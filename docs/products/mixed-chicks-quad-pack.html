            <li>The Deep conditioner is AMAZING when it comes to de-tangling in the shower, honestly it is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used and it makes combing knots out in the shower</li>
            <li>But the old version of humectress by nexxus, leave in conditioner was the best product ever for kinky hair</li>
            <li>It feels much better, more moisture and nice sheen.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>first let me start by saying that the quad pack is a great way to save on these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I wash my hair a lot and the conditioner keeps my hair nice and strong.</li>
            <li>Then I googled best hair products for mixed hair.</li>
            <li>I AM SO PLEASED WITH ALL OF THE PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li>THE LEAVE IN CONDITIONER HELPS CONTROL THE FRIZZ AND BRINGS MORE DEFINITION TO MY CURL.</li>
            <li>Perfect for trying out the entire line of products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!  </li>
            <li>and I love this stuff.  </li>

            <li>the shampoo and conditioner was ok.  </li>
            <li>PRAYING LUKE 6:38 ALL OVER THE CREATORS OF THIS PRODUCT! :)</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t help my hair look better or be more</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>She has had many comments and compliments.</li>
            <li>but i have dyed my hair many times</li>
            <li>my curls look and feel way better</li>
            <li>I have reordered my favorite part, the leave in conditioner, but will reorder the shampoo and everything else as well.</li>
            <li>Love these products :)</li>
            <li>The product hasn&#x27;t done anything better than any $5 bottle of shampoo or conditioner would do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found better products at 1/4 the price that work much better.</li>
            <li>Mixed chicks is perfect!</li>
            <li>and I can actually come out my hair with this awesome product.</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair and it just looks better when using these products.  </li>
            <li>The service was great and it came really fast.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me, and have more wavy curls, it will enhance those.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love my hair on this product.</li>
            <li>Love this Love this and Love this.</li>
            <li>The leave in conditioner is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with the deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Leaves hair bouncy and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>My products that I buy at cvs do a much better job at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Could be priced better.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and have tried so many products.  </li>
            <li>I love the leave in conditioner, it controls my hair and accents the curls.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the serum, it keeps my hair feeling supple and not all greasy looking</li>
            <li>I was really excited to use this product!</li>
            <li>I will say, the serum is awesome, but don&#x27;t use too much or your hair will look greasy and clumped up where you use to much of it.</li>
            <li>But, I have family members who are bi-racial with soft curly hair and this product works great for them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for natural hair</li>
            <li>This product has worked great (so far) for both my husband and me.  </li>
            <li>After first wash I felt that the product was most effective.</li>
            <li>It was easy to comb and style.  </li>
            <li>It came the following day &amp; totally happy with the service provided :)</li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t need anything extra than the leave in condition to get beautiful curls.</li>
            <li>My hair is not frizzy, is soft and my curls are so nice!  </li>
            <li>I get compliments daily on how beautiful my hair is.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend if you have fine hair...</li>
            <li>Conditioner is pretty good, but the deep conditioner I loved.</li>
            <li>Believe me, I am proud to be Black, but this stuff just makes your hair so nice and manageable.</li>
            <li>I cant speak for everyone but my sister has fine long beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>I felt a HUGE relief.</li>
            <li>for the quality of the product, I used shea moisture before, which I&#x27;m a huge fan of, and would oil my scalp with coconut oil.</li>
            <li>finally after 20 years I find this great product line for my curly hair.  </li>
            <li>The conditioners are excellent but the shampoo was to harsh for my hair.</li>
            <li>but I suppose that was because it wasn&#x27;t the sulfate free one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard great things about these products and since I&#x27;m a mixed chick</li>
            <li>But with mixed chicks once you put it in your hair you just automatically see the curls activate and feel much better!!</li>
            <li>The shampoo, leave-in conditioner, and deep conditioner were very effective.</li>
            <li>A gift for a special niece, arrived as promised and she loved it, very excited to try the different types of products offered in pack.</li>
            <li>Mixed chicks is simply amazing!</li>
            <li>Her curls are gorgeously defined, barely any frizz.  </li>
            <li>All I need is the leave in conditioner and my curls dry to a great finish and texture.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice anything special about these products</li>
            <li>, it leaves her hair nice and soft</li>
            <li>her curls really do look and feels healthy.</li>
            <li>And not a bad value.</li>
            <li>But when I tried the mixed chicks product definitely the best.  </li>
            <li>I have super curly curly hair, like straightened out</li>
            <li>She has very course, curly hair that breaks easily.  </li>
            <li>It also makes my unruly baby hairs sit down very nicely.</li>
            <li>Gives hair a real silky smooth when dentangling.</li>
            <li>The leave-in conditioner didn&#x27;t leave a sticky texture to my hair, which was fabulous, but I really wish the leave-in conditioner came in the jar and the rinse-away conditioner in the squeeze bottle.</li>
            <li>Smells good but its a light fragrance..not heavy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own, that&#x27;s why I keep it short</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner were okay, and her hair felt soft after washing, but I had to use a ton of conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Any girl with mixed hair needs to own this product.</li>
            <li>so I use more than I would prefer but when this is about done I&#x27;ll get the Sulfate Free Shampoo, Deep Conditioner and Leave In Conditioner in the liter sizes.</li>
            <li>Maybe those who have naturally curly,not kinky hair, would find this product to work better for their hair.</li>
            <li>but we&#x27;ll worth it.</li>
            <li>I looked at a bunch of reviews comparing this to miss jessie&#x27;s pillow soft curls and let me tell you, this is way better.  </li>
            <li>good produt for the price, as always loved the leave in conditioner, not too crazy for the shampoo or deap conditioner, maybe because i have others as favorites that are more reasonable in cost, will probably just stick to ordering the Leave inn</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the brand has a sulfate-free version, but that would be a nice option :)</li>
            <li>This is a extremely great price because sold separately it would be a lot more expensive.</li>
            <li>I hope this review helps other people shopping healthy for their fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>it curls up right above chin length, I think this would work wonders on more relaxed curls.</li>
            <li>I do however, very much like the oil that makes the hair shiney.  </li>
            <li>Boy was I surprised after the very first use!  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what i wanted.  </li>
            <li>These products, used together, have given me more manageable hair again, it actually controls the frizz.  </li>
            <li>I decided to use it first to check for gentleness on the eyes -</li>
            <li>I really love the deep condition  and the serum  </li>
            <li>I just love mixed chicks hair products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never felt comfortable wearing my hair natural until after using this product.</li>
            <li>My hair felt frizzy instead of smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It is smoother and my waves are more defined I don&#x27;t have curly hair, nor am I mixed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many products and I thought this would be different.</li>
            <li>I imagine the product we were hoping for smells and works even better and would probably be more protective for all the flat ironing and curling a teen does.</li>
            <li>now the best part Very little on your palm goes a long way on your hair.</li>
            <li>First off I had thought this was promising.</li>
            <li>WORKS AMAZING WITH MY CURLS AND LETS THEM DRY NATURALLY WITHOUT ANY FRIZZ!</li>
            <li>Anyway, I bought Mixed Chicks for Kids for my granddaughter who is only 1/8 Korean and has pretty frizzy hair - nothing like my daughter&#x27;s pretty fine hair and mostly like her African American dad&#x27;s although her hair is straight around the edges of her head, but more frizzy on the top and back.</li>
            <li>Hi have super naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>Mixed chicks does it and my hair is so curly it could easily turn into dreadlocks</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft</li>
            <li>Really, it smelled pretty good, hair didn&#x27;t feel oily or thick with stickiness.</li>
            <li>in all all the products are  pretty decent</li>
            <li>The deep conditioner felt great when I applied it but the leave-in made it feel heavy again.</li>
            <li>Her father has very course curly hair.</li>
            <li>how much?</li>
            <li>I REALLY DID NOT LIKE THIS</li>
            <li>product came on time thanks.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo is gentle clairifier.  </li>
            <li>Curls remain and much of the frizz leaves.</li>
            <li>The shampoo was gentle but thorough.</li>
            <li>and I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li>Made my hair feel very silky afterwards, but not greasy.</li>
            <li>I find that this product &amp;#34;cleans&amp;#34; my hair very well.</li>
            <li>I gave the product to my sister who has really curly hair</li>
            <li>This changes the very texture of your hair, almost like a jerri curl but without the jerri curl juice drip or the greasiness.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Its priced very well.</li>
            <li>I believe this product is very over priced.</li>
            <li>The products recommend that you use when hair is wet, and I recommend this for more defined curls.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this.  </li>
            <li>If anybody complains of these four components together, they&#x27;re probably not using it correctly, or using too much of all four.</li>
            <li>Mixed hair needs product to help keep soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>Mixed chicks helped my hair be manageable, healthy, shiny and soft again.</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling soft and looking healthy.</li>
            <li>In my first use, I tried the full set of shampoo, deep conditioner, leave-in conditioner and finishing serum to go from a wash to straightening.  </li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve tried the full like of the mixed chicks curl products, I really appreciate the quality of the product and the value for the price.</li>
            <li>I am transitioning from perm to natural (thank goodness) and only have a couple more inches to go before I am fully natural.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use a lot which is nice by the bottle being rather small.</li>
            <li>The best part is how soft and lively my hair feels - not dry and breakable, or gross because of the oily products i usually have to use to keep it hydrated.</li>
            <li>I love Mixed Chicks Products because I am a Mixed Chick</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny and it lasts pretty long!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo and conditioner for curly hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend watching the &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Also highly recommended product for curly hair no matter what your ethnicity is.</li>
            <li>When my hair was wet it felt fine.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hard to rate this product on its own because I&#x27;ve never used it alone in my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>When a straight guy gives a 51 year old, silver haired woman and compliment...</li>
            <li>so this product works out very well for my natural hair....</li>
            <li>They leave my hair soft and it curls very well when drying.</li>
            <li>Love to support small companies who really care about what they do.</li>
            <li>This product is comparable to BioSilk, my normal hair product.  </li>
            <li>I notice how different my hair looks when I use all 3 products (I rarely use the serum).  </li>
            <li>They can hardly believe I only have to wash and condition with no extras to have such beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>he said, are you using something new on your hair?</li>
            <li>First, I should mention that I am not a \\&quot;mixed chick\\&quot;; I&#x27;m just a frizzy-haired \\&quot;white chick\\&quot; who has spent way too much time and money trying to achieve smooth, straight, \\&quot;Marcia Brady\\&quot; hair.</li>
            <li>When she was born she had thin straight hair just like my own.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty curly; turning silver (a whole new type of hair) and can be on the dry side.</li>
            <li>THIS IS MY FIRST TIME USING MIXED CHICKS.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product it wasn&#x27;t what I expected at all!</li>
            <li>Amazing product for very curly hair, my daughter is mixed and her hair is thick, the conditioner gets tangles out within minutes.</li>
            <li>The hair silk was a bit light for her hair, but I like to use it for my straight/ slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is mostly gray now and has a different texture than when it was black.  </li>
            <li>Now I always wash my hands with soap right after and then dry.</li>
            <li>All seemed good, but after her hair dried it was a mess.  </li>
            <li>The conditioners were terrific; they absorbed well without visible residue and left her hair very soft and nourished.  </li>
            <li>My 18 year old, bi-racial daughter uses these products exclusively after trying many other hair products for her spiral curled, long hair.  </li>
            <li>Mixed Chicks enhances your natural curl- if you have tight curls it will refine them and give you the most of your volume.</li>
            <li>Mixed chicks are a product that I was very thankful to find.</li>
            <li>I bought the kids samples and the adult samples.</li>
            <li>It is so soft to the touch, no crunch, and</li>
            <li>When I finally made the decision to stop fighting the hair that nature had given me, I ended up spending way too much time and money trying to achieve curls that weren&#x27;t tangled, greasy, sticky or crunchy...</li>
            <li>old</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>This stuff makes your hair feel and look like the jerri curls of old without the jerri curl juice or drips.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for creating such products.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my daughter who has naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>So far nothing.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner leaves my hair soft, supple, with a lustrous shine.</li>
            <li>leave in conditioner is OK but not spectacular</li>
            <li>The leave in conditioner keep my curls soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to go to old products are cheaper products</li>
            <li>It defines my curls, controls frizz, and leaves it feeling soft but not oily.</li>
            <li>It def stripped the natural oils from hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product because I am trying to go natural and was trying to find a product that would hold a 2 strand twist style while moisturizing my hair.</li>
            <li>so I have to completely rewash and do it again.</li>
            <li>I had to switch to the adult line.</li>
            <li>I am natural</li>
            <li>For a bit of background, I have natural hair that can be styled as curly with a bit of mouse or straightened with a blow dryer and curling iron.  </li>
            <li>And after using it regularly for a few month, it just kept getting better.  </li>
            <li>Have recommended it to many friends that have to deal with thick and curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo I have been looking for the right shampoo for my Daughter&#x27;s and little sister&#x27;s hair type for a while now</li>
            <li>I would and have recommended this to anyone with curly hair that is tired of weighing it down with products to maintain a beautiful curl.</li>
            <li>First I want to say that I am white with a mixed daughter.</li>
            <li>Although I am glad that I bought the quad pack, next time I might just buy the leave in conditioner, as the other products tend to dry out my hair a bit.</li>
            <li>I did use the silk ( very small amount) one time on dry hair and liked it.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo was super drying, in fact I now use it once a month or so as a clarifying shampoo, just so I don&#x27;t feel like I wasted my money.  </li>
            <li>I generally go 4 - 7 days between washing and never see dandruff.</li>
            <li>THE DEEP CONDITIONER LEAVES MY HAIR SOFT AND MANAGEABLE.</li>
            <li>the leave-in didnot help me a lot with my frizzy 3c natural mixed hair.</li>
            <li>For the price I expected something great that would hold moisture And add softness and definition for a few days at least.</li>
            <li>I wear my hair blonde and natural, and these products work so well in my hair.</li>
            <li>I barely had to use a comb to unknot my hair.</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to use the shampoo and doesn&#x27;t see a real difference between it and basic shampoos, but she adores the regular conditioner and leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I ran out of my mixed chicks and saw the pillow soft curls on sale and bought it</li>
            <li>I have broken many combs along the way</li>
            <li>I have searched a long time for something that could tame my curls and reduce the frizzy-ness, and this has worked pretty well!!</li>
            <li>I am a white woman who has always had to deal with thick curly hair and have tried many expensive product that worked ok.  </li>
            <li>tried going without for a few months, but her hair started looking dull and didn&#x27;t have that nice feel.</li>
            <li>and I know most people use a combination of other products with this, but for the price I would rather use a lot of less expensive product and get the same or better results.  </li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t quite believe, after all this time, that I have finally found a product line that can turn my frizzy \\&quot;type 2b\\&quot; hair into a mass of soft, shiny, touchable ringlets -- \\&quot;Mixed</li>
            <li>Leaves my Jamaican - Irish - French C curl hair softly curled and supple.</li>
            <li>First off I am black not mixed so my hair is not curly those who are mixed.</li>
            <li>I usually wipe my hands right after using the product to get off the excess.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy; nor does it makes my hair dry or oily.</li>
            <li>I ordered the set and realized I didn&#x27;t need the leave in conditioner or the hair silk because I don&#x27;t let my hair dry naturally.  </li>
            <li>She is very active &amp; very prone to frizz.</li>
            <li>My real secret though is using the leave-in conditioner with a little bit of the Blended Beauty&#x27;s \\&quot;Happy Nappy\\&quot;.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have reordered my favorite part, the leave in conditioner, but will reorder the shampoo and everything else as well.</li>
            <li> Love these products :)</li>
            <li> The product hasn&#x27;t done anything better than any $5 bottle of shampoo or conditioner would do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found better products at 1/4 the price that work much better.</li>
            <li> Mixed chicks is perfect!</li>
            <li> and I can actually come out my hair with this awesome product.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair and it just looks better when using these products.  </li>
            <li> The service was great and it came really fast.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, and have more wavy curls, it will enhance those.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my hair on this product.</li>
            <li> Love this Love this and Love this.</li>
            <li> The leave in conditioner is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Very happy with the deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Leaves hair bouncy and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> My products that I buy at cvs do a much better job at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Could be priced better.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and have tried so many products.  </li>
            <li> I love the leave in conditioner, it controls my hair and accents the curls.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the serum, it keeps my hair feeling supple and not all greasy looking</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this product!</li>
            <li> I will say, the serum is awesome, but don&#x27;t use too much or your hair will look greasy and clumped up where you use to much of it.</li>
            <li> But, I have family members who are bi-racial with soft curly hair and this product works great for them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for natural hair</li>
            <li> This product has worked great (so far) for both my husband and me.  </li>
            <li> After first wash I felt that the product was most effective.</li>
            <li> It was easy to comb and style.  </li>
            <li> It came the following day &amp; totally happy with the service provided :)</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t need anything extra than the leave in condition to get beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> My hair is not frizzy, is soft and my curls are so nice!  </li>
            <li> I get compliments daily on how beautiful my hair is.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend if you have fine hair...</li>
            <li> Conditioner is pretty good, but the deep conditioner I loved.</li>
            <li> Believe me, I am proud to be Black, but this stuff just makes your hair so nice and manageable.</li>
            <li> I cant speak for everyone but my sister has fine long beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> I felt a HUGE relief.</li>
            <li> for the quality of the product, I used shea moisture before, which I&#x27;m a huge fan of, and would oil my scalp with coconut oil.</li>
            <li> finally after 20 years I find this great product line for my curly hair.  </li>
            <li> The conditioners are excellent but the shampoo was to harsh for my hair.</li>
            <li> but I suppose that was because it wasn&#x27;t the sulfate free one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things about these products and since I&#x27;m a mixed chick</li>
            <li> But with mixed chicks once you put it in your hair you just automatically see the curls activate and feel much better!!</li>
            <li> The shampoo, leave-in conditioner, and deep conditioner were very effective.</li>
            <li> A gift for a special niece, arrived as promised and she loved it, very excited to try the different types of products offered in pack.</li>
            <li> Mixed chicks is simply amazing!</li>
            <li> Her curls are gorgeously defined, barely any frizz.  </li>
            <li> All I need is the leave in conditioner and my curls dry to a great finish and texture.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice anything special about these products</li>
            <li> , it leaves her hair nice and soft</li>
            <li> her curls really do look and feels healthy.</li>
            <li> And not a bad value.</li>
            <li> But when I tried the mixed chicks product definitely the best.  </li>
            <li> I have super curly curly hair, like straightened out</li>
            <li> She has very course, curly hair that breaks easily.  </li>
            <li> It also makes my unruly baby hairs sit down very nicely.</li>
            <li> Gives hair a real silky smooth when dentangling.</li>
            <li> The leave-in conditioner didn&#x27;t leave a sticky texture to my hair, which was fabulous, but I really wish the leave-in conditioner came in the jar and the rinse-away conditioner in the squeeze bottle.</li>
            <li> Smells good but its a light fragrance..not heavy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own, that&#x27;s why I keep it short</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner were okay, and her hair felt soft after washing, but I had to use a ton of conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Any girl with mixed hair needs to own this product.</li>
            <li> so I use more than I would prefer but when this is about done I&#x27;ll get the Sulfate Free Shampoo, Deep Conditioner and Leave In Conditioner in the liter sizes.</li>
            <li> Maybe those who have naturally curly,not kinky hair, would find this product to work better for their hair.</li>
            <li> but we&#x27;ll worth it.</li>
            <li> I looked at a bunch of reviews comparing this to miss jessie&#x27;s pillow soft curls and let me tell you, this is way better.  </li>
            <li> good produt for the price, as always loved the leave in conditioner, not too crazy for the shampoo or deap conditioner, maybe because i have others as favorites that are more reasonable in cost, will probably just stick to ordering the Leave inn</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the brand has a sulfate-free version, but that would be a nice option :)</li>
            <li> This is a extremely great price because sold separately it would be a lot more expensive.</li>
            <li> I hope this review helps other people shopping healthy for their fine curly hair.</li>
            <li> it curls up right above chin length, I think this would work wonders on more relaxed curls.</li>
            <li> I do however, very much like the oil that makes the hair shiney.  </li>
            <li> Boy was I surprised after the very first use!  </li>
            <li> It is exactly what i wanted.  </li>
            <li> These products, used together, have given me more manageable hair again, it actually controls the frizz.  </li>
            <li> I decided to use it first to check for gentleness on the eyes -</li>
            <li> I really love the deep condition  and the serum  </li>
            <li> I just love mixed chicks hair products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt comfortable wearing my hair natural until after using this product.</li>
            <li> My hair felt frizzy instead of smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It is smoother and my waves are more defined I don&#x27;t have curly hair, nor am I mixed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many products and I thought this would be different.</li>
            <li> I imagine the product we were hoping for smells and works even better and would probably be more protective for all the flat ironing and curling a teen does.</li>
            <li> now the best part Very little on your palm goes a long way on your hair.</li>
            <li> First off I had thought this was promising.</li>
            <li> WORKS AMAZING WITH MY CURLS AND LETS THEM DRY NATURALLY WITHOUT ANY FRIZZ!</li>
            <li> Anyway, I bought Mixed Chicks for Kids for my granddaughter who is only 1/8 Korean and has pretty frizzy hair - nothing like my daughter&#x27;s pretty fine hair and mostly like her African American dad&#x27;s although her hair is straight around the edges of her head, but more frizzy on the top and back.</li>
            <li> Hi have super naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> Mixed chicks does it and my hair is so curly it could easily turn into dreadlocks</li>
            <li> My hair is super soft</li>
            <li> Really, it smelled pretty good, hair didn&#x27;t feel oily or thick with stickiness.</li>
            <li> in all all the products are  pretty decent</li>
            <li> The deep conditioner felt great when I applied it but the leave-in made it feel heavy again.</li>
            <li> Her father has very course curly hair.</li>
            <li> how much?</li>
            <li> I REALLY DID NOT LIKE THIS</li>
            <li> product came on time thanks.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo is gentle clairifier.  </li>
            <li> Curls remain and much of the frizz leaves.</li>
            <li> The shampoo was gentle but thorough.</li>
            <li> and I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel very silky afterwards, but not greasy.</li>
            <li> I find that this product &amp;#34;cleans&amp;#34; my hair very well.</li>
            <li> I gave the product to my sister who has really curly hair</li>
            <li> This changes the very texture of your hair, almost like a jerri curl but without the jerri curl juice drip or the greasiness.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Its priced very well.</li>
            <li> I believe this product is very over priced.</li>
            <li> The products recommend that you use when hair is wet, and I recommend this for more defined curls.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this.  </li>
            <li> If anybody complains of these four components together, they&#x27;re probably not using it correctly, or using too much of all four.</li>
            <li> Mixed hair needs product to help keep soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> Mixed chicks helped my hair be manageable, healthy, shiny and soft again.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling soft and looking healthy.</li>
            <li> In my first use, I tried the full set of shampoo, deep conditioner, leave-in conditioner and finishing serum to go from a wash to straightening.  </li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve tried the full like of the mixed chicks curl products, I really appreciate the quality of the product and the value for the price.</li>
            <li> I am transitioning from perm to natural (thank goodness) and only have a couple more inches to go before I am fully natural.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use a lot which is nice by the bottle being rather small.</li>
            <li> The best part is how soft and lively my hair feels - not dry and breakable, or gross because of the oily products i usually have to use to keep it hydrated.</li>
            <li> I love Mixed Chicks Products because I am a Mixed Chick</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny and it lasts pretty long!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shampoo and conditioner for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend watching the &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Also highly recommended product for curly hair no matter what your ethnicity is.</li>
            <li> When my hair was wet it felt fine.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to rate this product on its own because I&#x27;ve never used it alone in my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> When a straight guy gives a 51 year old, silver haired woman and compliment...</li>
            <li> so this product works out very well for my natural hair....</li>
            <li> They leave my hair soft and it curls very well when drying.</li>
            <li> Love to support small companies who really care about what they do.</li>
            <li> This product is comparable to BioSilk, my normal hair product.  </li>
            <li> I notice how different my hair looks when I use all 3 products (I rarely use the serum).  </li>
            <li> They can hardly believe I only have to wash and condition with no extras to have such beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> he said, are you using something new on your hair?</li>
            <li> First, I should mention that I am not a \\&quot;mixed chick\\&quot;; I&#x27;m just a frizzy-haired \\&quot;white chick\\&quot; who has spent way too much time and money trying to achieve smooth, straight, \\&quot;Marcia Brady\\&quot; hair.</li>
            <li> When she was born she had thin straight hair just like my own.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty curly; turning silver (a whole new type of hair) and can be on the dry side.</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY FIRST TIME USING MIXED CHICKS.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product it wasn&#x27;t what I expected at all!</li>
            <li> Amazing product for very curly hair, my daughter is mixed and her hair is thick, the conditioner gets tangles out within minutes.</li>
            <li> The hair silk was a bit light for her hair, but I like to use it for my straight/ slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is mostly gray now and has a different texture than when it was black.  </li>
            <li> Now I always wash my hands with soap right after and then dry.</li>
            <li> All seemed good, but after her hair dried it was a mess.  </li>
            <li> The conditioners were terrific; they absorbed well without visible residue and left her hair very soft and nourished.  </li>
            <li> My 18 year old, bi-racial daughter uses these products exclusively after trying many other hair products for her spiral curled, long hair.  </li>
            <li> Mixed Chicks enhances your natural curl- if you have tight curls it will refine them and give you the most of your volume.</li>
            <li> Mixed chicks are a product that I was very thankful to find.</li>
            <li> I bought the kids samples and the adult samples.</li>
            <li> It is so soft to the touch, no crunch, and</li>
            <li> When I finally made the decision to stop fighting the hair that nature had given me, I ended up spending way too much time and money trying to achieve curls that weren&#x27;t tangled, greasy, sticky or crunchy...</li>
            <li> old</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> This stuff makes your hair feel and look like the jerri curls of old without the jerri curl juice or drips.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for creating such products.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who has naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> So far nothing.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner leaves my hair soft, supple, with a lustrous shine.</li>
            <li> leave in conditioner is OK but not spectacular</li>
            <li> The leave in conditioner keep my curls soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to go to old products are cheaper products</li>
            <li> It defines my curls, controls frizz, and leaves it feeling soft but not oily.</li>
            <li> It def stripped the natural oils from hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I am trying to go natural and was trying to find a product that would hold a 2 strand twist style while moisturizing my hair.</li>
            <li> so I have to completely rewash and do it again.</li>
            <li> I had to switch to the adult line.</li>
            <li> I am natural</li>
            <li> For a bit of background, I have natural hair that can be styled as curly with a bit of mouse or straightened with a blow dryer and curling iron.  </li>
            <li> And after using it regularly for a few month, it just kept getting better.  </li>
            <li> Have recommended it to many friends that have to deal with thick and curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo I have been looking for the right shampoo for my Daughter&#x27;s and little sister&#x27;s hair type for a while now</li>
            <li> I would and have recommended this to anyone with curly hair that is tired of weighing it down with products to maintain a beautiful curl.</li>
            <li> First I want to say that I am white with a mixed daughter.</li>
            <li> Although I am glad that I bought the quad pack, next time I might just buy the leave in conditioner, as the other products tend to dry out my hair a bit.</li>
            <li> I did use the silk ( very small amount) one time on dry hair and liked it.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo was super drying, in fact I now use it once a month or so as a clarifying shampoo, just so I don&#x27;t feel like I wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> I generally go 4 - 7 days between washing and never see dandruff.</li>
            <li> THE DEEP CONDITIONER LEAVES MY HAIR SOFT AND MANAGEABLE.</li>
            <li> the leave-in didnot help me a lot with my frizzy 3c natural mixed hair.</li>
            <li> For the price I expected something great that would hold moisture And add softness and definition for a few days at least.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair blonde and natural, and these products work so well in my hair.</li>
            <li> I barely had to use a comb to unknot my hair.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to use the shampoo and doesn&#x27;t see a real difference between it and basic shampoos, but she adores the regular conditioner and leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I ran out of my mixed chicks and saw the pillow soft curls on sale and bought it</li>
            <li> I have broken many combs along the way</li>
            <li> I have searched a long time for something that could tame my curls and reduce the frizzy-ness, and this has worked pretty well!!</li>
            <li> I am a white woman who has always had to deal with thick curly hair and have tried many expensive product that worked ok.  </li>
            <li> tried going without for a few months, but her hair started looking dull and didn&#x27;t have that nice feel.</li>
            <li> and I know most people use a combination of other products with this, but for the price I would rather use a lot of less expensive product and get the same or better results.  </li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t quite believe, after all this time, that I have finally found a product line that can turn my frizzy \\&quot;type 2b\\&quot; hair into a mass of soft, shiny, touchable ringlets -- \\&quot;Mixed</li>
            <li> Leaves my Jamaican - Irish - French C curl hair softly curled and supple.</li>
            <li> First off I am black not mixed so my hair is not curly those who are mixed.</li>
            <li> I usually wipe my hands right after using the product to get off the excess.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy; nor does it makes my hair dry or oily.</li>
            <li> I ordered the set and realized I didn&#x27;t need the leave in conditioner or the hair silk because I don&#x27;t let my hair dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> She is very active &amp; very prone to frizz.</li>
            <li> My real secret though is using the leave-in conditioner with a little bit of the Blended Beauty&#x27;s \\&quot;Happy Nappy\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> She is mixed so her hair is very curly but thick and soft.  </li>
            <li> Every item that comes with this set works very well together and helps you create a simple routine to tame your curly hair.</li>
            <li> Due to her young age, (she&#x27;s just turned 9)</li>
            <li> I used all 3 steps - shampoo, deep conditionner and leave in, and did not get the look I expected on the first round.</li>
            <li> I love the silky feeling of my hair and I highly recommend this to anyone who has curly hair that insists on matting so badly you can&#x27;t even get a brush through it.</li>
            <li> it is to the middle of my back and washed and let air dry</li>
            <li> Especially for those of use who have dry coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half black, half German with fine, frizzy, long, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I die my hair strawberry blonde to blend all my grey.</li>
            <li> But I did it again a week later, and I&#x27;ve never seen my hair hold curls without the frizziness for so long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with very dry and curly hair.</li>
            <li> I wash, dry, and flat iron my hair daily.  </li>
            <li> I have mixed hair, that i&#x27;ve blown dried straight most of my life - because it was impossible to deal with my curls otherwise.</li>
            <li> It gave me a sample of every single products that I didn&#x27;t have to buy it individually and then not like it.</li>
            <li> It also last a while if you don&#x27;t wash hair every single day I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My hand towels have developed a discoloration, as if they had gotten a little bleach on them.  </li>
            <li> I just have to be careful how much I use; I don&#x27;t like a slick or oily look.  </li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve been looking for that miracle product for my daughters hair for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Buyer for as long as you make it.</li>
            <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve spent my money on a different product.</li>
            <li> I did a second round of shampoo and deep conditioner, but skipped the leave-in to avoid having extra stuff in my hair that could cause dandruff.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is any standard \\&quot;mixed chick\\&quot; hair, so I encourage others to try these products because you never know what works; however, these products dried out my hair and made me look like a head and shoulders commercial.  </li>
            <li> I use a few fingertips of CAROLS DAUGHTER Hair Pudding to control and define my curls of thin, easily stripped hair.</li>
            <li> I am Black, with Black hair, no mixed anything..just very kinky black hair.  </li>
            <li> and after both uses and hair was completely dry</li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> My scalp was also became dry and flaky from the shampoo.</li>
            <li> But the shampoo did leave my hair feeling dry</li>
            <li> Dry scalp</li>
            <li> I let it air dry</li>
            <li> I apply the leave in and by the time I get to work my hair is dry and fully curly and fluffy.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed I was really hoping this would work with my super dry frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I am all Black, not mixed at all</li>
            <li> My father is black and my mother is white.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my wet hair and on dry hair</li>
            <li> The only frustration I have is the $20 price hike in less than five months.</li>
            <li> it felt very dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> It looked very dry and did not hold its style.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-The shampoo made my hair very dry.</li>
            <li> Instructions seemed single enough but my hair felt heavy and gunky.</li>
            <li> I do apply a little extra on humid days.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 50&#x27;s, white with coarse hair and this works.</li>
            <li> It was always different but what remained was that hair should be washed once a week but needs to be conditioned everyday.</li>
            <li> They are both what I expected and resigned myself to their uses.  </li>
            <li> I did follow the directions - using water, wide tooth comb and product.</li>
            <li> However, since BioSilk has now changed it&#x27;s formula, I am going to stick to this product once my last few bottles are empty.  </li>
            <li> I apply when wet and let air dry, and it keeps down the frizz and puffiness.  </li>
            <li> My 5 year old has long, curly, difficult to manage hair and this stuff actually works on her.</li>
            <li> But I feel it dries out my hair to wet it everyday, and the product works well on dry hair and wet hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> never used the other bottle.  </li>
            <li> first time I used the product I was skeptical</li>
            <li> Before this non of the other products used to work for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> The next day hair is just not cute</li>
            <li> Just pricey for such a small amount</li>
            <li> After straightening, my hair lacked any luster and seemed a bit dry and dead looking.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t dry to a hard shell or dry out like other products do.</li>
            <li> IT LEFT MY HAIR HARD.  </li>
            <li> I am Hispanic/Arabic; my hair is dark and curly and will get frizzy in humid weather.</li>
            <li> I bought this set for $45 back in late September.</li>
            <li> Around 9 months old her hair started to curl and it was a waiting game..</li>
            <li> I have thin, soft defined curls.</li>
            <li> The leave in conditioner is HEAVEN SENT for my thick, wavy, coarse, frizzy, color treated hair!!!</li>
            <li> and it produces luscious, bouncy waves, without weighing my hair down too greasily or leaving me with crunchy ends.</li>
            <li> My hair is manageable and not weighed down, nor is it clumpy, gooey, or chunky.</li>
            <li> I am half black, half white and I have naturally thick curly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half black and half Korean.</li>
            <li> less thing to concern myself about and</li>
            <li> None of the products felt heavy on my hair or like it was weighing it down.</li>
            <li> If you want to try a new product for difficult hair - this is the a must.</li>
            <li> They are little CHILD sized pump bottles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, Its not worth the price!</li>
            <li> My hair is fairly long and thick thanks to my mom, but suffers from frizz and the ability to become an afro from my dad.  </li>
            <li> Especially if u have thick unruly curly hair!</li>
            <li> I thought there is NO product that can really tame Black hair.</li>
            <li> noticed immediately that my hair felt softer, but not that weird soft that Cream of Nature gives your hair - like you can&#x27;t wash it out-weird.</li>
            <li> wasted money</li>
            <li> This dried my hair out somewhat.  </li>
            <li> My sister thought it might be a bit heavy (who I got the recommendation from), but that has not been the case.  </li>
            <li> , we had no time to waste..</li>
            <li> I gave my hair 3 shampoos and then blow dried and the product is still in my hair.  </li>
            <li> These dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> and I noticed I looked a little less crazy than normal.</li>
            <li> After a 2 days I developed a terrible case of dandruff, which is very much out of character for my hair.  </li>
            <li> My niece loves this product - she has VERY tight curly hair and this is one of the few products that she&#x27;ll use.</li>
            <li> I used this product, but it dried out my hair so much, that it was tangled badly</li>
            <li> In the past I used 4 or 5 products to tame my curly hair; now I just need the leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I continued to style as usual</li>
            <li> /&gt;The serum/oily thing - actually I&#x27;m not sure what it is or what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had the same results.  </li>
            <li> For the price, I was pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> I heard about the brand Mixed Chicks a while ago, but hate to admit that I hadn&#x27;t tried it sooner because I assumed it was for African American mixed chicks :(</li>
            <li> After using if 2 times with real standout results I have say I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> It left my curls hard And Flaky!!!</li>
            <li> i hardly noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy or hard but still manages to keep things under control.  </li>
            <li> She looks forward to xmas and her birthdays when she can expect tor receive at least one pack.</li>
            <li> This was made for those people with thick, oily hair who wash their hair once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not greasy and thick.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and sort of frizzy and I need something that can tame it.  </li>
            <li> She has very tight coils, approximately the diameter of a thin pencil, and extremely thick.</li>
            <li> There are some comparable products from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply that are less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have really thick curly hair and this does wonders!</li>
            <li> The Johnson&#x27;s Baby Shampoo/conditioner seemed to be making the situation worse.</li>
            <li> It was not hair breakage (broken pieces in the sink)</li>
            <li> so you do not have to commit to the expensive product before knowing if it will work.</li>
            <li> I put the hair silk in, and was not impressed with it.</li>
            <li> Shampoo unfortunately for ME made my scalp itch</li>
            <li> I have weird curly hair and refuses to put any chemicals in it...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these products are not designed for my hair.  </li>
            <li> The dandruff came back, as well as terrible itching.  </li>
            <li> I tried carol&#x27;s daughter which i had heard rave reviews about, but that performed very poorly..</li>
            <li> I have  very thick curls, which can tangle really badly.  </li>
            <li> It was nasty to say the least.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about all these products.  </li>
            <li> her hair was coming out bad</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this product I have used it twice</li>
            <li> I will not be re-purchaing this again :-(</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the shampoo is not sulfate-free and I was thoroughly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Leave in conditioner is HORRIBLE!!</li>
            <li> My father is Louisiana Creole, and I have always had a terrible time finding products that work in my hair without making it too oily or drying out it out.</li>
            <li> It looks disgusting.  </li>

            <li> This is the best hair product for &amp;#34;mixed&amp;#34; hair.  It also smells great!</li>
            <li> My niece loves this product - she has VERY tight curly hair and this is one of the few products that she&#x27;ll use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with very dry and curly hair. This product didn&#x27;t provide the softness and moisture I was looking for. But, I have family members who are bi-racial with soft curly hair and this product works great for them.</li>
            <li> Mixed chicks are a product that I was very thankful to find. I have struggled with trying to find products that would help me manage and control my curls. I started using the leave in conditioner and noticed that one 10z bottle was about 20 dollars so when I found the quad pack I was amazed.  This quad pack included the shampoo, deep conditioner, leave in conditioner and the oil. This is a extremely great price because sold separately it would be a lot more expensive. I am able to have amazing curls day after day because of this product I would recommend anyone looking for the best curly hair product in the market.</li>
            <li> 5 out of 5 stars. First I want to say that I am white with a mixed daughter. When she was born she had thin straight hair just like my own. Her father has very course curly hair. Around 9 months old her hair started to curl and it was a waiting game.. would the texture change, how much? how curly... etc. At this point I started to do research. I asked several people who were mixed with curly hair what they did. It was always different but what remained was that hair should be washed once a week but needs to be conditioned everyday. This was a great place to start but as the curls got longer.. i tried product after product to make the curls keep from frizzing by the end of the day. I literally would be putting 4 or 5 products in my daughter&#x27;s hair. I tried carol&#x27;s daughter which i had heard rave reviews about, but that performed very poorly.. i hardly noticed a difference. Then I googled best hair products for mixed hair. This came up. I went to mixedchicks.net and realized that they actually sell sample sizes so you do not have to commit to the expensive product before knowing if it will work. I bought several so I can see how the product worked after several uses. I bought the kids samples and the adult samples. The adult worked best but the kids products were still very good. Because of the pricing Amazon.com is the best place to purchase the mixedchicks products but everywhere I got I am complimented about my child&#x27;s beautiful curls. Moms will stop me to ask what I do to her hair. They can hardly believe I only have to wash and condition with no extras to have such beautiful hair. It is so soft to the touch, no crunch, and the smell is very appealing. I would and have recommended this to anyone with curly hair that is tired of weighing it down with products to maintain a beautiful curl.</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY FIRST TIME USING MIXED CHICKS. I AM SO PLEASED WITH ALL OF THE PRODUCTS. THE DEEP CONDITIONER LEAVES MY HAIR SOFT AND MANAGEABLE. THE LEAVE IN CONDITIONER HELPS CONTROL THE FRIZZ AND BRINGS MORE DEFINITION TO MY CURL.</li>
            <li> Awesome product work wonders</li>
            <li> Best hair product ever! Still using and it&#x27;s wonderful ! Especially if u have thick unruly curly hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a year now.  I ordered the quad pack.  Came in a timely manner all products were counted for.  I love the product works great on my hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect for trying out the entire line of products.</li>
            <li> First, I should mention that I am not a \\&quot;mixed chick\\&quot;; I&#x27;m just a frizzy-haired \\&quot;white chick\\&quot; who has spent way too much time and money trying to achieve smooth, straight, \\&quot;Marcia Brady\\&quot; hair. When I finally made the decision to stop fighting the hair that nature had given me, I ended up spending way too much time and money trying to achieve curls that weren&#x27;t tangled, greasy, sticky or crunchy... I still can&#x27;t quite believe, after all this time, that I have finally found a product line that can turn my frizzy \\&quot;type 2b\\&quot; hair into a mass of soft, shiny, touchable ringlets -- \\&quot;Mixed Chicks\\&quot; is amazing!</li>
            <li> In the past I used 4 or 5 products to tame my curly hair; now I just need the leave-in conditioner.  I apply when wet and let air dry, and it keeps down the frizz and puffiness.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy or hard but still manages to keep things under control.  I do apply a little extra on humid days.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 11 yrs. old and she is a model and actress.She is mixed so her hair is very curly but thick and soft.  We could not find anything that works until we heard about Mixed Chicks.  It&#x27;s fantastic!  Her curls stay seperated and no frizz.  I have naturally curly hair and I am white.  I tried the product and worked great for me as well. We love it!</li>
            <li> Someone at work told me about the Mixed Chicks products.  I am all Black, not mixed at all and I love this stuff.  I am transitioning from perm to natural (thank goodness) and only have a couple more inches to go before I am fully natural.  This stuff makes your hair feel and look like the jerri curls of old without the jerri curl juice or drips.  Love these products.  You can keep the silk thearpy stuff though.  I love, love, love the leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I REALLY DID NOT LIKE THIS IT LEFT MY HAIR HARD.  I WILL NOT BUY IT AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I guess it did what it promised to do..might be my hair. My hair did get curly but once it dries, it doesn&#x27;t look the same. It dries flaky leaving flakes throughout hair</li>
            <li> product came on time thanks.  It is exactly what i wanted.  I am very satisfied with the results. again good job</li>
            <li> I really do love these products.  I had been searching for something to help me with my hair.  I am over 65.  My hair is mostly gray now and has a different texture than when it was black.  Now, the darker hair is still manageable but the gray is often unruly. These products, used together, have given me more manageable hair again, it actually controls the frizz.  Thanks for creating such products.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed I was really hoping this would work with my super dry frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that does what it says its going to do.  My hairstylist recommended this product for my curly hair.  All I need is the leave in conditioner and my curls dry to a great finish and texture.  My gel and mouse days are over because all I need it the leave in.  The shampoo is gentle clairifier.  The deep conditioner really deep conditions my hair.  The oil is light weight and smells great.  I recommend for anyone with curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half black and half Korean. My hair is pretty curly; turning silver (a whole new type of hair) and can be on the dry side. I use a relaxer to get out the frizz - comb-in and rinse out after 5 minutes. Curls remain and much of the frizz leaves. Anyway, I bought Mixed Chicks for Kids for my granddaughter who is only 1/8 Korean and has pretty frizzy hair - nothing like my daughter&#x27;s pretty fine hair and mostly like her African American dad&#x27;s although her hair is straight around the edges of her head, but more frizzy on the top and back. The Johnson&#x27;s Baby Shampoo/conditioner seemed to be making the situation worse. I did some research and bought Mixed Chicks. I decided to use it first to check for gentleness on the eyes - I let the shampoo and conditioner run in my face and there was no burning to the eyes at all.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed immediately that my hair felt softer, but not that weird soft that Cream of Nature gives your hair - like you can&#x27;t wash it out-weird. I continued to style as usual and I noticed I looked a little less crazy than normal. My hair has a mind of it&#x27;s own, that&#x27;s why I keep it short and NEVER comb it during the day. As soon as my co-worker saw me (also a mixed-chico) he said, are you using something new on your hair? It looks great!! I&#x27;m sold. When a straight guy gives a 51 year old, silver haired woman and compliment...&#x27;nough said. I&#x27;m going to use it on my grandbaby&#x27;s hair tonight.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who has naturally curly hair.  She was unimpressed.  I have used only the Hair Serum which I actually like a lot.</li>
            <li> I am a white woman who has always had to deal with thick curly hair and have tried many expensive product that worked ok.  But when I tried the mixed chicks product definitely the best.  And after using it regularly for a few month, it just kept getting better.  Have recommended it to many friends that have to deal with thick and curly hair.  Love to support small companies who really care about what they do.</li>
            <li> Mixed hair needs product to help keep soft and healthy. This does well. Have to shop for best pricing, but that is not going to find you bargains on this brand.</li>
            <li> I had bought it once before.  I loved it.  I will keep using until something else comes on the market that is better than this product.  So far nothing.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shampoo and conditioner for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Good conditioner. But hair still frizzy</li>
            <li> Purchased for my future stepdaughter&#x27;s hair. Her heritage is African American &amp; Italian/European. She has very tight coils, approximately the diameter of a thin pencil, and extremely thick. Due to her young age, (she&#x27;s just turned 9) she has difficulty managing her hair. She is very active &amp; very prone to frizz. The shampoo, leave-in conditioner, and deep conditioner were very effective. The shampoo was gentle but thorough. The conditioners were terrific; they absorbed well without visible residue and left her hair very soft and nourished.  Nice fragrance. The hair silk was a bit light for her hair, but I like to use it for my straight/ slightly wavy hair. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this product I have used it twice and after both uses and hair was completely dry it felt very dry and brittle. I will not be re-purchaing this again :-( and I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> I have really thick curly hair and this does wonders! I would definitely suggest using this product! It is worth every penny and it lasts pretty long! Love it</li>
            <li> Gives hair a real silky smooth when dentangling. Would recommend to any person with curly hair!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. The conditioner leaves my hair soft, supple, with a lustrous shine. This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used that actually works.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve been looking for that miracle product for my daughters hair for a long time.  This was not it.  My daughter is biracial ( african-american and caucasian).  She has very course, curly hair that breaks easily.  The shampoo and conditioner were okay, and her hair felt soft after washing, but I had to use a ton of conditioner.  At first when I put the leave in conditioner in her hair, it felt wonderful.  It was easy to comb and style.  I put the hair silk in, and was not impressed with it. It seemed like any shine serum on the market.  All seemed good, but after her hair dried it was a mess.  It looked very dry and did not hold its style.  I have read a lot about these products and I know most people use a combination of other products with this, but for the price I would rather use a lot of less expensive product and get the same or better results.  There are some comparable products from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply that are less expensive.  I will not purchase this again.  I realize the miracle product probably does not exist.</li>
            <li> I have polynesian hair that is curly BUT frizzy…this product defines my curls and keeps the frizz away without weight or greasiness…even in humidity...tried many products but this is the best yet</li>
            <li> I really am enjoying this product. I&#x27;ve been looking for a product like this and I am glad I found it!!!</li>
            <li> I love the product. I will order it again. This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s great for natural hair</li>
            <li> I like these products, except didn&#x27;t like the hair silk- makes your hair feel greasy. Conditioner is pretty good, but the deep conditioner I loved. Made my hair feel very silky afterwards, but not greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this product. (I have curly hair). I find that this product &amp;#34;cleans&amp;#34; my hair very well. Also, I don&#x27;t need anything extra than the leave in condition to get beautiful curls. My son tried it and I never my bottles again. I had to purchase another set for my self. The best product for my hair.</li>
            <li> A gift for a special niece, arrived as promised and she loved it, very excited to try the different types of products offered in pack.Thank you</li>
            <li> The Deep conditioner is AMAZING when it comes to de-tangling in the shower, honestly it is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used and it makes combing knots out in the shower a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shampoo unfortunately for ME made my scalp itch and I suspect it is because it contains avocado oil (I get the same reaction if I use Garnier products that contain it as well) if it didn&#x27;t contain it I would love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the leave in conditioner is OK but not spectacular it can be a bit sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to use the hair silk serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all all the products are  pretty decent I have super curly curly hair, like straightened out it is to the middle of my back and washed and let air dry it curls up right above chin length, I think this would work wonders on more relaxed curls.</li>
            <li> Hi have super naturally curly hair and I love all of these products!, especially the leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have weird curly hair and refuses to put any chemicals in it...so this product works out very well for my natural hair....basically it is wash, condition and go!!! my type of product since I lack patience.</li>
            <li> the shampoo and conditioner was ok.  I didn&#x27;t notice a difference with my curls unless I layered on loads of the leave in.  never used the other bottle.  I think it was a serum.  wasted money</li>
            <li> This product did not work well for me,  I do however, very much like the oil that makes the hair shiney.  I gave the product to my sister who has really curly hair and it works wonderfully for her hair.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> My father is black and my mother is white. I have thin, soft defined curls. The leave in conditioner keep my curls soft and hydrated. The curl gel doesn&#x27;t leave a residue while adding shine and smoothness to each curl.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the product I was skeptical but I kept it up for about a week, learned  how to use it the best amount for my hair, and end up really loving this product. I&#x27;ve tried to go to old products are cheaper products and I&#x27;m always disappointed.</li>
            <li> This dried my hair out somewhat.  I have  very thick curls, which can tangle really badly.  I used this product, but it dried out my hair so much, that it was tangled badly and I had to clip it in some places.</li>
            <li> Great price for package of products!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something to manage these frizzy biracial unknowns for years and have done the keratin treatment, relaxers, tried &amp;#34;following what my hair was doing,&amp;#34; mouses, gels, Caucasian approaches, African American approaches, Dominican, you name it, I have tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to wait to write this review until I had time to try it for awhile. After about 2 months now, I am still happy with this product! I wash my hair about 2-3 times a week and have tons of everything left except for deep conditioner! I went to the mixed chicks website and found a youtube video on how to apply it properly, found a way that worked for me after about 2 weeks and I am so happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One less thing to concern myself about and now I know how to care for my biracial husband and our biracial son&#x27;s hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and this was the cheapest place that I have found in buying this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT A BLESSING! PRAYING LUKE 6:38 ALL OVER THE CREATORS OF THIS PRODUCT! :)</li>
            <li> This works great on my hair...finally after 20 years I find this great product line for my curly hair.  Love, love, love!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Especially for those of use who have dry coarse hair.  The smell is great and not overpowering.  A must buy.</li>
            <li> I really love the deep condition  and the serum  but the leave-in and the shampoo are okey. the leave-in didnot help me a lot with my frizzy 3c natural mixed hair.</li>
            <li> All of mixed chicks products do not work well in my hair. I don&#x27;t know where they get the people who are on the advertisements with the perfect, smooth waves but my hair never looks like that. I guess it is their hair texture regardless of the products that will give them those results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum/oily thing - actually I&#x27;m not sure what it is or what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I tried it on my wet hair and on dry hair and it just felt as if I was putting baby oil in my hair. it didn&#x27;t help my hair look better or be more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the shampoo is not sulfate-free and I was thoroughly disappointed. only the conditioner and leave-in are usable to me.</li>
            <li> This product is comparable to BioSilk, my normal hair product.  However, since BioSilk has now changed it&#x27;s formula, I am going to stick to this product once my last few bottles are empty.  I might suggest using the sulfate-free version of their shampoo, though.  The leave-in conditioner didn&#x27;t leave a sticky texture to my hair, which was fabulous, but I really wish the leave-in conditioner came in the jar and the rinse-away conditioner in the squeeze bottle.</li>
            <li> This product has worked great (so far) for both my husband and me.  My sister thought it might be a bit heavy (who I got the recommendation from), but that has not been the case.  My hair is not frizzy, is soft and my curls are so nice!  Would definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> First off I had thought this was promising. Made for curly hair, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the shampoo, conditioning treatment then the leave-in conditioner. When my hair was wet it felt fine. Really, it smelled pretty good, hair didn&#x27;t feel oily or thick with stickiness. I let my hair air dry. Oh my! I was embarrassed to be out of the house! This was made for those people with thick, oily hair who wash their hair once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to stick with CAROLS DAUGHTER Products. I especially LOVE the scent of the monoi line and how my hair looks and feels. I use a few fingertips of CAROLS DAUGHTER Hair Pudding to control and define my curls of thin, easily stripped hair. I hope this review helps other people shopping healthy for their fine curly hair.</li>
            <li> Everything I need for my hair is all right there in the box!!! I love Mixed Chicks Products because I am a Mixed Chick and I need something for my kind of hair...</li>
            <li> Great shipping, good seller. I just love mixed chicks hair products. I use it on myself and my children. Not only does it soften your hair, the smell is indescribable lol. I love love love the smell!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this mixed chicks quad pack, but received the children&#x27;s quad pack of shampoo, conditioner, leave in conditioner and detangle spray. They are little CHILD sized pump bottles. Not enough product for the$$. My daughters hair was in dire need for repair so we just decided to use it anyway, we had no time to waste.. The products work but the smell isn&#x27;t so great. I imagine the product we were hoping for smells and works even better and would probably be more protective for all the flat ironing and curling a teen does.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve never felt comfortable wearing my hair natural until after using this product. It defines my curls, controls frizz, and leaves it feeling soft but not oily. Any girl with mixed hair needs to own this product.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my mom for xmas on year and she&#x27;s been hooked ever since.  She looks forward to xmas and her birthdays when she can expect tor receive at least one pack.</li>
            <li> I have searched a long time for something that could tame my curls and reduce the frizzy-ness, and this has worked pretty well!! I honestly didnt think it would work but it has definitely exceeded my expectations. I wish it weren&#x27;t so pricy though because I have A LOT of hair and I am almost out of all the Shampoo and Leave-in Conditioner</li>
            <li> Mixed chicks helped my hair be manageable, healthy, shiny and soft again. I will buy it again and would recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> The conditioners are excellent but the shampoo was to harsh for my hair.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this product! For once, something for mixed chicks! I am half black, half white and I have naturally thick curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The shampoo made my hair very dry. My scalp was also became dry and flaky from the shampoo. It def stripped the natural oils from hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The conditioner is great though! Light and smells wonderful! No complaints there! lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The serum is awesome too! Not greasy and thick. You dont need a lot to achieve the look you want. About 2 pumps will do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The Leave in conditioner is HORRIBLE!! It left my curls hard And Flaky!!! It was nasty to say the least. I do like this conditioner not one bit! YUCKY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Its not worth the price! Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have 3c/4a combo curly hair. The shampoo is not sulfate-free and it felt like there was a lot of buildup on my hair. I didn&#x27;t get a chance to try their sulfate-free shampoo. Instructions seemed single enough but my hair felt heavy and gunky. The deep conditioner felt great when I applied it but the leave-in made it feel heavy again.</li>
            <li> This product does not do what it says it will do. I find it to be too watery and not have enough of the actual product. I would never buy this again.</li>
            <li> Some of the best products around, I have very frizzy thick curly hair, And the shampoo conditioner is awesome, I also like the leave in which makes my curls look great!! I get a lot of compliments when i have used this stuff.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about all these products.  I thought there is NO product that can really tame Black hair. (or African American if you prefer).  I am Black, with Black hair, no mixed anything..just very kinky black hair.  I am transitioning off a perm (thank goodness) and only have a few straight ends left.  I tried Carol&#x27;s Daughter and Blended Beauty products.  They are both what I expected and resigned myself to their uses.  But a friend at work told me about Mixed Chicks.  I thought, yeah another product to buy with similar results.  Boy was I surprised after the very first use!  This changes the very texture of your hair, almost like a jerri curl but without the jerri curl juice drip or the greasiness. You can keep the silk serum though...does not add anything to the mix.  The real star of this quartet is the leave-in conditioner, it is priceless.  My real secret though is using the leave-in conditioner with a little bit of the Blended Beauty&#x27;s \\&quot;Happy Nappy\\&quot;.  They give me shiny, glossy, curly hair that makes people wonder if I am Indian.  Believe me, I am proud to be Black, but this stuff just makes your hair so nice and manageable.</li>
            <li> I had a sew-in in my hair for about two months and washing my hair afterwards I felt a HUGE relief. But the shampoo did leave my hair feeling dry but I suppose that was because it wasn&#x27;t the sulfate free one. But I used the deep conditioner and left that in my hair for an hour before rinising it out. And with the leave-in conditioner I applied that when I was doing my braid out. It left my hair feeling soft and looking healthy. None of the products felt heavy on my hair or like it was weighing it down. And the serum add additional gloss finish when I took my braids out. I gave it a four because of the size. I have really thick hair so I use more than I would prefer but when this is about done I&#x27;ll get the Sulfate Free Shampoo, Deep Conditioner and Leave In Conditioner in the liter sizes. I really like this product.</li>
            <li> 2nd order. Leaves my Jamaican - Irish - French C curl hair softly curled and supple. Love it. I die my hair strawberry blonde to blend all my grey. Nourishes it well.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo I have been looking for the right shampoo for my Daughter&#x27;s and little sister&#x27;s hair type for a while now and I think I found it, it leaves her hair nice and soft no frizz or dryness her curls really do look and feels healthy. She has had many comments and compliments. now the best part Very little on your palm goes a long way on your hair. This is almost a concentrated texture shampoo, it rinses out all impurities in her hair. it&#x27;s hard to rate this product on its own because I&#x27;ve never used it alone in my daughter&#x27;s hair. I&#x27;ve always used the Mixed Chicks Deep Conditioner with it. I would recommend always using the Deep. Conditioner when using this product because the shampoo cleans so thouroughly that you will need to condition it afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;  Cleans Thoroughly without drying her hair out&lt;br /&gt;  Great Smell&lt;br /&gt;  Lathers Well&lt;br /&gt;  Adds Shine&lt;br /&gt;  Adds Volume&lt;br /&gt;  Gentle&lt;br /&gt;  Improves Hair Health&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Uses&lt;br /&gt;  Curly Hair (natural)&lt;br /&gt;  Oily Hair&lt;br /&gt;  Thicker Hair&lt;br /&gt;  Thinner Hair&lt;br /&gt;  Dry scalp</li>
            <li> the only downside to this product is the time limit. i wish it repaired hair faster but i have dyed my hair many times so i guess that&#x27;s why, but this product smells great and works great to redefine, nourish and eliminate dryness and add shine to your hair. my curls look and feel way better and i only used these products about 4 times !</li>
            <li> Great way to find if the products work for you. And not a bad value. I have reordered my favorite part, the leave in conditioner, but will reorder the shampoo and everything else as well. Love these products :)</li>
            <li> This products does MIRACLES!!! Before this non of the other products used to work for my curly hair. But with mixed chicks once you put it in your hair you just automatically see the curls activate and feel much better!! Really great product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good product.  I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. This product works well for my hair. I&#x27;m definitely a devoted consumer. Its priced very well.</li>
            <li> good produt for the price, as always loved the leave in conditioner, not too crazy for the shampoo or deap conditioner, maybe because i have others as favorites that are more reasonable in cost, will probably just stick to ordering the Leave inn</li>
            <li> First off I am black not mixed so my hair is not curly those who are mixed. I believe my hair type is around a 4b.  I ordered this product because I am trying to go natural and was trying to find a product that would hold a 2 strand twist style while moisturizing my hair. I believe this product is very over priced. For the price I expected something great that would hold moisture And add softness and definition for a few days at least. The product hasn&#x27;t done anything better than any $5 bottle of shampoo or conditioner would do. I&#x27;ve found better products at 1/4 the price that work much better. Maybe those who have naturally curly,not kinky hair, would find this product to work better for their hair.</li>
            <li> My father is Louisiana Creole, and I have always had a terrible time finding products that work in my hair without making it too oily or drying out it out. Mixed chicks is perfect! Although I am glad that I bought the quad pack, next time I might just buy the leave in conditioner, as the other products tend to dry out my hair a bit. I 100% recommend this to anyone who struggles with finding products that aren&#x27;t for \\&quot;conventional\\&quot; hair. Mixed chicks is simply amazing!</li>
            <li> The shampoo in the kit has sulfites. Didn&#x27;t notice anything special about these products</li>
            <li> It works well for all of you mixed chicks. I would recommend it as nothin else seemed to work well</li>
            <li> Finally a product that works on my hair after wasting hundreds if not thousands of money looking for a shampoo and conditioner that actually does what it says. Mixed chicks does it and my hair is so curly it could easily turn into dreadlocks (yeah I know a lot of people would love to have that type of hair) but not me!! I love the silky feeling of my hair and I highly recommend this to anyone who has curly hair that insists on matting so badly you can&#x27;t even get a brush through it. I have broken many combs along the way and I can actually come out my hair with this awesome product. Buyer for as long as you make it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful service, great value</li>
            <li> I wear my hair blonde and natural, and these products work so well in my hair. They leave my hair soft and it curls very well when drying.</li>
            <li> The product made my hair look cute but its just not perfect for me. The next day hair is just not cute so I have to completely rewash and do it again.</li>
            <li> Best leave in conditioner for my curly hair, I also use it as my styling product. Just pricey for such a small amount but we&#x27;ll worth it.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product line. Been using it on my daughter&#x27;s hair for about 3 years. Started with the kids line but as her hair has gotten longer &amp; thicker &amp; curlier I had to switch to the adult line. The creators Wendi &amp; Kim have an awesome &amp;#34;How to&amp;#34; use this product on YouTube. Highly recommend watching the &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34;. Also highly recommended product for curly hair no matter what your ethnicity is.</li>
            <li> Love their products!!!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product it wasn&#x27;t what I expected at all! I felt it was overpriced and resemble inexpensive drug store brands. The scent is not the best. My hair felt frizzy instead of smooth and soft. I wish I would&#x27;ve spent my money on a different product.</li>
            <li> I notice how different my hair looks when I use all 3 products (I rarely use the serum).  It is smoother and my waves are more defined I don&#x27;t have curly hair, nor am I mixed.  I have wavy hair and it just looks better when using these products.  One thing, I think that the leave-in conditioner may cause staining.  My hand towels have developed a discoloration, as if they had gotten a little bleach on them.  I usually wipe my hands right after using the product to get off the excess.  Now I always wash my hands with soap right after and then dry.</li>
            <li> OMG!! This kit is amazing. My hair is super soft but I have defined curls also. Best conditioner I&#x27;ve used and purchased conditioners every where even salons. Smells good but its a light fragrance..not heavy. Worth trying at least one time.</li>
            <li> Did not work on my daughters hair. they do not tell you that if your hair is relaxted it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> These are great products and came with a brochure describing each one and how to use it. The service was great and it came really fast.</li>
            <li> Great value &amp; its totally worth it! It came the following day &amp; totally happy with the service provided :)</li>
            <li> first let me start by saying that the quad pack is a great way to save on these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the quality of the product, I used shea moisture before, which I&#x27;m a huge fan of, and would oil my scalp with coconut oil. Now that I&#x27;ve tried the full like of the mixed chicks curl products, I really appreciate the quality of the product and the value for the price. Mixed Chicks enhances your natural curl- if you have tight curls it will refine them and give you the most of your volume. If you&#x27;re like me, and have more wavy curls, it will enhance those. After first wash I felt that the product was most effective. I only wash my hair once a week, and use the leave-in conditioner and scalp oil daily, sometimes 2x a day. The products recommend that you use when hair is wet, and I recommend this for more defined curls. But I feel it dries out my hair to wet it everyday, and the product works well on dry hair and wet hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my hair on this product. I have mixed hair, that i&#x27;ve blown dried straight most of my life - because it was impossible to deal with my curls otherwise. They would get knotty and frizzy, and it took 20 mins minimum to comb every day.&lt;br /&gt;  I used all 3 steps - shampoo, deep conditionner and leave in, and did not get the look I expected on the first round. But I did it again a week later, and I&#x27;ve never seen my hair hold curls without the frizziness for so long. I barely had to use a comb to unknot my hair. It&#x27;s truly a miracle!&lt;br /&gt;  To last a week, I either rewet my hair and use the leave in, or just use the serum depending on how frizzy it is.&lt;br /&gt;  The best part is how soft and lively my hair feels - not dry and breakable, or gross because of the oily products i usually have to use to keep it hydrated.</li>
            <li> My 18 year old, bi-racial daughter uses these products exclusively after trying many other hair products for her spiral curled, long hair.  Her curls are gorgeously defined, barely any frizz.  Her hair just looks luxurious!  She receives compliments daily.  She doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to use the shampoo and doesn&#x27;t see a real difference between it and basic shampoos, but she adores the regular conditioner and leave in conditioner.  We regularly buy them.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this.  I&#x27;m half black, half German with fine, frizzy, long, curly hair.  The shampoo was super drying, in fact I now use it once a month or so as a clarifying shampoo, just so I don&#x27;t feel like I wasted my money.  I read the reviews for the Deva Curl products and got the &amp;#34;The Curly Girl Handbook&amp;#34;, and now my hair is super awesome.  This just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Amazing product for very curly hair, my daughter is mixed and her hair is thick, the conditioner gets tangles out within minutes.</li>
            <li> Wonderful Product. It works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many products and I thought this would be different. I loved the smell of everything. After using if 2 times with real standout results I have say I am disappointed. Way overpriced! I&#x27;ll stick with Motions.</li>
            <li> What a great price/value for this set! I heard about the brand Mixed Chicks a while ago, but hate to admit that I hadn&#x27;t tried it sooner because I assumed it was for African American mixed chicks :( I&#x27;m mixed but with Filipino, Hispanic, &amp; Pacific Islander. The leave in conditioner is HEAVEN SENT for my thick, wavy, coarse, frizzy, color treated hair!!! I let it air dry and it produces luscious, bouncy waves, without weighing my hair down too greasily or leaving me with crunchy ends. It also makes my unruly baby hairs sit down very nicely. I haven&#x27;t tried the deep conditioner and serum yet, but am looking forward to doing so. I&#x27;m not sure if the brand has a sulfate-free version, but that would be a nice option :)</li>
            <li> Love this Love this and Love this. Great for my hair. I have tried a million products and never have I had the results that I have with this product. I am in my late 50&#x27;s, white with coarse hair and this works. Thank you. I purchased this and mailed it to my children and will continue to use this. I get compliments daily on how beautiful my hair is. I did follow the directions - using water, wide tooth comb and product. If you want to try a new product for difficult hair - this is the a must.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a &amp;#34;mixed chick&amp;#34;, but I do have unruly curly hair and this product line is just what my hair needed!</li>
            <li> It lasted about a month.  I wash my hair about three times a weeks.  The leave in conditioner is my favorite.  I&#x27;ve never been able to find a product that can give me good curls.  My hair is thin and sort of frizzy and I need something that can tame it.  This did the trick.  I looked at a bunch of reviews comparing this to miss jessie&#x27;s pillow soft curls and let me tell you, this is way better.  This did not leave my hair feeling like it has residue.  I ran out of my mixed chicks and saw the pillow soft curls on sale and bought it and I&#x27;m regretting it.  I gave my hair 3 shampoos and then blow dried and the product is still in my hair.  It looks disgusting.  I can&#x27;t wait to get my mixed chicks again.  I will say, the serum is awesome, but don&#x27;t use too much or your hair will look greasy and clumped up where you use to much of it.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the deep conditioner. I am natural so I wash my hair a lot and the conditioner keeps my hair nice and strong.</li>
            <li> I cant speak for everyone but my sister has fine long beautiful hair. (African American woman) her hair was coming out bad and we thought it was her seizure medication until we stopped using this line of products an her hair immeadiately stop coming out. It was not hair breakage (broken pieces in the sink) it was strings from her root coming out every time we brushed or combed her hair. I would not recommend if you have fine hair...</li>
            <li> I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;I used it years ago and it is still the best curl conditioner for me. I apply the leave in and by the time I get to work my hair is dry and fully curly and fluffy.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry to a hard shell or dry out like other products do.</li>
            <li> Only product for my baby.</li>
            <li> Love it! Leaves hair bouncy and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed. My products that I buy at cvs do a much better job at a cheaper price. These dried out my hair. Bright side is they smell good.</li>
            <li> Love all of it! The conditioner is AWESOME! My 5 year old has long, curly, difficult to manage hair and this stuff actually works on her.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. keeps my hair moisturized between shampoos. Could be priced better. not everyone can afford to buy.</li>
            <li> I am Hispanic/Arabic; my hair is dark and curly and will get frizzy in humid weather. I like both the daily shampoo and conditioner. It&#x27;s not heavy; nor does it makes my hair dry or oily. I wash, dry, and flat iron my hair daily.  It&#x27;s not damaged and it&#x27;s probably because I am picky with my hair products. I ordered the set and realized I didn&#x27;t need the leave in conditioner or the hair silk because I don&#x27;t let my hair dry naturally.  I did use the silk ( very small amount) one time on dry hair and liked it.  I just have to be careful how much I use; I don&#x27;t like a slick or oily look.  I will buy the shampoo and conditioner again. I use the leave in conditioner like I use the regular conditioner.... washing out in the shower before stepping out.</li>
            <li> All I really loved was the leave in conditioner. This is the product that makes the biggest difference.  But the old version of humectress by nexxus, leave in conditioner was the best product ever for kinky hair</li>
            <li> Seems to work well in my daughters hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things about these products and since I&#x27;m a mixed chick I figured I should give it a shot.  Unfortunately, these products are not designed for my hair.  For a bit of background, I have natural hair that can be styled as curly with a bit of mouse or straightened with a blow dryer and curling iron.  My hair is fairly long and thick thanks to my mom, but suffers from frizz and the ability to become an afro from my dad.  In my first use, I tried the full set of shampoo, deep conditioner, leave-in conditioner and finishing serum to go from a wash to straightening.  After straightening, my hair lacked any luster and seemed a bit dry and dead looking.  After a 2 days I developed a terrible case of dandruff, which is very much out of character for my hair.  I generally go 4 - 7 days between washing and never see dandruff. I figured I would give the products another shot.  I did a second round of shampoo and deep conditioner, but skipped the leave-in to avoid having extra stuff in my hair that could cause dandruff.  Unfortunately I had the same results.  The dandruff came back, as well as terrible itching.  I don&#x27;t think there is any standard \\&quot;mixed chick\\&quot; hair, so I encourage others to try these products because you never know what works; however, these products dried out my hair and made me look like a head and shoulders commercial.  For the price, I was pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> These products have helped my granddaughters hair a lot. It feels much better, more moisture and nice sheen.&lt;br /&gt;I tried going without for a few months, but her hair started looking dull and didn&#x27;t have that nice feel. It didn&#x27;t comb&lt;br /&gt;out as well, either.</li>
            <li> WORKS AMAZING WITH MY CURLS AND LETS THEM DRY NATURALLY WITHOUT ANY FRIZZ! ANYONE WITH CURLY HAIR HAS TO TRY THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and have tried so many products.  I love the leave in conditioner, it controls my hair and accents the curls.</li>
            <li> I ordered this pack so that I could try it out on my daughters hair. I love it. It gave me a sample of every single products that I didn&#x27;t have to buy it individually and then not like it. It also last a while if you don&#x27;t wash hair every single day I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use a lot which is nice by the bottle being rather small. My hair is manageable and not weighed down, nor is it clumpy, gooey, or chunky. I love the serum, it keeps my hair feeling supple and not all greasy looking and it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out. If anybody complains of these four components together, they&#x27;re probably not using it correctly, or using too much of all four.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Every item that comes with this set works very well together and helps you create a simple routine to tame your curly hair. The only frustration I have is the $20 price hike in less than five months. I bought this set for $45 back in late September. By December it was $50-something, now it&#x27;s $60. What gives?</li>
