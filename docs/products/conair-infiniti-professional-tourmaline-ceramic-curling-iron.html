            <li>Great heat up very quickly</li>
            <li>Great value for the cheap cost.</li>
            <li>The swivel cord is a great feature and my hair is curled and smooth every time.</li>
            <li>This curl iron is amazing, it curls so well without hairspray.  </li>
            <li>That is a good thing, yes? :-)</li>
            <li>It gives me lots of body and the 4 settings are nice.</li>
            <li>I like the 1 inch barrel as it gives a nice amount of curl/wave.  </li>
            <li>Good just need more practice on it</li>
            <li>The curling iron makes nice curls.  </li>
            <li>The highest works nice.  </li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>Also, nice plastic cover for travel is included.</li>
            <li>It was a nice day out as well-</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s my own fault for not picking a hotter product.</li>
            <li>You may just need to really turn the heat up to get the best waves.</li>
            <li>Neither of us liked ours.  </li>
            <li>It shipped on time, gives the perfect sized curls, heats fast</li>
            <li>It is really good for hairstyling but just make sure you use hair spray</li>
            <li>The best was very pricey</li>
            <li>Nice to have the protective cover too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan to be honest.</li>
            <li>Bought one for my mom and she liked it.</li>
            <li>The heat control is easy and perfect and the iron heats QUICKLY</li>
            <li>Works great on my hair and the price is just right!</li>
            <li>Beautiful and useful.</li>
            <li>This 1-1/2&amp;#34; ceramic tourmaline curling iron is perfect for large waves and heats evenly without burning my hair, leaving more split ends.</li>
            <li>Loved the ability to change temperature easily.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s very easy to press by accident.</li>
            <li>The clamp on it is very strong but it doesn&#x27;t snag hairs.</li>
            <li>Love this curling iron, I can&#x27;t love without it!</li>
            <li>It might not be ideal for shorter hair because the barrel is so large.</li>
            <li>It heats very fast and makes beautiful curls.</li>
            <li>Overall though, it makes my hair (fine, medium length, curly/wavy) hair look great, at a great price!</li>
            <li>This is, by far, the best curling iron I have ever owned and I have owned a zillion of them.  </li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is the greatest curling iron in the universe!  </li>
            <li>It is soooo handy I love it</li>
            <li>My hair looks good using this iron - smooth and not frizzy.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;by far the best.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, and</li>
            <li>This is a very good product and I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Exactly as show.works great no hassles no issues.only thing i can say</li>
            <li>Really does a beautiful job on all hair types.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>this one is easy to handle, it has good temperature settings and makes the process very quick and satisfying.</li>
            <li>Great product -- my mistake was getting one too large.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite sure that this curling iron does not.</li>
            <li>Love &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>is make sure</li>
            <li>you know what size to get since my wife wasnt so sure</li>
            <li>You will LOVE &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>I love how this curling iron eliminates alot of the frizz</li>
            <li>There are more cons than pros with this curling iron.    </li>
            <li>I love the plastic cover that comes with it so that the iron is protected from scratches.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great product.</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I am returning it soon and hoping to find a better curling product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this iron.</li>
            <li>and I fell instantly in love with it.</li>
            <li>Love the weight of this iron.</li>
            <li>Love this model - just need to periodically replace over the years.  </li>
            <li>So glad I kept my receipt, and am going to spring for something laid out a lot better.</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron.</li>
            <li>plus it was a much better deal.</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite curling iron.</li>
            <li>ALL have performed better than this model.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy this curling iron because I have the Infiniti You Curl and love it -</li>
            <li>Love love love it.</li>
            <li>I used to turn it off a lot without realizing it, but I have adjusted to the location and make sure to mind the button.</li>
            <li>so I avoid touching it all together.</li>
            <li>, you will not be able to help getting your hair caught in them at some point.</li>
            <li>The hair that wraps towards the top gets stuck once out of every 3-4 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This seems like a quality iron, and I love the fact that it has an automatic shut off function.</li>
            <li>Love this curling iron.</li>
            <li>after drying- seems like no matter what I do, I cannot get the curls to stay in my hair for more than 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>i wish it curled more and stayed</li>
            <li>Heats up fast, works great.</li>
            <li>i just love how the curling iron works with my hair.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products that did not work.  </li>
            <li>I love my curling iron</li>
            <li>and I love the way it grips my hair.  </li>
            <li>I like this curling iron specifically because it doesn&#x27;t have a collapse able rest.  </li>
            <li>I love this iron...</li>
            <li>I cannot count how many times it has been dropped and all the functions still work as they did the day I bought it for her.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m ok with that...</li>
            <li>to have more of a curl impact on longer hair.  </li>
            <li>i would not have guessed that Conair would have made such a successful one, but guess what???!!!  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Also love the sleeve.  </li>
            <li>hopefully a bit more durable -</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron.</li>
            <li>Works great and heats up fast.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this curling iron.</li>
            <li>I already had one with a smaller barrel by Conair but this size is perfect for looser waves.</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron.</li>
            <li>I love the heat shield.  </li>
            <li>I have many hair curling tools</li>
            <li>Does her hair alot more as well now</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I love it :)</li>
            <li>I love this and specifically looked for a curler that came with this because I wanted to be sure I could store the curler away immediately when I was finished with</li>
            <li>and/or make this part non-tapered to give it more circumference</li>
            <li>Definitely practice holding the curler before turning in on to see how best to grip it</li>
            <li>I was looking for a thicker curling iron for big curls and this one is perfect.</li>
            <li>It seems to heat up okay, but doesn&#x27;t work well with my hair, for some reason.  </li>
            <li>My favorite curling iron.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this ceramic curling iron.</li>
            <li>Love the carrying case to protect it when traveling and need to throw it in your suitcase.</li>
            <li>And I like the many temperature options.</li>
            <li>but i am so in love with the volume</li>
            <li>This one performed a wee bit better, but it still had a tendency to not grip my hair, so my hair would fall out before I finished curling the length of my hair around it.  </li>
            <li>I mostly use it to curl the ends of my hair and it leaves my split ends looking shiny and styled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>you end up curling it many many times for just one strip of hair</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron...  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love Infiniti products.</li>
            <li>I AM GLAD</li>
            <li>I probably need more practice</li>
            <li>Who ever designed this needs to watch how women curl their hair and realize that tip needs to have way more protection.  </li>
            <li>I love this curling iron.</li>
            <li>I love this curler.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love this curling iron.</li>
            <li>(in case you thought you&#x27;d grip the tip to avoid gripping the handle, thereby turning the iron off while curling.).  </li>
            <li>that only had an on/off switch, but this curling iron is awesome!  </li>
            <li>I also bought the smaller 1&#x27; that also works just as great!</li>
            <li>I would just throw mine away, but I paid more (retail) than they charge here for it.</li>
            <li>Great purchase, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Just what I needed- heats fast, easy to handle and a great price</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re willing to overlook that, you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>so there is a good chance you will miss the plastic and touch the hot iron when styling.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good curling iron.</li>
            <li>The best curling iron I have purchased in a long time.</li>
            <li>This curling iron has the perfect barrel size for my long hair.  </li>
            <li>It heats almost instantly too, it is just amazing!!</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly &amp; curls  nicely.</li>
            <li>The variable temperature is super nice as well as the on/off switch.  </li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, doesn&#x27;t burn hair and provides a nice curl.</li>
            <li>it not only curls your hair perfectly with staying power, but also managed to straighten and smooth my hair simultaneously and twice</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for someone with limited use of hands.</li>
            <li>maybe it will work even better for those whose hair curls better and it gets hot nicely</li>
            <li>I liked it very much!</li>
            <li>perfect size for loose curls.</li>
            <li>love that it heats up quickly and covers a lot of surface area of my hair, gets hair done faster!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s nicely made, get&#x27;s really hot, and I like the swivel cord!</li>
            <li>Heats up fast, leaves my hair looking fabulous and if you forget and leave it on, it shuts off on its own!</li>
            <li>I have easy to curl, fine, smooth hair and this didn&#x27;t curl my hair at all!</li>
            <li>It has auto shut off which I liked better than the Hot Tools iron, I would be paranoid at work all day</li>
            <li>When my old Infiniti curling iron died, I was happy to find this updated version.  </li>
            <li>Great natural looking curl</li>
            <li>This has great reviews which is so ironic because I do not find any to be true.</li>
            <li>This curling iron seems to work fairly well, though I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.</li>
            <li>I skipped another iron I wanted to buy because this one was cheaper, but it&#x27;s true, you get what you pay for, and I still end up out $20!</li>
            <li>Used this curling iron for the first time yesterday and I have to say that I love it!  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it is great!</li>
            <li>This little gem performs wonderful and gives you top heat in 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li>It can easily be shut off while   using it</li>
            <li>Easy to use and gets job done well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to pick up even with my arthritis, curls like a dream.  </li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s easy to turn it off accidentally when your curling your hair because of the on off switch.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to burn your fingers.</li>
            <li>Its easy to use</li>
            <li>Heats quickly, easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly....</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>I think it gets the job done and heats up very quickly.  </li>
            <li>and I was looking for an easy to use ceramic curler.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to burn your fingers with this iron</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a bit easy to get burned.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the cheap cost take away from the fact that it gives the best curls with minimal frizz</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to make big fat curls or nice beachy waves, this is a good buy.</li>
            <li>And it gets nice and hot</li>
            <li>I own THREE Hot Tools curling irons (two gold-plated ones and one ceramic) and ended up purchasing this one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest, I prefer this one over Hot tools.  </li>
            <li>I really liked it at first</li>
            <li>iron.&lt;br /&gt;The barrel gets nice and hot; my hair does not get pulled at any part of the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Super awesome for long hair, leaves my hair Volumous and curly!</li>
            <li>Heats quickly, gets very hot, curls nicely - it does everything it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>I use this pretty much every day and it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>The reason is, the Hot Tools curling irons work awesome when there&#x27;s low humidity.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many hair styling tools and my hair holds pretty well, and the Conair Infiniti Pro 1.5 inch barrel was the most ineffective tool I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>which is fine if I lose the receipt, because the warranty is 5 years on the newer models.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and wavy</li>
            <li>Makes beautiful, smooth, big curls.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and the heat settings</li>
            <li>it was going to work fine</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S JUST FINE FOR ME.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly!</li>
            <li>And super love the plastic protector it comes with</li>
            <li>but i also love the shine this iron gives to hair and the quick results.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE temperature control; I have very fine straight hair</li>
            <li>Fit and finish is great and heats pretty fast</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved this so far!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I absolute love this curling iron!</li>
            <li>The cord could be longer, but with some precise extension cord placement, it&#x27;s just fine.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, nice large curls.</li>
            <li>and it is a great and cheap investment that will last for manyyyyyy years!</li>
            <li>does a great job of creating big, smooth waves on my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>they are quite an indispensable tool.</li>
            <li>plus it is light weight.</li>
            <li>so I just wanted to replace and still have the same great results.</li>
            <li>Works great on the second highest temp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great size for big curls.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all for anything that makes my wife happy, and this definitely does.</li>
            <li>The automatic shut off is a great feature to have especially if you are like me &amp; walk away forgetting to shut it off.</li>
            <li>and I am so happy that I finally found it!</li>
            <li>It also heats really fast, which is nice...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t enjoy &amp;#34;getting ready&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>great big curls!</li>
            <li>Really is a great product it actually adds shine to my curls without me adding any oils</li>
            <li>I have a smaller version of this curling iron and it works great.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and liked that users were saying that it smoothed their hair and stopped frizz even though I did not hold out much hope in that arena for myself.  </li>
            <li>No frizz -- no fly-aways - my hair stays smooth and straightened in between shampoos</li>
            <li>Before putting heat on my hair I use heat protecting spray which also helps my hair look smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>so i liked that um i cant really complain it gets the job done too</li>
            <li>Great as a back up</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars because it does leave my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>Light, east to use, adjustable temperature.</li>
            <li>Great iron for the price; multiple settings.</li>
            <li>Perfect size for everyday curls</li>
            <li>With some hair product and effort it does a fabulous job.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much</li>
            <li>As far as curling irons go this is certainly a good one.   </li>
            <li>It is possible I have a defective one since so many others found it a good item.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for the perfect curling iron to create those pretty beachy waves on my long hair</li>
            <li>So far, this seems to be a good curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Loved my old one,</li>
            <li>Good so far for the $$$.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t curl my own hair for shit lol...</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic curling iron, it heats up quickly and does glide easily over your hair.</li>
            <li>I love how hot these curling irons get and how quickly they heat up!</li>
            <li>There is many setting on how hot you want your curl iron which is amazing because sometime you want gentle heat on your hair.  </li>
            <li>It was super easy to return and super easy to order the correct size.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
            <li>The swivle cord is super easy to deal with</li>
            <li>It has become a chore that I just want to be quick and easy</li>
            <li>it is super easy to use and set the temperature.  </li>
            <li>The material composition appears to be consistent and not coated, which is better for the hair and does not burn the ends like the cheap coated irons.</li>
            <li>The barrel seems to be smooth and offers a nice curl when used on fine to semi-thick hair.</li>
            <li>It seems to heat up quick and definitely does a great job.</li>
            <li>so I was excited</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many Conair curling irons over the years and this is the first one that didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>First off the top piece is not heat resistent</li>
            <li>The 1.5 inch is perfect for a \\&quot;full\\&quot; affect without looking too \\&quot;prom\\&quot; curly hair, or you can use it to make quick waves for a more subtle affect.    </li>
            <li>While in use, it will turn off because the on/off button is exactly where most women would place their fingers while curling their hair.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>This thing gets real hot, yow yow!&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;- love the 1.5 inch size, big lovely sexy</li>
            <li>hair seems to handle the heat pretty well and seem more shiny after curling.</li>
            <li>The long cord is great too.</li>
            <li>i love the big sexy curls and bounce it gives my hair!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this because I&#x27;d always used a wand</li>
            <li>i used to have a hot tools one and this one works better.</li>
            <li>I bought a better brand with a higher heat as I have a lot on hair.</li>
            <li>I love that there is a cover for the curling iron, so you can cover it up and put it away while it&#x27;s hot and not have to worry about my son getting burned.  </li>
            <li>I burned my fingers so many times with the first use that I will never use it again.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite hot tools.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this one thus far.</li>
            <li>Worked for about a month, then only heated to barely warm!</li>
            <li>Really like being able to control temp setting for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It heats up to 400 F pretty quickly and the surface of the barrel is very smooth.</li>
            <li>considering that it is such a great tool, it is way worth it.</li>
            <li>I actually have the 2\\&quot; and it is by far the best curiling iron I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I have tried multiple curling irons and so far this is the best one.</li>
            <li>it is far better than i could have hoped!</li>
            <li>I did notice a smoothing effect which I liked a lot because I have fly aways and frizzy hair all year long with my naturally wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My little sister loves it, it&#x27;s real handy and readily accessible.</li>
            <li>I just bought a new one and am just as happy with my new curling iron.</li>
            <li>This is a rather large barrel hair curler, so it doesn&#x27;t truly curl your hair, it more adds wave and some curls at the ends of the hair (ends up looking like when my hair dresser blow dries it, vs when I do</li>
            <li>This curling iron gives me just the right lift and it tames my frizzy waves!</li>
            <li>Plus shipping was right on time!</li>
            <li>The plastic end isn&#x27;t very large and is easy to miss when you are rolling hair with two hands.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended because good quality for reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that requires high heat to curl.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind a burnt scalp and fingers, and the fact that it will turn off several times as you bump the on/off switch while curling your hair, it will produce good curls.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a shame because otherwise, I love this iron.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really curl my hair correctly, the sections I curled came out looking more like spirals without a lot of body.</li>
            <li>This is a really good product for people with short hair maybe at shoulder length.</li>
            <li>Prepare for gorgeous big waves</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron, so much so that I have it in the 1&amp;#34; and 1.5&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>So, this Conair Infiniti Pro is a dream come true.</li>
            <li>I bought 3 brands before I remembered the name Conair from years back as being good</li>
            <li>IF YOU WANT BOUNCY FULL CURLS</li>
            <li>So far it seems pretty good.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>The heat guard/stand that came with the curling iron keeps the hot iron off the counter during after use cool down...brilliant!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair smooth with just the right amount of body.</li>
            <li>the price was right and it was available through Amazon Prime.  </li>
            <li>It gets hot very quick.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is a great curling iron.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use -- the hinge opens with the perfect amount of resistance and it holds the hair just tight enough to make the perfect curl, while not providing too much excessive heat which could be damaging.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>This curling iron heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and does the job well.</li>
            <li>On the hottest scale, it give plenty of heat to curl quickly.  </li>
            <li>It arrived so quickly and I just adore it.</li>
            <li>Works great on my long hair, exactly as advertised .</li>
            <li>I quickly read some online reviews, then went to Target, who had it on sale.</li>
            <li>Heats quickly</li>
            <li>Works great!&lt;br /&gt;It heats up really quick.</li>
            <li>and I was lucky get it on time.</li>
            <li>I had the same one from many many years ago</li>
            <li>This heats up quickly, the cord doesn&#x27;t twist and the cover lets me put it away immediately after use.  </li>
            <li>Quick and efficient.  </li>
            <li>sure enough, I was able to get it here</li>
            <li>But it heats quickly and works well.</li>
            <li>So, I am amazed by this product - it works quickly</li>
            <li>Just quickly glide the straightener to relax the curls.  </li>
            <li>Heats up quickly</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li>I like that these heat up so quickly.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, but hair always gets caught in the screw hinge.</li>
            <li>This iron heats up quickly and evenly and curls well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These heat up quickly and do the job.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny and healthy looking, it has an auto shut off in case you forget to unplug it before you leave, and the settings are simple and just what I love about this.  </li>
            <li>This curling iron gets very hot, I can curl my hair quickly in the morning.</li>
            <li>My 1 inch from con air works amazing, but this barely did anything.</li>
            <li>My hair just slips off the barrel after releasing the clip and it is barely even warm when I touch it.</li>
            <li>A lot of settings for heat and can get very hot.  </li>
            <li>I THINK THIS WOULD BE A GOOD ITEM FOR SOMEONE WITH LONG CURLY HAIR</li>
            <li>I barely put any hairspray on and my curls were awesome loose curls.</li>
            <li>VERY high quality and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Great for straightening look with a slight wave.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a sleeve so you can put it away without having to let it cool off completely and the &amp;#34;kick stand&amp;#34; keeps the iron from touching your counter</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to inadvertently hit the button that changes the temperature setting, resulting in a much hotter iron than intended.</li>
            <li>I brought lots of similar product and this is my favorite one!</li>
            <li>Gets really hot and get&#x27;s the job done!</li>
            <li>IF IT BREAKS, BUT IM NOT MAD</li>
            <li>A 1.5&amp;#34; barrel works great on my thick, layered hair and this size isn&#x27;t easy to find.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The comment about the on/off switch being too easily depressed during normal curling - TRUE.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair that would be fried much beyong the minimum setting.</li>
            <li>I also have on the hottest setting, but it barely curls my hair, and my hair is very easy to style.  </li>
            <li>The on/ off switch is super sensitive and placed right where your hand needs to go in order to hold the iron safely.</li>
            <li>and yes, i have experienced that burning thing with this iron on my fingertips a few</li>
            <li>It is gentle on the hair and makes it so smooth and shiney.</li>
            <li>I love that it is tourmaline because it makes my hair SOO soft.</li>
            <li>Nice big barrel.</li>
            <li>Also, the \\&quot;cool tip\\&quot; still gets a bit hot.  </li>
            <li>Loved so much, through out my travel iron and bought a second one of these!</li>
            <li>now, if you have longer hair, you can&#x27;t expect nice curls from the big barrel irons...</li>
            <li>I had been buying professional curling irons for my wife and she said this works better.</li>
            <li>Now I have to decide if it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>Nice big curls!</li>
            <li>The comment about the tip being too hot - TRUE</li>
            <li>Again, maybe this curling iron is so exciting to me because I haven&#x27;t bought one in 15 years, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  </li>
            <li>The only fault is my own.</li>
            <li>This curling iron is very easy to use and gives quick and lasting results.  </li>
            <li>Gets hot very quick and love the big barrel curls -</li>
            <li>oh and i did accidentally turn off the button once or twice, but you get the hang of it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and has a convenient cover to put away hot.  </li>
            <li>Quick heat up, neat control panel, no accidental bumping of switches, and a hot, three tempurature choice.</li>
            <li>The little plastic sleeve to put on there while it&#x27;s still hot and is cooling is great.</li>
            <li>I think this is a great iron, which is why I&#x27;m replacing my old one with the exact same one.</li>
            <li>On/off switch is in a good place and isn&#x27;t accidentally turned off while using (unlike other models).</li>
            <li>Shut off switch is right where your hand is</li>
            <li>There was a funky smell that emanated from it right out of the box like burned electrical or something, but I still plugged it in to use anyway, and when the smell was still dominant, I decided to put it away, and that&#x27;s when I noticed no barrel cover and found it was pre-owned or a customer return.   </li>
            <li>The on/off switch is located right on the handle where you are turning and twisting to curl</li>
            <li>This gets the job done and was the right price.</li>
            <li>My hair would even smell scorched right away, but still no change.  </li>
            <li>The right product at the right time.</li>
            <li>but this doesn&#x27;t seem right to me</li>
            <li>you see it happen right away.</li>
            <li>I was right.  </li>
            <li>But, the finish on it makes your hair slide right out when you lift the handle.  </li>
            <li>it is a dome shape and ribbed so that your fingers slide right off the end.  </li>
            <li>As far as being user friendly, it heats up very fast, (man it is caplable of getting very hot!).</li>
            <li>Hair stays smooth, even in high humidity.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic curling iron with a high setting.</li>
            <li>It also doesnt hold a curl very long (even my Revlon $20 curling iron works a lot better over this one)!</li>
            <li>It could not be more relieved this has turned out to be even better than my previous one.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s in fine working condition and still looks brand new.</li>
            <li>The curling part works great, but as others have noted, the end is too small</li>
            <li>Bonus, it is so smooth it doesn&#x27;t pull my damaged ends and puts a sleek finish on my normally curly, and sometimes, out of control hair.</li>
            <li>I can use it to put beautiful, thick curls in or straighten my hair into a shiny, sleek, bone-straight style.  </li>
            <li>This is good, works better than my big barrel Conair models (which don&#x27;t hold curls as long AND break every couple of months due to a flawed cord) but this is not as good as the slimmer barrel Infiniti which I got first and was very impressed by.</li>
            <li>I have super curly hair and my expectation was to have large defined curls.</li>
            <li>The clamp is strong enought to hold my long hair in the iron but not so strong that you get a kink in the hair under the clamp.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m able to put it back in my gym bag without worrying about it being too hot!</li>
            <li>well, when ceramic straighteners came available on the market at a reasonable price a few years ago i was like hallelujah, it worked pretty good</li>
            <li>After much abuse by me, my original Infinity curling iron broke and was glad I could replace it with the same product.</li>
            <li>It gets hot right away and works well.</li>
            <li>Then your fingers will slide right onto the 400 degree hot curling surface.  </li>
            <li>I have really straight heavy hair that never curls and this worked great.</li>
            <li>but like how quickly it heats up and it ready to go.</li>
            <li>I get nice big curls and heats up fast.</li>
            <li>This iron works well, heats up fast and leaves nice big curls in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I definitely don&#x27;t recommend using that highest temperature on a daily basis (and don&#x27;t even think about using it on damp hair!), but it&#x27;s great when you need it.</li>
            <li>In fact, I probably won&#x27;t own a single Conair product after this one goes in the trash.</li>
            <li>In fact, I probably won&#x27;t own a single Conair product after this one goes in the trash.</li>
            <li>This iron does heat up fast and gets very hot.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot and very evenly.</li>
            <li>I LIKE THIS CURLING IRON, IT GIVES  NICE LOOSE CURLS IN MY HAIR.</li>
            <li>It gets hot super fast.  </li>
            <li>It has 4 temperature choices and all heat up very fast, within a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>This iron heats very fast &amp; works well.</li>
            <li>Turns off when not used for a while, which is a very important feature for us, since we are constantly forgetting to turn curling irons</li>
            <li>It heats up very fast.</li>
            <li>I have very straight hair and someone told me to look for tourmaline.  </li>
            <li>This curling iron heats very fast, has variable temperature settings, and automatic shut-off.  </li>
            <li>This little guy is good quality and do its job.</li>
            <li>comes with a heat protector and love the multiple settings.</li>
            <li>The barrel is nice and wide</li>
            <li>I tried freshly washed hair, I tried day after hair, it didn&#x27;t make much difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be trying the Hot Tools 24k gold iron instead.</li>
            <li>I have this curler , my mother had it first</li>
            <li>The on/off and temperature buttons are so sensitive that with just a light touch the unit either turns off or changes the setting.</li>
            <li>- The end tip is too hot to hold.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>Wish I had more of an opinion on it, but after about 2 weeks and a handful of uses, it doesn&#x27;t want to stay on, and if it does, it&#x27;s only a minute at a time.  </li>
            <li>Item exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well made!</li>
            <li>I had no problems with pressing the buttons while using the iron, and the piece in the middle that allows the iron to rest on the counter is better than most--very stable,</li>
            <li>Even when I hold the clamp all the way open and only use the barrel to curl, the hair that slides more than halfway up the barrel ends up getting lines on it just from touching the clamp.</li>
            <li>And when I use it as intended, with the clamp holding the outside of the curl, lines appear at the top of the curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i am not a fake reviewer hired by the company.</li>
            <li>Other than that.... Love it!</li>
            <li>so it is why I ordered a 1 1/2 inch size in the first place.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s working well for me considering first time curling my hair by myself..and</li>
            <li>This was a replacement to the first one that I owned for 8+ years.  </li>
            <li>I really like this curling iron!  </li>
            <li>The 1 1/2 inch size is great too, especially for those with long hair.  </li>
            <li>First thing I did</li>
            <li>PLus my hair slides so gently around it that it never snags and doesn&#x27;t pull out any of my hair!</li>
            <li>Remains consistently hot</li>
            <li>I love how you can set this to different temps, making it pretty versatile and will suit your needs.</li>
            <li>It works well and gives my hair and pretty, wavy curl.  </li>
            <li>and I love that it has multiple settings.</li>
            <li>I love the simple &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34; as the movable wire ones get in the way.  </li>
            <li>i do have long hair but tried this on my sisters short hair and worked great</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>With a variety of heat settings, I can get exactly the look I&#x27;m wanting without any hassle whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Works well for storing a hot iron when travelling.</li>
            <li>Well, overall, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I do like the sleeve that fits over a hot iron after you have finished so that you may pack it in your luggage and not have to wait until it cools.</li>
            <li>My last iron did much better at the curls.</li>
            <li>The tip gets extremely hot.  </li>
            <li>My first one just quit working.</li>
            <li>It gets so hot it&#x27;sridiculous.  </li>
            <li>She said it gave her the results she was hoping for within the first day of using</li>
            <li>Best one I have ever bought, and I have bought some expensive ones before.</li>
            <li>Does a great job with my thick hair.</li>
            <li>The lowest setting gets pretty hot.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was looking for and performs beyond expectation.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Love that you can actually set the heat by temperature instead of low/med/hot.</li>
            <li>because I use it a lot of times when my hair is straight!</li>
            <li>And I do make sure the clamp is raised enough off the barrel that the hair should have plenty of space.  </li>
            <li>I returned this after the first use.</li>
            <li>My hair just glides through the iron and ends up looking soft and frizz free.  </li>
            <li>so it is really easy to initially rest your index finger on the safety rest and when you go to turn the curling iron in an attempt to wind your hair around the barrel, your finger automatically moves from the safety rest to the PIPING HOT IRON!.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and makes nice curls in little time.  </li>
            <li>Ordered this item from the seller Ace Photo Digital with free super saving shipping, arrived in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li>Heats up super fast but doesn&#x27;t seem to hold curls very well.  </li>
            <li>No matter how skinny the ends of my hair were or how skinny a section of hair I did, the curling iron gripped the hair right to the very end</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that this iron doesn&#x27;t make loose curls, it seems like it just curls the ends of my hair, but still works great regardless.</li>
            <li>It seems to work better for me as a flat iron.</li>
            <li>It is a decent curling iron; it gets pretty hot but not as hot as my straightener.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, my hair tends to look dry on the ends, and this iron some how made the ends look MUCH better than they really do!  </li>
            <li>Works ok but the tip is too small and you can burn your fingers easily.</li>
            <li>Not bad if you have very thick or long hair though, the barrel works great!</li>
            <li>The iron gets hot fast and does its job.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast and stays hot.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done what I could to mitigate the damage, but this morning, it happened again, so I&#x27;m pretty much done dealing with this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a seamless transition from the iron to the top plastic piece.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad it has lasted as long as it has.</li>
            <li>WOW it is true</li>
            <li>I have super thick/frizzy hair and it usually takes forever to curl it into submission - this is one of the best irons I&#x27;ve ever had, it heats up fast and cools down fast.</li>
            <li>I thought it was just an issue with the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; light until I went on line to check out the instructions and found another review with exactly the same issue.  </li>
            <li>where your hold you hand, so unless you make an effort not to hit the buttons, it is easy to constantly be turing it off and adjusting the temp when you dont want to!  </li>
            <li>It will give u a nice wavy hair for less than 10 mins..</li>
            <li>The price on this iron is very realistic and it exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>It smoothes out my natural curls quickly for an alternative look.</li>
            <li>Best I have had and I have thick hair that is really long.  </li>
            <li>Good for long lasting, wavy curls.</li>
            <li>I bought this curling iron thinking it would create large curls and added volume.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it is just my hair, or I guess I underestimated how large the barrel would be, but the 1 1/2 inch did not do anything.</li>
            <li>I use the highest and hottest setting of 400 degrees on below shoulder-length hair to achieve large waves.</li>
            <li>I love the loose, voluminous curls and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty easy to please with these kinds of things, as long as they don&#x27;t break.  </li>
            <li>I like more strength in the blow power, but it seems to dry efficiently anyways!</li>
            <li>It also has a low setting for fine hair.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, but you&#x27;d better remember to use the tiny buttons above the power button to set the temp!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t get it to do it very easily which nearly ruins them.</li>
            <li>The end does get a little warm</li>
            <li>Having multiple heat settings is great, as is the little protective case.</li>
            <li>it heats up quick, and doesn&#x27;t snag on your hair like other cheap ones.  </li>
            <li>The top is very small and there is no place to hold the tip, and you can easily burn your fingers.</li>
            <li>I have VERY curly hair and no matter how I straighten or smooth it -- it ends up being frizzy and trying to curl up on me -- just doing the dishes or walking outside if the air has any humidity at all</li>
            <li>However, as someone else mentioned, be VERY CAUTIOUS about holding the end, or you will be burned, as I was.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Heated up fast, curls were shiny &amp; bouncy.</li>
            <li>Gentle heat and didn&#x27;t singe my hair, but it didn&#x27;t hold the curl either.</li>
            <li>However the iron does heat up fast.</li>
            <li>My daughter is very please with this.</li>
            <li>Smooths my hair without putting too much curl in it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair smooth and my curls do last all day.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and works well.</li>
            <li>is fast as my ceramic straightener.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>, that I now really wish I&#x27;d seen BEFORE purchasing this iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It heats up fast, but she doens&#x27;t like how the power button is a button and not, say, a switch, or perhaps move the power button, as she accidentally turns it off sometimes.  </li>
            <li>it really &amp;#34;grabs&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>If I curl it, I have to let it go and hold it with my hand for it to really stay.</li>
            <li>It heats up really well</li>
            <li>so I thought I didn&#x27;&#x27;t have much to lose with this one &amp; I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It also heats up really fast in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I really like this curling iron.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I rarely take the time to write reveiws but was going thru some old purchases and wanted to voice my opinion.  </li>
            <li>my medium think hair very well...</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It works really well .</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>My hair requires the highest heat setting to really keep a curl.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Conair should really extend the length</li>
            <li>: I can&#x27;t really tell if this &amp;#34;technology&amp;#34; has an effect but the curler curls and doesn&#x27;t seem to over fry my hair.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>For $40-50, you can&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li>I really like Conair products</li>
            <li>and I am VERY used to using an iron.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cone tip design allow my fingers to slip straight to the iron.  </li>
            <li>and my hair doesn&#x27;t hold the curl very well.</li>
            <li>This accomplished that well.</li>
            <li>i have yet to really try out the heat settings</li>
            <li>The barrel is also very slippery</li>
            <li>no sooner than you plug it in, its ready too use.</li>
            <li>and I end up with hair that is almost straight...</li>
            <li>I think I might be returning this since I have no use for it, seeing as it doesn&#x27;t really work on my hair...</li>
            <li>This one works really well for the price point.</li>
            <li>The ceramic barrel makes so much difference.</li>
            <li>oh yeah, it&#x27;s ready.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t have much effect&lt;</li>
            <li>I really like this Conair curling iron.</li>
            <li>really like this curling iron -  </li>
            <li>The barrel is rather smooth and I would recommend using product in your hair prior to curling/using as it does become slippery.  </li>
            <li>HEATS UP FAST</li>
            <li>Love that it comes with a cover for when I&#x27;m done especially since I have a four yr old.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s only happened twice because I&#x27;m not stupid and learned my lesson.</li>
            <li>Barrel too big and it wouldn&#x27;t be cost effective at the price I paid to spend another $7.00 on shipping it back ,so I am stuck with this unusable purchase.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have said, it heats up quickly, curls very nicely, and is all-in-all a solid buy, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; tip at the top of the curler (plastic tapered rounded end) isn&#x27;t quite big enough for your hand to rest comfortably/grip so you can easily burn yourself if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li>The spring/clip works fine, not too loose but not difficult to press, either.</li>
            <li>I had been buying Revlon styling wands but they do seem to fall apart pretty quickly with daily use.  </li>
            <li>Yes, the curling iron does get hot, quickly, and it could potentially curl your hair... if you don&#x27;t accidentally turn it off while rolling your hair, and if you don&#x27;t need to hold onto the tip, and if you don&#x27;t burn your fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It broke on my first curling iron in about a year, so I got a new one.  </li>
            <li>The off button is so sensitive and right where your hand goes to do your hair that you inadvertently turn it off.  </li>
            <li>There really weren&#x27;t too many other options out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is better than any other brand - heats fast, the controls are where they should be and don&#x27;t shut off every time you move your hand</li>
            <li>I thought it was very nice, was given as a gift for Secret Santa for Kids.</li>
            <li>For the price, this curling iron out performed other irons that cost 100 dollars or more.</li>
            <li>I like conair and have many other products</li>
            <li>So much better than the other curing irons I have had over the years.</li>
            <li>The other 3 were top brands</li>
            <li>It heats up rather quickly and has three heat settings but those are the only positive aspects I can think of.</li>
            <li>, I tore open the Amazon box, tossed the recyclables on top of the dryer (where they go for now) and plugged in my New Fancy Curling Iron, the Infiniti Professional Nano Tourmaline Ceramic Curling Iron, 1 and 1/2 inch baby....</li>
            <li>I have long (almost reaching my waist), fine hair, and this didn&#x27;t work at all for me.  </li>
            <li>I use the lowest setting on my long fine hair and the curl lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>However, so far the product has heated as hot as i wanted and has not broken.</li>
            <li>, I think they&#x27;re far enough up where I can use it easily without accidentally pressing them</li>
            <li>-- I am almost 50 years old and this is a FIRST ;</li>
            <li>The curling iron doesn&#x27;t clamp your hair tight enough to get a good curl.  </li>
            <li>Curling iron heats up in seconds and cools down faster than most.</li>
            <li>I must say, I&#x27;m glad I spent the money on this!!</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally completely straight and the most this curling iron did to my hair was make it lean a little to the side.</li>
            <li>brand new for a fraction of the price!  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product because I already had the flat iron and a smaller curling iron of the same series that I loved...</li>
            <li>When I do that, I find that I have to be careful as my hair gets easily snagged somewhere in the clamp.  </li>
            <li>Has multiple heat settings and heats up really quickly.  </li>
            <li>Decent curling iron for the money.</li>
            <li>Works better than more expensive curling irons I have had.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t heat up as well as my older model</li>
            <li>It heats extremely quickly &amp; my curls last til I wash my hair.</li>
            <li>This is a fairly decent curling iron for the price.</li>
            <li>But fairly decent iron.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the spring snaps rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>This curling iron heats up quickly and has several temperature settings.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this iron mainly because of the size.</li>
            <li>I bought this based on a blog review which considered the ratings on several different sites to determine the top 10 non-professional curling irons.</li>
            <li>It works nicely and gets hot in a few seconds would definitely recommended getting this!</li>
            <li>The feel of my hair is great no more looking and feeling dry &amp; burnt.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Gets super hot so be careful not to burn yourself, but just pay attention.</li>
            <li>It is a quality product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Saves my hair from high heat.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I have tried hot tools and many other high end brands, but Conair always impresses me, especially when you consider the price!</li>
            <li>Additionally, the newer models have improved power buttons which I agree with other reviewers that the iron so easily shuts off accidentally -</li>
            <li>My hair curls easily but this doesn&#x27;t seem to do much other than turn the ends.</li>
            <li>Really hard to believe until you see it with your own eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing bad about it :D</li>
            <li>I normally have.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hot barely.</li>
            <li>All its missing is a retractable cord. :-)</li>
            <li>so I can put my hot curling iron away withouth waiting for it to cool down.  </li>
            <li>I have super long, pretty thick hair &amp; this curling iron is fabulous!</li>
            <li>The only issue with that is that flat irons don&#x27;t always create the exact same curl, whereas curling irons provide a more even finish.</li>
            <li>When I first received it, it held easily onto my hair, even in small sections.  </li>
            <li>I turned it off several times without noticing right away.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product when i had super long hair.</li>
            <li>and my hair isn&#x27;t super long.</li>
            <li>I have the 1 1/4&amp;#34;, but needed 1 1/2&amp;#34; for my new style.  </li>
            <li>I need to buy a new one?  </li>
            <li>AND live in Texas...</li>
            <li>Yesterday I was doing my hair and it broke on the new curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Be prepared to buy a new one every 12-18 months or so.</li>
            <li>The heat may not be hot enough, I don&#x27;t know, but I sent it back for a refund, because it just doesn&#x27;t seem right that I tried all of these things AND tried it on two hair types, and nothing...</li>
            <li>My hair typically curls easily, but not with this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>section of hair and easily turned the ends into a two and a half roll coil.</li>
            <li>My hair curls fairly easy and this iron didn&#x27;t hold a curl long enough for me to use hair spray.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had lots of Conair products in the past and most all of them turn out to be sh!t.  </li>
            <li>and this gives me big pretty curls with lots of volume.</li>
            <li>First off this was not the same as advertised.</li>
            <li>It holds the curl for a while only when I use hairspray, but otherwise, it would fall flat, almost like I used a smooth iron in my hair, regardless, I always receive complimetns on my hair and o tell everyone it is the conair iron.</li>
            <li>Both of the other curling irons I own are by Conair and have never really had an issue with them.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
            <li>My onl con is that it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
            <li>The first lasted over ten years</li>
            <li>But, as it grows, I have the option to use a higher heat to accommodate the extra hair.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!</li>
            <li>This newest one seems exactly like my last one.</li>
            <li>find that my curls come out consistent even on the low heat setting.</li>
            <li>Second, the cool tip is too small: I burned myself several times before moving to a more one-handed approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Be aware that the tip for you to grasp is very small - burned fingertips do happen quite easily.  </li>
            <li>I have really long hair and needed a curling iron that was the right size to give me the curls I wanted.</li>
            <li>Mine is a few inches past my shoulders and it makes great wavy curls, since the iron is 1 1/2\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>For $20 i thought i was going to get a cheap curler that would probably not last long.</li>
            <li>It actually seems to straighten it more than curl, which is odd since I&#x27;ve used this size in the past with better curl results.      </li>
            <li>I have had this curling iron for a few years now, and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really get hot enough and it&#x27;s too big of a barrell.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that the barrel is short, however I wish the black tip was longer as I have slipped many times and burned my fingertips.</li>
            <li>Also, i was very careful from the get go not to use the tip of the barrel for full contact, just the tip of my fingers for support, no biggie.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s pretty sturdy and works really well.</li>
            <li>The iron that I received, does have a hard plastic tip, but it isn&#x27;t horribly large, so I did bump the actual iron with my fingers more than once.</li>
            <li>Heats up super quick and curls really well for my long and thick hair.</li>
            <li>, so my hair won&#x27;t be so straight it does smooth the hair and shines it a little overall</li>
            <li>but sometimes I am in a rush and forget-this this is a design issue that can be easily fixed and avoided.</li>
            <li>My hair is wild after washing.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a curling iron that was reasonably priced, yet would stand up to daily use.  </li>
            <li>it was way too sensitive.   </li>
            <li>They seem to hold curls very well, especially if you use the highest setting!  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy</li>
            <li>I should have replaced my old one sooner.</li>
            <li>It has worked grear so far.  </li>
            <li>Infiniti Professional Nano Tourmaline Ceramic Curling Iron, 1 1/2-Inch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the hair</li>
            <li>Both worked really well until recently.  </li>
            <li>version as well, but really wanted bigger, looser curls.</li>
            <li>i have naturally curly hair (can you say FRIZZZZ???)  </li>
            <li>I really like the different temperatures.</li>
            <li>barrel curler which creates much tighter curls but wanted a curler that created bigger volume/looser curls and this product does that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find that it rips out my hair near the spring mechanism.</li>
            <li>So far this unit is performing as described on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My hair looks like it&#x27;s been done professionally when I use this curling iron.</li>
            <li>but really was hoping for one that had lasting curls.</li>
            <li>This curling iron is going straight back to Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The control button is too sensitive too.  </li>
            <li>Arriving far quicker than I anticipated (Prime account?</li>
            <li>would recommend not to use with fresh washed hair, the curls do not last the same.</li>
            <li>Besides the poor design, the iron is not that effective as a styling tool.</li>
            <li>have EXTREMELY thick hair and found this curler to be only somewhat effective.</li>
            <li>it works as good as my old expensive one.</li>
            <li>This is too large to make decent curls, not what I expected from a hair curler.  </li>
            <li>: I think there are 3 heat settings so if you have fragile/delicate hair or harder to curl hair, you can choose the right setting for your curls.  </li>
            <li>My round flat iron makes better waves</li>
            <li>and I would much rather use this 1 1/2 inch rather than a flat iron.</li>
            <li>The black tip doesn&#x27;t get hot, but the ceramic gets hot enough to curl your hair in seconds with even heat throughout the barrel.  </li>
            <li>I had previously bough the Conair tapered curling wand, which I love, but wanted a second curling iron for bigger, looser curls.  </li>
            <li>I have used many curling irons, and never have had one with such a small area for holding on the end.  </li>
            <li>No half hour blow-dry sessions or rollers...priceless.</li>
            <li>then, i guess when we are putting an appliance of 300-400 degrees up to our head, if we use our hands on it to steady it, etc.... then, yes, we must expect that burns are an occasional possibility.  </li>
            <li>not only is it really short and gets hot on the tip</li>
            <li>I do not recommend it unless you want to use just the tips of your fingers on your alternate hand to steady it.  </li>
            <li>BUT BIG ENOUGH TO GET THE JOB DONE FAST!</li>
            <li>Bought this recently because I thought I had misplaced my old one that I bought about 7 years ago (still going strong).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good curling iron for a decent price for a long time because I always bought the really cheap ones that crap out after a month.  </li>
            <li>My hair is thick and very straight and even on the highest setting the curls fell right out.</li>
            <li>The handle is long and weighted so you shouldn&#x27;t have a hard time using it mainly with your prominent hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it only 3 stars because a couple of design flaws, which seemed pretty minor initially, have made it very aggravating over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The black piece over the handle is also very hot.</li>
            <li>Before I had to blow dry, flat iron THEN curl my hair, but with this curling iron I can skip the flat iron step and still get soft shiny frizz free hair.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE LONG STRAIGHT HAIR AND BOUGHT THIS TO MAKE SOME WAVES IN MY HAIR...</li>
            <li>/&gt;This does create nice curls, the only thing is I have found it very hard to use in terms of getting it to release your curls</li>
            <li>I must say I have lightly singed my fingers on the rod because the tip to hold it is a little too short like everyone has said.</li>
            <li>Most machines seem to only burn and not produce a hard curl</li>
            <li>AND my hair really does hold a curl long with this curling iron!</li>
            <li>well i just tried out  my new infiniti ceramic curling iron and cannot praise it enough.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use any hairspray so the curls fell out over the course of the day, but my hair just looked like it had been blown dry really well.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t send this back fast enough.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really seem that hot either, I am not sure if that is from it being a ceramic iron or not, but I did return this product.</li>
            <li>The temperatur button only gives a green light.  </li>
            <li>If you have hair length that requires more than one twist, you will likely turn this iron off accidentally at least once during your styling session.</li>
            <li>I usually buy Chi products, but this one is just as good, if not better.</li>
            <li>Then the curling iron doesn&#x27;t seem to turn back on unless it has had a chance to cool down.</li>
            <li>but it has a major design flaw.  </li>
            <li>Does not heat up well and stay hot, nor holds my hair in the clip to the end, as I pull the hair down to curl at the ends, the clip is not tight to the barrel and slips out.</li>
            <li>But seriously, this iron is durable and so easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>This iron is so much easier to use, and it really feels like it&#x27;s smoothing your hair, not gripping or pulling.  </li>
            <li>Heats up fast and does make a long lasting curl!</li>
            <li>Only thing I wish is that it notified you when it had heated up, but it really doesn&#x27;t take long</li>
            <li>End cap is too short and my fingers get burned frequently.</li>
            <li>I have hair that is wavy and coarse on my crown and soft waves underneath</li>
            <li>and it always causes this smell of nearly burnt hair, but my hair isn&#x27;t actually burnt.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe it was just my hair, but it happens with my 9 and my 12 year old, who use different shampoos and no products.</li>
            <li>and it always causes this smell of nearly burnt hair, but my hair isn&#x27;t actually burnt.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe it was just my hair, but it happens with my 9 and my 12 year old, who use different shampoos and no products.</li>
            <li>Whoever came up with that idea at Conair apparently hasn&#x27;t tried using this.</li>
            <li>I went back to my old one.</li>
            <li>my efforts to package it up and mail back my old unit and go without a curling iron for a couple weeks just to save $5.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t had constant use, but it has lasted quite a while so far.</li>
            <li>I have obstinate hair and with a combo of Matrix Biolage Deep Smoothing Shampoo and Conditioner plus curling my hair with the Infiniti Professional Nano Tourmaline Ceramic Curling Iron, 1 1/2-Inch</li>
            <li>And last but certainly not least, the CURLS DID NOT LAST!!  </li>
            <li>and i have touched the iron instead of the cool tip on several occations, but as long as you are careful and pay attention to what you are doing this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem with you.</li>
            <li>It took me twice as long to curl my hair with this iron than it normally does</li>
            <li>Love it for long, thick hair.</li>
            <li>I end up with some loose waves, and eventually pretty flat hair.  </li>
            <li>IT&#x27;s super helpful to have an iron that can go up to 400 degrees, especially because I have Asian, thick, straight hair that needs a lot of heat to keep a curl.</li>
            <li>Now granted that could be due to my curling technique or my large hands...</li>
            <li>I was forced into quickly buying a curling iron because mine unexpectedly broke.  </li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t purchased a new curling iron in a long time.</li>
            <li>My previous curling iron was HOT</li>
            <li>I previously bought a Hot Tools curling iron (for $60) with a 1 1/4&amp;#34; barrel.</li>
            <li>It seemed the other ones with similar features were considerably higher cost</li>
            <li>Other than that, I like that it heats up fast, reduces the frizz, and makes my hair shine.</li>
            <li>The clamp holds the hair pretty tight without creasing.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and falling out a little due to medications.</li>
            <li>I spent so much money on another brand that does the same thing</li>
            <li>I have had a lot of drugstore level hot tools and this was one of the more expensive and the most disappointing.</li>
            <li>so, yes... the other iron i had for over 25 years had a large enough end piece that when i used it to move the styler or hold it while doing the curling, there was no burning.  </li>
            <li>Ordered this because my other large curling iron finally broke beyond repair (I was holding it together with rubber bands and duct tape ;</li>
            <li>I have very long (waist length, fine hair) and my curls are usually gone my mid morning</li>
            <li>Works great, I&#x27;m just disappointed because my hair never can keep a curl.</li>
            <li>According to the chart, I should use a middle setting - which barely curled my hair.  </li>
            <li>I did not want to buy it, but after visiting three nearby stores, it became apparent that this was the only 1.5\\&quot; curling iron that I could have if I wanted it that day (which I did).  </li>
            <li>, Im not sure if this of a fault to the product, seeing as Ive never had any success with curling irons.</li>
            <li>It really cuts down the amount of time it takes to style your hair when you don&#x27;t have to compensate for working around a faulty clamp.</li>
            <li>Granted I live in a US territory, so I am limited to what will be shipped here, but how co you go from shipping to me and no longer a week later?</li>
            <li>I actually purchased this at a major beauty chain for a lower price, but it&#x27;s going back this weekend.  </li>
            <li>It gets MUCH hotter than other curlers I&#x27;ve used and the \\&quot;safety\\&quot; end where you hold it isn&#x27;t really big enough.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You know how the skinny ends of your hair you usually have to use your fingers to wrap the hair around because it will slide right through?</li>
            <li>It is a marvel at how quickly it manages to curl my ultra thick hair and make it look well groomed and styled.  </li>
            <li>The tip is not long enough.  </li>
            <li>I would say my one and only complaint is that the cool touch tip isn&#x27;t very big.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot and curls my thick hair in about 15-20 seconds.</li>
            <li>and I have below waist length, super thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li>Due to the size of this curling iron, this does not curl well for long straight hair.</li>
            <li>One negative that other reviewers have mentioned: it is too easy to hit the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; button.</li>

            <li> so it&#x27;s a win for both of us.</li>

            <li> Worked great until my cat chewed the cord a month after I bought it.....</li>
            <li> but i am really happy with the product.</li>

            <li> Good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> Good quality product.</li>
            <li> just wave your hand over it and if this baby is radiating heat, I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s when you&#x27;re good to start?&lt;br</li>
            <li> great curling iron, nice medium curls</li>
            <li> After reading reviews &amp; checking out sites like Good Housekeeping &amp; others</li>

            <li> I bought it for my wife and it is good product.</li>
            <li> Wife loved it..</li>
            <li> Still, good compromise between price and quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It curls my hair really good.</li>
            <li> But the size is good</li>

            <li> Love that this doesn&#x27;t burn my hair!</li>
            <li> Love this inexpensive curling iron!</li>

            <li> I am really glad i purchased this !</li>
            <li> Love it!)</li>
            <li> Great heat up very quickly</li>
            <li> Great value for the cheap cost.</li>
            <li> The swivel cord is a great feature and my hair is curled and smooth every time.</li>
            <li> This curl iron is amazing, it curls so well without hairspray.  </li>
            <li> That is a good thing, yes? :-)</li>
            <li> It gives me lots of body and the 4 settings are nice.</li>
            <li> I like the 1 inch barrel as it gives a nice amount of curl/wave.  </li>
            <li> Good just need more practice on it</li>
            <li> The curling iron makes nice curls.  </li>
            <li> The highest works nice.  </li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> Also, nice plastic cover for travel is included.</li>
            <li> It was a nice day out as well-</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s my own fault for not picking a hotter product.</li>
            <li> You may just need to really turn the heat up to get the best waves.</li>
            <li> Neither of us liked ours.  </li>
            <li> It shipped on time, gives the perfect sized curls, heats fast</li>
            <li> It is really good for hairstyling but just make sure you use hair spray</li>
            <li> The best was very pricey</li>
            <li> Nice to have the protective cover too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan to be honest.</li>
            <li> Bought one for my mom and she liked it.</li>
            <li> The heat control is easy and perfect and the iron heats QUICKLY</li>
            <li> Works great on my hair and the price is just right!</li>
            <li> Beautiful and useful.</li>
            <li> This 1-1/2&amp;#34; ceramic tourmaline curling iron is perfect for large waves and heats evenly without burning my hair, leaving more split ends.</li>
            <li> Loved the ability to change temperature easily.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s very easy to press by accident.</li>
            <li> The clamp on it is very strong but it doesn&#x27;t snag hairs.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron, I can&#x27;t love without it!</li>
            <li> It might not be ideal for shorter hair because the barrel is so large.</li>
            <li> It heats very fast and makes beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> Overall though, it makes my hair (fine, medium length, curly/wavy) hair look great, at a great price!</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best curling iron I have ever owned and I have owned a zillion of them.  </li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is the greatest curling iron in the universe!  </li>
            <li> It is soooo handy I love it</li>
            <li> My hair looks good using this iron - smooth and not frizzy.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;by far the best.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Exactly as show.works great no hassles no issues.only thing i can say</li>
            <li> Really does a beautiful job on all hair types.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> this one is easy to handle, it has good temperature settings and makes the process very quick and satisfying.</li>
            <li> Great product -- my mistake was getting one too large.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite sure that this curling iron does not.</li>
            <li> Love &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> is make sure</li>
            <li> you know what size to get since my wife wasnt so sure</li>
            <li> You will LOVE &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I love how this curling iron eliminates alot of the frizz</li>
            <li> There are more cons than pros with this curling iron.    </li>
            <li> I love the plastic cover that comes with it so that the iron is protected from scratches.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I am returning it soon and hoping to find a better curling product.</li>

            <li> I decided to buy this curling iron because I have the Infiniti You Curl and love it -</li>
            <li> Love love love it.</li>
            <li> I used to turn it off a lot without realizing it, but I have adjusted to the location and make sure to mind the button.</li>
            <li> so I avoid touching it all together.</li>
            <li> , you will not be able to help getting your hair caught in them at some point.</li>
            <li> The hair that wraps towards the top gets stuck once out of every 3-4 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This seems like a quality iron, and I love the fact that it has an automatic shut off function.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron.</li>
            <li> after drying- seems like no matter what I do, I cannot get the curls to stay in my hair for more than 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> i wish it curled more and stayed</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, works great.</li>
            <li> i just love how the curling iron works with my hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products that did not work.  </li>
            <li> I love my curling iron</li>
            <li> and I love the way it grips my hair.  </li>
            <li> I like this curling iron specifically because it doesn&#x27;t have a collapse able rest.  </li>
            <li> I love this iron...</li>
            <li> I cannot count how many times it has been dropped and all the functions still work as they did the day I bought it for her.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m ok with that...</li>
            <li> to have more of a curl impact on longer hair.  </li>
            <li> i would not have guessed that Conair would have made such a successful one, but guess what???!!!  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Also love the sleeve.  </li>
            <li> hopefully a bit more durable -</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron.</li>
            <li> Works great and heats up fast.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this curling iron.</li>
            <li> I already had one with a smaller barrel by Conair but this size is perfect for looser waves.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron.</li>
            <li> I love the heat shield.  </li>
            <li> I have many hair curling tools</li>
            <li> Does her hair alot more as well now</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I love it :)</li>
            <li> I love this and specifically looked for a curler that came with this because I wanted to be sure I could store the curler away immediately when I was finished with</li>
            <li> and/or make this part non-tapered to give it more circumference</li>
            <li> Definitely practice holding the curler before turning in on to see how best to grip it</li>
            <li> I was looking for a thicker curling iron for big curls and this one is perfect.</li>
            <li> It seems to heat up okay, but doesn&#x27;t work well with my hair, for some reason.  </li>
            <li> My favorite curling iron.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this ceramic curling iron.</li>
            <li> Love the carrying case to protect it when traveling and need to throw it in your suitcase.</li>
            <li> And I like the many temperature options.</li>
            <li> but i am so in love with the volume</li>
            <li> This one performed a wee bit better, but it still had a tendency to not grip my hair, so my hair would fall out before I finished curling the length of my hair around it.  </li>
            <li> I mostly use it to curl the ends of my hair and it leaves my split ends looking shiny and styled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> you end up curling it many many times for just one strip of hair</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron...  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love Infiniti products.</li>
            <li> I AM GLAD</li>
            <li> I probably need more practice</li>
            <li> Who ever designed this needs to watch how women curl their hair and realize that tip needs to have way more protection.  </li>
            <li> I love this curling iron.</li>
            <li> I love this curler.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love this curling iron.</li>
            <li> (in case you thought you&#x27;d grip the tip to avoid gripping the handle, thereby turning the iron off while curling.).  </li>
            <li> that only had an on/off switch, but this curling iron is awesome!  </li>
            <li> I also bought the smaller 1&#x27; that also works just as great!</li>
            <li> I would just throw mine away, but I paid more (retail) than they charge here for it.</li>
            <li> Great purchase, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed- heats fast, easy to handle and a great price</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re willing to overlook that, you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> so there is a good chance you will miss the plastic and touch the hot iron when styling.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good curling iron.</li>
            <li> The best curling iron I have purchased in a long time.</li>
            <li> This curling iron has the perfect barrel size for my long hair.  </li>
            <li> It heats almost instantly too, it is just amazing!!</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly &amp; curls  nicely.</li>
            <li> The variable temperature is super nice as well as the on/off switch.  </li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, doesn&#x27;t burn hair and provides a nice curl.</li>
            <li> it not only curls your hair perfectly with staying power, but also managed to straighten and smooth my hair simultaneously and twice</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for someone with limited use of hands.</li>
            <li> maybe it will work even better for those whose hair curls better and it gets hot nicely</li>
            <li> I liked it very much!</li>
            <li> perfect size for loose curls.</li>
            <li> love that it heats up quickly and covers a lot of surface area of my hair, gets hair done faster!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s nicely made, get&#x27;s really hot, and I like the swivel cord!</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, leaves my hair looking fabulous and if you forget and leave it on, it shuts off on its own!</li>
            <li> I have easy to curl, fine, smooth hair and this didn&#x27;t curl my hair at all!</li>
            <li> It has auto shut off which I liked better than the Hot Tools iron, I would be paranoid at work all day</li>
            <li> When my old Infiniti curling iron died, I was happy to find this updated version.  </li>
            <li> Great natural looking curl</li>
            <li> This has great reviews which is so ironic because I do not find any to be true.</li>
            <li> This curling iron seems to work fairly well, though I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.</li>
            <li> I skipped another iron I wanted to buy because this one was cheaper, but it&#x27;s true, you get what you pay for, and I still end up out $20!</li>
            <li> Used this curling iron for the first time yesterday and I have to say that I love it!  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it is great!</li>
            <li> This little gem performs wonderful and gives you top heat in 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> It can easily be shut off while   using it</li>
            <li> Easy to use and gets job done well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to pick up even with my arthritis, curls like a dream.  </li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s easy to turn it off accidentally when your curling your hair because of the on off switch.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to burn your fingers.</li>
            <li> Its easy to use</li>
            <li> Heats quickly, easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly....</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> I think it gets the job done and heats up very quickly.  </li>
            <li> and I was looking for an easy to use ceramic curler.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to burn your fingers with this iron</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit easy to get burned.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the cheap cost take away from the fact that it gives the best curls with minimal frizz</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to make big fat curls or nice beachy waves, this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> And it gets nice and hot</li>
            <li> I own THREE Hot Tools curling irons (two gold-plated ones and one ceramic) and ended up purchasing this one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To be honest, I prefer this one over Hot tools.  </li>
            <li> I really liked it at first</li>
            <li> iron.&lt;br /&gt;The barrel gets nice and hot; my hair does not get pulled at any part of the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Super awesome for long hair, leaves my hair Volumous and curly!</li>
            <li> Heats quickly, gets very hot, curls nicely - it does everything it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> I use this pretty much every day and it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> The reason is, the Hot Tools curling irons work awesome when there&#x27;s low humidity.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many hair styling tools and my hair holds pretty well, and the Conair Infiniti Pro 1.5 inch barrel was the most ineffective tool I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> which is fine if I lose the receipt, because the warranty is 5 years on the newer models.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and wavy</li>
            <li> Makes beautiful, smooth, big curls.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and the heat settings</li>
            <li> it was going to work fine</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S JUST FINE FOR ME.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly!</li>
            <li> And super love the plastic protector it comes with</li>
            <li> but i also love the shine this iron gives to hair and the quick results.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE temperature control; I have very fine straight hair</li>
            <li> Fit and finish is great and heats pretty fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this so far!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I absolute love this curling iron!</li>
            <li> The cord could be longer, but with some precise extension cord placement, it&#x27;s just fine.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, nice large curls.</li>
            <li> and it is a great and cheap investment that will last for manyyyyyy years!</li>
            <li> does a great job of creating big, smooth waves on my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> they are quite an indispensable tool.</li>
            <li> plus it is light weight.</li>
            <li> so I just wanted to replace and still have the same great results.</li>
            <li> Works great on the second highest temp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great size for big curls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all for anything that makes my wife happy, and this definitely does.</li>
            <li> The automatic shut off is a great feature to have especially if you are like me &amp; walk away forgetting to shut it off.</li>
            <li> and I am so happy that I finally found it!</li>
            <li> It also heats really fast, which is nice...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t enjoy &amp;#34;getting ready&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> great big curls!</li>
            <li> Really is a great product it actually adds shine to my curls without me adding any oils</li>
            <li> I have a smaller version of this curling iron and it works great.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and liked that users were saying that it smoothed their hair and stopped frizz even though I did not hold out much hope in that arena for myself.  </li>
            <li> No frizz -- no fly-aways - my hair stays smooth and straightened in between shampoos</li>
            <li> Before putting heat on my hair I use heat protecting spray which also helps my hair look smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> so i liked that um i cant really complain it gets the job done too</li>
            <li> Great as a back up</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because it does leave my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> Light, east to use, adjustable temperature.</li>
            <li> Great iron for the price; multiple settings.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for everyday curls</li>
            <li> With some hair product and effort it does a fabulous job.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much</li>
            <li> As far as curling irons go this is certainly a good one.   </li>
            <li> It is possible I have a defective one since so many others found it a good item.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for the perfect curling iron to create those pretty beachy waves on my long hair</li>
            <li> So far, this seems to be a good curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Loved my old one,</li>
            <li> Good so far for the $$$.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t curl my own hair for shit lol...</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic curling iron, it heats up quickly and does glide easily over your hair.</li>
            <li> I love how hot these curling irons get and how quickly they heat up!</li>
            <li> There is many setting on how hot you want your curl iron which is amazing because sometime you want gentle heat on your hair.  </li>
            <li> It was super easy to return and super easy to order the correct size.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
            <li> The swivle cord is super easy to deal with</li>
            <li> It has become a chore that I just want to be quick and easy</li>
            <li> it is super easy to use and set the temperature.  </li>
            <li> The material composition appears to be consistent and not coated, which is better for the hair and does not burn the ends like the cheap coated irons.</li>
            <li> The barrel seems to be smooth and offers a nice curl when used on fine to semi-thick hair.</li>
            <li> It seems to heat up quick and definitely does a great job.</li>
            <li> so I was excited</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many Conair curling irons over the years and this is the first one that didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> First off the top piece is not heat resistent</li>
            <li> The 1.5 inch is perfect for a \\&quot;full\\&quot; affect without looking too \\&quot;prom\\&quot; curly hair, or you can use it to make quick waves for a more subtle affect.    </li>
            <li> While in use, it will turn off because the on/off button is exactly where most women would place their fingers while curling their hair.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> This thing gets real hot, yow yow!&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;- love the 1.5 inch size, big lovely sexy</li>
            <li> hair seems to handle the heat pretty well and seem more shiny after curling.</li>
            <li> The long cord is great too.</li>
            <li> i love the big sexy curls and bounce it gives my hair!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this because I&#x27;d always used a wand</li>
            <li> i used to have a hot tools one and this one works better.</li>
            <li> I bought a better brand with a higher heat as I have a lot on hair.</li>
            <li> I love that there is a cover for the curling iron, so you can cover it up and put it away while it&#x27;s hot and not have to worry about my son getting burned.  </li>
            <li> I burned my fingers so many times with the first use that I will never use it again.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite hot tools.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this one thus far.</li>
            <li> Worked for about a month, then only heated to barely warm!</li>
            <li> Really like being able to control temp setting for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It heats up to 400 F pretty quickly and the surface of the barrel is very smooth.</li>
            <li> considering that it is such a great tool, it is way worth it.</li>
            <li> I actually have the 2\\&quot; and it is by far the best curiling iron I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple curling irons and so far this is the best one.</li>
            <li> it is far better than i could have hoped!</li>
            <li> I did notice a smoothing effect which I liked a lot because I have fly aways and frizzy hair all year long with my naturally wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My little sister loves it, it&#x27;s real handy and readily accessible.</li>
            <li> I just bought a new one and am just as happy with my new curling iron.</li>
            <li> This is a rather large barrel hair curler, so it doesn&#x27;t truly curl your hair, it more adds wave and some curls at the ends of the hair (ends up looking like when my hair dresser blow dries it, vs when I do</li>
            <li> This curling iron gives me just the right lift and it tames my frizzy waves!</li>
            <li> Plus shipping was right on time!</li>
            <li> The plastic end isn&#x27;t very large and is easy to miss when you are rolling hair with two hands.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended because good quality for reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that requires high heat to curl.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind a burnt scalp and fingers, and the fact that it will turn off several times as you bump the on/off switch while curling your hair, it will produce good curls.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a shame because otherwise, I love this iron.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really curl my hair correctly, the sections I curled came out looking more like spirals without a lot of body.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product for people with short hair maybe at shoulder length.</li>
            <li> Prepare for gorgeous big waves</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron, so much so that I have it in the 1&amp;#34; and 1.5&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> So, this Conair Infiniti Pro is a dream come true.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 brands before I remembered the name Conair from years back as being good</li>
            <li> IF YOU WANT BOUNCY FULL CURLS</li>
            <li> So far it seems pretty good.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> The heat guard/stand that came with the curling iron keeps the hot iron off the counter during after use cool down...brilliant!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair smooth with just the right amount of body.</li>
            <li> the price was right and it was available through Amazon Prime.  </li>
            <li> It gets hot very quick.</li>
            <li> Other than that it is a great curling iron.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use -- the hinge opens with the perfect amount of resistance and it holds the hair just tight enough to make the perfect curl, while not providing too much excessive heat which could be damaging.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> This curling iron heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and does the job well.</li>
            <li> On the hottest scale, it give plenty of heat to curl quickly.  </li>
            <li> It arrived so quickly and I just adore it.</li>
            <li> Works great on my long hair, exactly as advertised .</li>
            <li> I quickly read some online reviews, then went to Target, who had it on sale.</li>
            <li> Heats quickly</li>
            <li> Works great!&lt;br /&gt;It heats up really quick.</li>
            <li> and I was lucky get it on time.</li>
            <li> I had the same one from many many years ago</li>
            <li> This heats up quickly, the cord doesn&#x27;t twist and the cover lets me put it away immediately after use.  </li>
            <li> Quick and efficient.  </li>
            <li> sure enough, I was able to get it here</li>
            <li> But it heats quickly and works well.</li>
            <li> So, I am amazed by this product - it works quickly</li>
            <li> Just quickly glide the straightener to relax the curls.  </li>
            <li> Heats up quickly</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li> I like that these heat up so quickly.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, but hair always gets caught in the screw hinge.</li>
            <li> This iron heats up quickly and evenly and curls well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These heat up quickly and do the job.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny and healthy looking, it has an auto shut off in case you forget to unplug it before you leave, and the settings are simple and just what I love about this.  </li>
            <li> This curling iron gets very hot, I can curl my hair quickly in the morning.</li>
            <li> My 1 inch from con air works amazing, but this barely did anything.</li>
            <li> My hair just slips off the barrel after releasing the clip and it is barely even warm when I touch it.</li>
            <li> A lot of settings for heat and can get very hot.  </li>
            <li> I THINK THIS WOULD BE A GOOD ITEM FOR SOMEONE WITH LONG CURLY HAIR</li>
            <li> I barely put any hairspray on and my curls were awesome loose curls.</li>
            <li> VERY high quality and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Great for straightening look with a slight wave.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a sleeve so you can put it away without having to let it cool off completely and the &amp;#34;kick stand&amp;#34; keeps the iron from touching your counter</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to inadvertently hit the button that changes the temperature setting, resulting in a much hotter iron than intended.</li>
            <li> I brought lots of similar product and this is my favorite one!</li>
            <li> Gets really hot and get&#x27;s the job done!</li>
            <li> IF IT BREAKS, BUT IM NOT MAD</li>
            <li> A 1.5&amp;#34; barrel works great on my thick, layered hair and this size isn&#x27;t easy to find.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The comment about the on/off switch being too easily depressed during normal curling - TRUE.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair that would be fried much beyong the minimum setting.</li>
            <li> I also have on the hottest setting, but it barely curls my hair, and my hair is very easy to style.  </li>
            <li> The on/ off switch is super sensitive and placed right where your hand needs to go in order to hold the iron safely.</li>
            <li> and yes, i have experienced that burning thing with this iron on my fingertips a few</li>
            <li> It is gentle on the hair and makes it so smooth and shiney.</li>
            <li> I love that it is tourmaline because it makes my hair SOO soft.</li>
            <li> Nice big barrel.</li>
            <li> Also, the \\&quot;cool tip\\&quot; still gets a bit hot.  </li>
            <li> Loved so much, through out my travel iron and bought a second one of these!</li>
            <li> now, if you have longer hair, you can&#x27;t expect nice curls from the big barrel irons...</li>
            <li> I had been buying professional curling irons for my wife and she said this works better.</li>
            <li> Now I have to decide if it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> Nice big curls!</li>
            <li> The comment about the tip being too hot - TRUE</li>
            <li> Again, maybe this curling iron is so exciting to me because I haven&#x27;t bought one in 15 years, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  </li>
            <li> The only fault is my own.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is very easy to use and gives quick and lasting results.  </li>
            <li> Gets hot very quick and love the big barrel curls -</li>
            <li> oh and i did accidentally turn off the button once or twice, but you get the hang of it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and has a convenient cover to put away hot.  </li>
            <li> Quick heat up, neat control panel, no accidental bumping of switches, and a hot, three tempurature choice.</li>
            <li> The little plastic sleeve to put on there while it&#x27;s still hot and is cooling is great.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great iron, which is why I&#x27;m replacing my old one with the exact same one.</li>
            <li> On/off switch is in a good place and isn&#x27;t accidentally turned off while using (unlike other models).</li>
            <li> Shut off switch is right where your hand is</li>
            <li> There was a funky smell that emanated from it right out of the box like burned electrical or something, but I still plugged it in to use anyway, and when the smell was still dominant, I decided to put it away, and that&#x27;s when I noticed no barrel cover and found it was pre-owned or a customer return.   </li>
            <li> The on/off switch is located right on the handle where you are turning and twisting to curl</li>
            <li> This gets the job done and was the right price.</li>
            <li> My hair would even smell scorched right away, but still no change.  </li>
            <li> The right product at the right time.</li>
            <li> but this doesn&#x27;t seem right to me</li>
            <li> you see it happen right away.</li>
            <li> I was right.  </li>
            <li> But, the finish on it makes your hair slide right out when you lift the handle.  </li>
            <li> it is a dome shape and ribbed so that your fingers slide right off the end.  </li>
            <li> As far as being user friendly, it heats up very fast, (man it is caplable of getting very hot!).</li>
            <li> Hair stays smooth, even in high humidity.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic curling iron with a high setting.</li>
            <li> It also doesnt hold a curl very long (even my Revlon $20 curling iron works a lot better over this one)!</li>
            <li> It could not be more relieved this has turned out to be even better than my previous one.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s in fine working condition and still looks brand new.</li>
            <li> The curling part works great, but as others have noted, the end is too small</li>
            <li> Bonus, it is so smooth it doesn&#x27;t pull my damaged ends and puts a sleek finish on my normally curly, and sometimes, out of control hair.</li>
            <li> I can use it to put beautiful, thick curls in or straighten my hair into a shiny, sleek, bone-straight style.  </li>
            <li> This is good, works better than my big barrel Conair models (which don&#x27;t hold curls as long AND break every couple of months due to a flawed cord) but this is not as good as the slimmer barrel Infiniti which I got first and was very impressed by.</li>
            <li> I have super curly hair and my expectation was to have large defined curls.</li>
            <li> The clamp is strong enought to hold my long hair in the iron but not so strong that you get a kink in the hair under the clamp.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m able to put it back in my gym bag without worrying about it being too hot!</li>
            <li> well, when ceramic straighteners came available on the market at a reasonable price a few years ago i was like hallelujah, it worked pretty good</li>
            <li> After much abuse by me, my original Infinity curling iron broke and was glad I could replace it with the same product.</li>
            <li> It gets hot right away and works well.</li>
            <li> Then your fingers will slide right onto the 400 degree hot curling surface.  </li>
            <li> I have really straight heavy hair that never curls and this worked great.</li>
            <li> but like how quickly it heats up and it ready to go.</li>
            <li> I get nice big curls and heats up fast.</li>
            <li> This iron works well, heats up fast and leaves nice big curls in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I definitely don&#x27;t recommend using that highest temperature on a daily basis (and don&#x27;t even think about using it on damp hair!), but it&#x27;s great when you need it.</li>
            <li> In fact, I probably won&#x27;t own a single Conair product after this one goes in the trash.</li>
            <li> In fact, I probably won&#x27;t own a single Conair product after this one goes in the trash.</li>
            <li> This iron does heat up fast and gets very hot.</li>
            <li> It gets very hot and very evenly.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THIS CURLING IRON, IT GIVES  NICE LOOSE CURLS IN MY HAIR.</li>
            <li> It gets hot super fast.  </li>
            <li> It has 4 temperature choices and all heat up very fast, within a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> This iron heats very fast &amp; works well.</li>
            <li> Turns off when not used for a while, which is a very important feature for us, since we are constantly forgetting to turn curling irons</li>
            <li> It heats up very fast.</li>
            <li> I have very straight hair and someone told me to look for tourmaline.  </li>
            <li> This curling iron heats very fast, has variable temperature settings, and automatic shut-off.  </li>
            <li> This little guy is good quality and do its job.</li>
            <li> comes with a heat protector and love the multiple settings.</li>
            <li> The barrel is nice and wide</li>
            <li> I tried freshly washed hair, I tried day after hair, it didn&#x27;t make much difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be trying the Hot Tools 24k gold iron instead.</li>
            <li> I have this curler , my mother had it first</li>
            <li> The on/off and temperature buttons are so sensitive that with just a light touch the unit either turns off or changes the setting.</li>
            <li> - The end tip is too hot to hold.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Wish I had more of an opinion on it, but after about 2 weeks and a handful of uses, it doesn&#x27;t want to stay on, and if it does, it&#x27;s only a minute at a time.  </li>
            <li> Item exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well made!</li>
            <li> I had no problems with pressing the buttons while using the iron, and the piece in the middle that allows the iron to rest on the counter is better than most--very stable,</li>
            <li> Even when I hold the clamp all the way open and only use the barrel to curl, the hair that slides more than halfway up the barrel ends up getting lines on it just from touching the clamp.</li>
            <li> And when I use it as intended, with the clamp holding the outside of the curl, lines appear at the top of the curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i am not a fake reviewer hired by the company.</li>
            <li> Other than that.... Love it!</li>
            <li> so it is why I ordered a 1 1/2 inch size in the first place.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s working well for me considering first time curling my hair by myself..and</li>
            <li> This was a replacement to the first one that I owned for 8+ years.  </li>
            <li> I really like this curling iron!  </li>
            <li> The 1 1/2 inch size is great too, especially for those with long hair.  </li>
            <li> First thing I did</li>
            <li> PLus my hair slides so gently around it that it never snags and doesn&#x27;t pull out any of my hair!</li>
            <li> Remains consistently hot</li>
            <li> I love how you can set this to different temps, making it pretty versatile and will suit your needs.</li>
            <li> It works well and gives my hair and pretty, wavy curl.  </li>
            <li> and I love that it has multiple settings.</li>
            <li> I love the simple &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34; as the movable wire ones get in the way.  </li>
            <li> i do have long hair but tried this on my sisters short hair and worked great</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> With a variety of heat settings, I can get exactly the look I&#x27;m wanting without any hassle whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Works well for storing a hot iron when travelling.</li>
            <li> Well, overall, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I do like the sleeve that fits over a hot iron after you have finished so that you may pack it in your luggage and not have to wait until it cools.</li>
            <li> My last iron did much better at the curls.</li>
            <li> The tip gets extremely hot.  </li>
            <li> My first one just quit working.</li>
            <li> It gets so hot it&#x27;sridiculous.  </li>
            <li> She said it gave her the results she was hoping for within the first day of using</li>
            <li> Best one I have ever bought, and I have bought some expensive ones before.</li>
            <li> Does a great job with my thick hair.</li>
            <li> The lowest setting gets pretty hot.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for and performs beyond expectation.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Love that you can actually set the heat by temperature instead of low/med/hot.</li>
            <li> because I use it a lot of times when my hair is straight!</li>
            <li> And I do make sure the clamp is raised enough off the barrel that the hair should have plenty of space.  </li>
            <li> I returned this after the first use.</li>
            <li> My hair just glides through the iron and ends up looking soft and frizz free.  </li>
            <li> so it is really easy to initially rest your index finger on the safety rest and when you go to turn the curling iron in an attempt to wind your hair around the barrel, your finger automatically moves from the safety rest to the PIPING HOT IRON!.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and makes nice curls in little time.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this item from the seller Ace Photo Digital with free super saving shipping, arrived in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> Heats up super fast but doesn&#x27;t seem to hold curls very well.  </li>
            <li> No matter how skinny the ends of my hair were or how skinny a section of hair I did, the curling iron gripped the hair right to the very end</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that this iron doesn&#x27;t make loose curls, it seems like it just curls the ends of my hair, but still works great regardless.</li>
            <li> It seems to work better for me as a flat iron.</li>
            <li> It is a decent curling iron; it gets pretty hot but not as hot as my straightener.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, my hair tends to look dry on the ends, and this iron some how made the ends look MUCH better than they really do!  </li>
            <li> Works ok but the tip is too small and you can burn your fingers easily.</li>
            <li> Not bad if you have very thick or long hair though, the barrel works great!</li>
            <li> The iron gets hot fast and does its job.  </li>
            <li> It heats up fast and stays hot.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done what I could to mitigate the damage, but this morning, it happened again, so I&#x27;m pretty much done dealing with this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a seamless transition from the iron to the top plastic piece.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad it has lasted as long as it has.</li>
            <li> WOW it is true</li>
            <li> I have super thick/frizzy hair and it usually takes forever to curl it into submission - this is one of the best irons I&#x27;ve ever had, it heats up fast and cools down fast.</li>
            <li> I thought it was just an issue with the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; light until I went on line to check out the instructions and found another review with exactly the same issue.  </li>
            <li> where your hold you hand, so unless you make an effort not to hit the buttons, it is easy to constantly be turing it off and adjusting the temp when you dont want to!  </li>
            <li> It will give u a nice wavy hair for less than 10 mins..</li>
            <li> The price on this iron is very realistic and it exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> It smoothes out my natural curls quickly for an alternative look.</li>
            <li> Best I have had and I have thick hair that is really long.  </li>
            <li> Good for long lasting, wavy curls.</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron thinking it would create large curls and added volume.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it is just my hair, or I guess I underestimated how large the barrel would be, but the 1 1/2 inch did not do anything.</li>
            <li> I use the highest and hottest setting of 400 degrees on below shoulder-length hair to achieve large waves.</li>
            <li> I love the loose, voluminous curls and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty easy to please with these kinds of things, as long as they don&#x27;t break.  </li>
            <li> I like more strength in the blow power, but it seems to dry efficiently anyways!</li>
            <li> It also has a low setting for fine hair.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, but you&#x27;d better remember to use the tiny buttons above the power button to set the temp!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t get it to do it very easily which nearly ruins them.</li>
            <li> The end does get a little warm</li>
            <li> Having multiple heat settings is great, as is the little protective case.</li>
            <li> it heats up quick, and doesn&#x27;t snag on your hair like other cheap ones.  </li>
            <li> The top is very small and there is no place to hold the tip, and you can easily burn your fingers.</li>
            <li> I have VERY curly hair and no matter how I straighten or smooth it -- it ends up being frizzy and trying to curl up on me -- just doing the dishes or walking outside if the air has any humidity at all</li>
            <li> However, as someone else mentioned, be VERY CAUTIOUS about holding the end, or you will be burned, as I was.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Heated up fast, curls were shiny &amp; bouncy.</li>
            <li> Gentle heat and didn&#x27;t singe my hair, but it didn&#x27;t hold the curl either.</li>
            <li> However the iron does heat up fast.</li>
            <li> My daughter is very please with this.</li>
            <li> Smooths my hair without putting too much curl in it.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair smooth and my curls do last all day.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and works well.</li>
            <li> is fast as my ceramic straightener.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> , that I now really wish I&#x27;d seen BEFORE purchasing this iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It heats up fast, but she doens&#x27;t like how the power button is a button and not, say, a switch, or perhaps move the power button, as she accidentally turns it off sometimes.  </li>
            <li> it really &amp;#34;grabs&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> If I curl it, I have to let it go and hold it with my hand for it to really stay.</li>
            <li> It heats up really well</li>
            <li> so I thought I didn&#x27;&#x27;t have much to lose with this one &amp; I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It also heats up really fast in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I really like this curling iron.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I rarely take the time to write reveiws but was going thru some old purchases and wanted to voice my opinion.  </li>
            <li> my medium think hair very well...</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It works really well .</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> My hair requires the highest heat setting to really keep a curl.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Conair should really extend the length</li>
            <li> : I can&#x27;t really tell if this &amp;#34;technology&amp;#34; has an effect but the curler curls and doesn&#x27;t seem to over fry my hair.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> For $40-50, you can&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li> I really like Conair products</li>
            <li> and I am VERY used to using an iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cone tip design allow my fingers to slip straight to the iron.  </li>
            <li> and my hair doesn&#x27;t hold the curl very well.</li>
            <li> This accomplished that well.</li>
            <li> i have yet to really try out the heat settings</li>
            <li> The barrel is also very slippery</li>
            <li> no sooner than you plug it in, its ready too use.</li>
            <li> and I end up with hair that is almost straight...</li>
            <li> I think I might be returning this since I have no use for it, seeing as it doesn&#x27;t really work on my hair...</li>
            <li> This one works really well for the price point.</li>
            <li> The ceramic barrel makes so much difference.</li>
            <li> oh yeah, it&#x27;s ready.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have much effect&lt;</li>
            <li> I really like this Conair curling iron.</li>
            <li> really like this curling iron -  </li>
            <li> The barrel is rather smooth and I would recommend using product in your hair prior to curling/using as it does become slippery.  </li>
            <li> HEATS UP FAST</li>
            <li> Love that it comes with a cover for when I&#x27;m done especially since I have a four yr old.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s only happened twice because I&#x27;m not stupid and learned my lesson.</li>
            <li> Barrel too big and it wouldn&#x27;t be cost effective at the price I paid to spend another $7.00 on shipping it back ,so I am stuck with this unusable purchase.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, it heats up quickly, curls very nicely, and is all-in-all a solid buy, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; tip at the top of the curler (plastic tapered rounded end) isn&#x27;t quite big enough for your hand to rest comfortably/grip so you can easily burn yourself if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li> The spring/clip works fine, not too loose but not difficult to press, either.</li>
            <li> I had been buying Revlon styling wands but they do seem to fall apart pretty quickly with daily use.  </li>
            <li> Yes, the curling iron does get hot, quickly, and it could potentially curl your hair... if you don&#x27;t accidentally turn it off while rolling your hair, and if you don&#x27;t need to hold onto the tip, and if you don&#x27;t burn your fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It broke on my first curling iron in about a year, so I got a new one.  </li>
            <li> The off button is so sensitive and right where your hand goes to do your hair that you inadvertently turn it off.  </li>
            <li> There really weren&#x27;t too many other options out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is better than any other brand - heats fast, the controls are where they should be and don&#x27;t shut off every time you move your hand</li>
            <li> I thought it was very nice, was given as a gift for Secret Santa for Kids.</li>
            <li> For the price, this curling iron out performed other irons that cost 100 dollars or more.</li>
            <li> I like conair and have many other products</li>
            <li> So much better than the other curing irons I have had over the years.</li>
            <li> The other 3 were top brands</li>
            <li> It heats up rather quickly and has three heat settings but those are the only positive aspects I can think of.</li>
            <li> , I tore open the Amazon box, tossed the recyclables on top of the dryer (where they go for now) and plugged in my New Fancy Curling Iron, the Infiniti Professional Nano Tourmaline Ceramic Curling Iron, 1 and 1/2 inch baby....</li>
            <li> I have long (almost reaching my waist), fine hair, and this didn&#x27;t work at all for me.  </li>
            <li> I use the lowest setting on my long fine hair and the curl lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> However, so far the product has heated as hot as i wanted and has not broken.</li>
            <li> , I think they&#x27;re far enough up where I can use it easily without accidentally pressing them</li>
            <li> -- I am almost 50 years old and this is a FIRST ;</li>
            <li> The curling iron doesn&#x27;t clamp your hair tight enough to get a good curl.  </li>
            <li> Curling iron heats up in seconds and cools down faster than most.</li>
            <li> I must say, I&#x27;m glad I spent the money on this!!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally completely straight and the most this curling iron did to my hair was make it lean a little to the side.</li>
            <li> brand new for a fraction of the price!  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I already had the flat iron and a smaller curling iron of the same series that I loved...</li>
            <li> When I do that, I find that I have to be careful as my hair gets easily snagged somewhere in the clamp.  </li>
            <li> Has multiple heat settings and heats up really quickly.  </li>
            <li> Decent curling iron for the money.</li>
            <li> Works better than more expensive curling irons I have had.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t heat up as well as my older model</li>
            <li> It heats extremely quickly &amp; my curls last til I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly decent curling iron for the price.</li>
            <li> But fairly decent iron.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the spring snaps rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> This curling iron heats up quickly and has several temperature settings.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this iron mainly because of the size.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on a blog review which considered the ratings on several different sites to determine the top 10 non-professional curling irons.</li>
            <li> It works nicely and gets hot in a few seconds would definitely recommended getting this!</li>
            <li> The feel of my hair is great no more looking and feeling dry &amp; burnt.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Gets super hot so be careful not to burn yourself, but just pay attention.</li>
            <li> It is a quality product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Saves my hair from high heat.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I have tried hot tools and many other high end brands, but Conair always impresses me, especially when you consider the price!</li>
            <li> Additionally, the newer models have improved power buttons which I agree with other reviewers that the iron so easily shuts off accidentally -</li>
            <li> My hair curls easily but this doesn&#x27;t seem to do much other than turn the ends.</li>
            <li> Really hard to believe until you see it with your own eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing bad about it :D</li>
            <li> I normally have.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot barely.</li>
            <li> All its missing is a retractable cord. :-)</li>
            <li> so I can put my hot curling iron away withouth waiting for it to cool down.  </li>
            <li> I have super long, pretty thick hair &amp; this curling iron is fabulous!</li>
            <li> The only issue with that is that flat irons don&#x27;t always create the exact same curl, whereas curling irons provide a more even finish.</li>
            <li> When I first received it, it held easily onto my hair, even in small sections.  </li>
            <li> I turned it off several times without noticing right away.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product when i had super long hair.</li>
            <li> and my hair isn&#x27;t super long.</li>
            <li> I have the 1 1/4&amp;#34;, but needed 1 1/2&amp;#34; for my new style.  </li>
            <li> I need to buy a new one?  </li>
            <li> AND live in Texas...</li>
            <li> Yesterday I was doing my hair and it broke on the new curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Be prepared to buy a new one every 12-18 months or so.</li>
            <li> The heat may not be hot enough, I don&#x27;t know, but I sent it back for a refund, because it just doesn&#x27;t seem right that I tried all of these things AND tried it on two hair types, and nothing...</li>
            <li> My hair typically curls easily, but not with this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> section of hair and easily turned the ends into a two and a half roll coil.</li>
            <li> My hair curls fairly easy and this iron didn&#x27;t hold a curl long enough for me to use hair spray.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had lots of Conair products in the past and most all of them turn out to be sh!t.  </li>
            <li> and this gives me big pretty curls with lots of volume.</li>
            <li> First off this was not the same as advertised.</li>
            <li> It holds the curl for a while only when I use hairspray, but otherwise, it would fall flat, almost like I used a smooth iron in my hair, regardless, I always receive complimetns on my hair and o tell everyone it is the conair iron.</li>
            <li> Both of the other curling irons I own are by Conair and have never really had an issue with them.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
            <li> My onl con is that it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
            <li> The first lasted over ten years</li>
            <li> But, as it grows, I have the option to use a higher heat to accommodate the extra hair.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!</li>
            <li> This newest one seems exactly like my last one.</li>
            <li> find that my curls come out consistent even on the low heat setting.</li>
            <li> Second, the cool tip is too small: I burned myself several times before moving to a more one-handed approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Be aware that the tip for you to grasp is very small - burned fingertips do happen quite easily.  </li>
            <li> I have really long hair and needed a curling iron that was the right size to give me the curls I wanted.</li>
            <li> Mine is a few inches past my shoulders and it makes great wavy curls, since the iron is 1 1/2\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> For $20 i thought i was going to get a cheap curler that would probably not last long.</li>
            <li> It actually seems to straighten it more than curl, which is odd since I&#x27;ve used this size in the past with better curl results.      </li>
            <li> I have had this curling iron for a few years now, and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really get hot enough and it&#x27;s too big of a barrell.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the barrel is short, however I wish the black tip was longer as I have slipped many times and burned my fingertips.</li>
            <li> Also, i was very careful from the get go not to use the tip of the barrel for full contact, just the tip of my fingers for support, no biggie.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s pretty sturdy and works really well.</li>
            <li> The iron that I received, does have a hard plastic tip, but it isn&#x27;t horribly large, so I did bump the actual iron with my fingers more than once.</li>
            <li> Heats up super quick and curls really well for my long and thick hair.</li>
            <li> , so my hair won&#x27;t be so straight it does smooth the hair and shines it a little overall</li>
            <li> but sometimes I am in a rush and forget-this this is a design issue that can be easily fixed and avoided.</li>
            <li> My hair is wild after washing.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a curling iron that was reasonably priced, yet would stand up to daily use.  </li>
            <li> it was way too sensitive.   </li>
            <li> They seem to hold curls very well, especially if you use the highest setting!  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy</li>
            <li> I should have replaced my old one sooner.</li>
            <li> It has worked grear so far.  </li>
            <li> Infiniti Professional Nano Tourmaline Ceramic Curling Iron, 1 1/2-Inch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the hair</li>
            <li> Both worked really well until recently.  </li>
            <li> version as well, but really wanted bigger, looser curls.</li>
            <li> i have naturally curly hair (can you say FRIZZZZ???)  </li>
            <li> I really like the different temperatures.</li>
            <li> barrel curler which creates much tighter curls but wanted a curler that created bigger volume/looser curls and this product does that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find that it rips out my hair near the spring mechanism.</li>
            <li> So far this unit is performing as described on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My hair looks like it&#x27;s been done professionally when I use this curling iron.</li>
            <li> but really was hoping for one that had lasting curls.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is going straight back to Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The control button is too sensitive too.  </li>
            <li> Arriving far quicker than I anticipated (Prime account?</li>
            <li> would recommend not to use with fresh washed hair, the curls do not last the same.</li>
            <li> Besides the poor design, the iron is not that effective as a styling tool.</li>
            <li> have EXTREMELY thick hair and found this curler to be only somewhat effective.</li>
            <li> it works as good as my old expensive one.</li>
            <li> This is too large to make decent curls, not what I expected from a hair curler.  </li>
            <li> : I think there are 3 heat settings so if you have fragile/delicate hair or harder to curl hair, you can choose the right setting for your curls.  </li>
            <li> My round flat iron makes better waves</li>
            <li> and I would much rather use this 1 1/2 inch rather than a flat iron.</li>
            <li> The black tip doesn&#x27;t get hot, but the ceramic gets hot enough to curl your hair in seconds with even heat throughout the barrel.  </li>
            <li> I had previously bough the Conair tapered curling wand, which I love, but wanted a second curling iron for bigger, looser curls.  </li>
            <li> I have used many curling irons, and never have had one with such a small area for holding on the end.  </li>
            <li> No half hour blow-dry sessions or rollers...priceless.</li>
            <li> then, i guess when we are putting an appliance of 300-400 degrees up to our head, if we use our hands on it to steady it, etc.... then, yes, we must expect that burns are an occasional possibility.  </li>
            <li> not only is it really short and gets hot on the tip</li>
            <li> I do not recommend it unless you want to use just the tips of your fingers on your alternate hand to steady it.  </li>
            <li> BUT BIG ENOUGH TO GET THE JOB DONE FAST!</li>
            <li> Bought this recently because I thought I had misplaced my old one that I bought about 7 years ago (still going strong).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good curling iron for a decent price for a long time because I always bought the really cheap ones that crap out after a month.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick and very straight and even on the highest setting the curls fell right out.</li>
            <li> The handle is long and weighted so you shouldn&#x27;t have a hard time using it mainly with your prominent hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it only 3 stars because a couple of design flaws, which seemed pretty minor initially, have made it very aggravating over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The black piece over the handle is also very hot.</li>
            <li> Before I had to blow dry, flat iron THEN curl my hair, but with this curling iron I can skip the flat iron step and still get soft shiny frizz free hair.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE LONG STRAIGHT HAIR AND BOUGHT THIS TO MAKE SOME WAVES IN MY HAIR...</li>
            <li> /&gt;This does create nice curls, the only thing is I have found it very hard to use in terms of getting it to release your curls</li>
            <li> I must say I have lightly singed my fingers on the rod because the tip to hold it is a little too short like everyone has said.</li>
            <li> Most machines seem to only burn and not produce a hard curl</li>
            <li> AND my hair really does hold a curl long with this curling iron!</li>
            <li> well i just tried out  my new infiniti ceramic curling iron and cannot praise it enough.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use any hairspray so the curls fell out over the course of the day, but my hair just looked like it had been blown dry really well.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t send this back fast enough.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really seem that hot either, I am not sure if that is from it being a ceramic iron or not, but I did return this product.</li>
            <li> The temperatur button only gives a green light.  </li>
            <li> If you have hair length that requires more than one twist, you will likely turn this iron off accidentally at least once during your styling session.</li>
            <li> I usually buy Chi products, but this one is just as good, if not better.</li>
            <li> Then the curling iron doesn&#x27;t seem to turn back on unless it has had a chance to cool down.</li>
            <li> but it has a major design flaw.  </li>
            <li> Does not heat up well and stay hot, nor holds my hair in the clip to the end, as I pull the hair down to curl at the ends, the clip is not tight to the barrel and slips out.</li>
            <li> But seriously, this iron is durable and so easy to work with.  </li>
            <li> This iron is so much easier to use, and it really feels like it&#x27;s smoothing your hair, not gripping or pulling.  </li>
            <li> Heats up fast and does make a long lasting curl!</li>
            <li> Only thing I wish is that it notified you when it had heated up, but it really doesn&#x27;t take long</li>
            <li> End cap is too short and my fingers get burned frequently.</li>
            <li> I have hair that is wavy and coarse on my crown and soft waves underneath</li>
            <li> and it always causes this smell of nearly burnt hair, but my hair isn&#x27;t actually burnt.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe it was just my hair, but it happens with my 9 and my 12 year old, who use different shampoos and no products.</li>
            <li> and it always causes this smell of nearly burnt hair, but my hair isn&#x27;t actually burnt.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe it was just my hair, but it happens with my 9 and my 12 year old, who use different shampoos and no products.</li>
            <li> Whoever came up with that idea at Conair apparently hasn&#x27;t tried using this.</li>
            <li> I went back to my old one.</li>
            <li> my efforts to package it up and mail back my old unit and go without a curling iron for a couple weeks just to save $5.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t had constant use, but it has lasted quite a while so far.</li>
            <li> I have obstinate hair and with a combo of Matrix Biolage Deep Smoothing Shampoo and Conditioner plus curling my hair with the Infiniti Professional Nano Tourmaline Ceramic Curling Iron, 1 1/2-Inch</li>
            <li> And last but certainly not least, the CURLS DID NOT LAST!!  </li>
            <li> and i have touched the iron instead of the cool tip on several occations, but as long as you are careful and pay attention to what you are doing this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem with you.</li>
            <li> It took me twice as long to curl my hair with this iron than it normally does</li>
            <li> Love it for long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I end up with some loose waves, and eventually pretty flat hair.  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;s super helpful to have an iron that can go up to 400 degrees, especially because I have Asian, thick, straight hair that needs a lot of heat to keep a curl.</li>
            <li> Now granted that could be due to my curling technique or my large hands...</li>
            <li> I was forced into quickly buying a curling iron because mine unexpectedly broke.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t purchased a new curling iron in a long time.</li>
            <li> My previous curling iron was HOT</li>
            <li> I previously bought a Hot Tools curling iron (for $60) with a 1 1/4&amp;#34; barrel.</li>
            <li> It seemed the other ones with similar features were considerably higher cost</li>
            <li> Other than that, I like that it heats up fast, reduces the frizz, and makes my hair shine.</li>
            <li> The clamp holds the hair pretty tight without creasing.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and falling out a little due to medications.</li>
            <li> I spent so much money on another brand that does the same thing</li>
            <li> I have had a lot of drugstore level hot tools and this was one of the more expensive and the most disappointing.</li>
            <li> so, yes... the other iron i had for over 25 years had a large enough end piece that when i used it to move the styler or hold it while doing the curling, there was no burning.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this because my other large curling iron finally broke beyond repair (I was holding it together with rubber bands and duct tape ;</li>
            <li> I have very long (waist length, fine hair) and my curls are usually gone my mid morning</li>
            <li> Works great, I&#x27;m just disappointed because my hair never can keep a curl.</li>
            <li> According to the chart, I should use a middle setting - which barely curled my hair.  </li>
            <li> I did not want to buy it, but after visiting three nearby stores, it became apparent that this was the only 1.5\\&quot; curling iron that I could have if I wanted it that day (which I did).  </li>
            <li> , Im not sure if this of a fault to the product, seeing as Ive never had any success with curling irons.</li>
            <li> It really cuts down the amount of time it takes to style your hair when you don&#x27;t have to compensate for working around a faulty clamp.</li>
            <li> Granted I live in a US territory, so I am limited to what will be shipped here, but how co you go from shipping to me and no longer a week later?</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this at a major beauty chain for a lower price, but it&#x27;s going back this weekend.  </li>
            <li> It gets MUCH hotter than other curlers I&#x27;ve used and the \\&quot;safety\\&quot; end where you hold it isn&#x27;t really big enough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You know how the skinny ends of your hair you usually have to use your fingers to wrap the hair around because it will slide right through?</li>
            <li> It is a marvel at how quickly it manages to curl my ultra thick hair and make it look well groomed and styled.  </li>
            <li> The tip is not long enough.  </li>
            <li> I would say my one and only complaint is that the cool touch tip isn&#x27;t very big.</li>
            <li> It gets very hot and curls my thick hair in about 15-20 seconds.</li>
            <li> and I have below waist length, super thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Due to the size of this curling iron, this does not curl well for long straight hair.</li>
            <li> One negative that other reviewers have mentioned: it is too easy to hit the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; button.</li>
            <li> The curl looks nice for about one hour, dies down during the second hour, then all my hard work goes down the drain</li>
            <li> On the hottest setting this curler will almost function like a flat iron if you pull it quickly through small sections, and that has been a lifesaver when I&#x27;ve forgotten to pack all my styling tools on a trip!</li>
            <li> But you don&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s off and keep on styling and wonder why it&#x27;s not curling, then swear, then turn back on and have to set to the right temperature -- at least three times during one styling.  </li>
            <li> It just fell out completely flat, with only the end of my hair being left curled.</li>
            <li> No matter what setting I put it on, no matter how long or short I held my hair in it, no matter how much or how little hair I tried it on, it would not curl my hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried other curling irons but this one is far better.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> The only thing that has ever worked for me is using a flat iron to curl my hair...</li>
            <li> Sigh I&#x27;ll just go back to the flat iron.</li>
            <li> Curling my hair with a flat iron leaves me with curls that last, but this doesn&#x27;t hold at all.</li>
            <li> If you have difficulty using a flat iron or just want big curls.  </li>
            <li> I hold the iron in position for several seconds, long enough for any curl to take yet</li>
            <li> the cure doesn&#x27;t last that long because the size is too big.</li>
            <li> But it gets hot enough for you gals with thick hair, too.</li>
            <li> The description says new, and this was obviously used - ther were scuff marks and scratches on the ceramic iron parts and little pieces of hair on it.</li>
            <li> Well for starters the manufacture date on the metal plug was 2003, so this was a very old stock piece, made of a rubberized type black handle, these type eventually become sticky and wear out.</li>
            <li> but the curler is not tight enough and it doesnt grasp my hair tight enough to make the curls .</li>
            <li> but the curl still didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The long cord makes it possible to use just about anywhere.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with using my flat iron to get curls</li>
            <li> (I used to use two curling irons and a flat iron to get everything \\&quot;smoothed\\&quot;) --</li>
            <li> just doesn&#x27;t seem to hold the heat long enough to curl hair.</li>
            <li> Well made, long lasting, doesn&#x27;t damage hair.</li>
            <li> My hair fell totally flat in a couple hours afterward.  </li>
            <li> I use this as a flat iron also.</li>
            <li> Flat irons create long-lasting curls but curling irons for some reason just don&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold my hair long enough for me to get the desired curl.</li>
            <li> The iron calms it down and makes it soft and shiny looking.</li>
            <li> Would recommend if you need something this big or have very long hair.</li>
            <li> My only recommendation is to be really careful when you are doing your hair, if the iron touch for a second</li>
            <li> The barrel is a big too big for my liking - so as a result, the curls are very, very loose.</li>
            <li> I guess my continuous buying says it all - not another on the market that works as well for thick coarse straight hair.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick long hair</li>
            <li> The small black end that you are suppose to hold with your fingers gets extremely hot!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to add two other really important negative remarks that I&#x27;ve not seen in other reviews</li>
            <li> It creates big loose waves, instead of a ringlet effect.</li>
            <li> I was looking for tighter curls, but I actually like the loose waves quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> It creates big, loose curls and makes my hair shiny.</li>
            <li> and it does what it says: gives big loose curls/waves.  </li>
            <li> I couldnt find the same one at my local stores and kept trying other ones and kept returning them to the store.  </li>
            <li> last 1.5\\&quot; curling iron was a Conair Instant Heat which retails for about half and worked well for several years.  </li>
            <li> The other negative reviews were right.  </li>
            <li> It holds on to my hair well and gets hot enough to curl my very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> but it takes way too long to set the curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have burned the tips of my fingers a couple times while rolling my long hair</li>
            <li> Once in a while I accidentally push the on/off button turning the iron off while I&#x27;m using it, but as long as I don&#x27;t have a death grip on it</li>
            <li> Also, when I wrap my hair around the entire iron with the clamp closed, it produces lines in the hair that is on the inside of the curl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m careful to keep the heat fairly low</li>
            <li> my hair just wasn&#x27;t long enough?&amp;#34; for this iron to give me the effects I was looking for.</li>
            <li> was get some of my long hair caught in the screws</li>
            <li> has a really long cord.</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> Does not old a curl.</li>
            <li> Curls stays long but have to use hair spray for it to keep the day it through the day</li>
            <li> Omg I wish I would of known about this long ago.</li>
            <li> I got the 1 1/2\\&quot; size, which, it turns out, offers absolutely no curl for my thick, below-shoulder length naturally wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that when you put it down the hot part tips forward which will burn whatever it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> have very thin, fine hair, which should be the easiest to avoid these problems.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> When i used to curl my long hair with this product, my hair would curl but it never stayed very long..</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair (long, medium weight), but when I curl my hair with this curling iron, the curls do not hold for very long.  </li>
            <li> Barely made a slight wave, no curl</li>
            <li> I have super long and thick hair that goes to my waist that is also extremely hard to curl, so I held each curl in for EXTRA LONG and on the highest heat setting.</li>
            <li> It also produces very natural, healthy-looking results, unlike metal irons I&#x27;ve used in the past that give hair a dry, fried appearance.</li>
            <li> As long as I don&#x27;t touch my curls they stay in without hairspray!</li>
            <li> The other thing I do not like about it is that sometimes hair gets caught in the tiny screws that hold the clip to the barrel.</li>
            <li> After spending days researching all other curling irons, I ended up purchasing the same one.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 1 1/2 inch one not realizing it was the same make and model of my other one.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews on this and several other irons.</li>
            <li> One thing to note, the 2003 model I received had a very long cord so that stylists could use it in a salon, where as the newer one I bought has a shorter cord by 2 feet.   </li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron to replace one that I had for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I could tell the staying power wasn&#x27;t going to be very long.</li>
            <li> Be very careful I actually burned myself.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Has a relatively high temperature so it works on hard to curl hair</li>
            <li> but I have used others that were much easier to use and release the curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron heats up quickly, doesn&#x27;t burn your hair, but it does burn your forehead bad if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder-length hair, and I can just wash it, let it dry, and when it&#x27;s convenient I can touch it up in a couple of minutes and look presentable.  </li>
            <li> I tried this curler on various heat settings, held it for various lengths of time, tried it with hairspray, without, with pre-curling product and then without... clean hair, 2-day hair, and my hair is medium length and somewhat thin, but my daughter&#x27;s is thick...</li>
            <li> The plastic grip is a horrible design; I burned my fingers many times thanks to the stupid cone shape with ridges that make it easy for your fingers to slip into the wonderfully hot barrel.  </li>
            <li> I need extremely high temperatures because my hair is so thick.  </li>
            <li> I just hope it will last me as long as my previous curling iron.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for my prior one (same model) which died after several years of hard use.</li>
            <li> There is no safe place to hold the curler near the tip.  </li>
            <li> The barrel creates really loose waves, not curls.  </li>
            <li> When I called them, they offered to reship me another at the current selling price and credit me when I return this one, but when it came down to ordering, somehow my address was blocked???</li>
            <li> I bought this size and the next one down in 2008 for a cruise.  </li>
            <li> It means I can put the iron away before it&#x27;s totally cooled down.</li>
            <li> Because of the locaion of the switches on the handle, it&#x27;s impossible to avoid touching them.</li>
            <li> If you have a lot of hair, it will be impossible to avoid them because you will not be able to keep your hair at the end of the barrel and away from the clamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice long cord that rotates at the base is a bonus, as is the silicone barrel-cover that permits me to pack it up while it&#x27;s still</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that due to the fact it&#x27;s tip isn&#x27;t a heat resistant as it claims it makes it hard to touch to tip to style right.</li>
            <li> have medium thick, long layered hair that reaches almost the middle of my back.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold the hair tight enough when trying to curl.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the heat supply or that the clamp isn&#x27;t tight enough, but I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Also with a lot of hair, little hair, short hair, and nothing.</li>
            <li> also I think it is a little big for my shoulder length hair..</li>
            <li> However, this is my fourth Conair curling iron and each one lasts just a little over one year, at which time the spring breaks.</li>
            <li> for someone who is growing their hair out and having a tough time with those pesky ends you aren&#x27;t ready to chop off.</li>
            <li> I think the barrel size might be just a little big for what I wanted, but that just means I&#x27;ll buy the next size down as well!</li>
            <li> Huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> Of course, you will probaby not realize this until your iron goes cold or if you happen to look at the iron and notice the light has gone off.  </li>
            <li> problem is that the clamp is too thick and does not open wide enough, which produces creases in the hair.</li>
            <li> matter what I do and how careful I am, my hair still ends up getting creases in it.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected</li>
            <li> It is just a curling iron and does what I expected.  </li>
            <li> You have to be careful</li>
            <li> So i have to be careful.</li>
            <li> I think, you should be careful handling any heat tools and if you are burning yourself on it, my recommendation is practicing using it with one hand.</li>
            <li> It took me several rolls to get one strand of hair to even form a curl and not just a limp bump.  </li>
            <li> did  not do what i expected at all .</li>
            <li> i wanted this curling iron to make some wide wavy hair curls</li>
            <li> If you have stick straight thin hair and don&#x27;t use product I would imagine you&#x27;d struggle with any curling iron.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t figured out if it&#x27;s getting caught in the hinge or if the edge of the clamp is just not smooth enough to glide or</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like a rough edge...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars only because I&#x27;ve burned myself a few times with this one.</li>
            <li> I ended up purchasing another curling iron after using this one for a few months (with various styling products).</li>
            <li> Just be careful</li>
            <li> I also have thick hair that has body naturally.</li>
            <li> I am actually on Amazon right now looking for a replacement because I cannot stand the stupid button getting turned off constantly and having to turn it back on.</li>
            <li> It seems to work better for straightening with a slight curl on the end, but very difficult to get a controlled wave anywhere else.  </li>
            <li> JUST MADE IT LIMP AND FLAT</li>
            <li> I burned my fingers several times because the tip is too small to hold onto.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t crease my hair, but it&#x27;s pretty much useless since it does.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the buttons like other reviewers</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only small, but</li>
            <li> I would leave it on for a long while and still my hair would remain limp.  </li>
            <li> I have never accidentally turned it off as some other reviews noted.  </li>
            <li> : Some reviewers have noted that they have accidentally shut off the curler due to the placement of the controls/buttons</li>
            <li> but I wanted looser and more flawy curls but after trying it a couple of times I was nothing but disappointed.</li>
            <li> I do burn my fingers a lot because the cool tip is so awkward.</li>
            <li> Due to the thickness of my hair</li>
            <li> I spent two hours curling my hair with this thing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this problem with any other curling iron I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Other people have commented that the on/off button gets in the way, I didn&#x27;t find that to be a problem.</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful</li>
            <li> I have to be very careful when purchasing heating items for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Other irons I seem to fumble with like on those bad infomercials where the dude cant pour milk without the easy to use spout or whatever.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try a less expensive iron this time, in anticipation of having to buy a new iron for the same reason every 3 years hereafter.  </li>
            <li> -I just have to be extra careful and go slow</li>
            <li> If you look carefully at the picture of the curling iron, you will see that the on/off and temperature control buttons are push-button controls, slightly indented into the handle of the iron.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for months and other reviewers complained that they accidentally turned it off due to where the on/off button was located-that only happened to me once.  </li>
            <li> You may have to practice a bit like me if you aren&#x27;t used to using a curling iron, you can crimp your hair if you are attempting to properly curl from the base down, but the heat of the iron seems to smooth out crimps if you get them in time.</li>
            <li> typically don&#x27;t even need to use product because my hair holds really well, but I blasted with hairspray multiple times and the curls STILL fell-- looked like I rolled out of bed and didn&#x27;t style my hair at all.</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse hair that holds a curl extremely well.  </li>
            <li> I am only giving it 4 stars because the tip is a little too small</li>
            <li> Its too big and hard to curle.</li>
            <li> As with all heat tools use basic common sense and   caution to avoid burning yourself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Conair&#x27;s Infiniti tools and only gave this curling iron 3 stars because the size was way bigger than I expected and therefore difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Was not worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> My second one lasted at least 10 years until the spring broke.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on Amazon and on Target.com (Target&#x27;s reviewers gave it a lower average).  </li>
            <li> i have thick coarse curly Persian hair and all my life</li>
            <li> I have been an Infiniti fan for years for how well curls hold in my thick asian hair.</li>
            <li> barrel has enough room to accommodate my very long, very thick hair.</li>
            <li> $30.00 down the drain..products I use, or don&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> $30.00 down the drain..</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, when I curl my hair, I start towards the roots and pull the iron down towards my ends.  </li>
            <li> I began at the root, slid down a 1 &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> spend a lot of money on other brands - this one will do the job!</li>
            <li> After an hour or two all I had was a slight curve at the ends.</li>
            <li> However, the rest doesn&#x27;t go all the around the circumfrance of the black plastic end of the curling iron</li>
            <li> I tried it twice and like my subject line mentions &amp;#34;Maybe</li>
            <li> so I could use the wrap around method without burning my fingers, I didn&#x27;t touch the black guard part on the end though.</li>
            <li> I would definitely replace it with the same one again if it did fail.</li>
            <li> this is something ordinary metal curl irons CANNOT do... not sure if it is the &#x27;ionizing&#x27; feature or whatever they call it, but once you have used the iron on your hair, the hair definitely resists humidity.  </li>
            <li> one inch (or less??)</li>
            <li> less than 10 mins</li>
            <li> I had first tried the Hot Tools iron which was terrible - the clamp would not hold onto my hair at all.  </li>
            <li> It looked as if I tried to flatten half my head instead of curling all of it.  </li>
            <li> The curling iron leaves lines from the clamp and the curls do not even work much less hold in my hair.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s slightly wavy with medium thickness.  </li>
            <li> THIS CUT MY HAIR TIME TO ABOUT HALF THE BARREL</li>
            <li> days)rolling my hair in big plastic curlers every night and sitting under a beauty parlor style hair dryer i got at a yard sale, blow drying  little sections for hours using expensive de-frizzing creams, and using an actual clothing iron to no avail.</li>
            <li> The controls are at EXACTLY the spot you put your hands while you&#x27;re curling, which means in the two times I used it, I turned the iron off about 15 times and adjusted the heat haphazardly another 20.  </li>
            <li> But otherwise it&#x27;s not worth the trouble.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick hair, maybe if you have finer hair</li>
            <li> The curl doesn&#x27;t stay in my hair any longer than with any other iron, the clip is, useless because it is too loose and my hair falls out of it, the tip is too short to keep you from burning yourself over and over, and it smells of heated plastic.</li>
            <li> The black plastic end of the curling iron has a little safety rest so that the curling iron doesn&#x27;t burn surface it is heated up on.</li>
            <li> you need a tight clamp, keep looking.</li>
            <li> The curls it produces aren&#x27;t as tight as they should be for an iron of this size.</li>
            <li> I may just contact con air directly about this, unfair selling of old outdated items on amazon with missing parts.  </li>
            <li> However, the buttons are annoying as they are easy to switch it off while using it.  </li>
            <li> Using a curling iron takes a little practice, but once you get the  hang of it</li>
            <li> a little passed my shoulders</li>
            <li> Every time I use this iron it happens, unless I take an extremely small section of hair to curl and I don&#x27;t dare move the iron to one side or the other.</li>
            <li> My hair was pass my hips and maybe a little longer.</li>
            <li> then one day i cut my hair to donate n now its a little below my shoulder</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s little wait time.</li>
            <li> and I had it for a little bit of time</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant because of some of the reviews of this product saying it doesn&#x27;t heat up, turns off etc.</li>
            <li> but did little to nothing towards my roots.</li>
            <li> Unless of course, you grip a little closer to the handle.  </li>
            <li> The handling end is a little shorter than I&#x27;d used before.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I bought a crummy Revlon one at Walgreen&#x27;s for $15.</li>
            <li> Unlike some of the 1 to 2 star reviews, I&#x27;ve never had any trouble burning my fingers on the tip of the iron.</li>
            <li> It holds your hair firmly but still let&#x27;s it slide without damage to your hair.  </li>
            <li> Check the product again to see if anyone else had trouble with this iron.</li>
            <li> The end tip is too narrow and you bun your fingers trying to hold</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Whether at home or traveling, my wife uses this curling iron everyday.</li>
            <li> It will work well for few months</li>
            <li> Not happy with it, my hair kept snagging and it took a while to heat back up between curls.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your time &amp; money on this iron.</li>
            <li> I found this iron to be deficient in several ways.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I do not use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this model almost two years, and it still gets used everyday with no mechanical issues.</li>
            <li> Not a comfortable feeling.  </li>
            <li> It just plain does not work...</li>
            <li> It holds my hair tight and does the job!  </li>
            <li> i have a long thin hair and it didnt work work for me.</li>
            <li> I have very long VERY thick hair.</li>
            <li> This curling iron does what it&#x27;s supposed to, but not very effectively.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in a bad location, and I would often accidentally turn it off when picking it up which required extra time to heat it back  up.  </li>
            <li> , my curls were there all day and with no or little hairspray!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed because there were so many rave reviews on it.</li>
            <li> I use it routinely and notice very little heat damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> I curl my hair just about every other day!!!</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and can make very loose curls/waves with this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it has an automatic timer to shut off though?  </li>
            <li> A couple of small problems that kept it at three stars.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually hit the recessed on/off button</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> [it is a safety mechanism built in] and I have put it on the highest temperature and still not satisfied with the curl.  </li>
            <li> I tried a few of the temperature settings and my curls were falling out before I was even done with all my hair!</li>
            <li> I usually burn my fingers when holding the iron.</li>
            <li> Cap on end too small.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the manufacturer would not think of this...?</li>
            <li> perhaps its with my hair, Im not sure</li>
            <li> (I have really small hands and have burned myself).  </li>
            <li> This seems silly given that the curling iron only retails for $16 and</li>
            <li> Also, the tip of the curling iron is way too small.  </li>
            <li> The flaw I have noticed, that is really annoying is the control buttons are on the handle right</li>
            <li> i have very thick wavy hair that never wants to do what i want it to!</li>
            <li> I Like It Because It Doesn&#x27;t Burn Your Hair As Bad As Other Curling Irons, But My Hair Stays Curled For A Short Amount Of Time With This Curling Iron😳</li>
            <li> so I was disappointed to not have the iron ready on my time line and to always have to fuss with the plug, cord and switches.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m feeling silly as to why I waited so long!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SO BAD, that this morning I finally sat down at the computer to write this review.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SO BAD, that this morning I finally sat down at the computer to write this review.</li>
            <li> My hair can be so hard to curl sometimes</li>
            <li> It is hard to keep the setting on one number as you turn it.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with the other reviewers that the tip is too small or the wrong shape.</li>
            <li> my hair hardly holds curls</li>
            <li> My hair is the type that has always been hard to curl even with a \\&quot;gallon\\&quot; of hairspray, it just would never hold.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hard to convince that a curling iron could make my hair shiney.</li>
            <li> The end is hard to hold when curling your hair.  </li>
            <li> It hardly curled my hair at all.</li>
            <li> This item stopped working after only a few weeks, I only used it a handful of times, very disappointing!  </li>
            <li> and I have to wait at least 15 seconds per section for the curl to take.</li>
            <li> The thing needed like 30 minutes to heat up, and it&#x27;s hottest setting was a total disappointment.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re sleepily doing your hair in the morning (as I often do), plan on burning yourself at least seven or eight times.    </li>
            <li> BIG DISAPPOINTMENT...</li>
            <li> have nothing negative to say about this curling iron at all.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this item wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> think this size is just too thick to curl.</li>
            <li> Fix the small design issues with this curling iron and it would be 5 stars for me!</li>
            <li> SO NO MORE ACCIDENTAL BURNS!</li>
            <li> a weirdly horrible smell comes up regardless of how clean my hair is, what products I use, or don&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> Not good for thick hair though, it does nothing for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The complaints about the design of this iron are sort of ridiculous</li>
            <li> You cannot hold onto it without giving yourself some serious burns.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using this being that the biggest I&#x27;ve ever used was a half inch around</li>
            <li> Because of the badly designed tip, I have burnt myself three times, while only using it twice.  </li>
            <li> I am in my early 60s, and I hate spending time messing with my hair, so I decided to try this wide-barreled curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I have curly hair, and it&#x27;s not too thick, and it&#x27;s not too thin.</li>
            <li> All the other negative remarks regarding the lame button design and the weird temperature buttons..</li>
            <li> other than that I highy recommend it especially for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong!!!</li>
            <li> The barrel is very thick, not good for curling bangs, you&#x27;ll need a thinner iron for that.</li>
            <li> It sucks!</li>
            <li> my hair is very hard to curl but this gave it some type of bend</li>
            <li> for some reason it works like a flat straightening iron :(</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> Poor design.</li>
            <li> The on/off button is in a POOR location as I hit it with almost every curl -</li>
            <li> I tend to leave curling irons perched precariously on the edge of my bathroom counter after I&#x27;m done with them which leads to a lot of broken curling irons - not this one.</li>
            <li> Earlier reviews mentioned that the power button was in an annoying position, I did not find this to be so.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with this item.</li>
            <li> Alas, to the landfill it goes...</li>
            <li> This curling iron is poorly designed.  </li>
            <li> which was really irritating.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s frustrating.</li>
            <li> These buttons are poorly placed in relationship to the grip of the iron.  </li>
            <li> It does the job of curling, but has poor design.</li>
            <li> RIDICULOUS design flaw!</li>
            <li> was a bit disappointed because the clamp is not very tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The On/Off button is a little annoying just because I accidentally press it when I don&#x27;t mean to but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using curling irons for 30 years and this one is by far the worst.</li>
            <li> and now shes got the wrong size.</li>
            <li> I accidently bought the wrong size.  </li>
            <li> The worst part is that the stay-cool tip of the iron is so short that even it is not an alternative place to put your hands.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say that there was no curl created.</li>
            <li> curling is by no means terrible, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone that curls their hair regularly.</li>
            <li> so that is what Ill continue doing...</li>
            <li> returning this one unfortunately</li>
            <li> The clip does not hold my hair so I am unable to use it.</li>
            <li> I have to returned it because it was to expensive and had to pay it</li>
            <li> no good all!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had to replace my 1 1/2&amp;#34; curling brush with this iron because they no longer make the brushes... but the unit works</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical to begin with</li>
            <li> I can style it to be a bit glamorous for going out or flatten the curls (with a straightener) a bit for a casual beachy waves.  </li>
            <li> But, alas, the on/off button is in a very unfortunate location.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, this is designed just terribly.  </li>
            <li> This iron drives me crazy.</li>
            <li> It is awkward to hold and manipulate because of its shape.    </li>
            <li> However, the on/off button is inconveniently located at a spot on the handle</li>
            <li> How utterly disappointing.</li>
            <li> This was a disappointing purchase for me.</li>
            <li> Dangerous.  </li>
            <li> Terrible waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair, and the iron will make ugly marks on my hair that makes it look like unnatural ugly curls.</li>
            <li> The buttons are awkwardly placed and it is very difficult to keep a grip on the end of the curler.</li>
            <li> It is horribly unpleasant, and it does not matter what heat setting</li>
            <li> It is horribly unpleasant, and it does not matter what heat setting</li>
            <li> It is nearly impossible to use this device without turning it off during styling.</li>
            <li> The tip of the curling iron is rounded, so that it is nearly impossible to get a grip on it while curing your hair.  </li>
            <li> Not too bad on the eyes either.</li>
            <li> Bad design.</li>
            <li> Really bad design.</li>
            <li> One thing that worried me after reading them is that the on/off switch was in a bad location, but I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it.  </li>
            <li> This bad boy was on my wish list forever</li>
            <li> you are going to have an ugly burn.</li>
            <li> This item disappointed in how it does not curl hair at all.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would work wonders as others had stated-but I must have gotten a dud. :-(</li>
            <li> Disappointed with this curling iron.</li>
            <li> really disappointed</li>
            <li> Watched videos on you tube and do everything as they advise, but no curls :((&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> so disappointed</li>
            <li> I even tried clipping the curls to my head to let them set, STILL the curls fell out :(</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Does not work on my shoulder lenght hair :(</li>
            <li> very unhappy with this curling iron</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m debating just unscrewing the stupid clamp and just using this as a wand</li>
            <li> Stupid me for not thinking of them sooner.</li>
            <li> Still hate it.</li>
            <li> Piece of crap.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 3 uses, but it conveniently waited to crap out on me after the eligible return date.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s THAT annoying.  </li>
            <li> I hate this curling iron, and it&#x27;s going out in the garbage today.</li>
            <li> I hate this curling iron, and it&#x27;s going out in the garbage today.</li>
            <li> Crap.</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> /curls than this crap.</li>
            <li> but I am very disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst curling irons I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> The number one reason is that the on/off switch&#x27;s design and placement is awful.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even curl hair all it does is wave the hair in a horrible way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- placement of buttons is terrible!</li>
            <li> It was terrible.</li>
            <li> Conair Hair products are the worst.</li>
            <li> Hate it!</li>
            <li> This iron was terrible!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a lot of curling irons in my day, and this one is undoubtedly the worst of the bunch.  </li>
            <li> Terrible product.  </li>
            <li> Horrible.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the on/off and temperature buttons are located in a terrible place on the handle.</li>
            <li> And worst of all... if you use it on heat setting #4 or #5, YOU WILL RADIATE THE SMELL OF BURNED HAIR -</li>
            <li> Worst purchase ever.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Does not curl my hair, it straightens it.  How do I return it?</li>
            <li> Love this item! Heats up quickly! Curls great! And super love the plastic protector it comes with - I&#x27;m able to put it back in my gym bag without worrying about it being too hot! AWESOME addition!</li>
            <li> This curling iron heats and curls well.  However, as someone else mentioned, be VERY CAUTIOUS about holding the end, or you will be burned, as I was.  I have used many curling irons, and never have had one with such a small area for holding on the end.  I did keep it for its good qualities, but please be advised that there is an issue you will need to contend with.</li>
            <li> perfect size for loose curls. comes with a heat protector and love the multiple settings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s my hair or it just doesn&#x27;t heat evenly but I can&#x27;t get a curl to stay in. The barrel is nice and wide so I was excited but it takes way too long to set the curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably my hairs fault</li>
            <li> I use this pretty much every day and it&#x27;s great.  Has multiple heat settings and heats up really quickly.  I&#x27;m not sure if it has an automatic timer to shut off though?  Decent curling iron for the money.</li>
            <li> This curling iron does what it&#x27;s supposed to, but not very effectively. I have course hair, and I need a curling iron that reaches 400 degrees. I&#x27;m quite sure that this curling iron does not. My hair is quite touchable after just curling it and I have to wait at least 15 seconds per section for the curl to take. My previous curling iron was HOT and I didn&#x27;t need to leave the iron on at all -- curl up and done. I&#x27;d return it but I&#x27;ve used it for a week. Still hate it.</li>
            <li> Very good value and quality for money, works well. Heats up in 30 seconds to my lowest setting I like. Perfect roller size. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Best curling iron I have ever owned!! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I like more strength in the blow power, but it seems to dry efficiently anyways!</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, nice large curls.</li>
            <li> For the price, this curling iron out performed other irons that cost 100 dollars or more. Heated up fast, curls were shiny &amp; bouncy. Loved the ability to change temperature easily. Not too bad on the eyes either. Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Gentle heat and didn&#x27;t singe my hair, but it didn&#x27;t hold the curl either. My hair is thick and very straight and even on the highest setting the curls fell right out. I tried freshly washed hair, I tried day after hair, it didn&#x27;t make much difference. I tried curling it and pining it up until it cooled, and that helped somewhat but the curl still didn&#x27;t last long. After an hour or two all I had was a slight curve at the ends. I&#x27;ve had many Conair curling irons over the years and this is the first one that didn&#x27;t work for me. It may work on a different hair type, but it didn&#x27;t do the job for me. I&#x27;ll be trying the Hot Tools 24k gold iron instead.</li>
            <li> End cap is too short and my fingers get burned frequently.</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst curling irons I have ever bought. First off the top piece is not heat resistent so I burn myself every time I touch it. The black piece over the handle is also very hot. Every time I curl away from my head I hit the buttons and turn it off. This curling iron is going back tomorrow!</li>
            <li> Great heat up very quickly</li>
            <li> FINALLY! A curling iron that WORKS! You don&#x27;t know how happy this makes me. A few months ago I bought a crummy Revlon one at Walgreen&#x27;s for $15. The thing needed like 30 minutes to heat up, and it&#x27;s hottest setting was a total disappointment. This Conair one is a life saver. Heats up in a minute. I was so psyched. And it gets nice and hot so you don&#x27;t have to do a million passes. My hair is like silk after using it this morning, 8 hours later. Love &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I have repeatedly burned my index finger with this curling iron. The black plastic end of the curling iron has a little safety rest so that the curling iron doesn&#x27;t burn surface it is heated up on. However, the rest doesn&#x27;t go all the around the circumfrance of the black plastic end of the curling iron so it is really easy to initially rest your index finger on the safety rest and when you go to turn the curling iron in an attempt to wind your hair around the barrel, your finger automatically moves from the safety rest to the PIPING HOT IRON!. I actually blistered my index finger the third time I used this curling iron!  Choose a safer curling iron or suffer the burns!</li>
            <li> Exactly as show.works great no hassles no issues.only thing i can say is make sure you know what size to get since my wife wasnt so sure and now shes got the wrong size.</li>
            <li> Love this!! Heats up fast, leaves my hair looking fabulous and if you forget and leave it on, it shuts off on its own!</li>
            <li> This curling iron is perfect for longer hair. Mine is a few inches past my shoulders and it makes great wavy curls, since the iron is 1 1/2\\&quot;. I love that it is tourmaline because it makes my hair SOO soft. I have very fine hair also, so the settings are great. It ranges from 310 to 395 degrees so it doesn&#x27;t fry my hair. The On/Off button is a little annoying just because I accidentally press it when I don&#x27;t mean to but considering that it is such a great tool, it is way worth it. It heats almost instantly too, it is just amazing!!</li>
            <li> This iron drives me crazy. It heats up rather quickly and has three heat settings but those are the only positive aspects I can think of. It is nearly impossible to use this device without turning it off during styling. The on/ off switch is super sensitive and placed right where your hand needs to go in order to hold the iron safely. Besides the poor design, the iron is not that effective as a styling tool. I simply do not like it. I have only had this model for a couple of weeks and will be ordering a FHI or CHI. You always get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The two screws on the sides pull my hair out. Poor design. However the iron does heat up fast.</li>
            <li> I have really straight heavy hair that never curls and this worked great. As long as I don&#x27;t touch my curls they stay in without hairspray! You will LOVE &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been curling my hair for 20 years and I can&#x27;t send this back fast enough. I burned my fingers several times because the tip is too small to hold onto. My hair didn&#x27;t hold the curl for longer than 10 minutes!</li>
            <li> My wife usea it daily. She doesn&#x27;t complain. That is a good thing, yes? :-)</li>
            <li> It has 4 temperature choices and all heat up very fast, within a couple of minutes. The 1.5 inch is perfect for a \\&quot;full\\&quot; affect without looking too \\&quot;prom\\&quot; curly hair, or you can use it to make quick waves for a more subtle affect.    The cord could be longer, but with some precise extension cord placement, it&#x27;s just fine. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I love how this curling iron eliminates alot of the frizz I normally have. I have hair that is wavy and coarse on my crown and soft waves underneath so I am always battling the frizz issue-this iron works for me. It gives me lots of body and the 4 settings are nice. I have been using it for months and other reviewers complained that they accidentally turned it off due to where the on/off button was located-that only happened to me once.  I just check it as I am using it-which I do not mind because I do not forget turn it OFF when I am done.  It also comes with a sleeve so you can put it away without having to let it cool off completely and the &amp;#34;kick stand&amp;#34; keeps the iron from touching your counter so no burns.I like it and it works for me. I am only giving it 4 stars because the tip is a little too small and I have burned the tips of my fingers a couple times while rolling my long hair -I just have to be extra careful and go slow but sometimes I am in a rush and forget-this this is a design issue that can be easily fixed and avoided.</li>
            <li> The curling iron does the job. My only recommendation is to be really careful when you are doing your hair, if the iron touch for a second your skin you are going to have an ugly burn.</li>
            <li> As far as curling irons go this is certainly a good one.   I like the 1 inch barrel as it gives a nice amount of curl/wave.  Using a curling iron takes a little practice, but once you get the  hang of it they are quite an indispensable tool. I use this iron  about one to two times a week. It can easily be shut off while   using it so check the on/off switch from time to time while it  is in use. As with all heat tools use basic common sense and   caution to avoid burning yourself. A great product for the money!  I would definaltly recomend this item to anyone in the market  for a quality iron that works.</li>
            <li> There are more cons than pros with this curling iron.    CONS  *  The tip of the curling iron is rounded, so that it is nearly impossible to get a grip on it while curing your hair.  *  Because of the badly designed tip, I have burnt myself three times, while only using it twice.  *  While in use, it will turn off because the on/off button is exactly where most women would place their fingers while curling their hair.  *  It is awkward to hold and manipulate because of its shape.    PROS  *  If you don&#x27;t mind a burnt scalp and fingers, and the fact that it will turn off several times as you bump the on/off switch while curling your hair, it will produce good curls.</li>
            <li> This curling iron heats up quickly. For the price, I feel like it is a great product. However, there have been a couple of times that I have turned it off by accident when curling hair. The other thing I do not like about it is that sometimes hair gets caught in the tiny screws that hold the clip to the barrel.</li>
            <li> I own THREE Hot Tools curling irons (two gold-plated ones and one ceramic) and ended up purchasing this one.  The reason is, the Hot Tools curling irons work awesome when there&#x27;s low humidity.  But, come summer, the curls do not stay curled whereas this one definitely keeps the curls intact longer.  The iron gets hot fast and does its job.  The cord swivels which is also awesome.  I love the plastic cover that comes with it so that the iron is protected from scratches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any issues with the buttons as some of the others have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I prefer this one over Hot tools.  Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product. Wife loves it, especially the cover that goes over curler.</li>
            <li> Great curling iron.  I use it ever day. It heats up quickly and does the job well.</li>
            <li> Good just need more practice on it</li>
            <li> Daughter said this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Good price and performs as advertised. Really like being able to control temp setting for my fine hair.  Doesn&#x27;t catch/ pull hair. Easy to use and gets job done well.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron.  My hair is wild after washing.  The iron calms it down and makes it soft and shiny looking.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a curling iron that was reasonably priced, yet would stand up to daily use.  I like how you can adjust the heat settings.  On the hottest scale, it give plenty of heat to curl quickly.  It also comes with a heat sleeve.</li>
            <li> I have easy to curl, fine, smooth hair and this didn&#x27;t curl my hair at all! I like conair and have many other products but I am very disappointed with this one. I do not know if it was user error or not but it didn&#x27;t add any wave or curl to my hair at all. I am returning it soon and hoping to find a better curling product.</li>
            <li> The curling iron makes nice curls.  A couple of small problems that kept it at three stars.  1. Do not pay attention to the suggested settings.  According to the chart, I should use a middle setting - which barely curled my hair.  The highest works nice.  2.  Be aware that the tip for you to grasp is very small - burned fingertips do happen quite easily.  3.  The on/off button is in a POOR location as I hit it with almost every curl - meaning I have to turn it back and adjust the heat level constantly.</li>
            <li> These irons heat quickly and work great!!  I recommend the purchase..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this iron for years and I have below waist length, super thick, coarse hair. I absolutely love this iron. I can use it to put beautiful, thick curls in or straighten my hair into a shiny, sleek, bone-straight style.  Unlike some of the 1 to 2 star reviews, I&#x27;ve never had any trouble burning my fingers on the tip of the iron. Once in a while I accidentally push the on/off button turning the iron off while I&#x27;m using it, but as long as I don&#x27;t have a death grip on it I don&#x27;t usually hit the recessed on/off button so it isn&#x27;t an issue.  Having multiple heat settings is great, as is the little protective case. All-in-all I think this is a great iron, which is why I&#x27;m replacing my old one with the exact same one. Love it for long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have this curler , my mother had it first and then she let me use it and I fell instantly in love with it. My hair can be so hard to curl sometimes and this curls it in a pinch and makes it last. Most machines seem to only burn and not produce a hard curl but this one does!</li>
            <li> Great curling iron.  This is a replacement for my prior one (same model) which died after several years of hard use.</li>
            <li> I am actually on Amazon right now looking for a replacement because I cannot stand the stupid button getting turned off constantly and having to turn it back on.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron!  It holds my hair tight and does the job!  It heats up fast and stays hot.  I have tried other curling irons but this one is far better.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t spend a lot of money on other brands - this one will do the job! Excellent product!!  I&#x27;m considering buying a second one so I&#x27;ll never be without this curling iron!</li>
            <li> The tip is not long enough.  I have burned my fingers 6 times. Wish I had not purchased it.</li>
            <li> I would have given it a zero star if I could.     - The unit keeps turnig off or changes the set temperature. The on/off and temperature buttons are so sensitive that with just a light touch the unit either turns off or changes the setting. Because of the locaion of the switches on the handle, it&#x27;s impossible to avoid touching them. I accidentally turned off the power every time I curled a section of hair.    - The end tip is too hot to hold. You could burn you fingers!    I&#x27;m returning mine. I can&#x27;t find a bettter way to hold this iron properly without turning off the unit and burning my fingers at the same time.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered. Great item!</li>
            <li> My daughter is very please with this.</li>
            <li> I accidently bought the wrong size.  It was super easy to return and super easy to order the correct size.</li>
            <li> This is the best curling iron I have used!! plus it is light weight. Works better than more expensive curling irons I have had.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, does a great job! I have tried hot tools and many other high end brands, but Conair always impresses me, especially when you consider the price!</li>
            <li> This curling iron seems to work fairly well, though I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to. However, the on/off button is inconveniently located at a spot on the handle that&#x27;s very easy to press by accident. I keep accidentally turning it off while using it.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Great product.</li>
            <li> The plastic grip is a horrible design; I burned my fingers many times thanks to the stupid cone shape with ridges that make it easy for your fingers to slip into the wonderfully hot barrel.  Wish I had more of an opinion on it, but after about 2 weeks and a handful of uses, it doesn&#x27;t want to stay on, and if it does, it&#x27;s only a minute at a time.  I&#x27;ve had lots of Conair products in the past and most all of them turn out to be sh!t.  I skipped another iron I wanted to buy because this one was cheaper, but it&#x27;s true, you get what you pay for, and I still end up out $20!</li>
            <li> Nice big barrel. Smooths my hair without putting too much curl in it.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best tool I have found for styling my hair!! It is a marvel at how quickly it manages to curl my ultra thick hair and make it look well groomed and styled.  I have not even used my straightener once since I got this!!</li>
            <li> After having my ceramic curling iron for 7 years, it finally died. Conair proved to do the job all these years so I just wanted to replace and still have the same great results. After doing my homework and reading reviews I took my chances on the infinti pro nano Tourmalin. It could not be more relieved this has turned out to be even better than my previous one. It leaves my hair smooth and my curls do last all day. As far as being user friendly, it heats up very fast, (man it is caplable of getting very hot!). I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the buttons as some reviews have stated. Also, i was very careful from the get go not to use the tip of the barrel for full contact, just the tip of my fingers for support, no biggie. I just hope it will last me as long as my previous curling iron. For the price, Why change to another brand when this one keeps improving? I totaly recomend and approve of it.</li>
            <li> Love the weight of this iron. It&#x27;s easy to pick up even with my arthritis, curls like a dream.  It&#x27;s perfect for someone with limited use of hands.</li>
            <li> Would use Seller again. Excellent product as stated.</li>
            <li> I hit the off button too...but just as described. I am a fan of Conair.</li>
            <li> Love this model - just need to periodically replace over the years.  I guess my continuous buying says it all - not another on the market that works as well for thick coarse straight hair.</li>
            <li> Piece of crap. Stopped working after 3 uses, but it conveniently waited to crap out on me after the eligible return date. Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and packaged great. Bought as a gift so cant say on quality yet.</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is a great curling iron. I tend to leave curling irons perched precariously on the edge of my bathroom counter after I&#x27;m done with them which leads to a lot of broken curling irons - not this one. It&#x27;s very well made! It heats up in like 2 minutes. It has multiple heat settings so you don&#x27;t fry your hair. I have elbow length hair and this iron is great for me. It might not be ideal for shorter hair because the barrel is so large.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many hair styling tools and my hair holds pretty well, and the Conair Infiniti Pro 1.5 inch barrel was the most ineffective tool I&#x27;ve ever used.  Curls lasted 5 minutes, if that, and then fell immediately; I would have to restyle multiple times throughout the day (i.e. on a weekend attending brunch and then an evening cocktail party) and the curls just wouldn&#x27;t hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically don&#x27;t even need to use product because my hair holds really well, but I blasted with hairspray multiple times and the curls STILL fell-- looked like I rolled out of bed and didn&#x27;t style my hair at all.</li>
            <li> Shut off switch is right where your hand is</li>
            <li> This iron does heat up fast and gets very hot. It also produces very natural, healthy-looking results, unlike metal irons I&#x27;ve used in the past that give hair a dry, fried appearance. I had no problems with pressing the buttons while using the iron, and the piece in the middle that allows the iron to rest on the counter is better than most--very stable, no sliding around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that the clamp is too thick and does not open wide enough, which produces creases in the hair. Even when I hold the clamp all the way open and only use the barrel to curl, the hair that slides more than halfway up the barrel ends up getting lines on it just from touching the clamp. Also, when I wrap my hair around the entire iron with the clamp closed, it produces lines in the hair that is on the inside of the curl. And when I use it as intended, with the clamp holding the outside of the curl, lines appear at the top of the curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thin, fine hair, which should be the easiest to avoid these problems. If you have a lot of hair, it will be impossible to avoid them because you will not be able to keep your hair at the end of the barrel and away from the clamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter what I do and how careful I am, my hair still ends up getting creases in it. It&#x27;s really a shame because otherwise, I love this iron. I would give it 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t crease my hair, but it&#x27;s pretty much useless since it does. Huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this at a major beauty chain for a lower price, but it&#x27;s going back this weekend.  I got the 1 1/2\\&quot; size, which, it turns out, offers absolutely no curl for my thick, below-shoulder length naturally wavy hair.  It actually seems to straighten it more than curl, which is odd since I&#x27;ve used this size in the past with better curl results.      As other reviewers have said, this is designed just terribly.  The controls are at EXACTLY the spot you put your hands while you&#x27;re curling, which means in the two times I used it, I turned the iron off about 15 times and adjusted the heat haphazardly another 20.  In fact, the second time I used it, I just gave up halfway through and put it aside to return.  It&#x27;s THAT annoying.  The worst part is that the stay-cool tip of the iron is so short that even it is not an alternative place to put your hands.  So if you&#x27;re sleepily doing your hair in the morning (as I often do), plan on burning yourself at least seven or eight times.    So glad I kept my receipt, and am going to spring for something laid out a lot better.</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best curling iron I have ever owned and I have owned a zillion of them.  It holds your hair firmly but still let&#x27;s it slide without damage to your hair.  I use the highest setting and my waves last all day.  I like the cover that comes with it so I can put my hot curling iron away withouth waiting for it to cool down.  The long cord makes it possible to use just about anywhere.  It is a quality product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for those perfect curls</li>
            <li> Love it! Heats up fast and works well. Good for the price.</li>
            <li> This iron heats very fast &amp; works well. My only complaint is that when you put it down the hot part tips forward which will burn whatever it&#x27;s on. So I recommend keeping it on a something heatproof. Maybe a glass type plate or mirror.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron. Works great on this hair too! I curl my hair just about every other day!!! AMAZING!</li>
            <li> This item disappointed in how it does not curl hair at all. My hair just slips off the barrel after releasing the clip and it is barely even warm when I touch it. Needless to say that there was no curl created. I was hoping it would work wonders as others had stated-but I must have gotten a dud. :-( Tried to like it but I can only give it 1 star.</li>
            <li> This is the best curling iron I&#x27;ve owned. I previously bought a Hot Tools curling iron (for $60) with a 1 1/4&amp;#34; barrel. It didn&#x27;t really curl my hair correctly, the sections I curled came out looking more like spirals without a lot of body. I realized I needed a iron with a wider barrel and this was perfect. It creates big loose waves, instead of a ringlet effect. It has auto shut off which I liked better than the Hot Tools iron, I would be paranoid at work all day if I thought I had left it on. With this one I don&#x27;t even worry if I accidentally left it on (although I still always check!) plus it was a much better deal.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron. There are none like it in South Africa so I ordered it off Amazon. It arrived so quickly and I just adore it. It&#x27;s absolutely perfect. Styles so well and the curls are gorgeous. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> i have thick coarse curly Persian hair and all my life i wanted sleek bouncy hair. i went to great lengths to do this including at home straightening chemicals(lasted 2 days)rolling my hair in big plastic curlers every night and sitting under a beauty parlor style hair dryer i got at a yard sale, blow drying  little sections for hours using expensive de-frizzing creams, and using an actual clothing iron to no avail. well, when ceramic straighteners came available on the market at a reasonable price a few years ago i was like hallelujah, it worked pretty good but i still had to curl the ends which was time consuming. well i just tried out  my new infiniti ceramic curling iron and cannot praise it enough. it not only curls your hair perfectly with staying power, but also managed to straighten and smooth my hair simultaneously and twice is fast as my ceramic straightener. this is my first review on amazon just because i am soooo impressed. oh and i did accidentally turn off the button once or twice, but you get the hang of it pretty quickly. no biggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. i am not a fake reviewer hired by the company. i just wanted to add that because they piss me off and have made me weary of trusting reviews on amazon.</li>
            <li> So far it seems pretty good. I actually like the ones that my hair slips easier on and I like the ones with just one heat setting. It is hard to keep the setting on one number as you turn it. Next time I would get the next size larger.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite curling iron. I have hair a little passed my shoulders and this gives me big pretty curls with lots of volume. The clamp holds the hair pretty tight without creasing. The only thing I would change is the power button location. I accidentally turn it off every time and don&#x27;t notice until I realize my hair isn&#x27;t curling. Other than that.... Love it!</li>
            <li> Ordered this item from the seller Ace Photo Digital with free super saving shipping, arrived in a timely fashion. First off this was not the same as advertised. The description says new, and this was obviously used - ther were scuff marks and scratches on the ceramic iron parts and little pieces of hair on it. There was a funky smell that emanated from it right out of the box like burned electrical or something, but I still plugged it in to use anyway, and when the smell was still dominant, I decided to put it away, and that&#x27;s when I noticed no barrel cover and found it was pre-owned or a customer return.   Next, I noticed this model number was described as CD109bn and I got CD109. What&#x27;s the difference? Well for starters the manufacture date on the metal plug was 2003, so this was a very old stock piece, made of a rubberized type black handle, these type eventually become sticky and wear out. Out dated manufacturing date means without a receipt, there is no warranty which expires in 3 years. The newer model which I locally purchased has a shiny plastic handle, is manufactured 06-11 which is fine if I lose the receipt, because the warranty is 5 years on the newer models. Plus the plastic handle will last me for years. Additionally, the newer models have improved power buttons which I agree with other reviewers that the iron so easily shuts off accidentally - it was way too sensitive.   One thing to note, the 2003 model I received had a very long cord so that stylists could use it in a salon, where as the newer one I bought has a shorter cord by 2 feet.   I emailed the amazon seller and was replied that I need to contact customer service at amazon since it was shipped by amazon. When I called them, they offered to reship me another at the current selling price and credit me when I return this one, but when it came down to ordering, somehow my address was blocked??? Yeah, the message on the screen says this item cannot be shipped to the stated adress, please select adifferent shipping address or remove this item. Imagine that! Granted I live in a US territory, so I am limited to what will be shipped here, but how co you go from shipping to me and no longer a week later? I&#x27;m miffed. I may just contact con air directly about this, unfair selling of old outdated items on amazon with missing parts.  The iron itself? I love it! I have the 1 1/4 inch size, and with longer hair I needed a larger barrel so it is why I ordered a 1 1/2 inch size in the first place. It holds the curl for a while only when I use hairspray, but otherwise, it would fall flat, almost like I used a smooth iron in my hair, regardless, I always receive complimetns on my hair and o tell everyone it is the conair iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various curling irons over the years from various brands and of varying widths. ALL have performed better than this model. I had no problem with the placement of the buttons, however I did have a problem with it not curling my hair at all! My hair is naturally completely straight and the most this curling iron did to my hair was make it lean a little to the side. Definitely returning this one.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t heat up as well as my older model but it does the job. I have been an Infiniti fan for years for how well curls hold in my thick asian hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and can make very loose curls/waves with this curling iron.  Heats up super fast but doesn&#x27;t seem to hold curls very well.  I&#x27;ve used it twice and the results were the same.</li>
            <li> I like this. It smooths and curls.  I&#x27;m careful to keep the heat fairly low but like how quickly it heats up and it ready to go.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this curling iron because I have the Infiniti You Curl and love it - so I thought I&#x27;d probably love this as well! The design is just like the &amp;#34;you curl&amp;#34;, except of course it has the clamp! I took out the screws on mine and turned it into a wand. I love how hot these curling irons get and how quickly they heat up! They seem to hold curls very well, especially if you use the highest setting!  I&#x27;ve loved this so far! I think the barrel size might be just a little big for what I wanted, but that just means I&#x27;ll buy the next size down as well!</li>
            <li> Works great. Love that it comes with a cover for when I&#x27;m done especially since I have a four yr old.</li>
            <li> Works great on the second highest temp. Saves my hair from high heat. My hair is naturally wavy and I would much rather use this 1 1/2 inch rather than a flat iron. Makes my hair smooth with just the right amount of body.</li>
            <li> This would be a good product except for the design flaws.  The on/off switch is located right on the handle where you are turning and twisting to curl and you ultimately end up turning it off.  But you don&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s off and keep on styling and wonder why it&#x27;s not curling, then swear, then turn back on and have to set to the right temperature -- at least three times during one styling.  Didn&#x27;t they have someone use it before they produced it?</li>
            <li> I HAVE LONG STRAIGHT HAIR AND BOUGHT THIS TO MAKE SOME WAVES IN MY HAIR...WELL IT DID NOTHING AT ALL JUST MADE IT LIMP AND FLAT......I THINK THIS WOULD BE A GOOD ITEM FOR SOMEONE WITH LONG CURLY HAIR SO IT WOULD STRAIGHTEN IT OUT FOR THEM IF THEY WANTED THAT LOOK....BIG DISAPPOINTMENT...</li>
            <li> This iron works great! It gets very hot and curls my thick hair in about 15-20 seconds. I am very satisfied with this curling iron!</li>
            <li> Love love love it. It makes my hair feel and look silky. It&#x27;s a great size for big curls. Very happy</li>
            <li> I have had this curling iron for a few years now, and it&#x27;s still going strong. As other reviewers have said, it heats up quickly, curls very nicely, and is all-in-all a solid buy, especially for the price. But, alas, the on/off button is in a very unfortunate location. I used to turn it off a lot without realizing it, but I have adjusted to the location and make sure to mind the button. If you&#x27;re willing to overlook that, you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> love that it heats up quickly and covers a lot of surface area of my hair, gets hair done faster!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all for anything that makes my wife happy, and this definitely does. I&#x27;m also all over those curls this thing produces. If she&#x27;s happy with it I&#x27;m happy with it. It seems to heat up quick and definitely does a great job.</li>
            <li> The barrel creates really loose waves, not curls.  However, my hair tends to look dry on the ends, and this iron some how made the ends look MUCH better than they really do!  I was looking for tighter curls, but I actually like the loose waves quite a bit.  Earlier reviews mentioned that the power button was in an annoying position, I did not find this to be so.  I also read that there was no \\&quot;tip\\&quot; to hold onto and that reviewers were burning themselves.  The iron that I received, does have a hard plastic tip, but it isn&#x27;t horribly large, so I did bump the actual iron with my fingers more than once. Overall though, it makes my hair (fine, medium length, curly/wavy) hair look great, at a great price!</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews about this curling iron and it seemed like a great one to purchase.  Mine seems to shut off too soon [it is a safety mechanism built in] and I have put it on the highest temperature and still not satisfied with the curl.  It is possible I have a defective one since so many others found it a good item.  Check the product again to see if anyone else had trouble with this iron.</li>
            <li> I did burn my finger once when rushing but I like this iron.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s working well for me considering first time curling my hair by myself..and the switch dsen&#x27;t bother me</li>
            <li> This was a replacement to the first one that I owned for 8+ years.  The automatic shut off is a great feature to have especially if you are like me &amp; walk away forgetting to shut it off.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I bought - one for home and one for my office.</li>
            <li> It is really great! I brought lots of similar product and this is my favorite one!</li>
            <li> Nice. I should have replaced my old one sooner. Best price.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and is easy to use.  I usually buy Chi products, but this one is just as good, if not better.</li>
            <li> Great value for the cheap cost. Works great on my long hair, exactly as advertised . Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> I really like this curling iron!  It has worked grear so far.  It holds on to my hair well and gets hot enough to curl my very thick hair.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I use it on the coolest setting and it works great. The end does get a little warm so I avoid touching it all together.</li>
            <li> Used this curling iron for the first time yesterday and I have to say that I love it!  I curl my hair often and until now I used a Conair Instant Heat curling iron.  This iron is so much easier to use, and it really feels like it&#x27;s smoothing your hair, not gripping or pulling.  The 1 1/2 inch size is great too, especially for those with long hair.  I didn&#x27;t use any hairspray so the curls fell out over the course of the day, but my hair just looked like it had been blown dry really well.</li>
            <li> Both of the other curling irons I own are by Conair and have never really had an issue with them. I wanted a bigger barrel and purchased this one. I tried it twice and like my subject line mentions &amp;#34;Maybe my hair just wasn&#x27;t long enough?&amp;#34; for this iron to give me the effects I was looking for. It didn&#x27;t really seem that hot either, I am not sure if that is from it being a ceramic iron or not, but I did return this product.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the perfect curling iron to create those pretty beachy waves on my long hair and I am so happy that I finally found it!</li>
            <li> This curling iron is being returned.  The number one reason is that the on/off switch&#x27;s design and placement is awful.  I turned it off several times without noticing right away.  Another thing I didn&#x27;t like is that there&#x27;s no indicator for when it has reached the temperature.  Also, the \\&quot;cool tip\\&quot; still gets a bit hot.  And last but certainly not least, the CURLS DID NOT LAST!!  I tried a few of the temperature settings and my curls were falling out before I was even done with all my hair!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work! Not what I expected</li>
            <li> Great service and wonderful product!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this curling iron to replace a Revlon ceramic I&#x27;d had for a couple of years that finally died, leaving me in a lurch for an event that evening. I quickly read some online reviews, then went to Target, who had it on sale. I brought it home and immediately plugged it in and used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s: Heats up quickly, but you&#x27;d better remember to use the tiny buttons above the power button to set the temp!&lt;br /&gt;  Turns off when not used for a while, which is a very important feature for us, since we are constantly forgetting to turn curling irons off.&lt;br /&gt;  The barrel seems to be smooth and offers a nice curl when used on fine to semi-thick hair. Not good for thick hair though, it does nothing for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s: All the other negative remarks regarding the lame button design and the weird temperature buttons.. I would have to say I totally AGREE! I hit the on button to heat it up, come back to use it and accidentally hit the button again, turning it off... PAIN in the derriere! I&#x27;d like to add two other really important negative remarks that I&#x27;ve not seen in other reviews, that I now really wish I&#x27;d seen BEFORE purchasing this iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  First thing I did was get some of my long hair caught in the screws Conair used to attach the clip to the iron. RIDICULOUS design flaw! There are now several hairs imbedded in the screws that USED to be in my head. Every time I use this iron it happens, unless I take an extremely small section of hair to curl and I don&#x27;t dare move the iron to one side or the other. I like my hair, and I&#x27;d like to keep it where it belongs, not ripped out by the roots by two screws that are so big and cumbersome, you will not be able to help getting your hair caught in them at some point. I&#x27;ve done what I could to mitigate the damage, but this morning, it happened again, so I&#x27;m pretty much done dealing with this iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Secondly, THE SMELL...a weirdly horrible smell comes up regardless of how clean my hair is, what products I use, or don&#x27;t use. It is horribly unpleasant, and it does not matter what heat setting it&#x27;s on and it always causes this smell of nearly burnt hair, but my hair isn&#x27;t actually burnt. It sometimes lingers for minutes to hours and I can&#x27;t stand it anymore! I thought maybe it was just my hair, but it happens with my 9 and my 12 year old, who use different shampoos and no products. It&#x27;s SO BAD, that this morning I finally sat down at the computer to write this review. I hate this curling iron, and it&#x27;s going out in the garbage today. Bye bye Conair, back to Revlon ceramic for me! In fact, I probably won&#x27;t own a single Conair product after this one goes in the trash. $30.00 down the drain..products I use, or don&#x27;t use.

            <li> Great curling iron. It gets hot very quick. Good Price quality relation.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend not to use with fresh washed hair, the curls do not last the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Conair&#x27;s Infiniti tools and only gave this curling iron 3 stars because the size was way bigger than I expected and therefore difficult to use. Other than that, it&#x27;s pretty sturdy and works really well. Would recommend if you need something this big or have very long hair.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, but works great!</li>
            <li> got this for my wife and she likes it.  It heats up fast, but she doens&#x27;t like how the power button is a button and not, say, a switch, or perhaps move the power button, as she accidentally turns it off sometimes.  Probably just needs getting used to.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron! i have very thick wavy hair that never wants to do what i want it to! This curling iron gives me just the right lift and it tames my frizzy waves! PLus my hair slides so gently around it that it never snags and doesn&#x27;t pull out any of my hair! It&#x27;s wonderful. I would say my one and only complaint is that the cool touch tip isn&#x27;t very big. I have 2 toddlers and often have to do  my hair while they are running around and i have touched the iron instead of the cool tip on several occations, but as long as you are careful and pay attention to what you are doing this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem with you.</li>
            <li> Product works great and is a good quality product and matched description.  I would buy it again in a heart beat.</li>
            <li> Heats quickly, gets very hot, curls nicely - it does everything it is supposed to. The only issue I have with it is that the cord could be longer. Aside from that, it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> Good quality. Heats up fast and does make a long lasting curl!</li>
            <li> Disappointed with this curling iron. The end tip is too narrow and you bun your fingers trying to hold it.&lt;br /&gt;You can grab it while you are rolling your hair onto it.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is very easy to use and gives quick and lasting results.  The tip provides for good protection against accidental finger burning and the shield allows you to store it promptly after use.  I bought one for myself and now got another one for my mother.  My hair is fine and wavy, I use the lowest temperature settings and tried the  iron with several styling products: it works all the time</li>
            <li> For the price this is a good curling iron.  I&#x27;ve had it for 3 weeks though and I am currently looking to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Heats quickly&lt;br /&gt;- Remains consistently hot&lt;br /&gt;- Has a relatively high temperature so it works on hard to curl hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- After using about 10 times, there is a noticeable difference in the spring.  When I first received it, it held easily onto my hair, even in small sections.  Now I have to take larger sections.&lt;br /&gt;- My hair tangles around the screw.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s not a seamless transition from the iron to the top plastic piece.  The hair that wraps towards the top gets stuck once out of every 3-4 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curling is by no means terrible, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone that curls their hair regularly.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 60s, and I hate spending time messing with my hair, so I decided to try this wide-barreled curling iron.  I have shoulder-length hair, and I can just wash it, let it dry, and when it&#x27;s convenient I can touch it up in a couple of minutes and look presentable.  No half hour blow-dry sessions or rollers...priceless.</li>
            <li> Makes beautiful, smooth, big curls. Curling iron heats up in seconds and cools down faster than most. I love it!</li>
            <li> Just the perfect size for my hair length.</li>
            <li> It gets hot right away and works well. I dont like where the buttons are placed. Good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> This seems like a quality iron, and I love the fact that it has an automatic shut off function. FYI: The time allotment is one hour, for the automatic shut off. It also has a low setting for fine hair.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron. I have fine hair and the heat settings are just what I needed. The heat guard/stand that came with the curling iron keeps the hot iron off the counter during after use cool down...brilliant!</li>
            <li> I have to agree with the other reviewers that the tip is too small or the wrong shape. I usually burn my fingers when holding the iron. It helps if I hold it with my index finger on the middle of the tip. Also, for some reason, it doesn&#x27;t seem to grab my hair well enough. My hair just slides through. It seems to work better for me as a flat iron. Other than that, I like that it heats up fast, reduces the frizz, and makes my hair shine.</li>
            <li> I have the 1 1/4&amp;#34;, but needed 1 1/2&amp;#34; for my new style.  Like that my fingers don&#x27;t accidently turn the iron off or change the heat setting.  Also, nice plastic cover for travel is included.</li>
            <li> Crap. Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve sprayed my hair with hair spray, tried putting in products before drying, after drying- seems like no matter what I do, I cannot get the curls to stay in my hair for more than 20 minutes.  I&#x27;ve adjusted the heat settings and that seemed to make my hair not curl at all.  I was hoping to use this for family pictures. I curled my hair- went to the photography session and my hair is not curly at all in any of my photos.  It was a nice day out as well- so weather had noting to do with it.</li>
            <li> When I read &amp;#34;perfect for traveling&amp;#34; I understood it could work in any country, any situation... But it is not dual voltage! And now, I need to use an adapter to use it.</li>
            <li> my hair is very hard to curl but this gave it some type of bend i wish it curled more and stayed, so my hair won&#x27;t be so straight it does smooth the hair and shines it a little overall maybe it will work even better for those whose hair curls better and it gets hot nicely</li>
            <li> It sucks! It doesn&#x27;t even curl hair all it does is wave the hair in a horrible way. And it always burns your fingers</li>
            <li> I like this curling iron a lot.  Heats up immediately.  I have very fine hair, and it really &amp;#34;grabs&amp;#34;.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the short plastic on the end.  You have to be very careful or else it will burn your fingers even on the low setting.</li>
            <li> This is too large to make decent curls, not what I expected from a hair curler.  It seems to work better for straightening with a slight curl on the end, but very difficult to get a controlled wave anywhere else.  Maybe I just don&#x27;t know how to use it properly!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t burn my hair! I love how you can set this to different temps, making it pretty versatile and will suit your needs.</li>
            <li> The best curling iron I have owned and I have been through about 10 of them.  Don&#x27;t let the cheap cost take away from the fact that it gives the best curls with minimal frizz</li>
            <li> it is far better than i could have hoped!</li>
            <li> Super awesome for long hair, leaves my hair Volumous and curly! Great purchase, highly recommend. Good quality product.</li>
            <li> pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Awesome seemingly even heat! This thing gets real hot, yow yow!&lt;br /&gt;- love the 1.5 inch size, big lovely sexy curls.&lt;br /&gt;- hair seems to handle the heat pretty well and seem more shiny after curling. I&#x27;m attributing this to the ceramic and tourmaline characteristics of the curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t notify you when it&#x27;s done heating up. just wave your hand over it and if this baby is radiating heat, I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s when you&#x27;re good to start?&lt;br /&gt;- placement of buttons is terrible! Whoever came up with that idea at Conair apparently hasn&#x27;t tried using this. Derp.&lt;br /&gt;- there are screws holding the clamp to the barrel that have recently started snagging my hair and pulling out 2-3 strands every time I curled a section!!! OW?? I&#x27;m debating just unscrewing the stupid clamp and just using this as a wand but I specifically bought this iron so that I could have an iron with a clamp. How utterly disappointing.</li>
            <li> It is a decent curling iron; it gets pretty hot but not as hot as my straightener.&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit disappointed because the clamp is not very tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a tight clamp, keep looking.</li>
            <li> Due to the size of this curling iron, this does not curl well for long straight hair. (fyi, I am asian). If I curl it, I have to let it go and hold it with my hand for it to really stay. I suggest you get a  1 - 1 1/4 inch.</li>
            <li> Works great!&lt;br /&gt;It heats up really quick. One convenient feature is after use you can put it into its cover without having to let it cool.&lt;br /&gt;Also has a really long cord.</li>
            <li> It heats up really well and it&#x27;s super easy to use. My onl con is that it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough but that&#x27;s my own fault for not picking a hotter product.</li>
            <li> Does not heat up well and stay hot, nor holds my hair in the clip to the end, as I pull the hair down to curl at the ends, the clip is not tight to the barrel and slips out. Not happy with this item.</li>
            <li> Infiniti Professional Nano Tourmaline Ceramic Curling Iron, 1 1/2-Inch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the hair .&lt;br /&gt;like it  for the big waves &amp;#62;</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, works great. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the buttons like other reviewers have mentioned, I think they&#x27;re far enough up where I can use it easily without accidentally pressing them</li>
            <li> This product does not heat up at all. Now I have to pay for postage to return this product.</li>
            <li> I like this curling iron.  It works well and gives my hair and pretty, wavy curl.  I&#x27;m pretty easy to please with these kinds of things, as long as they don&#x27;t break.  This gets the job done and was the right price.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product for people with short hair maybe at shoulder length. I bought this product when i had super long hair. My hair was pass my hips and maybe a little longer. When i used to curl my long hair with this product, my hair would curl but it never stayed very long..then one day i cut my hair to donate n now its a little below my shoulder n i just love how the curling iron works with my hair. It curls and it stays almost all day</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the barrel is short, however I wish the black tip was longer as I have slipped many times and burned my fingertips.</li>
            <li> The curling iron doesn&#x27;t clamp your hair tight enough to get a good curl.  The tip of the curling iron that you hold to curl is to short and I have burned myself every time I use it.  Also it&#x27;s easy to turn it off accidentally when your curling your hair because of the on off switch.  Would be great if it had an auto shutoff.  Should have returned it!</li>
            <li> Gets really hot and get&#x27;s the job done! It also heats really fast, which is nice... there&#x27;s little wait time. If you&#x27;re looking to make big fat curls or nice beachy waves, this is a good buy. I&#x27;ve had it now for over a year and it&#x27;s still working perfectly!</li>
            <li> Buy this and you will have burned fingers,  Do not recommend. Cap on end too small.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> great curling iron, nice medium curls</li>
            <li> Great for curly hair.  Hair stays smooth, even in high humidity.  I have tried so many products that did not work.  This was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews &amp; checking out sites like Good Housekeeping &amp; others I decided not to spend a lot &amp; try this one.&lt;br /&gt;Most sites said for the price this was a good choice &amp; it is.  It seemed the other ones with similar features were considerably higher cost so I thought I didn&#x27;&#x27;t have much to lose with this one &amp; I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this for 2 months and I am very happy with how lightweight it is and how it works. The feel of my hair is great no more looking and feeling dry &amp; burnt.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback for me is I tend to hold onto the tip of the barrel &amp; this one doesn&#x27;t have enough coverage for me to hold onto, I&#x27;ve burnt my fingers twice. other than that I highy recommend it especially for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong!!!</li>
            <li> This little guy is good quality and do its job. I bought it for my wife and it is good product. Also it was on sale and I was lucky get it on time. Simple to use. Of course don&#x27;t forget use it in a safer way.</li>
            <li> Was not worth the purchase. Did not work. Never turned on.... Meaning it never heated. Waste of money. The product did not work as the merchant says it does.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was going to work fine but the curler is not tight enough and it doesnt grasp my hair tight enough to make the curls . The good thing about it is i like the way it heats up real quick and the temp is perfect.</li>
            <li> The curling part works great, but as others have noted, the end is too small and it&#x27;s easy to burn your fingers. It&#x27;s not only small, but it it&#x27;s dome-shaped which means the only way to actually hold it is where it meets the metal. Bad design. If I had to do it again, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this one.</li>
            <li> I had the same one from many many years ago but I gave it to my mom because hers broke. After spending days researching all other curling irons, I ended up purchasing the same one. I LOVE temperature control; I have very fine straight hair and I set it to the lowest settings, which it curls it perfectly. Its easy to use and it is a great and cheap investment that will last for manyyyyyy years! It also heats up really fast in my opinion.</li>
            <li> When my old Infiniti curling iron died, I was happy to find this updated version.  A 1.5&amp;#34; barrel works great on my thick, layered hair and this size isn&#x27;t easy to find.  This heats up quickly, the cord doesn&#x27;t twist and the cover lets me put it away immediately after use.  Good price, too!</li>
            <li> So far, this seems to be a good curling iron.  My hairdresser recommended a Tourmaline product.  It heats up very quickly!!</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron to replace one that I had for a very long time.  The off button is so sensitive and right where your hand goes to do your hair that you inadvertently turn it off.  I thought it was just an issue with the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; light until I went on line to check out the instructions and found another review with exactly the same issue.  I returned it the next day.</li>
            <li> No complaints at all with this curling iron. Heats quickly, easy to use and I love that it has multiple settings. The swivel cord is a great feature and my hair is curled and smooth every time. Hoping its a workhorse and will last for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> I love my curling iron I get nice big curls and heats up fast. The long cord is great too.</li>
            <li> Barely made a slight wave, no curl what so ever. I&#x27;ll stick with using my flat iron to get curls</li>
            <li> Beautiful curls.  Quick and efficient.  Home iron died, so bought this to replace.  Loved so much, through out my travel iron and bought a second one of these!</li>
            <li> Wife loved it..Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am a creature of habit and when I find something I like, I stay with it forever.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is the greatest curling iron in the universe!  I used it for YEARS before it finally started pooping out.  I couldnt find the same one at my local stores and kept trying other ones and kept returning them to the store.  I went to the official website and found it but decided to just see if Amazon had one and sure enough, I was able to get it here brand new for a fraction of the price!  So I expect it will last me another zillion years.  I love the simple &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34; as the movable wire ones get in the way.  The heat control is easy and perfect and the iron heats QUICKLY and  I also appreciate the automatic shut off because unfortunatley on occasion, I do forget to shut it off.   The swivle cord is super easy to deal with and I love the way it grips my hair.  Other irons I seem to fumble with like on those bad infomercials where the dude cant pour milk without the easy to use spout or whatever. lol  But seriously, this iron is durable and so easy to work with.  I don&#x27;t enjoy &amp;#34;getting ready&amp;#34;.  It has become a chore that I just want to be quick and easy so I LOVE anything that helps me to getter done!  Sooo dig this iron!!</li>
            <li> I bought this size and the next one down in 2008 for a cruise.  Both worked really well until recently.  The temperatur button only gives a green light.  Before I would use it for the 300 heat.  Do  I need to buy a new one?  Reach me at betty45890@gmail.com.</li>
            <li> This iron works well, heats up fast and leaves nice big curls in my hair.  The flaw I have noticed, that is really annoying is the control buttons are on the handle right where your hold you hand, so unless you make an effort not to hit the buttons, it is easy to constantly be turing it off and adjusting the temp when you dont want to!  I would say that it is possible to find an iron in the same price range that works just as well that doesn&#x27;t have this problem.  I&#x27;m not sure why the manufacturer would not think of this...?</li>
            <li> this curling iron is amazing!!!!! i love the big sexy curls and bounce it gives my hair! who ever says it doesn&#x27;t work must not no how to curl hair properly cause i get amazing result! so its the perfect size and has excellent  heat settings and gets hot in about 15 seconds! i do have long hair but tried this on my sisters short hair and worked great it gave her lots of volume! i love it! price is amazing too!</li>
            <li> Great product -- my mistake was getting one too large. But it heats quickly and works well.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> This curling iron was the size I needed and works great! I am very happy with my purchase. The package arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> the best and the price was great.  I spent so much money on another brand that does the same thing</li>
            <li> I have long (almost reaching my waist), fine hair, and this didn&#x27;t work at all for me.  I would leave it on for a long while and still my hair would remain limp.  My hair would even smell scorched right away, but still no change.  I tried several hair products, such as heat protectors and sprays, but nothing.  Also with a lot of hair, little hair, short hair, and nothing. Eventually, for the sake of my hair, I gave up on it and it is now gathering dust in some drawer.</li>
            <li> I really liked it at first but now it turns off while I&#x27;m curling my hair and I had it for a little bit of time really disappointed</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant because of some of the reviews of this product saying it doesn&#x27;t heat up, turns off etc. but I love it! Especially for the price. It creates big, loose curls and makes my hair shiny. I have long hair so I could use the wrap around method without burning my fingers, I didn&#x27;t touch the black guard part on the end though. I would definitely still buy it knowing what I know now!</li>
            <li> Even the lowest setting kinks &amp;  burns hair.</li>
            <li> This is good, works better than my big barrel Conair models (which don&#x27;t hold curls as long AND break every couple of months due to a flawed cord) but this is not as good as the slimmer barrel Infiniti which I got first and was very impressed by. Still, good compromise between price and quality.</li>
            <li> I like this curling iron specifically because it doesn&#x27;t have a collapse able rest.  Those always fold up and the curling iron falls.  These stay put.</li>
            <li> I love this iron... great big curls!</li>
            <li> This is the second one.  The first lasted over ten years and hopefully so will this one!</li>
            <li> Great~ Love it use it every day!</li>
            <li> DOES WHAT IT NEEDS TO DO, SQUEAKS A LOT AND DOES NOT HEAT UP TOO WELL, BUT IT STILL GETS OUT MY FRIZZIES . WILL NOT ORDER THE SAME IF IT BREAKS, BUT IM NOT MAD AT IT ;)</li>
            <li> I have super long, pretty thick hair &amp; this curling iron is fabulous! I have the 1&amp;#34; version as well, but really wanted bigger, looser curls. With a variety of heat settings, I can get exactly the look I&#x27;m wanting without any hassle whatsoever. It heats extremely quickly &amp; my curls last til I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> works well... ugh don&#x27;t know why they require me to write a story when I just want to give 5 stars</li>
            <li> I am impressed with this curling iron!  VERY high quality and easy to use.  The black tip doesn&#x27;t get hot, but the ceramic gets hot enough to curl your hair in seconds with even heat throughout the barrel.  This was a very good deal.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product. The small black end that you are suppose to hold with your fingers gets extremely hot! I have a blister on my index finger to prove it. Really bad design.</li>
            <li> I really like this curling iron. I like that you can change the tempature and the price was great! It curls very good. I read a lot of reviews about it before I bought it which made me concerned about where the on off switch was. It doesn&#x27;t bother me where they are. I haven&#x27;t accidently turned it off. It is a great curling iron. I would recommend that you buy it.</li>
            <li> Excellent AND easy to use!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to do beautiful, silky and frizz-free boucles.</li>
            <li> Whether at home or traveling, my wife uses this curling iron everyday. I would definitely replace it with the same one again if it did fail. I cannot count how many times it has been dropped and all the functions still work as they did the day I bought it for her.</li>
            <li> It will not curl or wave my hair at all!</li>
            <li> so, yes... the other iron i had for over 25 years had a large enough end piece that when i used it to move the styler or hold it while doing the curling, there was no burning.  and yes, i have experienced that burning thing with this iron on my fingertips a few times.&lt;br /&gt;but then, i guess when we are putting an appliance of 300-400 degrees up to our head, if we use our hands on it to steady it, etc.... then, yes, we must expect that burns are an occasional possibility.  i&#x27;m ok with that... because  on the upside- because there is an upside to everything!... this is something ordinary metal curl irons CANNOT do... not sure if it is the &#x27;ionizing&#x27; feature or whatever they call it, but once you have used the iron on your hair, the hair definitely resists humidity.  i have naturally curly hair (can you say FRIZZZZ???)  AND live in Texas... so we know about humidity!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  now, if you have longer hair, you can&#x27;t expect nice curls from the big barrel irons... you have to get a smaller barrel... one inch (or less??) to have more of a curl impact on longer hair.  but i also love the shine this iron gives to hair and the quick results.  if you are ready to have a few fingertip burns over time as with ANY heat instrument close to your head is possible... this is a great one to have.  i would not have guessed that Conair would have made such a successful one, but guess what???!!!  they did.</li>
            <li> The right product at the right time. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Works great.  I had been buying professional curling irons for my wife and she said this works better.</li>
            <li> It is soooo handy I love it</li>
            <li> Really is a great product it actually adds shine to my curls without me adding any oils (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I have a smaller version of this curling iron and it works great. I can get some very lovely curls and even look like Shirley Temple if I wanted to. THIS one, however, did not work at all! It was terrible. No matter what setting I put it on, no matter how long or short I held my hair in it, no matter how much or how little hair I tried it on, it would not curl my hair. It just fell out completely flat, with only the end of my hair being left curled. Was practically a straightner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this size is just too thick to curl.</li>
            <li> Love that this doesn&#x27;t burn my hair! I really like the different temperatures. My hair is currently short, so I use a lower heat setting. But, as it grows, I have the option to use a higher heat to accommodate the extra hair. It glides well on my hair and the curl actually lasts--without crimp marks.</li>
            <li> I rarely take the time to write reveiws but was going thru some old purchases and wanted to voice my opinion.  I have had this for a year now and I love it.  It heats up very quickly.... curls my medium think hair very well... the curl lasts all night if I hold each group of hair about 10 seconds... I burned my finder once and learned to never do that again.... I have never accidentally turned it off as some other reviews noted.  This is a very good product and I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly decent curling iron for the price. It heats up very fast. It doesn&#x27;t have an auto shut off, which I didnt&#x27; like, because I ALWAYS forget to shut my curling iron off! The barrel is very thick, not good for curling bangs, you&#x27;ll need a thinner iron for that. But fairly decent iron.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Love this inexpensive curling iron!</li>
            <li> Conair Hair products are the worst. It will work well for few months and then it will stop working. When i asked couple of friends they had the same experience. Recently I bought a hair dryer and after 8 months it stopped working. When i called conair for warranty they asked me to send it to AZ with $7 in the pack (it will cost me 20$). Please dont trust Conair.</li>
            <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Great price compare to local stores&lt;br /&gt;2 day shipping</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron.  I use it as a smoothing iron and it works perfectly.  Also love the sleeve.  Works well for storing a hot iron when travelling.</li>
            <li> It may not be the best curling iron, but it works well. I like the heat control. You may just need to really turn the heat up to get the best waves. Well, overall, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Ordered this because my other large curling iron finally broke beyond repair (I was holding it together with rubber bands and duct tape ;o) So, I was looking for something the same size and hopefully a bit more durable - I had been buying Revlon styling wands but they do seem to fall apart pretty quickly with daily use.  I happened upon this Conair Infinity product and thought I would give it a try - the price was right and it was available through Amazon Prime.  I read the reviews and liked that users were saying that it smoothed their hair and stopped frizz even though I did not hold out much hope in that arena for myself.  I have VERY curly hair and no matter how I straighten or smooth it -- it ends up being frizzy and trying to curl up on me -- just doing the dishes or walking outside if the air has any humidity at all will cause my hair to freak out.  So, I am amazed by this product - it works quickly (I used to use two curling irons and a flat iron to get everything \\&quot;smoothed\\&quot;) -- but now I use this and only this curling iron! No frizz -- no fly-aways - my hair stays smooth and straightened in between shampoos -- I am almost 50 years old and this is a FIRST ;o)</li>
            <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t know how to use it, but it doesn&#x27;t work for me.. Watched videos on you tube and do everything as they advise, but no curls :((&lt;br /&gt;And also I think it is a little big for my shoulder length hair..</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron. Works great and heats up fast. Infiniti is a great brand, i have many of there products.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT! The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that this iron doesn&#x27;t make loose curls, it seems like it just curls the ends of my hair, but still works great regardless.</li>
            <li> Does not old a curl. Hate it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this curling iron. I already had one with a smaller barrel by Conair but this size is perfect for looser waves.</li>
            <li> I am on my second infiniti curling iron.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the spring snaps rather quickly.  It broke on my first curling iron in about a year, so I got a new one.  Yesterday I was doing my hair and it broke on the new curling iron.  I went to the store last night and got a different curling iron, not a consort.  Not happy with it, my hair kept snagging and it took a while to heat back up between curls.  So today I scoured the internet trying to find out how to order a replacement spring.  The consort website is not helpful but I finally found it somewhere else.  I ordered 2 springs figuring it will probably happen again sometime.  Other than that it is a great curling iron.  Best I have had and I have thick hair that is really long.  Doesn&#x27;t burn my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron. It works really well . My hair doesn&#x27;t stick to it all ..&lt;br /&gt;It curls my hair really good.</li>
            <li> This curling iron heats up quickly and has several temperature settings.  I use the lowest setting on my long fine hair and the curl lasts all day.  I love the heat shield.  It means I can put the iron away before it&#x27;s totally cooled down.</li>
            <li> Wife and daughter like this curler.  Highly recommended because good quality for reasonable price.  Fit and finish is great and heats pretty fast</li>
            <li> Bought one for my daughter and one for me.  Neither of us liked ours.  Doesn&#x27;t hold the hair tight enough when trying to curl.</li>
            <li> I liked it very much! Product arrived on time and perfect! Very nice! Beautiful and useful. I recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I Like It Because It Doesn&#x27;t Burn Your Hair As Bad As Other Curling Irons, But My Hair Stays Curled For A Short Amount Of Time With This Curling Iron😳</li>
            <li> My wife uses this so I&#x27;ll let her review it.&lt;br /&gt;I have medium thick, long layered hair that reaches almost the middle of my back.  I love the loose, voluminous curls and this barrel size is great for my hair to achieve that look.  I can style it to be a bit glamorous for going out or flatten the curls (with a straightener) a bit for a casual beachy waves.  Don&#x27;t worry you are not going to flatten the curls you just made.  Just quickly glide the straightener to relax the curls.  I get lots of body to my hair with this curling iron.  I also use this curling iron like a wand, just hold the clip open while you wrap your hair around the barrel.  You get a slightly different looking curl this way.  I have many hair curling tools but I find I reach for this Conair curling iron a lot and am happy with the results every time I use it. Before putting heat on my hair I use heat protecting spray which also helps my hair look smooth and shiny.  I put the heat to 360, which is the second highest setting.  Works great and I get the curls I want.</li>
            <li> It is just a curling iron and does what I expected.  I do like the sleeve that fits over a hot iron after you have finished so that you may pack it in your luggage and not have to wait until it cools.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, great price, love it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife since she didn&#x27;t have one and was using a straightening iron to curl her hair. I have never curled hair or anything but this doesn&#x27;t seem right to me so I got her this and she loves it. Does her hair alot more as well now so it&#x27;s a win for both of us.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It just plain does not work... perhaps its with my hair, Im not sure, Im not sure if this of a fault to the product, seeing as Ive never had any success with curling irons. The only thing that has ever worked for me is using a flat iron to curl my hair... so that is what Ill continue doing... returning this one unfortunately</li>
            <li> The curling part of it works great, but I accidentally turn it off all the time because of the placement of the on-off/switch.</li>
            <li> Great. No thero curling iron works on my hair !</li>
            <li> I feel like it takes along time to curl my hair. I have pretty thick long hair and it takes along time to actaully curl it. I wrap it around the barrel a lot and it seems like it doesnt work that great.&lt;br /&gt;Its okay but I feel like I should probably get a different one! haha But the size is good</li>
            <li> Great product.  Really does a beautiful job on all hair types.  Would purchase it for friends and family.  Great gift.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. It shipped on time, gives the perfect sized curls, heats fast and it&#x27;s just so great!! I&#x27;ve been looking for a good curling iron for a decent price for a long time because I always bought the really cheap ones that crap out after a month.  I must say I have lightly singed my fingers on the rod because the tip to hold it is a little too short like everyone has said. But it&#x27;s only happened twice because I&#x27;m not stupid and learned my lesson. But I don&#x27;t care either way. And when it comes to the &amp;#34;poor positioning&amp;#34; of the off switch. IT&#x27;S JUST FINE FOR ME. I used the curling rod on my weave all the time, not one time did I hit the button. Now granted that could be due to my curling technique or my large hands... BUT LADIES STOP COMPLAINING AND FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I love it :)</li>
            <li> I purchased the 1.5&amp;#34; barrel curler on Amazon for $19.  It&#x27;s a great value for the price and it does what it says: gives big loose curls/waves.  I already have a 1&amp;#34; barrel curler which creates much tighter curls but wanted a curler that created bigger volume/looser curls and this product does that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Heats up quickly: I think there are 3 heat settings so if you have fragile/delicate hair or harder to curl hair, you can choose the right setting for your curls.  My hair requires the highest heat setting to really keep a curl.&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with heat protective shield.  I love this and specifically looked for a curler that came with this because I wanted to be sure I could store the curler away immediately when I was finished with it.&lt;br /&gt;- Swivel tangle-free cord: This works as described.&lt;br /&gt;- Inexpensive: I purchased mine for $19 and have Amazon Prime so my item arrived in 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; tip at the top of the curler (plastic tapered rounded end) isn&#x27;t quite big enough for your hand to rest comfortably/grip so you can easily burn yourself if you&#x27;re not careful.  Conair should really extend the length and/or make this part non-tapered to give it more circumference (I have really small hands and have burned myself).  Definitely practice holding the curler before turning in on to see how best to grip it and/or think about getting a pair of heat-resistant gloves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral:&lt;br /&gt;- Button placement: Some reviewers have noted that they have accidentally shut off the curler due to the placement of the controls/buttons but I haven&#x27;t ever done this and if I did, it&#x27;s not an issue to reset the temperature.&lt;br /&gt;- Nano Tourmaline Ceramic: I can&#x27;t really tell if this &amp;#34;technology&amp;#34; has an effect but the curler curls and doesn&#x27;t seem to over fry my hair.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;I have EXTREMELY thick hair and found this curler to be only somewhat effective. I found it curled the ends of my fair well but did little to nothing towards my roots. I also feel that this curler singed the tips of my hair despite using product and heat-protectant. For $40-50, you can&#x27;t expect too much. This is a curler I only use of some occasions a couple times a month.</li>
            <li> This was a disappointing purchase for me. The buttons are awkwardly placed and it is very difficult to keep a grip on the end of the curler. I find that it rips out my hair near the spring mechanism. I have had a lot of drugstore level hot tools and this was one of the more expensive and the most disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a thicker curling iron for big curls and this one is perfect. Not to mention cheap!!! it works as good as my old expensive one. Great gift idea!</li>
            <li> So far this unit is performing as described on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I got myself a 1 1/2 inch and i Regret buying this. i have a long thin hair and it didnt work work for me. It will give u a nice wavy hair for less than 10 mins.. yes! less than 10 mins even if u put a gallon of hair spray on  your hair.. so disappointed</li>
            <li> This iron was terrible! It didn&#x27;t curl my hair and left kinks and lines in it. Do not recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> The plastic tip is very short so there is a good chance you will miss the plastic and touch the hot iron when styling.  Dangerous.  Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> Great natural looking curl, I curl my hair under but all the way to my scalp then brush it out and it looks gorgeous. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I had previously bough the Conair tapered curling wand, which I love, but wanted a second curling iron for bigger, looser curls.  I still prefer a wand, and thus followed my friend&#x27;s advice and unscrewed the clip to this one and use it was a wand.  Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> The curling iron turns off when I pick it up.  The only thing I can think of is... there must be a short in the swivel chord. Then the curling iron doesn&#x27;t seem to turn back on unless it has had a chance to cool down. I really like Conair products so I was disappointed to not have the iron ready on my time line and to always have to fuss with the plug, cord and switches.</li>
            <li> I purchased this iron mainly because of the size. A hairstyle I wanted to try on a blog had this listed as the tool. All and all it&#x27;s Fantasic. My only complaint is that due to the fact it&#x27;s tip isn&#x27;t a heat resistant as it claims it makes it hard to touch to tip to style right. So you have to work around that.</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron thinking it would create large curls and added volume.  My hair typically curls easily, but not with this curling iron.  It seems to heat up okay, but doesn&#x27;t work well with my hair, for some reason.  I went back to my old one.</li>
            <li> Terrible waste of money.  The clip does not hold my hair so I am unable to use it.</li>
            <li> My favorite curling iron. Gets super hot so be careful not to burn yourself, but just pay attention. My hair looks like it&#x27;s been done professionally when I use this curling iron. I bought one in 2010 and it lasted until 2015. I just bought a new one and am just as happy with my new curling iron.</li>
            <li> hair slides off,  turns off during use</li>
            <li> i like this curling iron so much it is bigger than i imagined so i liked that um i cant really complain it gets the job done too</li>
            <li> It gets hot super fast.  The end is somewhat too short for use. You have to be careful and I am VERY used to using an iron. My last iron did much better at the curls. This one doesn&#x27;t seem to give lasting curls.  Great for straightening look with a slight wave. Great as a back up but really was hoping for one that had lasting curls. I have super curly hair and my expectation was to have large defined curls.</li>
            <li> It is really good for hairstyling but just make sure you use hair spray and it takes time to curl your hair</li>
            <li> Bought it for myself, Heats up really quickly, awesome curls,I love it.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed- heats fast, easy to handle and a great price</li>
            <li> Takes more than 20 minutes to heat up and the curls fall out in 5 seconds literally! I was so excited to get this because I&#x27;d always used a wand but I wanted looser and more flawy curls but after trying it a couple of times I was nothing but disappointed. This has great reviews which is so ironic because I do not find any to be true. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!</li>
            <li> The tip gets extremely hot.  It&#x27;s cone tip design allow my fingers to slip straight to the iron.  I&#x27;ve used this iron 4 times and have burned myself every time.  I&#x27;ve been using curling irons for 30 years and this one is by far the worst.</li>
            <li> just doesn&#x27;t seem to hold the heat long enough to curl hair. Loved my old one,</li>
            <li> Well made, long lasting, doesn&#x27;t damage hair.</li>
            <li> I do burn my fingers a lot because the cool tip is so awkward. So i have to be careful. and my hair doesn&#x27;t hold the curl very well. maybe its just my hair.</li>
            <li> it works good. except that while your using it the buttons shut off because where you have to hold it and than you need to turn it back on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m torn about this product. I absolutely love this ceramic curling iron. I use it routinely and notice very little heat damage to my hair. It&#x27;s easy to use -- the hinge opens with the perfect amount of resistance and it holds the hair just tight enough to make the perfect curl, while not providing too much excessive heat which could be damaging. However, this is my fourth Conair curling iron and each one lasts just a little over one year, at which time the spring breaks. Otherwise, it&#x27;s in fine working condition and still looks brand new. I have tried calling Conair for a replacement spring and their solution is for me to pay to mail the unit back (~$10 in shipping) and they&#x27;ll mail me a replacement. This seems silly given that the curling iron only retails for $16 and it&#x27;s otherwise in perfect working condition. Ugh. Now I have to decide if it&#x27;s worth my efforts to package it up and mail back my old unit and go without a curling iron for a couple weeks just to save $5. Probably not. Alas, to the landfill it goes...</li>
            <li> Curling iron works great. Heats up quickly and makes nice curls in little time.  I would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> This curl iron is amazing, it curls so well without hairspray.  There is many setting on how hot you want your curl iron which is amazing because sometime you want gentle heat on your hair.  So I would definately reccomend this to friends and families.</li>
            <li> Nice big curls! Lovin this. Curls stays long but have to use hair spray for it to keep the day it through the day</li>
            <li> Takes any frizz out of my hair and adds volume.  Heats up quickly.  A lot of settings for heat and can get very hot.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> it heats up quick, and doesn&#x27;t snag on your hair like other cheap ones.  i used to have a hot tools one and this one works better.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome curling iron with a protective heat sleeve included and the price is truly great.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great, I&#x27;m just disappointed because my hair never can keep a curl. But it&#x27;s nicely made, get&#x27;s really hot, and I like the swivel cord!</li>
            <li> Love the carrying case to protect it when traveling and need to throw it in your suitcase.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work!! It will not curl anything!!!! I should have just gotten a wand curler</li>
            <li> Maybe it is just my hair, or I guess I underestimated how large the barrel would be, but the 1 1/2 inch did not do anything. It was basically like a straightening iron. I have curly hair, and it&#x27;s not too thick, and it&#x27;s not too thin. My 1 inch from con air works amazing, but this barely did anything. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Worked great until my cat chewed the cord a month after I bought it.....</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd one in about 20 years. Not bad. My first one just quit working. My second one lasted at least 10 years until the spring broke. I still use that one and just wrap my hair around it. This newest one seems exactly like my last one. I like that these heat up so quickly. I like that the hair doesn&#x27;t tend to snag or stick to it. I like the swivel cord. And I like the many temperature options. Its definently my go-to.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on a blog review which considered the ratings on several different sites to determine the top 10 non-professional curling irons. The best was very pricey so it wasn&#x27;t an option. The price on this iron is very realistic and it exceeded my expectations. I have very fine hair that requires high heat to curl. This accomplished that well.</li>
            <li> my hair hardly holds curls but i am so in love with the volume this thing gives me! i have yet to really try out the heat settings but i am really happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I was replacing my Chi curling iron after its spring broke after 2-3 years.  I thought I would try a less expensive iron this time, in anticipation of having to buy a new iron for the same reason every 3 years hereafter.  I had first tried the Hot Tools iron which was terrible - the clamp would not hold onto my hair at all.  This one performed a wee bit better, but it still had a tendency to not grip my hair, so my hair would fall out before I finished curling the length of my hair around it.  I ended up returning this and purchasing another Chi which has been working wonderfully.  It really cuts down the amount of time it takes to style your hair when you don&#x27;t have to compensate for working around a faulty clamp.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I already had the flat iron and a smaller curling iron of the same series that I loved... This curling iron is great! Curls are big and shiny... Love this Conair Infiniti brand!!!</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and has a convenient cover to put away hot.  My hair looks good using this iron - smooth and not frizzy.  However, the buttons are annoying as they are easy to switch it off while using it.  Also, this is the second Conair curling iron I&#x27;ve had where the tension spring popped out and I had to send it back to Conair for a replacement.</li>
            <li> I actually have the 2\\&quot; and it is by far the best curiling iron I have ever used. My hair is the type that has always been hard to curl even with a \\&quot;gallon\\&quot; of hairspray, it just would never hold. (I have long/thick hair) I barely put any hairspray on and my curls were awesome loose curls. I plan on getting the 1 1/4\\&quot; inch one also for some tighter curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know how the skinny ends of your hair you usually have to use your fingers to wrap the hair around because it will slide right through? That didnt happen with this. No matter how skinny the ends of my hair were or how skinny a section of hair I did, the curling iron gripped the hair right to the very end so I never had crappy looking ends or burned my fingers wrapping it around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have nothing negative to say about this curling iron at all.</li>
            <li> The complaints about the design of this iron are sort of ridiculous I think, you should be careful handling any heat tools and if you are burning yourself on it, my recommendation is practicing using it with one hand. The handle is long and weighted so you shouldn&#x27;t have a hard time using it mainly with your prominent hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that my curls come out consistent even on the low heat setting. The clamp on it is very strong but it doesn&#x27;t snag hairs. You may have to practice a bit like me if you aren&#x27;t used to using a curling iron, you can crimp your hair if you are attempting to properly curl from the base down, but the heat of the iron seems to smooth out crimps if you get them in time. I mostly use it to curl the ends of my hair and it leaves my split ends looking shiny and styled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for someone who is growing their hair out and having a tough time with those pesky ends you aren&#x27;t ready to chop off.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hard to convince that a curling iron could make my hair shiney. WOW it is true you see it happen right away. It is gentle on the hair and makes it so smooth and shiney. Really hard to believe until you see it with your own eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best price around.</li>
            <li> My hair curls easily but this doesn&#x27;t seem to do much other than turn the ends. I gave it 3 stars because it does leave my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> I tried this curler on various heat settings, held it for various lengths of time, tried it with hairspray, without, with pre-curling product and then without... clean hair, 2-day hair, and my hair is medium length and somewhat thin, but my daughter&#x27;s is thick... NONE OF THIS WORKED!!!! Nada, nothing... the curls would instantly fall out.  If you have hard-to-curl hair, think twice before buying this product. The heat may not be hot enough, I don&#x27;t know, but I sent it back for a refund, because it just doesn&#x27;t seem right that I tried all of these things AND tried it on two hair types, and nothing... I even tried clipping the curls to my head to let them set, STILL the curls fell out :( I soooo wanted this to work!</li>
            <li> This curling iron is going straight back to Amazon.  For one, the barrel is very short so if you have any hair it&#x27;s going to be an issue.  The barrel is also very slippery so it doesn&#x27;t grab hold of your hair, your hair just falls out as soon as you try to roll it.  I also have on the hottest setting, but it barely curls my hair, and my hair is very easy to style.  Total P.O.S.  don&#x27;t waste your time &amp; money on this iron.</li>
            <li> I have very straight hair and someone told me to look for tourmaline.  I found this iron to be deficient in several ways.  The curl doesn&#x27;t stay in my hair any longer than with any other iron, the clip is, useless because it is too loose and my hair falls out of it, the tip is too short to keep you from burning yourself over and over, and it smells of heated plastic. Yuck.  I hate it.</li>
            <li> I would give this 0 stars if I could ! very unhappy with this curling iron not only is it really short and gets hot on the tip but it also doesn&#x27;t give you enough room to actually maneuver your hair you end up curling it many many times for just one strip of hair I&#x27;m planning on returning it as soon as possible</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic curling iron with a high setting. It smoothes out my natural curls quickly for an alternative look.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is poorly designed.  The end is hard to hold when curling your hair.  It also doesnt hold a curl very long (even my Revlon $20 curling iron works a lot better over this one)!</li>
            <li> This curling iron gets very hot, I can curl my hair quickly in the morning. I&#x27;ve never had a curling iron where the cord swivels, so great to not get caught up with the cord.The clamp is strong enought to hold my long hair in the iron but not so strong that you get a kink in the hair under the clamp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a lot of curling irons in my day, and this one is undoubtedly the worst of the bunch.  I have thick coarse hair that holds a curl extremely well.  Not with this iron though.  It took me several rolls to get one strand of hair to even form a curl and not just a limp bump.  Due to the thickness of my hair I hold the iron in position for several seconds, long enough for any curl to take yet it didn&#x27;t.  It took me twice as long to curl my hair with this iron than it normally does which was really irritating.  Once I finally got my hair to curl with this I could tell the staying power wasn&#x27;t going to be very long. I was right.  My hair fell totally flat in a couple hours afterward.  I looked like I had been out in the rain!  Terrible product.  It looked as if I tried to flatten half my head instead of curling all of it.  Also, the tip of the curling iron is way too small.  You cannot hold onto it without giving yourself some serious burns.  The control button is too sensitive too.  It&#x27;s in a bad location, and I would often accidentally turn it off when picking it up which required extra time to heat it back  up.  I would not recommend this curling iron to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron...  does a great job of creating big, smooth waves on my frizzy hair. Going to order another in a smaller size for variety.</li>
            <li> I use this as a flat iron also. It smoothes my hair because the barrel is 1 1/2 inches. Love it. I also have an 1 inch one. Depends on how I want my hair to look.  Love Infiniti products. I ordered the 1 1/2 inch one not realizing it was the same make and model of my other one. Happy with the product and the outcomes it brings.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly &amp; curls  nicely. I like this curling iron!</li>
            <li> Great product. Light, east to use, adjustable temperature. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great iron for the price; multiple settings.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic curling iron, it heats up quickly and does glide easily over your hair. The plastic end on the tip of the curling iron is small and you can burn your fingers so just be aware, that is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. Other than that, it is great!</li>
            <li> Ir is too big and doesnot grip the hair it just slides through.  I would like to return it and get another.  How do i do this?</li>
            <li> Gets hot very quick and love the big barrel curls -</li>
            <li> This was a gift to my daughter. She loves it..no sooner than you plug it in, its ready too use. My daughter is always in a hurry. Good product..thanks</li>
            <li> I have always had hard-to-curl hair. For some reasons, drugstore curling irons just don&#x27;t do the job when it comes to curling my hair. Flat irons create long-lasting curls but curling irons for some reason just don&#x27;t do the job. I spent two hours curling my hair with this thing! I have super long and thick hair that goes to my waist that is also extremely hard to curl, so I held each curl in for EXTRA LONG and on the highest heat setting. I used hairspray prior to and after using the iron. The curl looks nice for about one hour, dies down during the second hour, then all my hard work goes down the drain and I end up with hair that is almost straight...Sigh I&#x27;ll just go back to the flat iron. The only issue with that is that flat irons don&#x27;t always create the exact same curl, whereas curling irons provide a more even finish. Anyway...I think I might be returning this since I have no use for it, seeing as it doesn&#x27;t really work on my hair...I am very disappointed because there were so many rave reviews on it.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is awesome. It&#x27;s gets hotter than any curling iron I&#x27;ve ever had, and it works like a dream. I told all of my sisters to save their money, and buy this baby.</li>
            <li> Good. Nothing bad about it :D</li>
            <li> I LIKE THIS CURLING IRON, IT GIVES  NICE LOOSE CURLS IN MY HAIR. I AM GLAD THAT I PICKEDV IT TO BUY</li>
            <li> Omg I wish I would of known about this long ago. It gets so hot it&#x27;sridiculous.  You should always use a heat protector.  Be very careful I actually burned myself.  My curls stayed in all day.  I didn&#x27;t even need a holding spray.  Definitely a must buy</li>
            <li> I have really long hair and needed a curling iron that was the right size to give me the curls I wanted. I chose this one because it is ceramic and it was affordable, plus the reviews looked good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does create nice curls, the only thing is I have found it very hard to use in terms of getting it to release your curls, I can&#x27;t get it to do it very easily which nearly ruins them. I probably need more practice but I have used others that were much easier to use and release the curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron heats up quickly, doesn&#x27;t burn your hair, but it does burn your forehead bad if you aren&#x27;t careful. I did notice a smoothing effect which I liked a lot because I have fly aways and frizzy hair all year long with my naturally wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want an affordable ceramic iron, this is a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> She loved it...dunno what else to say. She said it gave her the results she was hoping for within the first day of using</li>
            <li> I have to returned it because it was to expensive and had to pay it the returned no good all!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have thin hair, and the iron will make ugly marks on my hair that makes it look like unnatural ugly curls.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t purchased a new curling iron in a long time. This one works really well for the price point.</li>
            <li> Heats up super quick and curls really well for my long and thick hair. Good for long lasting, wavy curls.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 3 weeks!!! Won&#x27;t stay turned on and now I can&#x27;t return it!!!</li>
            <li> Curls don&#x27;t stay in to finish curling your hair. I bought a better brand with a higher heat as I have a lot on hair.</li>
            <li> Look up this brand tutorials on youtube. Prepare for gorgeous big waves</li>
            <li> i bought this after reading the reviews.  One thing that worried me after reading them is that the on/off switch was in a bad location, but I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it.  I love that there is a cover for the curling iron, so you can cover it up and put it away while it&#x27;s hot and not have to worry about my son getting burned.  It leaves my hair very smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> The irony. Did not curl my hair. I attempted it multiple times with hair spray hair products and none and still I could not get a curl to stay.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these and both lost their springiness in days. The clip squeaks every time you open and close it. There is no quality what so ever in this product and I will not buy Conair anything again.</li>
            <li> Horrible.  I burned my fingers so many times with the first use that I will never use it again.  There is no safe place to hold the curler near the tip.  Who ever designed this needs to watch how women curl their hair and realize that tip needs to have way more protection.  Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my college age granddaughter and she loves it!</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple curling irons and so far this is the best one. I usually have problems handling curling irons - burning myself, not achieving pretty curls....this one is easy to handle, it has good temperature settings and makes the process very quick and satisfying.</li>
            <li> did  not do what i expected at all . i wanted this curling iron to make some wide wavy hair curls but it did not last for 30 min on my hair. for some reason it works like a flat straightening iron :(</li>
            <li> Easy to use and I actually love it!</li>
            <li> Perfect size for everyday curls</li>
            <li> This item stopped working after only a few weeks, I only used it a handful of times, very disappointing!  I would not recommend purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, but hair always gets caught in the screw hinge.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron. Best one I have ever bought, and I have bought some expensive ones before. Best one yet. Does a great job with my thick hair.</li>
            <li> This curling/wave iron has 3 heat settings. The lowest setting gets pretty hot. I don&#x27;t use it on myself, but I use it on our daughter and I have burned myself with it. Please be cautious. The plastic end isn&#x27;t very large and is easy to miss when you are rolling hair with two hands. The spring/clip works fine, not too loose but not difficult to press, either. It hasn&#x27;t had constant use, but it has lasted quite a while so far.</li>
            <li> After much abuse by me, my original Infinity curling iron broke and was glad I could replace it with the same product.</li>
            <li> The only thing I did not like was that the plastic tip does not protect from getting burned by the iron.  Needs longer tip for protection.</li>
            <li> Pretty good curling iron. The only down side is that it doesn&#x27;t last. Be prepared to buy a new one every 12-18 months or so.</li>
            <li> The barrel is a big too big for my liking - so as a result, the curls are very, very loose. Not bad if you have very thick or long hair though, the barrel works great!</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for and performs beyond expectation. The ceramic barrel makes so much difference. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I can not stand this curling iron. Like some others have mentioned, I constantly hit the off switch while I am curling my hair. I won&#x27;t realize it until I notice my curls aren&#x27;t holding and then I have to wait for it to heat back up. I&#x27;ve never had this problem with any other curling iron I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even curl your hair and leaves creases in it. I have long thick hair, maybe if you have finer hair it works. But I&#x27;m literally just going to throw this in the garbage. It&#x27;s a waste of money. DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron, so much so that I have it in the 1&amp;#34; and 1.5&amp;#34;. Love that you can actually set the heat by temperature instead of low/med/hot. IT&#x27;s super helpful to have an iron that can go up to 400 degrees, especially because I have Asian, thick, straight hair that needs a lot of heat to keep a curl. I do agree with others that the on/off button is not in the best location and every once in a while I do accidentally turn it off while curling, so I docked it by one star because of that. Otherwise, I absolute love this curling iron!</li>
            <li> Love this iron!  Works great on my hair and the price is just right!</li>
            <li> The best curling iron I have purchased in a long time.</li>
            <li> Love it works great for me</li>
            <li> I love the size; it&#x27;s perfect for me needs.  But, the finish on it makes your hair slide right out when you lift the handle.  Plus, my hair has never gotten caught at the hinge of the handle, so I&#x27;ve not lost one strand on it.  The variable temperature is super nice as well as the on/off switch.  I&#x27;ve never been happier with a curling iron and I&#x27;m glad it has lasted as long as it has.</li>
            <li> This curling iron has the perfect barrel size for my long hair.  it is super easy to use and set the temperature.  I was forced into quickly buying a curling iron because mine unexpectedly broke.  I have already recommended to others.  If you are looking for a curling iron - this is the one for you.  I have to be very careful when purchasing heating items for my hair.  I need extremely high temperatures because my hair is so thick.  This one is perfect!</li>
            <li> I have had this curling wand for quite sometime now. I absolutely love this curling wand! Beautiful, luscious, and bouncy curls! Great investment on my part because I use it a lot of times when my hair is straight!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this item wasn&#x27;t what I expected. It hardly curled my hair at all.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite hot tools. Heats up very quickly and forms beautiful curls without over heating and singing your hair.</li>
            <li> The curling iron leaves lines from the clamp and the curls do not even work much less hold in my hair. I even used a ton of hairspray</li>
            <li> Perfect size and curl.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews on this and several other irons. I landed on this one and I am so happy with it. I do not use it everyday. I also have thick hair that has body naturally. With some hair product and effort it does a fabulous job. If you have stick straight thin hair and don&#x27;t use product I would imagine you&#x27;d struggle with any curling iron. For my hair this works great. I am happy with my purchase and happy with the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this model almost two years, and it still gets used everyday with no mechanical issues. I&#x27;m giving it only 3 stars because a couple of design flaws, which seemed pretty minor initially, have made it very aggravating over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the on/off and temperature buttons are located in a terrible place on the handle. If you have hair length that requires more than one twist, you will likely turn this iron off accidentally at least once during your styling session. It&#x27;s also easy to inadvertently hit the button that changes the temperature setting, resulting in a much hotter iron than intended. Second, the cool tip is too small: I burned myself several times before moving to a more one-handed approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t abandoned this curling iron yet, though, because I like a couple of key features: rapid heating, smooth-surface barrel, temperature. On the hottest setting this curler will almost function like a flat iron if you pull it quickly through small sections, and that has been a lifesaver when I&#x27;ve forgotten to pack all my styling tools on a trip! I definitely don&#x27;t recommend using that highest temperature on a daily basis (and don&#x27;t even think about using it on damp hair!), but it&#x27;s great when you need it. Nice long cord that rotates at the base is a bonus, as is the silicone barrel-cover that permits me to pack it up while it&#x27;s still warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come on, Conair! Fix the small design issues with this curling iron and it would be 5 stars for me!</li>
            <li> This iron heats up quickly and evenly and curls well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when I curl my hair, I start towards the roots and pull the iron down towards my ends.  When I do that, I find that I have to be careful as my hair gets easily snagged somewhere in the clamp.  Not a comfortable feeling.  And I do make sure the clamp is raised enough off the barrel that the hair should have plenty of space.  I haven&#x27;t figured out if it&#x27;s getting caught in the hinge or if the edge of the clamp is just not smooth enough to glide or what.  It doesn&#x27;t look like a rough edge...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had I bought it from a brick-and-mortar store, I would return it.  But otherwise it&#x27;s not worth the trouble.  I won&#x27;t use it often, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone else.</li>
            <li> I think it gets the job done and heats up very quickly.  My hair looks so shiny.</li>
            <li> I love this curler. Bought this recently because I thought I had misplaced my old one that I bought about 7 years ago (still going strong). One negative that other reviewers have mentioned: it is too easy to hit the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; button. BUT... for the price, I don&#x27;t mind just being mindful of the button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The barrel has enough room to accommodate my very long, very thick hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love this curling iron. The curls it produces aren&#x27;t as tight as they should be for an iron of this size. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the heat supply or that the clamp isn&#x27;t tight enough, but I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Does not work on my shoulder lenght hair :(</li>
            <li> So much better than the other curing irons I have had over the years. Have not come close to burning my fingers... Nice to have the protective cover too. I liked it so much I now have three. Home, vacation home, and for traveling.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have very long VERY thick hair. However this did the job perfectly! It heats very fast and makes beautiful curls. Plus shipping was right on time!</li>
            <li> This is a rather large barrel hair curler, so it doesn&#x27;t truly curl your hair, it more adds wave and some curls at the ends of the hair (ends up looking like when my hair dresser blow dries it, vs when I do and it never looks good!) The little plastic sleeve to put on there while it&#x27;s still hot and is cooling is great. I take it when I travel a lot. The adjustable temp is helpful. Only thing I wish is that it notified you when it had heated up, but it really doesn&#x27;t take long and I&#x27;ve been find just guessing that oh yeah, it&#x27;s ready.</li>
            <li> This little gem performs wonderful and gives you top heat in 30 seconds.  I&#x27;m a happy customer.  Great value for the price!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan to be honest. The heat is great and it curls ok. But what I dislike is the looseness of the clamps. It doesn&#x27;t hold my hair long enough for me to get the desired curl. That&#x27;s frustrating. I find myself having to repeat the same piece over and over because of that issue. Maybe I have a faulty curling iron? Who knows? Either way I&#x27;m probably going to send it back</li>
            <li> You need someone else to do it for you. I burnt myself trying to do my hair.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on Amazon and on Target.com (Target&#x27;s reviewers gave it a lower average).  I did not want to buy it, but after visiting three nearby stores, it became apparent that this was the only 1.5\\&quot; curling iron that I could have if I wanted it that day (which I did).  The other negative reviews were right.  Yes, the curling iron does get hot, quickly, and it could potentially curl your hair... if you don&#x27;t accidentally turn it off while rolling your hair, and if you don&#x27;t need to hold onto the tip, and if you don&#x27;t burn your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comment about the on/off switch being too easily depressed during normal curling - TRUE.  The comment about the tip being too hot - TRUE (in case you thought you&#x27;d grip the tip to avoid gripping the handle, thereby turning the iron off while curling.).  Nobody has mentioned the shape of the tip... it is a dome shape and ribbed so that your fingers slide right off the end.  Unless of course, you grip a little closer to the handle.  Then your fingers will slide right onto the 400 degree hot curling surface.  And worst of all... if you use it on heat setting #4 or #5, YOU WILL RADIATE THE SMELL OF BURNED HAIR - ALL DAY LONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last 1.5\\&quot; curling iron was a Conair Instant Heat which retails for about half and worked well for several years.  I&#x27;m getting that one again.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had to replace my 1 1/2&amp;#34; curling brush with this iron because they no longer make the brushes... but the unit works great- I just have to get used to using it!</li>
            <li> A good feature at this price is that it has adjustable heat controls. I have fine hair that would be fried much beyong the minimum setting. But it gets hot enough for you gals with thick hair, too. Good so far for the $$$.</li>
            <li> Its too big and hard to curle. Worst purchase ever. Will not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Holds the curl and makes my hair look shiny!&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased countless curling irons and this one is&lt;br /&gt;by far the best.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and falling out a little due to medications. So, this Conair Infiniti Pro is a dream come true. It helps build volume with product too, but it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> I read some of the reviews about this product before buying it and I was skeptical to begin with but I did need a curling iron. My hair curls fairly easy and this iron didn&#x27;t hold a curl long enough for me to use hair spray. The top is very small and there is no place to hold the tip, and you can easily burn your fingers. I returned this after the first use.</li>
            <li> I like the heat temperature setting.  I use this curling iron every day.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and I was looking for an easy to use ceramic curler. I am very pleased with this one thus far. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars only because I&#x27;ve burned myself a few times with this one. It gets MUCH hotter than other curlers I&#x27;ve used and the \\&quot;safety\\&quot; end where you hold it isn&#x27;t really big enough. That said, it&#x27;s a great curler at an amazing price. I even use it to straighten my hair sometimes, it works just as well as my ceramic hair straightener!</li>
            <li> Bought one for my mom and she liked it.</li>
            <li> It may be because before this Iron, I was using a curling iron  I bought in the 90&#x27;s that only had an on/off switch, but this curling iron is awesome!  Not only does it have an on/off switch, but it has temperature settings!  My hair just glides through the iron and ends up looking soft and frizz free.  Before I had to blow dry, flat iron THEN curl my hair, but with this curling iron I can skip the flat iron step and still get soft shiny frizz free hair.  Again, maybe this curling iron is so exciting to me because I haven&#x27;t bought one in 15 years, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  It even has a swivel cord so it doesn&#x27;t get all tangled up!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have much effect&lt;br /&gt;strange since it does seem to get hot,&lt;br /&gt;should have returned it, just thought I should try again, and then I never did,...</li>
            <li> For $20 i thought i was going to get a cheap curler that would probably not last long. However, so far the product has heated as hot as i wanted and has not broken. Plus it curls real nice. I am really glad i purchased this !</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair (long, medium weight), but when I curl my hair with this curling iron, the curls do not hold for very long.  I end up with some loose waves, and eventually pretty flat hair.  I ended up purchasing another curling iron after using this one for a few months (with various styling products).</li>
            <li> It creates great curls but doesn&#x27;t hold at all, even with hairspray.  I have asian hair that&#x27;s slightly wavy with medium thickness.  Curling my hair with a flat iron leaves me with curls that last, but this doesn&#x27;t hold at all.</li>
            <li> These heat up quickly and do the job.  If you have difficulty using a flat iron or just want big curls.  This curling iron definitely does the trick.</li>
            <li> I really like this Conair curling iron. I purchased this over the $30+ some irons because of the price and the fact that it was a 1.5-inch iron. There really weren&#x27;t too many other options out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are varying heat temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a cover for the iron.&lt;br /&gt;The barrel gets nice and hot; my hair does not get pulled at any part of the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got good curls from this!</li>
            <li> Worked for about a month, then only heated to barely warm!</li>
            <li> really like this curling iron -  like the low heat setting</li>
            <li> Bought this bigger curling iron to try to get bigger waves. I must say, I&#x27;m glad I spent the money on this!! It works nicely and gets hot in a few seconds would definitely recommended getting this! I also bought the smaller 1&#x27; that also works just as great!</li>
            <li> Arriving far quicker than I anticipated (Prime account? Love it!), I tore open the Amazon box, tossed the recyclables on top of the dryer (where they go for now) and plugged in my New Fancy Curling Iron, the Infiniti Professional Nano Tourmaline Ceramic Curling Iron, 1 and 1/2 inch baby....Quick heat up, neat control panel, no accidental bumping of switches, and a hot, three tempurature choice. I began at the root, slid down a 1 &amp;#34; section of hair and easily turned the ends into a two and a half roll coil. Bonus, it is so smooth it doesn&#x27;t pull my damaged ends and puts a sleek finish on my normally curly, and sometimes, out of control hair. The only fault is my own. In my curling excitement, I burnt by fingers on the end as I held the curling iron in a perfect pose. The handling end is a little shorter than I&#x27;d used before. Watch your finger tips, but this is just getting used to the appliance.</li>
            <li> This curling iron heats very fast, has variable temperature settings, and automatic shut-off.  It makes beautiful curls.  I would give it a 5 but it has a major design flaw.  If you look carefully at the picture of the curling iron, you will see that the on/off and temperature control buttons are push-button controls, slightly indented into the handle of the iron.  These buttons are poorly placed in relationship to the grip of the iron.  As you grip the iron with your hand wrapped around the handle, quite often, your hands inadvertently press the on/off button.  Of course, you will probaby not realize this until your iron goes cold or if you happen to look at the iron and notice the light has gone off.  So, it is necessary between each curl to check that this hasn&#x27;t happened.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to burn your fingers with this iron and I am CONSTANTLY accidentally turning it off while using because of the placement of the buttons. It does the job of curling, but has poor design.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 brands before I remembered the name Conair from years back as being good so I bought one of these - this is the second one I bought so I could have one at my vaca house too.  This is better than any other brand - heats fast, the controls are where they should be and don&#x27;t shut off every time you move your hand and it comes with a heat shield to put it away without it heating up anything where you store it.  The other 3 were top brands but they stunk and Conair is the only brand I will buy ever again.  Stupid me for not thinking of them sooner.</li>
            <li> Great product, great end result and shipping was a breeze. This bad boy was on my wish list forever and I&#x27;m feeling silly as to why I waited so long!</li>
            <li> Works ok but the tip is too small and you can burn your fingers easily.</li>
            <li> Great iron! On/off switch is in a good place and isn&#x27;t accidentally turned off while using (unlike other models). Heats up quickly, doesn&#x27;t burn hair and provides a nice curl.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product and haven&#x27;t burned myself once with this model.  I would definitely recommend this product to friends!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot barely. My round flat iron makes better waves/curls than this crap. I&#x27;m sending it back asap.</li>
            <li> I thought it was very nice, was given as a gift for Secret Santa for Kids.</li>
            <li> I have super thick/frizzy hair and it usually takes forever to curl it into submission - this is one of the best irons I&#x27;ve ever had, it heats up fast and cools down fast.</li>
            <li> Great curling iron for the price! The barrel is rather smooth and I would recommend using product in your hair prior to curling/using as it does become slippery.  It gets very hot and very evenly.</li>
            <li> Barrel too big and it wouldn&#x27;t be cost effective at the price I paid to spend another $7.00 on shipping it back ,so I am stuck with this unusable purchase.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using this being that the biggest I&#x27;ve ever used was a half inch around and my hair isn&#x27;t super long. HOWEVER,  I don&#x27;t use anything else now! It makes my hair shiny and healthy looking, it has an auto shut off in case you forget to unplug it before you leave, and the settings are simple and just what I love about this.  All its missing is a retractable cord. :-)</li>
            <li> My little sister loves it, it&#x27;s real handy and readily accessible.</li>
            <li> This 1-1/2&amp;#34; ceramic tourmaline curling iron is perfect for large waves and heats evenly without burning my hair, leaving more split ends. I use the highest and hottest setting of 400 degrees on below shoulder-length hair to achieve large waves.The material composition appears to be consistent and not coated, which is better for the hair and does not burn the ends like the cheap coated irons.</li>
            <li> I have obstinate hair and with a combo of Matrix Biolage Deep Smoothing Shampoo and Conditioner plus curling my hair with the Infiniti Professional Nano Tourmaline Ceramic Curling Iron, 1 1/2-Inch my hair now looks like it do when I came home from the salon. Yay!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really get hot enough and it&#x27;s too big of a barrell. larger than i thought.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t curl my own hair for shit lol...but got this n it&#x27;s been great ,recommends it to all heats up well and curls great</li>
            <li> I burn myself daily using this thing.  The tip is just way too short.  I do not recommend it unless you want to use just the tips of your fingers on your alternate hand to steady it.  I would just throw mine away, but I paid more (retail) than they charge here for it.</li>
            <li> The only problem I&#x27;ve had is accidentally turning the iron off because of the button placement.</li>
            <li> Other people have commented that the on/off button gets in the way, I didn&#x27;t find that to be a problem. The heat settings are great!! AND my hair really does hold a curl long with this curling iron! I have very long (waist length, fine hair) and my curls are usually gone my mid morning, my curls were there all day and with no or little hairspray! I would definitely recommend this product!1</li>
            <li> Loveeeeee it!! Just be careful cause it&#x27;s a bit easy to get burned. Problem solved if you wear a thermical glove</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron, I can&#x27;t love without it! Works well for curling or smoothing and straightening hair.</li>
            <li> IF YOU WANT BOUNCY FULL CURLS YOU NEED THIS! THIS CUT MY HAIR TIME TO ABOUT HALF THE BARREL IS NOT TOO BUG BUT BIG ENOUGH TO GET THE JOB DONE FAST! HEATS UP FAST AS WELL AND COMES WITH A COVER FOR THE BARREL SO NO MORE ACCIDENTAL BURNS!</li>
            <li> Very nice- it meets my expectation.  It heats up to 400 F pretty quickly and the surface of the barrel is very smooth.</li>
            <li> the cure doesn&#x27;t last that long because the size is too big.</li>
