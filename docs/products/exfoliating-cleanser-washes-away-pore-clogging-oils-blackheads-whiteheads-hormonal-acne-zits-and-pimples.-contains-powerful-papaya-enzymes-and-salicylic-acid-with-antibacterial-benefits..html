            <li>A good friend of mine is four years older than i.</li>
            <li>The first 2 days I used it, it was amazing.</li>
            <li>One fine day my friend suggested me to use this washer and started using this cream.</li>

            <li>and my skin is smooth.</li>
            <li>This solution is more worth than the price.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is fantastic.</li>

            <li>One of the best things I like about this product is that it is free of sulfates, parabens, artificial dyes and fragrances, but still has a pleasant relaxing smell.</li>
            <li>sincerely thank you very much to you.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>But this is totally worth it!</li>
            <li>What a useful product !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth it!  </li>
            <li>On my very first use I saw results with gentle yet effective exfoliation.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more once i run out! :)</li>
            <li>It is a product worth the try!</li>
            <li>But well worth the money !</li>
            <li>My skin gets really oily after a while, so I have to have a face wash that helps control that, and this works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before; I&#x27;ve noticed a huge decrease in oiliness.</li>
            <li>Wow, I love this cleanser!</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference right away!  </li>
            <li>My skin feels fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li>I am using it daily and the results are good.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the manufacturer for creating all in one package for the skin. :)</li>
            <li>It is a product that I will use daily and make me feel good about myself.</li>
            <li>The T-zone was the most problematic part of my face, yet this product worked really well for it.</li>
            <li>Gentle and safe for all skin types .</li>
            <li>It soft yet effective with my skin.</li>
            <li>Really cool product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other products from this brand, and they all work great, so it wasn&#x27;t a surprise that this one was just as good.</li>
            <li>My face felt moisturized and clean, a wonderful combination that so many products are unable to deliver.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is nothing more than cheap clear hand soap.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin with mild rosacea.</li>
            <li>Acne is a problem in high school, when the appearance is one of the things that matter most.</li>
            <li>I was never able to find a happy medium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this facial cleanser, my skin immediately felt soft and, for lack of a better term, happy.</li>
            <li>As an active skin care product user this product has been the most effective out of all the brands I have used.</li>
            <li>It really annoys me to look in the mirror and see something that is so easy to change.</li>
            <li>The improvement of my skin tone and texture were simply just added bonuses to this magical exfoliating cleanser!</li>
            <li>I have been using it for few months and my skin looks great</li>
            <li>It really makes my skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>This facial cleaner is amazing</li>
            <li>My skin feels fresh and youthful, and I do not even need to wear foundation.</li>
            <li>I love it that this is completely natural.</li>
            <li>My skin feels fresh and youthful</li>
            <li>I just love how soft my skin feels.</li>
            <li>It applied good, no odor, left my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It does what it promises to do, which is a rare claim among skin cleansers and anti-acne products.</li>
            <li>With me having sensitive skin, most products irritate my face but this one did not.</li>
            <li>I have tried and tried and tried so many different types of exfoliant to unclog my pores and make my skin feel fresh, and none have ever taken the cake like this one!</li>
            <li>I was reluctant to pay so much for a face wash, but it really is worth it!</li>
            <li>will notice the difference right away.</li>
            <li>This comment is in regards to the misleading picture on the right \\&quot;MIRACLE WORKER\\&quot; by Irma.</li>
            <li>I was never able to find a happy medium.</li>
            <li>This is a good solid product that makes my face look younger and free of acne problems.</li>
            <li>And it works super fast.</li>
            <li>This wash has helped my face clear up very quickly.</li>
            <li>When you have no time time and want to cleanse your face super fast, you can rely on this.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s always smart to test it out first!</li>
            <li>Some exfoliating cleansers do clean the skin but can also be harsh on it, Best New Exfoliating Cleanser is different.  </li>
            <li>The main problem - natural does not mean effective.</li>
            <li>You Guys Really have to try this product!</li>
            <li>When I was start to using this clay facial mask, I knew I wanted to try out more of this brandâ€™s products.</li>
            <li>This product truly works the best, I&#x27;ve been struggling with a bad case of adult acne and sought many solutions, and my long search finally ends with this incredible product</li>
            <li>For the first time in forever (I promise I&#x27;m not singing the lyric to that song in the movie Frozen)</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t create issues with my skin and is reasonably priced! -rrc</li>
            <li>how you dress, how you look, it&#x27;s the first thing they see your classmates and of course, no one would like to walk with acne on the face, a friend recommended me this product and then went to buy it in a store in my city.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only has my acne subsided, but my pores are free and minimized!</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure others would want the same.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My face felt smooth and soft after one use.</li>
            <li>Helps keep my skin clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>I also love that this helps with all types of people in different age brackets as well.</li>
            <li>however,&lt;br /&gt;It really was worth it!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I love exfoliation, so I try multiple brands.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>After purchasing and using their clay facial mask, I knew I wanted to try out more of this brandâ€™s products.</li>
            <li>I love using just ONE product to take care of my facial care needs!</li>
            <li>And also I cannot get enough of the adorable packaging.</li>
            <li>I think that it does exactly what it says....</li>
            <li>You can really tell it works!</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products that I almost gave up entirely until I tried this product.</li>
            <li>I love that it has a facial scrub feel because it feels like it is working while using it.</li>
            <li>about many tramientos certainly buy it again for her and possibly for me why not?&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really dry out my skin like similar products have done in the past which I think is a great added bonus to the already good features of this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Clean and clear skin has never been easier.</li>
            <li>it has your face feeling soft, clean and refresh</li>
            <li>I love to exfoliate and cleanse my skin as much and possible.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only good for acne but for overall health of skin.</li>

            <li>I did not want to spend so much buying a facewash at first.</li>
            <li>but it tes the job done and has turned my back to a more smooth back that my wife loves</li>
            <li>It smells good and makes me look forward to washing my face everyday!</li>
            <li>I would recommend everyone trying this, it helps with the oiliness so much and makes your skin feel so soft and clean.</li>
            <li>better than compare to a normal facial cleanser</li>

            <li>This product really cleared up my acne.</li>

            <li>This cleanser really woks well on my skin....</li>
            <li>and it is so gentle....</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>but after trying this, it really cleared them all up.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to cover up much of anything regarding my acne</li>
            <li>If you add a touch of water (or use in the shower) it lathers really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth the money so far.</li>
            <li>I got it thanks to a promotioanl price .</li>
            <li>It also really helps your pores.</li>
            <li>I was amazed that a something so reasonably priced had the ability to almost work miracles.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t want to spend so much on a face wash</li>
            <li>really recommend this if you are suffering with oily skin.</li>
            <li>The acne clearing benefit is very noticeable and</li>
            <li>Very unsatisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It is also very affordable.</li>
            <li>Really is.</li>
            <li>This Product Really Works.</li>
            <li>I have been using this exfoliating cleanser for about 1 month now and let me tell you how much my skin has improved.</li>
            <li>I have very acne prone skin and breakouts all the time.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>It provides an exfoliating and smooth feel for your skin, not only on your face but your body as well.</li>
            <li>You really do get what you pay for and would recommend this skin treatment to anyone.</li>
            <li>how quickly and effective this facial cleanser was, it even took care of my black heads.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product, because my skin did feel so very soft and at the same time clean after using it for the first 2 days.</li>
            <li>Skip out on half your beauty regimen with this easy fix!</li>
            <li>I was do excited that I found something that actually worked, I bought another one for backup.</li>
            <li>even better use of this and other together.</li>
            <li>I have tried other Beauty Facial Extreme products and have been very happy with them as well.</li>
            <li>Not sure how this stuff has such great reviews.....doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li>This cleanser has helped me last couple weeks to keep a clean face with no acne.</li>
            <li>The dark blackheads and the unclean stuff on my nose have mostly been removed.</li>
            <li>I am less than two weeks into using this and my skin looks so much better already.</li>
            <li>Been using it for a couple of weeks and my skin is smooth and no longer dry.</li>
            <li>I used this a few days ago when I got it, when I had a couple bright red blemishes.</li>
            <li>This product has helped wonders against both of them and helped reduce my tanned skin that has made me look a bit older.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone, not only those with acne but all people that hope to better take care of their skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to people with acne.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this exfoliator.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Gets rid of dirt under pores, is gentle enough for sensitive skin which has always been a problem for me, and is good for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to everyone to help with removing blackheads.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone who has acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I have little bumps all over in the summer and it helps smooth them!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have to use blush, because my natural color shines through.</li>
            <li>I cleanse with this, then I use a toner (I really like this one from etsy: https://www.etsy.com/transaction/1037891810 ), then I use their acne cream ( http://www.amazon.com/Acne-Serum-Spot-Treatment-blackheads/dp/B00VOJ7S88/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1436307412&amp;sr&#x3D;1-3 ), and I follow with Nardo&#x27;s Natural Moisturizer ( http://www.nardosnatural.com/collections/shop-women/products/new-organic-facial-moisturizer ).</li>
            <li>I cleanse with this, then I use a toner (I really like this one from etsy: https://www.etsy.com/transaction/1037891810 ), then I use their acne cream ( http://www.amazon.com/Acne-Serum-Spot-Treatment-blackheads/dp/B00VOJ7S88/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1436307412&amp;sr&#x3D;1-3 ), and I follow with Nardo&#x27;s Natural Moisturizer ( http://www.nardosnatural.com/collections/shop-women/products/new-organic-facial-moisturizer ).</li>
            <li>This cleanser foams nicely, is a thick gel that does not drip, it has a nice smell, and the volume you get is quite substantial.  </li>
            <li>Normally I am scared to try new products for my face, but I decided to give this Exfoliating Cleanser a try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin, but it exfoliates well enough that it makes my skin baby soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Would not mind recommending this new exfoliating cleanser.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts since using this.</li>
            <li>My skin is oily and I live in a humid state</li>
            <li>I really like how this treatment feels like it is all the different acne treatments in one, and you can really feel that effect on your skin.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a fantastic product and I look forward to trying their deep pore cleansing product.esn&#x27;t remain on the skin.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a fantastic product and I look forward to trying their deep pore cleansing product.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very soft in that aspect.</li>
            <li>It feels very natural on my skin.</li>
            <li>and I saw this EXACT SAME PICTURE.</li>
            <li>It not only works better than any blackhead, acne, and whatever other cleanser</li>
            <li>After using this product, not only did my skin look more youthful and revived, but it also felt silkier and cleaner than it has with other products.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend, this is better than any cleanser or even any other product I have tried!</li>
            <li>My skin is not totally clear, but better than other products I have used.</li>
            <li>I have some and it made my skin clear up faster than you can say clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>There has been a considerable change in the texture and tone of my skin..</li>
            <li>I was looking for something natural for my skin care.</li>
            <li>I have combination sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It also helped to clear up old blemishes without over drying.</li>
            <li>Or sensitive skin</li>
            <li>do I do as far as regimen goes?</li>
            <li>What do I do as far as regimen goes?</li>
            <li>i am using this product from last 3 months and it really works..</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough for my face</li>
            <li>It is fast acting you will notice results immediately.</li>
            <li>After one use, my skin felt amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>The natural papaya enzymes are a natural cleaner and purifier.</li>
            <li>NATURAL.</li>
            <li>I have frequent acne problems, and I tried this exfoliating cleanser to help fight the pimples.</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin, so I do not want to overuse it in case it over-dries</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>I am only posting this because I am a long time acne sufferer who is looking for a TRUE product that will work for me.</li>
            <li>Just massage it in the face for few sec, rinse and use toner (I prefer rose water as a toner).</li>
            <li>I worry it may over-dry if I use it daily, but I do not know this for sure (so not a strong con).  </li>
            <li>I think that it works much better than other facial cleansers I&#x27;ve tried from my local pharmacies.</li>
            <li>This is the first exfoliating cleanser that did not leave my skin dry and breaking out.</li>
            <li>I have long been attempting to find a facial and body exfoliating wash to help with facial as well as body acne that has more recently worsened.</li>
            <li>Really helps fight against breakouts, and I&#x27;ve also noticed my pores getting smaller (which is great because I&#x27;ve had a really hard time keeping the pores on my nose small!).</li>
            <li>I saw major improvement!</li>
            <li>After only a few days, my face looks and feels better than it ever has following a doctor&#x27;s appointment.</li>
            <li>Beauty facial extreme keeps my skin clear from damaged sun spots, acne and even smile lines.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a new cleaner, look no further!</li>
            <li>Really helps my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Perhaps this would work if you only used it 2x a week, 1x a day, but otherwise, I find it to be a very inappropriate facial cleaning product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;P.S. had an isolated break out on my chin, nothing major and this stuff didn&#x27;t even work for that.</li>
            <li>Used it for a few days and never got the feeling that it gave me a deep clean.  </li>
            <li>I have always had a problem with mild acne and especially nose black heads.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently trying philosophy clear days ahead</li>
            <li>When you look at our faces, she looks far much younger.</li>
            <li>To start off, I&#x27;m 24 year old female who has ALWAYS struggled with acne.</li>
            <li>contains natural and essential ingredients to remove excess oils, dirt, and residues.</li>
            <li>I am 21 and the only thing I got going for me is acne and early onset of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Ive tried a couple different cleansers and they all didnt work nearly as well.</li>
            <li>Spent way too much on this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands but this really works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so gentle on my skin unlike those other products that burn and itch.</li>
            <li>This is the ultimate facial cleanser that gives natural results without blemishes.</li>
            <li>From then on, it so completely dried out my facial skin that even though I haven&#x27;t used it in 2 weeks, my skin continues to look flaky, old, and very unattractive.  </li>
            <li>I instantly saw an improvement in the appeareance of my face skin, my pores are barely noticeable and my skin is looking moisturized than ever.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin and sensitive skin I would use this once per day instead of twice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used variety of products from Proactiv (what a waste of money, I had NO results), Yes to Carrots (again no results), Neutrogena Grapefruit Extract (I had moderate results, but nothing I&#x27;d write home to mom about), AcneFree (no results), Cetaphil (nothing), Clean and Clear Advantage Kit (moderate results), Clinique (nothing), Bare Essentials Face Wash (nada), Clearasil (nope), JuiceBeauty (nothing again), St. Ives (moderate results), Indian Healing Clay (messy and nothing happened), The Body Shop (tea tree oil cleanser)...</li>
            <li>less grease, less dirt, just clean.</li>

            <li> What a useful product !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally worth it!  </li>
            <li> On my very first use I saw results with gentle yet effective exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more once i run out! :)</li>
            <li> It is a product worth the try!</li>
            <li> But well worth the money !</li>
            <li> My skin gets really oily after a while, so I have to have a face wash that helps control that, and this works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before; I&#x27;ve noticed a huge decrease in oiliness.</li>
            <li> Wow, I love this cleanser!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference right away!  </li>
            <li> My skin feels fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li> I am using it daily and the results are good.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the manufacturer for creating all in one package for the skin. :)</li>
            <li> It is a product that I will use daily and make me feel good about myself.</li>
            <li> The T-zone was the most problematic part of my face, yet this product worked really well for it.</li>
            <li> Gentle and safe for all skin types .</li>
            <li> It soft yet effective with my skin.</li>
            <li> Really cool product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other products from this brand, and they all work great, so it wasn&#x27;t a surprise that this one was just as good.</li>
            <li> My face felt moisturized and clean, a wonderful combination that so many products are unable to deliver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is nothing more than cheap clear hand soap.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin with mild rosacea.</li>
            <li> Acne is a problem in high school, when the appearance is one of the things that matter most.</li>
            <li> I was never able to find a happy medium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this facial cleanser, my skin immediately felt soft and, for lack of a better term, happy.</li>
            <li> As an active skin care product user this product has been the most effective out of all the brands I have used.</li>
            <li> It really annoys me to look in the mirror and see something that is so easy to change.</li>
            <li> The improvement of my skin tone and texture were simply just added bonuses to this magical exfoliating cleanser!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for few months and my skin looks great</li>
            <li> It really makes my skin smooth.  </li>
            <li> This facial cleaner is amazing</li>
            <li> My skin feels fresh and youthful, and I do not even need to wear foundation.</li>
            <li> I love it that this is completely natural.</li>
            <li> My skin feels fresh and youthful</li>
            <li> I just love how soft my skin feels.</li>
            <li> It applied good, no odor, left my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It does what it promises to do, which is a rare claim among skin cleansers and anti-acne products.</li>
            <li> With me having sensitive skin, most products irritate my face but this one did not.</li>
            <li> I have tried and tried and tried so many different types of exfoliant to unclog my pores and make my skin feel fresh, and none have ever taken the cake like this one!</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to pay so much for a face wash, but it really is worth it!</li>
            <li> will notice the difference right away.</li>
            <li> This comment is in regards to the misleading picture on the right \\&quot;MIRACLE WORKER\\&quot; by Irma.</li>
            <li> I was never able to find a happy medium.</li>
            <li> This is a good solid product that makes my face look younger and free of acne problems.</li>
            <li> And it works super fast.</li>
            <li> This wash has helped my face clear up very quickly.</li>
            <li> When you have no time time and want to cleanse your face super fast, you can rely on this.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s always smart to test it out first!</li>
            <li> Some exfoliating cleansers do clean the skin but can also be harsh on it, Best New Exfoliating Cleanser is different.  </li>
            <li> The main problem - natural does not mean effective.</li>
            <li> You Guys Really have to try this product!</li>
            <li> When I was start to using this clay facial mask, I knew I wanted to try out more of this brandâ€™s products.</li>
            <li> This product truly works the best, I&#x27;ve been struggling with a bad case of adult acne and sought many solutions, and my long search finally ends with this incredible product</li>
            <li> For the first time in forever (I promise I&#x27;m not singing the lyric to that song in the movie Frozen)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t create issues with my skin and is reasonably priced! -rrc</li>
            <li> how you dress, how you look, it&#x27;s the first thing they see your classmates and of course, no one would like to walk with acne on the face, a friend recommended me this product and then went to buy it in a store in my city.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only has my acne subsided, but my pores are free and minimized!</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure others would want the same.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> My face felt smooth and soft after one use.</li>
            <li> Helps keep my skin clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> I also love that this helps with all types of people in different age brackets as well.</li>
            <li> however,&lt;br /&gt;It really was worth it!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I love exfoliation, so I try multiple brands.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> After purchasing and using their clay facial mask, I knew I wanted to try out more of this brandâ€™s products.</li>
            <li> I love using just ONE product to take care of my facial care needs!</li>
            <li> And also I cannot get enough of the adorable packaging.</li>
            <li> I think that it does exactly what it says....</li>
            <li> You can really tell it works!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products that I almost gave up entirely until I tried this product.</li>
            <li> I love that it has a facial scrub feel because it feels like it is working while using it.</li>
            <li> about many tramientos certainly buy it again for her and possibly for me why not?&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really dry out my skin like similar products have done in the past which I think is a great added bonus to the already good features of this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Clean and clear skin has never been easier.</li>
            <li> it has your face feeling soft, clean and refresh</li>
            <li> I love to exfoliate and cleanse my skin as much and possible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only good for acne but for overall health of skin.</li>
            <li> But I definitely  think that anyone who wants better looking epidermis should give this a try.</li>
            <li> We stand behind our products 100%, with a guarantee of significantly transforming your skin to achieve healthy and more vibrant skin.</li>
            <li> I did not want to spend so much buying a facewash at first.</li>
            <li> but it tes the job done and has turned my back to a more smooth back that my wife loves</li>
            <li> It smells good and makes me look forward to washing my face everyday!</li>
            <li> I would recommend everyone trying this, it helps with the oiliness so much and makes your skin feel so soft and clean.</li>
            <li> better than compare to a normal facial cleanser</li>
            <li> It is also super cheap compared to other acne treatments.</li>
            <li> This product really cleared up my acne.</li>
            <li> I just wanted a gentle cleanser for my face.</li>
            <li> This cleanser really woks well on my skin....</li>
            <li> and it is so gentle....</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> but after trying this, it really cleared them all up.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to cover up much of anything regarding my acne</li>
            <li> If you add a touch of water (or use in the shower) it lathers really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pricey but worth the money so far.</li>
            <li> I got it thanks to a promotioanl price .</li>

            <li> Very unsatisfied with this purchase.</li>

            <li> This Product Really Works.</li>
            <li> I have been using this exfoliating cleanser for about 1 month now and let me tell you how much my skin has improved.</li>
            <li> I have very acne prone skin and breakouts all the time.</li>
            <li> haha</li>

            <li> Skip out on half your beauty regimen with this easy fix!</li>
            <li> I was do excited that I found something that actually worked, I bought another one for backup.</li>
            <li> even better use of this and other together.</li>
            <li> I have tried other Beauty Facial Extreme products and have been very happy with them as well.</li>
            <li> Not sure how this stuff has such great reviews.....doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> This cleanser has helped me last couple weeks to keep a clean face with no acne.</li>
            <li> The dark blackheads and the unclean stuff on my nose have mostly been removed.</li>
            <li> I am less than two weeks into using this and my skin looks so much better already.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a couple of weeks and my skin is smooth and no longer dry.</li>
            <li> I used this a few days ago when I got it, when I had a couple bright red blemishes.</li>
            <li> This product has helped wonders against both of them and helped reduce my tanned skin that has made me look a bit older.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone, not only those with acne but all people that hope to better take care of their skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to people with acne.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t really have to use blush, because my natural color shines through.</li>
            <li> I cleanse with this, then I use a toner (I really like this one from etsy: https://www.etsy.com/transaction/1037891810 ), then I use their acne cream ( http://www.amazon.com/Acne-Serum-Spot-Treatment-blackheads/dp/B00VOJ7S88/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1436307412&amp;sr&#x3D;1-3 ), and I follow with Nardo&#x27;s Natural Moisturizer ( http://www.nardosnatural.com/collections/shop-women/products/new-organic-facial-moisturizer ).</li>

            <li> Normally I am scared to try new products for my face, but I decided to give this Exfoliating Cleanser a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin, but it exfoliates well enough that it makes my skin baby soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Would not mind recommending this new exfoliating cleanser.</li>

            <li> It not only works better than any blackhead, acne, and whatever other cleanser</li>
            <li> After using this product, not only did my skin look more youthful and revived, but it also felt silkier and cleaner than it has with other products.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend, this is better than any cleanser or even any other product I have tried!</li>

            <li> NATURAL.</li>
            <li> I have frequent acne problems, and I tried this exfoliating cleanser to help fight the pimples.</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin, so I do not want to overuse it in case it over-dries</li>

            <li> I am only posting this because I am a long time acne sufferer who is looking for a TRUE product that will work for me.</li>
            <li> Just massage it in the face for few sec, rinse and use toner (I prefer rose water as a toner).</li>
            <li> I worry it may over-dry if I use it daily, but I do not know this for sure (so not a strong con).  </li>
            <li> I think that it works much better than other facial cleansers I&#x27;ve tried from my local pharmacies.</li>

            <li> Really helps fight against breakouts, and I&#x27;ve also noticed my pores getting smaller (which is great because I&#x27;ve had a really hard time keeping the pores on my nose small!).</li>
            <li> I saw major improvement!</li>
            <li> After only a few days, my face looks and feels better than it ever has following a doctor&#x27;s appointment.</li>
            <li> Beauty facial extreme keeps my skin clear from damaged sun spots, acne and even smile lines.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a new cleaner, look no further!</li>
            <li> Really helps my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this would work if you only used it 2x a week, 1x a day, but otherwise, I find it to be a very inappropriate facial cleaning product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;P.S. had an isolated break out on my chin, nothing major and this stuff didn&#x27;t even work for that.</li>
            <li> Used it for a few days and never got the feeling that it gave me a deep clean.  </li>
            <li> I have always had a problem with mild acne and especially nose black heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently trying philosophy clear days ahead</li>
            <li> When you look at our faces, she looks far much younger.</li>
            <li> To start off, I&#x27;m 24 year old female who has ALWAYS struggled with acne.</li>
            <li> contains natural and essential ingredients to remove excess oils, dirt, and residues.</li>
            <li> I am 21 and the only thing I got going for me is acne and early onset of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Ive tried a couple different cleansers and they all didnt work nearly as well.</li>
            <li> Spent way too much on this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands but this really works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so gentle on my skin unlike those other products that burn and itch.</li>
            <li> This is the ultimate facial cleanser that gives natural results without blemishes.</li>
            <li> From then on, it so completely dried out my facial skin that even though I haven&#x27;t used it in 2 weeks, my skin continues to look flaky, old, and very unattractive.  </li>
            <li> I instantly saw an improvement in the appeareance of my face skin, my pores are barely noticeable and my skin is looking moisturized than ever.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin and sensitive skin I would use this once per day instead of twice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used variety of products from Proactiv (what a waste of money, I had NO results), Yes to Carrots (again no results), Neutrogena Grapefruit Extract (I had moderate results, but nothing I&#x27;d write home to mom about), AcneFree (no results), Cetaphil (nothing), Clean and Clear Advantage Kit (moderate results), Clinique (nothing), Bare Essentials Face Wash (nada), Clearasil (nope), JuiceBeauty (nothing again), St. Ives (moderate results), Indian Healing Clay (messy and nothing happened), The Body Shop (tea tree oil cleanser)...</li>
            <li> less grease, less dirt, just clean.</li>
            <li> And Iâ€™m anxious to see if my pores really do shrink with continued use.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how much longer I can purchase the products.</li>
            <li> Iâ€™m suffering with oily face since long time and tried using different face creams, but those did not helped me a lot.</li>
            <li> So far, the redness is down, I used again today, and I am going to update.</li>
            <li> especially when i get those pesky dry skin flakes that show up around my nose</li>
            <li> I used to spend a lot on different products but now I said bye to all my extra expenses due to this product.</li>
            <li> This is especially something that people with either skin that dries out easily, especially using other skin exfoliators cause.</li>
            <li> So after a week I really started to notice a difference all over my face, which sounds crazy, but I really was only looking for something to shrink pores.</li>
            <li> Iâ€™ve had issues with my skin for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product to shrink my pores for way too long.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d known about this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Iâ€™ve had issues with my skin for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> Bought this product not too long ago</li>
            <li> If you plan on buying the product, take a look at the ingredients first and try a small sample on somewhere other than your face!</li>
            <li> Antibacterial benefit set with salicylic acid that gives a mild exfoliation of dead cells that can cause clogged pores and a dull complexion for cleaner and clearer</li>
            <li> After only 3 uses of this exfoliating cleanser, my acne began to do a slow crawl onto Planet Nonexistent, and by the 5th use, my acne had almost completely faded into oblivion!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the product that exfoliates,cleanses and addresses those skin problems that you have been trying to get rid of for so long, then you have found it!</li>
            <li> Will using it twice a day make your skin excessively dry and/or cause a burning sensation?</li>
            <li> Will using it twice a day make your skin excessively dry and/or cause a burning sensation?</li>
            <li> Type: Combination, Dry, Sensitive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a week of use day and night it started to dry out my skin a bit</li>
            <li> It removed the impurities in my body but it didnt dry my skin.  </li>
            <li> did not use it, I highly recommend it for those who have problems with rough skin and face senter that feeling hard as wood.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Beauty Facial Extreme!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no joke when they say its Beauty Facial Extreme!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Beauty Facial Extreme&#x27;s products work, and they work extremely well.</li>
            <li> This cleanser works fine- no better or worse than any of the other cheaper products out there.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me that I need to be careful in picking the treatments I use for my skin.</li>
            <li> I got myself cured from acne problem from which I was facing problems for the last few years.</li>
            <li> It removes all the dead skins and deep cleans the skin.</li>
            <li> I mean wow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a cheap face wash for the past year now, and it finally wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore, so I tried this.</li>
            <li> I guess I was not sure what to expect because I havenâ€™t found a product that actually worked but when it works it works.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine using any other sort of exfoliating cleanser.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since using this product I&#x27;ve noticed an extreme decrease in acne.</li>
            <li> I had an extreme amount on my chin and nose, and this has done well to reduce it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical of this cleanser -</li>
            <li> IT IS AN ONLINE PICTURE FROM WEBMD AND SHOULD NOT BE USED TO PROMOTE OTHER PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> I am going to order the other cleanser and the lotion as well.  </li>
            <li> I bought the vitamin c cleanser and acne toner from extreme beauty as well bc</li>
            <li> The Exfoliating Cleanser has worked faster then any other product that I have used.</li>
            <li> It was just the same as usual and can&#x27;t remove make up.</li>
            <li> I had bumps on my skin and dark circles on my eyes and this cleared all of that.</li>
            <li> It felt like I had a chemical peel minus the harsh chemicals and aftermath.</li>
            <li> Exfoliating cure cleansing gel has worked for her two years down the line.</li>
            <li> It seems to be helping with blemishes and other skin issues!  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe I spent almost 40 dollars on this!!</li>
            <li> I do not want to be misled for other products that does not work, hence waste my money and time.</li>
            <li> My acne is a lot less noticeable and my face feels smoother.</li>
            <li> My face is smoother, my pores are invisible, and even my wrinkles are less visible.</li>
            <li> My face feels smoother, my wrinkles less visible.</li>
            <li> My acne scars are going away, my blackheads are clearing up on my nose, and I am getting less pimples on my face.</li>
            <li> I used this cleanser for a week and half</li>
            <li> But as anyone who is dealing with acne understands, sometimes you just get so desperate that you are willing to try anything.</li>
            <li> I often break out with the other cleansers Iâ€™ve used in the past but not with this product.</li>
            <li> My acne is clearing and the little acne scars as well</li>
            <li> I had hit a wall and decided to try it little</li>
            <li> This product dry my skin so much that start to be painful .....</li>
            <li> Feel like trying out other products too!!</li>
            <li> However on the 3rd day I woke up, I had a reaction to the product that I&#x27;ve never experienced before.</li>
            <li> Every product Iâ€™ve used has either made my face break out or has dried it out.</li>
            <li> One of my friend used to apply these everyday.</li>
            <li> This product lets me do that without being too harsh or even damaging my skin.</li>
            <li> (I do use a green primer which neutralizes the redness from acne scars.)</li>
            <li> and I see no difference, waste of money</li>
            <li> Every product Iâ€™ve used has either made my face break out or has dried it out.</li>
            <li> I try really hard to use this with all of the other products in the line.</li>
            <li> I decided to enquire the secret behind the tender and vibrant look on her skin.</li>
            <li> it is a little pricey !</li>
            <li> Not that I&#x27;ve noticed, but I usually follow a regimen morning and night after cleansing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not that I&#x27;ve noticed, but I usually follow a regimen morning and night after cleansing.  </li>
            <li> and I had to stop using it because I started to get RASHES and SMALL BUMPS on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;re fake, but it definitely looks suspicious.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for a few weeks now and it has dried my skin out and where my skin hasn&#x27;t dried out it has broken out.</li>
            <li> I have used all of the products that you see in random commercials that catch your attention, especially if you deal with skin ailments.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work :(</li>
            <li> i recommend this product it has help me with all my black heads,And believe me that is an issue i have been suffering with for the past 3 years!!</li>
            <li> It leaves my dull skin brighter and smoother...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late teens and have always had acne problems.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m going to do it anyway; using this has bumped me at least 2 opints in the hotness scale.</li>
            <li> but nothing serious</li>
            <li> So confused.</li>
            <li> My pores are almost extinct</li>
            <li> Before finding this little jewel, I was the unfortunate chick who had to pile on pounds and tons of makeup just to cover my grotesquely acne-ridden face.</li>
            <li> Sorry, ladies... these reviews are fake.  </li>
            <li> The last thing I used on my face was, after a while, really awful for me, because of the chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have bought lines of expensive cleaners and anti-acne series skincare</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also expensive and didn&#x27;t do what it was claimed to do.  </li>
            <li> It only made my acne worst.</li>
            <li> My pores have decreased in size!</li>
            <li> all in all I&#x27;ve probably spent well over $600 trying to get rid of my persistent and VERY annoying acne problem.</li>
            <li> Very expensive but sadly has no effect on my pimples.</li>
            <li> I usually suffer horrible hormonal out breaks.</li>
            <li> but it is way to expensive!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!  </li>
            <li> Try it and you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> combination dry&lt;br /&gt;Age:26&lt;br /&gt;I moved to another state and my skin has either been unresponsive or reacted in the worst ways to what was my go to for my skincare routine.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product really cleared up my acne. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> There are so many things I like about this exfoliating cleanser since I started using it. I often break out with the other cleansers Iâ€™ve used in the past but not with this product. My skin feels fresh and smooth. I will be buying again</li>
            <li> You Guys Really have to try this product! This product is Awesome!</li>
            <li> i recommend this product it has help me with all my black heads,And believe me that is an issue i have been suffering with for the past 3 years!! try this out guys!!</li>
            <li> This is the ultimate facial cleanser that gives natural results without blemishes. I highly recommend to people with acne.</li>
            <li> Sorry, ladies... these reviews are fake.  This product is nothing more than cheap clear hand soap.  Returned!</li>
            <li> I always had relatively beautiful skin. I just wanted a gentle cleanser for my face. I bought this product after seeing all the amazing reviews. The first 2 days I used it, it was amazing. However on the 3rd day I woke up, I had a reaction to the product that I&#x27;ve never experienced before. If you plan on buying the product, take a look at the ingredients first and try a small sample on somewhere other than your face! I regret purchasing this product. I just hope it doesn&#x27;t end up scarring..</li>
            <li> When I was start to using this clay facial mask, I knew I wanted to try out more of this brandâ€™s products. Iâ€™ve had issues with my skin for as long as I can remember.  I used to have to use makeup remover wipes after washing my face to remove what was left. Every product Iâ€™ve used has either made my face break out or has dried it out. I was never able to find a happy medium. I found myself browsing Amazon for face and body acne relievers and came across this product.&lt;br /&gt; I use the facial cleanser twice daily, once at night and another time during the day. I was astonished by how quickly and effective this facial cleanser was, it even took care of my black heads. Indeed a 10/10 for me, donâ€™t doubt it till you try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beauty Facial Extreme&#x27;s products work, and they work extremely well.

            <li> This cleanser really woks well on my skin....and it is so gentle....great product!</li>
            <li> Not sure how this stuff has such great reviews.....doesn&#x27;t do anything. You can buy comparable soap at ANY drug store. So confused. Was hoping that this stuff would actually do something. I wonder if the reviewers are paid or made up....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. had an isolated break out on my chin, nothing major and this stuff didn&#x27;t even work for that.</li>
            <li> great cleanser for body and face:)</li>
            <li> This really makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li> I usually suffer horrible hormonal out breaks. This scrub totally helps around that time. I can feel confident, and not worry that everyone is staring at my bumpy face.</li>
            <li> A good friend of mine is four years older than i. When you look at our faces, she looks far much younger. I decided to enquire the secret behind the tender and vibrant look on her skin. Exfoliating cure cleansing gel has worked for her two years down the line. She is all I needed to give me the anti-aging skin have yearned for all along. Two months now and the results are brilliant.</li>
            <li> It has helped me in lightening my skin. I am using it daily and the results are good. Would not mind recommending this new exfoliating cleanser. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product to shrink my pores for way too long. I have used almost all of the over-the-counter brands with no luck. I found this while searching for the next miracle cream and decided to try it. So after a week I really started to notice a difference all over my face, which sounds crazy, but I really was only looking for something to shrink pores. My acne is a lot less noticeable and my face feels smoother. I guess I was not sure what to expect because I havenâ€™t found a product that actually worked but when it works it works. And this works great. All skin is different and what works for one person might not work for the next but I think this cleanser can help all skin types.</li>
            <li> Acne has been my biggest enemy these last five or six months, and I couldn&#x27;t find a good cleanser until now! This cleanser has helped me last couple weeks to keep a clean face with no acne. If you are looking for a new cleaner, look no further!</li>
            <li> better than compare to a normal facial cleanser</li>
            <li> Wow, I love this cleanser! My friend recommended it and after only a week of using it my skin has totally transformed. My face is smoother, my pores are invisible, and even my wrinkles are less visible. My skin feels fresh and youthful, and I do not even need to wear foundation. It smells good and makes me look forward to washing my face everyday! I would definitely recommend, this is better than any cleanser or even any other product I have tried!</li>
            <li> Make my skin even more oily than normal &amp; so in return my skin broke out even more..</li>
            <li> Magical !! I just brought this product while browsing around and I&#x27;m really glad I did.. There has been a considerable change in the texture and tone of my skin.. It leaves my dull skin brighter and smoother... Feel like trying out other products too!!</li>
            <li> Beauty Facial Extreme! I love it that this is completely natural. The last thing I used on my face was, after a while, really awful for me, because of the chemicals. It actually made me dizzy. Natural is always the best way to go. Beautiful.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser! My colleague recommended it after noticing my skin with wrinkles. Just in a week of using it my skin has transformed. My face feels smoother, my wrinkles less visible. My skin feels fresh and youthful I would recommend it as a best cleanser i have ever tried.</li>
            <li> this moisturizer is really very awesome. One of my friend used to apply these everyday. It smells really good. The antioxidant and the other ingredients are very good. one of the best qualities. I really loved it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to some ingredient but this came with ingredient and I made sure it would be healthy for my skin. Works like a charm and it makes my skin smooth. I can feel it cleaning out my pores and also make me look amazing. It is highly effective against acne.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous. I was looking for something natural for my skin care. The main problem - natural does not mean effective. This product combines effectiveness and really nice list of ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;You will notice the difference right away. Just massage it in the face for few sec, rinse and use toner (I prefer rose water as a toner). And you will love it! :)</li>
            <li> This product truly works the best, I&#x27;ve been struggling with a bad case of adult acne and sought many solutions, and my long search finally ends with this incredible product</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference right away!  My skin feels smoother and my pores are smaller.  I was reluctant to pay so much for a face wash, but it really is worth it!</li>
            <li> Worked great! Cleared my face!</li>
            <li> I love this line of products. Both my SO and I use it all the time.  I personally get the best results when I use it with the mask.  I have combination sensitive skin and I have NO problems with it.  But it&#x27;s always smart to test it out first!</li>
            <li> My skin glows now! I love to exfoliate and cleanse my skin as much and possible. This product lets me do that without being too harsh or even damaging my skin. I can&#x27;t imagine using any other sort of exfoliating cleanser. I try really hard to use this with all of the other products in the line. If you can&#x27;t it does work really well on its own still. I just love how soft my skin feels.</li>
            <li> A great product to add for my growing family .</li>
            <li> . As an active skin care product user this product has been the most effective out of all the brands I have used.</li>
            <li> This does what it says it does, its perfect and it really works. I know im buying this again when i run out of mine.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many exfolating cleansers,  some worked OK some not at all. This was by far the best exfoliator I have ever used. It applied good, no odor, left my skin feeling soft and smooth. After using a couple days I noticed a change in the amount of visible pores I was do excited that I found something that actually worked, I bought another one for backup. I would highly recommend this exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I used to spend a lot on different products but now I said bye to all my extra expenses due to this product. The most important aspect I like about it that I can use it for any skin problem. Thanks to the manufacturer for creating all in one package for the skin. :)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts since using this. It also helped to clear up old blemishes without over drying.</li>
            <li> Love this more everytime use it. Leaves my face 100% clean :)</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser I had. Nice smell. I use it twice for a day. After 4 weeks, u can feel your skin look brighter and smoother. Good for acnes too.</li>
            <li> After struggling for years with acne and oily skin, after trying this, it worked miracles! I&#x27;ve always had problems with oily skin and outbreaks on my chin and on my nose but after trying this, it really cleared them all up. I would recommend everyone trying this, it helps with the oiliness so much and makes your skin feel so soft and clean. The scent from this is also very great. This is especially something that people with either skin that dries out easily, especially using other skin exfoliators cause. Or sensitive skin, it&#x27;s very soft in that aspect. A great product that I would recommend for anyone struggling with skin problems.</li>
            <li> I really like how this treatment feels like it is all the different acne treatments in one, and you can really feel that effect on your skin. And it works super fast. My acne scars are going away, my blackheads are clearing up on my nose, and I am getting less pimples on my face. It is also super cheap compared to other acne treatments. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I use this twice a day and have seen results on day 2.  It is important to not skip days with this product as then it will take more time for your skin to readjust to the formula.  It doesn&#x27;t really dry out my skin like similar products have done in the past which I think is a great added bonus to the already good features of this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I did not want to spend so much buying a facewash at first. But this is totally worth it! After using it, I felt that my skin is smoother, and my pores have become smaller. The dark blackheads and the unclean stuff on my nose have mostly been removed. The scrub is definitely doing its job. And  it leaves my skin with a refreshing feeling. I&#x27;ll keep on using it, and hope that it will help me treat my acne.</li>
            <li> To start off, I&#x27;m 24 year old female who has ALWAYS struggled with acne. I have combination skin with mild rosacea. I&#x27;ve used variety of products from Proactiv (what a waste of money, I had NO results), Yes to Carrots (again no results), Neutrogena Grapefruit Extract (I had moderate results, but nothing I&#x27;d write home to mom about), AcneFree (no results), Cetaphil (nothing), Clean and Clear Advantage Kit (moderate results), Clinique (nothing), Bare Essentials Face Wash (nada), Clearasil (nope), JuiceBeauty (nothing again), St. Ives (moderate results), Indian Healing Clay (messy and nothing happened), The Body Shop (tea tree oil cleanser)... all in all I&#x27;ve probably spent well over $600 trying to get rid of my persistent and VERY annoying acne problem. That being said, if you&#x27;ve tried everything and you&#x27;ve gotten no results (like me) perhaps this is the thing to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using this product I&#x27;ve noticed an extreme decrease in acne. For the first time in forever (I promise I&#x27;m not singing the lyric to that song in the movie Frozen) I&#x27;m able to be make-up free (save for my eyebrows which I have tendency to over-pluck so I draw them on with an angled brush and bareMinerals brow powder) and I don&#x27;t have to cover up much of anything regarding my acne (I do use a green primer which neutralizes the redness from acne scars.) That being said, if I decided to use makeup I&#x27;ve noticed it looks smoother and my skin looks fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1, Does this help with acne? Absolutely!&lt;br /&gt;2. Does it help with blackheads? It&#x27;s helped reduce the amount of blackheads that I&#x27;ve had. I had an extreme amount on my chin and nose, and this has done well to reduce it.&lt;br /&gt;3. Does it help reduce acne scars? I&#x27;ve not noticed any reduction in the acne scars that I have. That being said I did not purchase this product to assist with acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;4. Does it lather well? If you add a touch of water (or use in the shower) it lathers really well.&lt;br /&gt;5. Is the scent off-putting? Not at all. It&#x27;s lightly fragrant and doesn&#x27;t remain on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;6. Will using it twice a day make your skin excessively dry and/or cause a burning sensation? Not that I&#x27;ve noticed, but I usually follow a regimen morning and night after cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do I do as far as regimen goes? I cleanse with this, then I use a toner (I really like this one from etsy: https://www.etsy.com/transaction/1037891810 ), then I use their acne cream ( http://www.amazon.com/Acne-Serum-Spot-Treatment-blackheads/dp/B00VOJ7S88/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1436307412&amp;sr&#x3D;1-3 ), and I follow with Nardo&#x27;s Natural Moisturizer ( http://www.nardosnatural.com/collections/shop-women/products/new-organic-facial-moisturizer ).

            <li> I used this a few days ago when I got it, when I had a couple bright red blemishes. So far, the redness is down, I used again today, and I am going to update.</li>
            <li> It is a nice and useful product. My skin feels so good after using it.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I ordered it. It is a product that I will use daily and make me feel good about myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended this to family members as well and they love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser 3-4 times a week and my skin is smooth. I have fair sensitive skin which is prone to irritation breakouts. I have been using it for few months and my skin looks great, I try different products befor but this one is the only one seems to work.</li>
            <li> Works great! Doesn&#x27;t create issues with my skin and is reasonably priced! -rrc</li>
            <li> I liked it. Will probably order again</li>
            <li> Gets rid of dirt under pores, is gentle enough for sensitive skin which has always been a problem for me, and is good for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Acne is a problem in high school, when the appearance is one of the things that matter most. how you dress, how you look, it&#x27;s the first thing they see your classmates and of course, no one would like to walk with acne on the face, a friend recommended me this product and then went to buy it in a store in my city. I tell them the results of use, the acne has diminished and my skin looks better, it&#x27;s a good product even better use of this and other together.</li>
            <li> Pricey but worth the money so far. I am less than two weeks into using this and my skin looks so much better already.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical of this cleanser - I have tried so many before but none seemed to battle my acne or large pores effectively. But as anyone who is dealing with acne understands, sometimes you just get so desperate that you are willing to try anything. I have bought lines of expensive cleaners and anti-acne series skincare but they only seemed to work for a week until it all went downhill again. I have been using this product for weeks now, and my acne is still under control!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin Type: Combination, Dry, Sensitive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only has my acne subsided, but my pores are free and minimized! The T-zone was the most problematic part of my face, yet this product worked really well for it. AND my skin-tone even out nicely in the process! I absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I just started using this cleanser. I&#x27;ll update in a months time. So far so good tho&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE; I think I have to agree with the others who say that the 5 Star reviews must be paid reviews. Most of the reviews are not even from &amp;#34;Amazon verified buyers&amp;#34;. I used this cleanser for a week and half and I had to stop using it because I started to get RASHES and SMALL BUMPS on my face. I want my MONEY BACK. I had to throw the product away as soon as possible. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> the protection which this cream gives is provided by none. it has moisturizing properties which work stunningly on skin. the best out of the entire lot.  also very good for acne removal and cleansing of skin, i really liked it, will recommend to all. very very good.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product, because my skin did feel so very soft and at the same time clean after using it for the first 2 days. From then on, it so completely dried out my facial skin that even though I haven&#x27;t used it in 2 weeks, my skin continues to look flaky, old, and very unattractive.  Perhaps this would work if you only used it 2x a week, 1x a day, but otherwise, I find it to be a very inappropriate facial cleaning product.</li>
            <li> EVERYONE PLEASE READ!!!! This comment is in regards to the misleading picture on the right \\&quot;MIRACLE WORKER\\&quot; by Irma. I&#x27;m only giving it 5 star so it stays on top of the comment list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE PICTURE IS COPYRIGHTED AND MISLEADING. IT IS AN ONLINE PICTURE FROM WEBMD AND SHOULD NOT BE USED TO PROMOTE OTHER PRODUCTS. It&#x27;s funny I was browsing for acne treatments when I came across this article from WebMD.com [...] and I saw this EXACT SAME PICTURE. This picture was achieved after 5 TREATMENTS OF DIODE LASER as stated in WebMD; not from using an exfoliating cleanser such as this product. I am only posting this because I am a long time acne sufferer who is looking for a TRUE product that will work for me. I do not want to be misled for other products that does not work, hence waste my money and time. I&#x27;m sure others would want the same. I hope you find this posting helpful. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Good product . What a useful product ! I and my wife really love this product .It contains natural and essential ingredients to remove excess oils, dirt, and residues. Gentle and safe for all skin types . This product is suitable for men and women . It&#x27;s convenient for people. Easy to use . I got it thanks to a promotioanl price . I felt more comfortable after using . So I purchased 2 items for my family . Rating 5/5 stars for good quality</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work :(</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  Used it for a few days and never got the feeling that it gave me a deep clean.  My face was oily and I started breaking out.  Most of these reviews are unverified. I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;re fake, but it definitely looks suspicious.  I&#x27;m just trying to inform customers to not make the same mistake as I did.  It&#x27;s also expensive and didn&#x27;t do what it was claimed to do.  Good luck my friends in finding the right face wash.  I&#x27;m currently trying philosophy clear days ahead and so far, so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late teens and have always had acne problems. This wash has helped my face clear up very quickly. I always thought these kind of things were frivolous, but it&#x27;s really worthwhile if you care about appearance and hygiene.</li>
            <li> This product is a acne destroyer I just want to say this isn&#x27;t a holy product but it tes the job done and has turned my back to a more smooth back that my wife loves</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for two weeks now and I haven&#x27;t seen any changes. It only made my acne worst.</li>
            <li> the best exfoliating cleanser. just loved it..I have been using many skin care products before but this one is amazing..i am using this product from last 3 months and it really works..so THUMBS UP from my side for this lovely product</li>
            <li> My face feels great! It seems to be helping with blemishes and other skin issues!  I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results!</li>
            <li> 2nd time I have purchased. I love all of their products. Shipping time is great and product is great! My skin is not totally clear, but better than other products I have used.</li>
            <li> I am here to tell you this product  worked. My face felt smooth and soft after one use. No need to pay more when this works I will be buying more I even bought my mom some for her birthday</li>
            <li> This cleanser is amazing. It not only works better than any blackhead, acne, and whatever other cleanser there are. It&#x27;s perfect for any sin imperfection. It has all the products that bother your skin all into one great cleanser which makes it the perfect thing for anyone in need of it.</li>
            <li> GREAT!  I&#x27;m HOOKED!  This stuff is amazing!  I am going to order the other cleanser and the lotion as well.  It really makes my skin smooth.  I LOVE it!  And, I am not one to spend alot of money on anything like this but, I have to say..  It&#x27;s totally worth it!  You will not be disappointed!  Enjoy! :)</li>
            <li> love this product.  Helps keep my skin clear and smooth. especially when i get those pesky dry skin flakes that show up around my nose and after i have been out in the sun for a while.</li>
            <li> I agree with everyone else.  It really cleans and makes your skin feel wonderful. This will be the only cleanser I use from now on!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a cheap face wash for the past year now, and it finally wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore, so I tried this. I&#x27;ve tried several other products from this brand, and they all work great, so it wasn&#x27;t a surprise that this one was just as good. It&#x27;s gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin, but it exfoliates well enough that it makes my skin baby soft and smooth. I was very happy to read that it was paraben free. My skin gets really oily after a while, so I have to have a face wash that helps control that, and this works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before; I&#x27;ve noticed a huge decrease in oiliness. Really helps fight against breakouts, and I&#x27;ve also noticed my pores getting smaller (which is great because I&#x27;ve had a really hard time keeping the pores on my nose small!). My skin is in better condition than it&#x27;s ever been, so I&#x27;m pretty pleased with this face wash! It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> If you are acne prone then this is the best product for you. It also really helps your pores. This also helps your blood circulate as well. I also love that this helps with all types of people in different age brackets as well.</li>
            <li> It does a good job,  is reasonably priced and has a light, pleasant citrus fragrance.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the B-O-M-B!  Before finding this little jewel, I was the unfortunate chick who had to pile on pounds and tons of makeup just to cover my grotesquely acne-ridden face. After only 3 uses of this exfoliating cleanser, my acne began to do a slow crawl onto Planet Nonexistent, and by the 5th use, my acne had almost completely faded into oblivion! I was amazed that a something so reasonably priced had the ability to almost work miracles. The improvement of my skin tone and texture were simply just added bonuses to this magical exfoliating cleanser!</li>
            <li> I am still breaking out and I see no difference, waste of money</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to spend so much on a face wash however,&lt;br /&gt;It really was worth it!&lt;br /&gt;My skin already feels smoother and I feel alot fresher!</li>
            <li> The product is really easy to use and makes your face look elegant. When you have no time time and want to cleanse your face super fast, you can rely on this.</li>
            <li> I love exfoliation, so I try multiple brands. I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this company. I have always had a problem with mild acne and especially nose black heads. It really annoys me to look in the mirror and see something that is so easy to change. I was given a bunch of these products from my aunt for Christmas and they work well.</li>
            <li> Iâ€™m suffering with oily face since long time and tried using different face creams, but those did not helped me a lot. One fine day my friend suggested me to use this washer and started using this cream. Now I found the face was bit fresh and feels good compared with my past..!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this if you are suffering with oily skin.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!My skin looks health</li>
            <li> This is wonderful! On my very first use I saw results with gentle yet effective exfoliation. I wish I&#x27;d known about this a long time ago. My skin is oily and I live in a humid state so you can imagine. No drying issues either.</li>
            <li> I am 21 and the only thing I got going for me is acne and early onset of wrinkles. This product has helped wonders against both of them and helped reduce my tanned skin that has made me look a bit older.</li>
            <li> Like the title says, my face looks amazing. I don&#x27;t want to brag but I&#x27;m going to do it anyway; using this has bumped me at least 2 opints in the hotness scale.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of pimples and acne. My mother told me that must buy a product who fights against them. I found this and I bought it! Wonderful results! Now I have no pimples and acne, my skin is wonderful! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now and it cleared a lot of my acne marks. My dermatologist told me that I need to be careful in picking the treatments I use for my skin. Gladly, I found this product. It exfoliates my skin every time I use it. Very effective and suggested for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Skin type: combination dry&lt;br /&gt;Age:26&lt;br /&gt;I moved to another state and my skin has either been unresponsive or reacted in the worst ways to what was my go to for my skincare routine. My acne is clearing and the little acne scars as well and my skin is evening out. I bought the vitamin c cleanser and acne toner from extreme beauty as well bc After a week of use day and night it started to dry out my skin a bit but nothing serious so I will prob. Will be using this for a day time or night time not both. I would definitely recommend this</li>
            <li> Really helps my dry skin. Been using it for a couple of weeks and my skin is smooth and no longer dry.</li>
            <li> After purchasing and using their clay facial mask, I knew I wanted to try out more of this brandâ€™s products. Iâ€™ve had issues with my skin for as long as I can remember. Every product Iâ€™ve used has either made my face break out or has dried it out. I was never able to find a happy medium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this facial cleanser, my skin immediately felt soft and, for lack of a better term, happy. My face felt moisturized and clean, a wonderful combination that so many products are unable to deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleansersâ€™ scent is soothing and makes for a nice relaxing shower. And Iâ€™m anxious to see if my pores really do shrink with continued use. But Iâ€™m already super pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> This is the first exfoliating cleanser that did not leave my skin dry and breaking out. I use it on my face as well as body. It is gentle enough for my face and I actually feel the papaya enzymes at work on my skin. One of the best things I like about this product is that it is free of sulfates, parabens, artificial dyes and fragrances, but still has a pleasant relaxing smell. It&#x27;s not only good for acne but for overall health of skin. This is a product I will recommend to all my girlfriends.</li>
            <li> Bought this product not too long ago and I am pleased to say im already seeing results! Ive tried a couple different cleansers and they all didnt work nearly as well. Ive recommended this to family members as well and they love it! Definitely better than any gel, cream, scrub, polishe, washe or exfoliator ive ever used before! Will definitely be buying more once i run out! :)</li>
            <li> This facial cleaner is amazing it has your face feeling soft, clean and refresh also helps shrink your pores. It is fast acting you will notice results immediately. I shared some with my daughter and works great for her as well. She will be purchasing her own soon.</li>
            <li> This solution is more worth than the price. I got myself cured from acne problem from which I was facing problems for the last few years. Thanks to this cleanser now I am acne free :D just follow the directions given with patience and you will see that your skin will improve for sure.</li>
            <li> After using this, my skin just feels cleaner. less grease, less dirt, just clean. I&#x27;d recommend to anybody even without acne.</li>
            <li> Stops all acne it also gives you a healthy skin. You will notice the different in weeks.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best skin care products on the market!</li>
            <li> Excellent product for my wife ... He likes the way his face left after the cream is applied, the best part was that it acquired on promotion.&lt;br /&gt;The feeling of having smooth and shiny skin feels much better than before did not use it, I highly recommend it for those who have problems with rough skin and face senter that feeling hard as wood.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning cream face in his presentation is enough for about many tramientos certainly buy it again for her and possibly for me why not?&lt;br /&gt;We sincerely thank you very much to you. For such a great product and great.</li>
            <li> Clean and clear skin has never been easier. I love using just ONE product to take care of my facial care needs!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this line of products. The acne clearing benefit is very noticeable and I like that I can use it on my face and my body! It&#x27;s not too chemically either.... It feels very natural on my skin.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the product that exfoliates,cleanses and addresses those skin problems that you have been trying to get rid of for so long, then you have found it! This exfoliating cleanser is bottled with ingredients that address many of the skin issues we have! It is a product worth the try!</li>
            <li> This product is great! It does what it promises to do, which is a rare claim among skin cleansers and anti-acne products. Try it and you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> After using this product, not only did my skin look more youthful and revived, but it also felt silkier and cleaner than it has with other products. This cleanser is not oily, and never leaves splotches. I will definitely recommend this product to my friends!</li>
            <li> I have tried and tried and tried so many different types of exfoliant to unclog my pores and make my skin feel fresh, and none have ever taken the cake like this one! It felt like I had a chemical peel minus the harsh chemicals and aftermath. Skip out on half your beauty regimen with this easy fix! And also I cannot get enough of the adorable packaging. Five stars, all the way.</li>
            <li> Spent way too much on this product. I have used it for a few weeks now and it has dried my skin out and where my skin hasn&#x27;t dried out it has broken out. Very unsatisfied with this purchase. I bought an $8 exfoliating face wash from Walmart that works much better than this.</li>
            <li> before 15days i try this product, but now its good result.&lt;br /&gt;iam very satisfied. now my face become a handsome.</li>
            <li> This product dry my skin so much that start to be painful .....</li>
            <li> my mother purchased this product and she found it to be awesome. A really good one. It removes all the dead skins and deep cleans the skin. It can also be used as a face wash. The lotion has really good smell. It is also very affordable. It removes all the scars from the face and the face starts glowing. My mother has witnessed great results from this. One should use it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Really is. I have some and it made my skin clear up faster than you can say clear up my skin. So if you want some skin cream for your skin then buy this stuff it works nice and you can&#x27;t find anything better.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is fantastic. It makes my skin feel so fresh and clean! My pores have decreased in size! I&#x27;m recommending to everyone I know!</li>
            <li> I actually like this product. I think that it does exactly what it says....but it is way to expensive! I am not sure how much longer I can purchase the products. I may have to look for something similar with the same results.</li>
            <li> Felt great the first use ! You can really tell it works! I definitely love it and it smells great ! I have little bumps all over in the summer and it helps smooth them! I would definitely love to try their line thou it is a little pricey ! But well worth the money !</li>
            <li> Normally I am scared to try new products for my face, but I decided to give this Exfoliating Cleanser a try. After one use, my skin felt amazingly soft. With me having sensitive skin, most products irritate my face but this one did not. I highly recommend it to everyone to help with removing blackheads. The Exfoliating Cleanser has worked faster then any other product that I have used.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for several times now and I have already seen a distinction. This has a lot of the best components use in other items for washing encounters and for pimples. It is very simple on the experience, of course everyone epidermis is different. But I definitely  think that anyone who wants better looking epidermis should give this a try.</li>
            <li> I really love this exfoliating cleanser. It soft yet effective with my skin. It removed the impurities in my body but it didnt dry my skin.  I instantly saw an improvement in the appeareance of my face skin, my pores are barely noticeable and my skin is looking moisturized than ever.&lt;br /&gt;I also really love that its not tested in animals, i thinks thats a great plus for any beauty product.</li>
            <li> Really cool product. Lightened up my acne.</li>
            <li> This Product Really Works. I had bumps on my skin and dark circles on my eyes and this cleared all of that. I highly recommend this product. I have tried other brands but this really works. If you have dry skin and sensitive skin I would use this once per day instead of twice. This product is great and I use nothing else.</li>
            <li> This and there acne pads are amazing! Cleared up my body acne in a couple of weeks I saw major improvement! 10/10 would recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been using this exfoliating cleanser for about 1 month now and let me tell you how much my skin has improved. I have very acne prone skin and breakouts all the time. I have tried so many products that I almost gave up entirely until I tried this product. Highly recommend for anyone who has acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product it makes my face very smooth and cleans it the best!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  I have combination skin oily/dry, occasional acne, and need something to help with anti-aging.  I highly recommend this as it&#x27;s easy to use, effective, and a good value.</li>
            <li> I love this exfoliating cleanser, it makes my skin feel so nice, smooth and clean! I use it all over my body. My skin is sensitive to most skin care products but this cleanser works great, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This cleanser works fine- no better or worse than any of the other cheaper products out there. I cannot believe I spent almost 40 dollars on this!! What was I thinking?!</li>
            <li> Thought it would work for me but didn&#x27;t. Very expensive but sadly has no effect on my pimples. It was just the same as usual and can&#x27;t remove make up.</li>
            <li> My face feels fresher and healthier than ever!</li>
            <li> The natural papaya enzymes are a natural cleaner and purifier. I use papaya on my hair, skin and face and so I have total faith in this product&#x27;s efficacy and safety of use. NATURAL. keep thinking all-natural. Use what God&#x27;s given us</li>
            <li> Some exfoliating cleansers do clean the skin but can also be harsh on it, Best New Exfoliating Cleanser is different.  It does clean the skin but it gentle on the skin as wel, its perfect for all agesl.</li>
            <li> I have used probably every exfoliating cleanser out there and nothing has ever come close to this. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference after only a week. It&#x27;s gentle, not too harsh and leaves my skin feeling refreshed. I now use this product daily as part of my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> I have frequent acne problems, and I tried this exfoliating cleanser to help fight the pimples. I have to say that it works great! I think that it works much better than other facial cleansers I&#x27;ve tried from my local pharmacies. I have tried other Beauty Facial Extreme products and have been very happy with them as well. This is a good solid product that makes my face look younger and free of acne problems. I love that it has a facial scrub feel because it feels like it is working while using it. I have it in my shower waiting for me every morning during my shower. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have oily/combo skin and when I have occasional breakouts, I use this regularly and my skin clears up without drying out (but I only use once daily, not twice daily as it recommends).  I do have sensitive skin, so I do not want to overuse it in case it over-dries, so I stop using it after one week which is all it takes for the break out to resolve (it starts improving by day 2 ).  And then I re-start if  I have another break out.  Pros:  This cleanser foams nicely, is a thick gel that does not drip, it has a nice smell, and the volume you get is quite substantial.  Cons:  I worry it may over-dry if I use it daily, but I do not know this for sure (so not a strong con).  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> My sister told me about the great products she bought here and so i came looking and you wouldn&#x27;t believe what i found! It&#x27;s no joke when they say its Beauty Facial Extreme! I mean wow. This exfoliating cleansing gel works so well. My skin is so soft and rejuvenated. My pores are almost extinct haha i love it! It&#x27;s so gentle on my skin unlike those other products that burn and itch. Beauty facial extreme keeps my skin clear from damaged sun spots, acne and even smile lines. Its awesome all my friends want mine.</li>
            <li> I have long been attempting to find a facial and body exfoliating wash to help with facial as well as body acne that has more recently worsened. I have used all of the products that you see in random commercials that catch your attention, especially if you deal with skin ailments. Although they were helpful in their own ways, none could provide me with the cleansing I needed for my face and body. I found myself browsing Amazon for face and body acne relievers and came across this product. I had hit a wall and decided to try it little did I know this would be the perfect solution to my acne troubles. It provides an exfoliating and smooth feel for your skin, not only on your face but your body as well. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone, not only those with acne but all people that hope to better take care of their skin.</li>
            <li> You really do get what you pay for and would recommend this skin treatment to anyone. After only a few days, my face looks and feels better than it ever has following a doctor&#x27;s appointment.</li>
