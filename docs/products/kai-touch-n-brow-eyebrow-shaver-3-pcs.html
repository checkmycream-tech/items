            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>Are nice to take on trips as these can be carried on board airplane no problem.</li>
            <li>NOthing special or great about it.</li>
            <li>This razor is so far the best I have tried.  </li>
            <li>The technician told me that these are the kind they use because they&#x27;re so safe.</li>
            <li>I love the Touch N Brow the best so far.  </li>
            <li>When I wrote my first review, I thought they were GREAT....</li>
            <li>After menopause I find myself growing excess peach fuzz on my face, and so I googled &amp;#34;what to do about peach fuzz&amp;#34; and found some great YouTube podcasts about exactly that post-menopausal issue.  </li>
            <li>These are very smooth.</li>
            <li>I was so impressed that I am about to purchase my second pack now.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t think of a better alternative.</li>
            <li>I love these razors and purchase them all the time.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I recommend that you search YouTube to have a visual guide on the best way to use these razors.</li>
            <li>I get many uses from each one.  </li>
            <li>Was happy to find them on ebay for a more reasonable amount.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and I agree with most, this razor works well.  </li>
            <li>I love these things for cleaning up my eyebrows without having to tweeze.</li>
            <li>They worked great around the eyebrows and upper lip and were very easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>Great for the pesky lip stash and eyebrows  could not find in my usual stores and so happy I found them</li>
            <li>Other than that, they are perfect!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>If you do at home dermaplanting, these are pretty handy.</li>
            <li>I was barely touching my skin and the hair fell off quickly without any irritation whatsoever.</li>
            <li>And the price is pretty good too ;)</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t been able to get it to work, you&#x27;re probably not holding it right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for the fine hairs that you can&#x27;t really get with tweezers and are 100% better and easier to use than regular razor blades.  </li>
            <li>These are the best little razors for shaving peach fuzz with!</li>
            <li>true--</li>
            <li>well, with subsequent uses they are not that good.</li>
            <li>but overall, good value and performance.</li>
            <li>I had originally purchased these from my Dermatologist office at a higher price.</li>
            <li>The ones in stores don&#x27;t cut right.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re well priced, last a while, and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I use them to clean up the hair on my neck between haircuts (my hair is very short at the back) and they do a great job, but my main use for them is as stitch rippers if I have to take out a seam.</li>
            <li>They worked exactly as the podcast described.  </li>
            <li>I first encountered this product from a dermaplaning class and now all my clients that have this procedure want these.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what is pictured, and works well too.</li>
            <li>Five stars for the price though, which makes the dull tool easy and convenient to replace :)</li>
            <li>And it seems very</li>
            <li>For some reason these cut me more than the other razor I have used.  </li>
            <li>It is quiet sharp, yet very safe to use.  </li>
            <li>Think of them as disposable razors - they go blunt fairly quickly - and buy several at a time.</li>
            <li>After watching YouTube videos of ladies using similar razors, I figured out the proper 45-degree angle, and then it worked like magic.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I feel totally safe using this in my bikini area or other sensitive areas, without fear of getting cut.</li>
            <li>I was extremely pleased with these little shavers.  </li>
            <li>Normally they come 3 razors in a sealed package.</li>
            <li>These razors came already opened leaving me wondering if they are new or refurbished.</li>
            <li>mostly ok, be careful, some are sharper than others and may give you a tiny cut.</li>
            <li>the design is unique, having safe little \\&quot;bars\\&quot; that run across the blade, so that tiny mm-long gaps are left exposing the blade, just enough to cut the hairs, but not the skin.</li>
            <li>It is extremely safe to use, while cutting hairs easily.</li>
            <li>No in-growns so far, either.</li>
            <li>i really didnt like it, just stick with the regular razor.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows aren&#x27;t gross anymore hahaha</li>
            <li>The last several months before I need to get a fresh one out.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how good they are; however, I really felt sad that I received the different products.</li>
            <li>Mine is already 3 months old, which I use every 3 days, and it is still as sharp as new!</li>
            <li>Their blades are just not sharp enough.</li>
            <li>They do dull pretty quickly, but they last longer than other facial razors I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>Very sharp at first, but dulls down quickly (each one may last only two months if used once a week).</li>

            <li> Might sound weird to hear this coming from a man.</li>
            <li> other similar razors just do not compare to the quality of this one.</li>
            <li> It is the fastest, easiest, least irritating method of hair removal I&#x27;ve ever tried -- and it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go back to using a regular razor which I have used in the past and did experience some nicks.  </li>
            <li> So, I find that I have to work a bit harder to get at the tougher hairs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands, but keep coming back to these.</li>
            <li> I shave my face and usually use Twinkle razors with minimal issues.  </li>
            <li> I still wish they were just a little sharper.</li>
            <li> The little plastic blade-guards prevent cuts on the fabric, and the razor just glides down that seam!!</li>
            <li> It helps me tame and shape my eyebrow&#x27;s</li>
            <li> For me, though, my hair can be a little thick.  </li>
            <li> too hard to shave for me, wouldn&#x27;t recommend it myself.</li>
            <li> When I use it, I don&#x27;t experience razor burn or negative stuff like that.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it might cut me while using it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m out $21.57 and very disappointed with this order.</li>

            <li> I go to the salon to have my eyebrows threaded 2x/year, and I shave to maintain it, since I do not pluck.  This razor is so far the best I have tried.  It is quiet sharp, yet very safe to use.  Mine is already 3 months old, which I use every 3 days, and it is still as sharp as new!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful...other similar razors just do not compare to the quality of this one. It is extremely safe to use, while cutting hairs easily. Great for shaping eyebrows, since I do not like to pluck.</li>
            <li> The laser place where I used to go, uses these razors to touch up and prep the area before using the laser. The technician told me that these are the kind they use because they&#x27;re so safe. And it seems very true-- the design is unique, having safe little \\&quot;bars\\&quot; that run across the blade, so that tiny mm-long gaps are left exposing the blade, just enough to cut the hairs, but not the skin. I feel totally safe using this in my bikini area or other sensitive areas, without fear of getting cut. The design is great. I was so impressed that I am about to purchase my second pack now. When I use it, I don&#x27;t experience razor burn or negative stuff like that. No in-growns so far, either.</li>
            <li> This product works well.  I was afraid it might cut me while using it.  But it doesn&#x27;t at all.  It&#x27;s great for the fine hairs that you can&#x27;t really get with tweezers and are 100% better and easier to use than regular razor blades.  For me, though, my hair can be a little thick.  So, I find that I have to work a bit harder to get at the tougher hairs.  Other than that, they are perfect!  I can&#x27;t think of a better alternative.</li>
            <li> If you do at home dermaplanting, these are pretty handy. They do dull pretty quickly, but they last longer than other facial razors I&#x27;ve seen. And the price is pretty good too ;)</li>
            <li> The very best eyebrow shaver! Never a nick or cut.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item two weeks ago, and received it. I assumed this product is a Japanese one since the picture, but it is different from that picture. I haven&#x27;t used this eyebrow razors, so I don&#x27;t know how good they are; however, I really felt sad that I received the different products.</li>
            <li> Leaves some stubbles if u don&#x27;t use it against the grain but over all works great.</li>
            <li> These are the best little razors for shaving peach fuzz with! I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands, but keep coming back to these. It&#x27;s cheaper to order them on Amazon than to buy them at the local beauty supply!</li>
            <li> I use these for two jobs. I use them to clean up the hair on my neck between haircuts (my hair is very short at the back) and they do a great job, but my main use for them is as stitch rippers if I have to take out a seam. Boy do they do a wonderful job! The little plastic blade-guards prevent cuts on the fabric, and the razor just glides down that seam!! Think of them as disposable razors - they go blunt fairly quickly - and buy several at a time.</li>
            <li> When I get a facial, I am dermaplaned each time.  I wanted to do it at home in between visits.  When I wrote my first review, I thought they were GREAT....well, with subsequent uses they are not that good. Their blades are just not sharp enough.</li>
            <li> I love these razors and purchase them all the time. However, this order came with razors not packaged. Normally they come 3 razors in a sealed package. These razors came already opened leaving me wondering if they are new or refurbished. With the magnitude of blood diseases these days I don&#x27;t want to risk using a razor that is not in a sealed package. I&#x27;m out $21.57 and very disappointed with this order.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Might sound weird to hear this coming from a man. I use this to shave and trim my beard. It makes it very easy to trim the perfect line on my beard. I&#x27;ve used many expensive men products that just don&#x27;t measure up to this. I always buy 10 packs at a time which comes to 30 blades, and i&#x27;ve been happy with each and every one of them. 10/10 4 thumbs up! (i counted my toes) lol..</li>
            <li> For some reason these cut me more than the other razor I have used.  I shave my face and usually use Twinkle razors with minimal issues.  I probably wont repurchase.</li>
            <li> After menopause I find myself growing excess peach fuzz on my face, and so I googled &amp;#34;what to do about peach fuzz&amp;#34; and found some great YouTube podcasts about exactly that post-menopausal issue.  One of the devices shown in one podcast looked like these razors; so I ordered them.  They worked exactly as the podcast described.  I plan to keep them on hand to de-fuzz as often as necessary, and am hoping that will be the &amp;#34;once a month or so&amp;#34; described in the podcast.  I recommend that you search YouTube to have a visual guide on the best way to use these razors.</li>
            <li> Got product on time. Product was what I asked for and works great! Cannot find in store anylnger so really happy I can still get these type. Thank you for the great service</li>
            <li> I love the Touch N Brow the best so far.  I get many uses from each one.  I use it for trimming the hair of the nape of my neck as well as facial fuzz.  The last several months before I need to get a fresh one out.  I still wish they were just a little sharper.</li>
            <li> Great for the pesky lip stash and eyebrows  could not find in my usual stores and so happy I found them</li>
            <li> works good but the blade could be sharper</li>
            <li> it is wat it is. NOthing special or great about it.</li>
            <li> Love these! A lady&#x27;s must.</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased these from my Dermatologist office at a higher price. Was happy to find them on ebay for a more reasonable amount. These don&#x27;t irritate my skin like the Tinkle? brand I have tried. Are nice to take on trips as these can be carried on board airplane no problem.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and I agree with most, this razor works well.  It helps me tame and shape my eyebrow&#x27;s when I don&#x27;t have time to tweeze.</li>
            <li> It was a gift, but he is happy.</li>
            <li> mostly ok, be careful, some are sharper than others and may give you a tiny cut. but overall, good value and performance.</li>
            <li> I was extremely pleased with these little shavers.  They worked great around the eyebrows and upper lip and were very easy to handle.  I  had no issues with any nicks or scrapes.  As with any razor you need to use care but as long as you go slow (and use some type of lather and not use on dry skin) you should be fine.  I won&#x27;t go back to using a regular razor which I have used in the past and did experience some nicks.  Will definitely be ordering in the future as well as recommending them to my friends.</li>
            <li> These are the best eyebrow shavers ever. The ones in stores don&#x27;t cut right. These are very smooth.</li>
            <li> Great for defining. Very sharp at first, but dulls down quickly (each one may last only two months if used once a week). Five stars for the price though, which makes the dull tool easy and convenient to replace :)</li>
            <li> I first encountered this product from a dermaplaning class and now all my clients that have this procedure want these. Easy to use.Love them!</li>
            <li> When I first tried this, I wasn&#x27;t holding it properly and it felt like a dull blade and wouldn&#x27;t cut any hair. After watching YouTube videos of ladies using similar razors, I figured out the proper 45-degree angle, and then it worked like magic. I was barely touching my skin and the hair fell off quickly without any irritation whatsoever. It is the fastest, easiest, least irritating method of hair removal I&#x27;ve ever tried -- and it&#x27;s cheap! I highly recommend it. If you haven&#x27;t been able to get it to work, you&#x27;re probably not holding it right.</li>
            <li> i really didnt like it, just stick with the regular razor. too hard to shave for me, wouldn&#x27;t recommend it myself.</li>
            <li> Replaces seam ripper in some projects</li>
            <li> Quality product I would order again.</li>
            <li> Good or the price. It is exactly what is pictured, and works well too. My eyebrows aren&#x27;t gross anymore hahaha</li>
            <li> I love these things for cleaning up my eyebrows without having to tweeze. They&#x27;re well priced, last a while, and very easy to use.</li>
