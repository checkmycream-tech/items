            <li>So easy to use and great color</li>
            <li>Super bright and a great, cheaper alternative to Splat or Manic Panic.</li>
            <li>The color is amazing..</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve washed my hair probably 6 times since dying it and it still looks amazing.</li>
            <li>The ADORE colors are the absolute best!</li>
            <li>Better quality color than my own hairstylist has.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far one of the best hair dyes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy about that</li>

            <li>Love it&lt;</li>
            <li>I love the way it turned out</li>
            <li>So I bought this hair dye about a week ago, it was suppose to arrive on Thursday the 4th of June, but, to my surprise it arrived two days sooner which just makes things all the more better.</li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li>so I can see what I&#x27;m doing better.</li>

            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>it looked cute for her age.</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure had plenty.</li>
            <li>I love adore colors</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely color but not the color I was looking for</li>
            <li>MANY COLORS TO CHOICE</li>
            <li>A friend recommended it to me and I&#x27;m glad she did.</li>
            <li>I love Adore.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair 1-2 times a week with a color safe shampoo.</li>
            <li>Bright, vibrant color that lasts for ever and does no damage whatsoever!</li>
            <li>I am extremely surprised and happy with this product.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the very best hair color available!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty pleased with this product!</li>
            <li>, So I was not expecting a bright vibrant color at all.</li>
            <li>On that note: it bleaches out quite easily.</li>
            <li>Great hair color doesnt wash out its pretty vibrant.</li>
            <li>Nice colour, but faded really fast.</li>
            <li>The price of the product is cheap because the product is far from being a good quality.</li>
            <li>Most pink dyes I am used to turn out very light and rinse out very easily.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s also super cheap.</li>
            <li>The Indigo Blue is absolutely GORGEOUS.</li>
            <li>It keep fading really quickly</li>
            <li>Id like it to be more vibrant but very well!!</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t actually used the Pink Rose yet, I&#x27;ve been loving my Purples!</li>
            <li>The color was super bright pink on the bleached parts of my hair.</li>
            <li>Awesome when mixed with conditioner for a cotton candy pink</li>
            <li>I have been adding fun color to my hair for about 5 years.</li>
            <li>The price per bottle can&#x27;t be beat, and as I don&#x27;t have to &amp;#34;freshen&amp;#34; up my fun colors</li>
            <li>First, let me start by saying that my daughter has colored her hair with many different brands of fun colors.</li>
            <li>True colors, high pigment</li>
            <li>I got the pink and it had a nice smell to it too.</li>
            <li>I ordered the rose pink one and it came in 2 days</li>
            <li>So be aware before you dye</li>
            <li>I bought #82 Pink Rose.</li>
            <li>The cost to ship it back was more than the prosuct itself.</li>
            <li>I always strip my hair first, then apply the ADORE via foil and leave it on for a minimum of 4 hours.</li>
            <li>Pink rose is more like a rich red to me and not pink at all.</li>
            <li>I purchased this based on all the positive reviews, but it did not work for me.</li>
            <li>Make sure your hair is dry and bleached.</li>
            <li>My hair is light brown and did not require any bleach and had enough to apply to all my hair twice &amp; test it out by doing just my ends at first.</li>
            <li>The color is very vibrant.</li>
            <li>I can easily say that I have dyed my hair every color possible.</li>
            <li>I use some dry shampoo on my hair more often than washing them, to keep the colors longer...</li>
            <li>This color is very vibrant and just what I had been looking for to change my look.</li>
            <li>I usually go back in and add a few more streaks on day 2 because it&#x27;s hard to get it perfectly even.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve washed my hair 4 times since applying it, and the color has really faded</li>
            <li>I recommend this item it works really well</li>
            <li>It took very well and has been washed once since we applied it</li>
            <li>Any store brand really...</li>
            <li>but it sure can stain some things so please be careful where and how you decide to dye your hair.</li>
            <li>I LIKE VERY MUCH,&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>This stuff is really something.</li>
            <li>hair is dark and I wasn&#x27;t sure it would take the color</li>
            <li>[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t see the bottom half of my hair, which is the most saturated.</li>
            <li>so i thought it would be an easy transition to dye my hair to pink.</li>
            <li>Vibrant color that lasts.</li>
            <li>Most of her hair was done this color with just a bit of the front done with the Indigo Blue of this same brand.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more of this brands colors in the future</li>
            <li>Using this process on my virgin, naturally dark blonde hair, I end up with super bright fuchsia streaks that fade into a much more subtle pink pretty evenly in about 1-3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>At this point, I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;As far as ease of application; this was much easier to apply than some products.</li>
            <li>and we normally go through 3 bottles</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve applied it 4 times so far on my hair, and if I&#x27;m lucky, it MIGHT last 2 washes.</li>
            <li>I only added a little bit of conditioner and my whole head turned out bright hot fuchsia, not exactly &amp;#34;pink rose&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural blonde, and figured I&#x27;d just add some of this as a fun highlight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so vivid.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve washed it about 6 times already, and it&#x27;s just as vivid.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend to anyone who wants to try!</li>
            <li>I dyed all my hair bright pink a few months ago with Splat!</li>
            <li>So far this has been my favorite as far as ease of application and my daughter&#x27;s due to the initial vibrancy of the colors.</li>
            <li>This gave my daughter a vibrant color which faded significantly after a few days and continues to fade.</li>
            <li>I mixed the Pink Rose with the Hot Pink (and maybe about a tablespoon of white</li>
            <li>This dye was very vibrant to begin with and it mixed very well with WHITE conditioner.</li>
            <li>i take into consideration that i already know red dye of any kind is hard to maintain)</li>
            <li>but it works really well on the blonde</li>
            <li>I ordered 6 bottles of this color as I cannot buy it at any store near me.</li>
            <li>It makes it far easier to apply than the pasty-textured dyes.</li>
            <li>This one was honestly, and by far, the worse one I ever had.</li>
            <li>Love this product a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>Also just a tip, before dyeing, make sure your hair is almost white or very pale blond.</li>
            <li>The dye also has a really sweet smell instead of the gross smell some other temporary ones may have.</li>
            <li>it was very vibrant up until about a month ago (which was about 2-3 solid months with pink hair), now my hair is mostly my original blonde and with a peachy hue and some faded pink.</li>
            <li>Anyway, no other hair dye was dying my hair anymore until I tried this one</li>
            <li>I colored my hair 6 months ago, and other than the new growth my 2 shades of purple are still vibrant purple, as always with ADORE.</li>
            <li>I had been dyeing my hair with a Revlon red, and it faded almost completely in 2 or 3 washes..</li>
            <li>On the other side is some Special Effects color, which I think is allegedly purple but never turns out that way.</li>
            <li>Very simple to apply, Very vibrant, long lasting color.</li>
            <li>Long lasting and vibrant color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a vibrant color and doesn&#x27;t stain clothes as much as other brands I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t really effect the black</li>

            <li> Love this product a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Also just a tip, before dyeing, make sure your hair is almost white or very pale blond.</li>
            <li> The dye also has a really sweet smell instead of the gross smell some other temporary ones may have.</li>
            <li> it was very vibrant up until about a month ago (which was about 2-3 solid months with pink hair), now my hair is mostly my original blonde and with a peachy hue and some faded pink.</li>
            <li> Anyway, no other hair dye was dying my hair anymore until I tried this one</li>
            <li> I colored my hair 6 months ago, and other than the new growth my 2 shades of purple are still vibrant purple, as always with ADORE.</li>
            <li> I had been dyeing my hair with a Revlon red, and it faded almost completely in 2 or 3 washes..</li>
            <li> On the other side is some Special Effects color, which I think is allegedly purple but never turns out that way.</li>
            <li> Very simple to apply, Very vibrant, long lasting color.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and vibrant color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a vibrant color and doesn&#x27;t stain clothes as much as other brands I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t really effect the black</li>
            <li> I have a few sections of hair which I bleached and had been dying pink with a cheap pink dye.</li>
            <li> And for normal colors like black, brown, blonde...</li>
            <li> If you wash your hair a little less than usual and use cool water to rinse, the color can probably stay vibrant for a month in between reapplications.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried following the package instructions (total fail, blah colour), and tips and hits left here from other users (better colour, but still only lasts for days).</li>
            <li> Anyways, I have dark brown hair and have been bleaching/coloring it for nearly 6 years now.</li>
            <li> I totally recommend this, although I have yet to see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> However I don&#x27;t know how long it will last (I just colored it today)</li>
            <li> The product works well, but it does not last long.</li>
            <li> I shampooed my hair this morning, dried it, put the dye in for about thirty minutes then washed my hair as normal.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really follow the instructions on the bottle, at least not totally.</li>
            <li> I recently decided I wanted to go back to pink</li>
            <li> And, the black is now leaving a tint of green with its fading (with the reflection on the light, one can see some green easily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Neither one of those brands would stick to my hair, the colors would just be dull and fade extremely fast.</li>
            <li> I currently am using Violet Gem and the dark Purple in different sections.</li>
            <li> I blowdry for 10-15 minutes (however long I can stand), then rinse it out without shampooing and condition my hair.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair but don&#x27;t condition it and let it dry</li>
            <li> So i dyed my hair the day after Christmas, and now its April 10, and my hair only has a little bit of pink left.</li>
            <li> but sense it is naturally dark, I am part Irish</li>
            <li> If you are a fan of colors like purple, pink, red, green, blue...</li>
            <li> She ended up with an Indigo Blue stripe coming down her forehead and into her eyebrow.</li>
            <li> Afterwards I wrapped my hair up in a towel to dry, it didn&#x27;t even stain the towel!</li>
            <li> Go ahead and apply on dry hair!</li>
            <li> I put it on my black hair and my blonde it</li>
            <li> i still have half a bottle left.</li>
            <li> as I&#x27;m not too fond of my daughter&#x27;s pink hair.</li>
            <li> Just be careful to watch for the dripping.</li>
            <li> oh so careful with the amount I used.</li>
            <li> the Color #80 Pink Fire,</li>
            <li> skip the part where you wet your hair before applying the dye.</li>
            <li> Other products I have used would fade out to a pink color after 4-6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Leave it in for 45 minutes and you&#x27;ll achieve an extremely saturated blue/purple.</li>
            <li> But I extremely recommend Adore hair dye.</li>
            <li> It saturates the hair quickly due to its consistency.</li>
            <li> I have been dying my hair every other months for 13 years now.</li>
            <li> I have dyed my hair with the Black and  </li>
            <li> She has very long, thick hair</li>
            <li> I wanted pale streaks of pink and got what I wanted!!</li>
            <li> I did get a little liberal with the application process.</li>
            <li> Its a little annoying because the ends and the roots are not pink, its just the middle (which is is a faded pink),</li>
            <li> I hardly use any product compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick, Brown and long, but I bleached it.</li>
            <li> and we&#x27;re usually stretching it then.</li>
            <li> Even the black!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hardly faded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it lasts at least 7 weeks.</li>
            <li> and as it fades, the color change looks intentional instead of sloppy and neglected.</li>
            <li> I previously have used Splat and Manic Panic, both of which I hate.</li>
            <li> Then, I apply random streaks using a baby toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My bad.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with ADORE.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it comes out when you wash it, so if you hate it-</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get as bright as I wanted</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the hype. I purchased this based on all the positive reviews, but it did not work for me. I&#x27;m a natural blonde, and figured I&#x27;d just add some of this as a fun highlight. However, the colour fades immediately. I applied it yesterday, and it&#x27;s already faded a lot by this morning, even though I have not washed my hair. I&#x27;ve applied it 4 times so far on my hair, and if I&#x27;m lucky, it MIGHT last 2 washes. I&#x27;ve tried following the package instructions (total fail, blah colour), and tips and hits left here from other users (better colour, but still only lasts for days).</li>
            <li> The Indigo Blue is absolutely GORGEOUS. Leave it in for 45 minutes and you&#x27;ll achieve an extremely saturated blue/purple. Stays saturated for about a week, then fades to turquoise eventually. I&#x27;d say it lasts at least 7 weeks. So cheap! Do it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a picture: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t see the bottom half of my hair, which is the most saturated. On the other side is some Special Effects color, which I think is allegedly purple but never turns out that way. Make sure your hair is dry and bleached.</li>
            <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt;My hair is dark and I wasn&#x27;t sure it would take the color but it did. I wanted pale streaks of pink and got what I wanted!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pleased with this product! My hair is light brown and did not require any bleach and had enough to apply to all my hair twice &amp; test it out by doing just my ends at first.</li>
            <li> When I saw the price and reviews for this, I couldn&#x27;t resist buying it! The color was super bright pink on the bleached parts of my hair. The dye also has a really sweet smell instead of the gross smell some other temporary ones may have. If you wash your hair a little less than usual and use cool water to rinse, the color can probably stay vibrant for a month in between reapplications.</li>
            <li> Awesome when mixed with conditioner for a cotton candy pink</li>
            <li> This gave my daughter a vibrant color which faded significantly after a few days and continues to fade. I&#x27;m pretty happy about that as I&#x27;m not too fond of my daughter&#x27;s pink hair.</li>
            <li> Platinum turned my hair blue...????</li>
            <li> Super bright and a great, cheaper alternative to Splat or Manic Panic. I got the pink and it had a nice smell to it too.</li>
            <li> So i dyed my hair the day after Christmas, and now its April 10, and my hair only has a little bit of pink left. it was very vibrant up until about a month ago (which was about 2-3 solid months with pink hair), now my hair is mostly my original blonde and with a peachy hue and some faded pink. Its a little annoying because the ends and the roots are not pink, its just the middle (which is is a faded pink), but it comes out when you wash it, so if you hate it- you can probably get it out. but I will probably by this again&lt;br /&gt;Also mine did not come with gloves,</li>
            <li> This dye was very vibrant to begin with and it mixed very well with WHITE conditioner. My desired colour was cotton candy and I achieved it. I love the way it turned out and my mum loves it too (I dyed it in support of her battling breast cancer)! I totally recommend this, although I have yet to see how long it lasts. Also just a tip, before dyeing, make sure your hair is almost white or very pale blond.</li>
            <li> So I bought this hair dye about a week ago, it was suppose to arrive on Thursday the 4th of June, but, to my surprise it arrived two days sooner which just makes things all the more better. Anyways, I have dark brown hair and have been bleaching/coloring it for nearly 6 years now. I recently decided I wanted to go back to pink so I bleached my hair, (but sense it is naturally dark, I am part Irish so I get red tones when I bleach and I have dye stacked on dye)it was like a orangey blonde, So I was not expecting a bright vibrant color at all. But I have never been so happy with my hair before in my life! The color just pops and looks amazing! I previously have used Splat and Manic Panic, both of which I hate. Neither one of those brands would stick to my hair, the colors would just be dull and fade extremely fast. But I extremely recommend Adore hair dye. I shampooed my hair this morning, dried it, put the dye in for about thirty minutes then washed my hair as normal. Afterwards I wrapped my hair up in a towel to dry, it didn&#x27;t even stain the towel! However I don&#x27;t know how long it will last (I just colored it today) but the results after coloring are outstanding! I am extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Vibrant color that lasts. Better quality color than my own hairstylist has.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve used this 5 times to put pink streaks in my hair, and there&#x27;s still a lot left in the bottle. I don&#x27;t really follow the instructions on the bottle, at least not totally. I wash my hair but don&#x27;t condition it and let it dry so I can see what I&#x27;m doing better. Then, I apply random streaks using a baby toothbrush. I blowdry for 10-15 minutes (however long I can stand), then rinse it out without shampooing and condition my hair. I usually go back in and add a few more streaks on day 2 because it&#x27;s hard to get it perfectly even. Using this process on my virgin, naturally dark blonde hair, I end up with super bright fuchsia streaks that fade into a much more subtle pink pretty evenly in about 1-3 weeks.  It smells pleasant and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair at all.</li>
            <li> The product works well, but it does not last long. I&#x27;ve washed my hair 4 times since applying it, and the color has really faded</li>
            <li> I ordered the rose pink one and it came in 2 days I put it on my black hair and my blonde it I left it in for 30 min and it didn&#x27;t really effect the black but it works really well on the blonde I recommend this item it works really well</li>
            <li> Love this product. The color is amazing..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a vibrant color and doesn&#x27;t stain clothes as much as other brands I&#x27;ve used and it&#x27;s also super cheap. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with this product. I had been dyeing my hair with a Revlon red, and it faded almost completely in 2 or 3 washes..(thought i take into consideration that i already know red dye of any kind is hard to maintain) so i thought it would be an easy transition to dye my hair to pink. I mixed the Pink Rose with the Hot Pink (and maybe about a tablespoon of white conditioner)..i LOVE it! It&#x27;s so vivid. I&#x27;ve washed it about 6 times already, and it&#x27;s just as vivid. I am extremely surprised and happy with this product. I can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive it is. The only thing I am wondering...is if this product is tested on animals or not..Does anyone know??</li>
            <li> Love this produ√ßt. So easy to use and great color</li>
            <li> First off, let me say, this dye works wonderfully. Color payoff is excellent. Very bright, vivid, does not rinse out. My problem: I was not expecting that. Most pink dyes I am used to turn out very light and rinse out very easily. So be aware before you dye: this is not of that nature. I only added a little bit of conditioner and my whole head turned out bright hot fuchsia, not exactly &amp;#34;pink rose&amp;#34;. On that note: it bleaches out quite easily.</li>
            <li> this is great. my hair was already bleached with color that was fading. this gave it an extra tone of color to it. love it. my daughter got highlights of this too and it wasnt too bright. it looked cute for her age. i still have half a bottle left. will be buying again. maybe BLUE!</li>
            <li> Great hair color doesnt wash out its pretty vibrant. Id like it to be more vibrant but very well!! I will order again</li>
            <li> So saturated! Mixed with conditioner and it has lasted multiple dyes.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the very best hair color available! No staining of your skin, clothes, or tub. No smell, and your hair feels like it had a deep conditioning treatment after using it. Long lasting and vibrant color. Will not ever use anything else!</li>
            <li> First, let me start by saying that my daughter has colored her hair with many different brands of fun colors. She has very long, thick hair and we normally go through 3 bottles and we&#x27;re usually stretching it then. I ordered 6 bottles of this color as I cannot buy it at any store near me. I wanted to make sure had plenty. We went through two bottles and just a drop of a third. Most of her hair was done this color with just a bit of the front done with the Indigo Blue of this same brand. The color is very vibrant. I had bleach-bathed her hair prior to applying this color as she had done her hair red before this. The directions, I believe, say to leave it on 15 minutes. She left it in for 3 hours. It took very well and has been washed once since we applied it so I cannot, at this time, attest to how well it will hold up to washing. She only washes her hair about every 4th day to preserve the color. At this point, I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;As far as ease of application; this was much easier to apply than some products. The liquid is thinner than some colors I&#x27;ve applied to her hair. It makes it far easier to apply than the pasty-textured dyes. Just be careful to watch for the dripping. She ended up with an Indigo Blue stripe coming down her forehead and into her eyebrow. My bad. I did get a little liberal with the application process. I just didn&#x27;t feel like I needed to be oh so careful with the amount I used. It saturates the hair quickly due to its consistency. So far this has been my favorite as far as ease of application and my daughter&#x27;s due to the initial vibrancy of the colors. (The blue is the Indigo Blue of the same brand)</li>
            <li> Bright, vibrant color that lasts for ever and does no damage whatsoever! Perfect product. True colors, high pigment and as it fades, the color change looks intentional instead of sloppy and neglected. This is the best candy color dye on the market, and I have tried them all!</li>
            <li> Nice colour, but faded really fast.</li>
            <li> Very simple to apply, Very vibrant, long lasting color. I will definitely buy more of this brands colors in the future</li>
            <li> Super effective and very bright! Low fade and I would reccommend leaving on hair for longer than stated!</li>
            <li> I have been dying my hair every other months for 13 years now. I have been a \\&quot;tester\\&quot; for hair dressers for different brands and I have been testing and trying different brand and colors myself. I can easily say that I have dyed my hair every color possible. Now... This one was honestly, and by far, the worse one I ever had. I have dyed my hair with the Black and  the Color #80 Pink Fire, After NEARLY just a week, the pink is almost already all gone. I use some dry shampoo on my hair more often than washing them, to keep the colors longer... But after just 2 wash, BOTH colors are fading away, almost gone. Yes... Even the black!! And, the black is now leaving a tint of green with its fading (with the reflection on the light, one can see some green easily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, one gets what one pays for. The price of the product is cheap because the product is far from being a good quality. I dyed all my hair bright pink a few months ago with Splat! and it lasted over 2 months, and this one is almost all gone after a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally do not recommend this product unless you do not want to have a color longer than a week or so. If you are a fan of colors like purple, pink, red, green, blue... I would, in that case, recommend Splat!... And for normal colors like black, brown, blonde... Any store brand really... Even the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; colors from this product does not last. Save your couple of dolors and spend it on a product that is a tad bit more expensive... You&#x27;ll get a MUCH better result, without any doubt!!</li>
            <li> This color is very vibrant and just what I had been looking for to change my look. I get so many compliments now that I have put these color panels in my hair!</li>
            <li> I love adore colors but it sure can stain some things so please be careful where and how you decide to dye your hair. Pink rose is more like a rich red to me and not pink at all. It&#x27;s a lovely color but not the color I was looking for but hey I will rock it anyway. Definitely recommend to anyone who wants to try!</li>
            <li> I LIKE VERY MUCH,&lt;br /&gt;VERY GOOD PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;100% SATISFIED&lt;br /&gt;EASY TO USE&lt;br /&gt;AND MANY COLORS TO CHOICE&lt;br /&gt;BRITE COLORS  I RECOMMENDED 100%</li>
            <li> I bought #82 Pink Rose. It&#x27;s by far one of the best hair dyes I&#x27;ve tried. Maniac Panic doesn&#x27;t even work this well. My hair is very thick, Brown and long, but I bleached it. Anyway, no other hair dye was dying my hair anymore until I tried this one and it left no yellow spots. I dyed it about a month ago and it&#x27;s hardly faded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s. skip the part where you wet your hair before applying the dye. Go ahead and apply on dry hair!</li>
            <li> I did not care for this product as it almost immediately washed out of my hair. When I contacted customer service about returning it I was advised that I had to pay to ship it back to receive a refund. The cost to ship it back was more than the prosuct itself. Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really something. A friend recommended it to me and I&#x27;m glad she did. I have a few sections of hair which I bleached and had been dying pink with a cheap pink dye. It keep fading really quickly so I finally ordered this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left it on for about an hour. I&#x27;m used to just wandering around my house with dye in my hair... When I washed it out, I was very impressed. It was SO pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve washed my hair probably 6 times since dying it and it still looks amazing. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s faded at all. I&#x27;m really, really impressed!</li>
            <li> I love Adore. It&#x27;s the only brand that I&#x27;ll use on my hair, and I can&#x27;t talk highly enough about it.</li>
            <li> I have been adding fun color to my hair for about 5 years. The ADORE colors are the absolute best! I currently am using Violet Gem and the dark Purple in different sections. I always strip my hair first, then apply the ADORE via foil and leave it on for a minimum of 4 hours. I rinse it out until there is no longer any color tinting the rinse water. Bonus-this doesn&#x27;t stain your shower! I colored my hair 6 months ago, and other than the new growth my 2 shades of purple are still vibrant purple, as always with ADORE. Other products I have used would fade out to a pink color after 4-6 weeks. Not ADORE- for me the purples stay purple. I wash my hair 1-2 times a week with a color safe shampoo. I have been using ADORE for almost 2 years now. The price per bottle can&#x27;t be beat, and as I don&#x27;t have to &amp;#34;freshen&amp;#34; up my fun colors I hardly use any product compared to other brands. You will not be disappointed with ADORE.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t actually used the Pink Rose yet, I&#x27;ve been loving my Purples!</li>
            <li> Love this product a little goes a long way</li>
