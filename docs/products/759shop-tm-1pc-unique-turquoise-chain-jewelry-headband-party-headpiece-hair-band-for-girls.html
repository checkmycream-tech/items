            <li> The smaller chains hang down way too far to be wearable.</li>
            <li> It came in less than two weeks, early than expected.</li>
            <li> When I first got it I was confused about how to put it on, but it&#x27;s  a lot simpler than it looks (connect both ends of the jewelry and lay it over your head).</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected nor wanted at all...</li>
            <li> actually wore it to church and received quite a few compliments.</li>
            <li> My theme colors for my belly dance video is black, purple and gold...</li>
            <li> To saggy on your head, don&#x27;t hold tight.</li>
            <li> For small heads and not very friendly with curly hair</li>
            <li> but we were not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> My 11 yr old was realy disappointed with this item.</li>
            <li> wouldnt beat it up too hard though!</li>
            <li> It was broken when i got it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy.</li>
            <li> but i was really confused how to put it on</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> Looks kinda awkward.</li>

            <li> Really cute, and came way before the seller said it would, can&#x27;t wait to wear it, it was the perfect fit for head, and the price is great!!! I LOVE the color of the stones!!!! And it doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all!!!</li>
            <li> I love this so much! It is so cute! Looks exactly like picture</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember ordering this turquoise head chain... I remember ordering all gold head chains and then I get this after about 3- 4 weeks... Its small as heck, will only fit a child&#x27;s head. I&#x27;m not happy. Wasn&#x27;t what I expected nor wanted at all... My theme colors for my belly dance video is black, purple and gold... Not turquoise.... .</li>
            <li> Very nice brought it a few months ago very good quality hasn&#x27;t fallen apart I get compliments everywhere I go I have a huge head and it fits perfect it can be adjusted as well</li>
            <li> Love Love Love!!!! Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Very cool and on point!&lt;br /&gt;I actually wore it to church and received quite a few compliments.</li>
            <li> I love this piece, very cute.</li>
            <li> I love it my only issue is the it&#x27;s too short Around the head</li>
            <li> I recieved this really fast but i was really confused how to put it on</li>
            <li> Cute and love it. Good buy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have real thick hair. Good price but fits just a bit snug. It is adjustable on the chain.</li>
