            <li>I did get some results ,but not the ones I wanted I should order more of it to make the results look how I wanted them to</li>

            <li>Seems like more in the tube than another brand ounce for ounce.</li>

            <li>Very mild.</li>
            <li>Ultra moisturizing, great size, good packaging, bad quantity for the price paid, a very good convenient size for travel or home.</li>

            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t worth it at all</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is right...</li>
            <li>Great for evening out dark spots!!</li>
            <li>since then, I have been getting great deals on eBay (usually 2 tubes for around $30).</li>

            <li>;)</li>
            <li>On top of that, I found out that the seller discounts shipping on multiple tubes</li>
            <li>/&gt;What&#x27;s funny about this</li>
            <li>I will say that the product must be used for many weeks, but the results are definite.  </li>

            <li>Much smaller than expected but great product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very dissapointed</li>
            <li>This lotion really works.</li>
            <li>I did have to wait 3 or 4 weeks before I saw real results</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much improvement there will be</li>
            <li>I RECIEVED MY ORDER  FAST</li>
            <li>AND IT REALLY DOES WORK FOR CORRECTING DARK SPOTS I WOULD LIKE TO GET SOME  MORE.</li>

            <li>the MAIN THING I was told by the clinician at Macy&#x27;s was this product DOES NOT WORK for persons whose dark circles are hereditary so perhaps this is why some of you are dissatisfied.</li>

            <li> Product too small - looked like part of a gift with purchase instead of real sale product.  </li>
            <li> is all of the reviews about how much of a ripoff this is for such a small tube and not marked for resale...</li>
            <li> Too small quantity to use for a long period of time to ascertain if the product really works or not.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was dried out or old because it was a brown</li>
            <li> As long as it&#x27;s not used, i consider it a deal!</li>
            <li> dab on MORNING AND NIGHT, let dry, put on your face cream and makeup.</li>
            <li> Weight is subjective, I had one that was half the weight, and had only a tiny bit in the tube much less than this one.</li>
            <li> the little bottle is smaller than my pinky</li>
            <li> I have noticed a definite lightening with the dark spots (sun damage!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update the review on after my wife tries the stuff.</li>
            <li> I went through an entire sample tube on one small spot on my face.</li>
            <li> just went to Sephora the other day to grab a 1oz bottle of this stuff with my wife.</li>
            <li> The dark area had been caused by hormones during pregnancy, it stuck around afterwards and didn&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li> Not worth what I paid.</li>
            <li> it would lighten the dark spots</li>
            <li> THE PRICE WAZ NOT WORTH WUT I PAID</li>
            <li> After a month and a half of using the product, I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference in the color of that spot at all.</li>
            <li> I use this product once a day at night ,everyday and am still struggling with dark spots.</li>
            <li> I see a difference in the few dark spots that I have.</li>
            <li> Yesterday i put some on my face and a little under my eyes</li>
            <li> To my surprise i found this little .24oz bottle for around $10 each after shipping.</li>
            <li> this little tube didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> I have had very dark red/purple acne scars for a few years now and have tried just about everything.</li>
            <li> I feel like it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money honesty</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Very disappointed my product had a small hole at the top product was all over .</li>
            <li> This is not a miracle product and takes at least a few weeks of use to notice any small difference.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll just have to keep looking...</li>
            <li> I purchased this product over 3 months ago and am sad to say that my dark spots have not diminished at all.</li>
            <li> WAZ VERY VERY SMALL</li>
            <li> It is a VERY VERY SMALL tube and it LOOKS  like a sample.  </li>
            <li> One use... not good customer relations to do this.</li>
            <li> I am 60 yrs old and hated, when about 5 yrs ago, those ugly black, puffy rings started showing up.</li>
            <li> so we bought just shy of 1oz for $33 vs $50</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about the product.  </li>
            <li> Save you money :(</li>
            <li> I always felt sorry for my friend&#x27;s sister because her&#x27;s are awful and add yrs to her face</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it.</li>
            <li> I hate that they sold me a trial size for $10</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So this came with a free gift which im happy about and i also love this brand but i just got it so i dont know how well it will work. Yesterday i put some on my face and a little under my eyes but now i have super puffy and swollen bags. Hopefully i can avoid the reaction by next time putting it on away from my eyes</li>
            <li> This product really work!!! Noticed a difference within two weeks of use. The size of the tube was the only issue.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed my product had a small hole at the top product was all over . I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was dried out or old because it was a brown /tan color</li>
            <li> Too small quantity to use for a long period of time to ascertain if the product really works or not.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work on my spot</li>
            <li> I should have reviewed the size amount a bit better. The package was so tiny for $10 charge. Review size.</li>
            <li> I went through an entire sample tube on one small spot on my face. The dark area had been caused by hormones during pregnancy, it stuck around afterwards and didn&#x27;t fade. After a month and a half of using the product, I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference in the color of that spot at all. I wound up buying a rapid results retinol cream from Neutrogena that worked much better. Faded the spot enough to hide it with make up.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I opened the package was the tiny size. Not worth what I paid. Second, I saw on the back \\&quot;Not for sale\\&quot; - which means this is a free sample someone got at Macys and they just pocketed my $10. I&#x27;m very dissapointed and I hope the karma police catch up to these people soon...</li>
            <li> Not too impressed with the results. I found another item I bought from my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Great for evening out dark spots!!</li>
            <li> I have had very dark red/purple acne scars for a few years now and have tried just about everything. This has faded the scars slightly, but really hasn&#x27;t done much. This is not a miracle product and takes at least a few weeks of use to notice any small difference.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll just have to keep looking...</li>
            <li> Actually I tried both I bought and it didn&#x27;t work. Clinique is a great product, I love the company and have bought many things from them, this was 50/50 it would lighten the dark spots</li>
            <li> *** We haven&#x27;t used this product yet, But I just wanted to throw my .02 In on this based on the reviews. I&#x27;ll update the review on after my wife tries the stuff. ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just went to Sephora the other day to grab a 1oz bottle of this stuff with my wife. I was baffled that women pay $50+tax for a 1oz jar of face cream! ;) ;) I couldn&#x27;t let her buy it especially after checking on Amazon for the stuff. To my surprise i found this little .24oz bottle for around $10 each after shipping. I figured, let&#x27;s just buy 4 of them to get the 1oz and we&#x27;ll only pay $40 and save some $$$! On top of that, I found out that the seller discounts shipping on multiple tubes so we bought just shy of 1oz for $33 vs $50+. Sounds like a deal to me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s funny about this is all of the reviews about how much of a ripoff this is for such a small tube and not marked for resale...I think people are failing to do the math here and realize that it is, in fact, cheaper to get the smaller tubes. And who really cares if it isn&#x27;t marked for resale. As long as it&#x27;s not used, i consider it a deal!</li>
            <li> Ultra moisturizing, great size, good packaging, bad quantity for the price paid, a very good convenient size for travel or home.</li>
            <li> I did get some results ,but not the ones I wanted I should order more of it to make the results look how I wanted them to</li>
            <li> Product too small - looked like part of a gift with purchase instead of real sale product.  Will not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> seems to be working ok, have been using it for about 2 months, is lightening brown spots, no miracle, but they are getting better. Better than another more expensive brand. Seems like more in the tube than another brand ounce for ounce. Weight is subjective, I had one that was half the weight, and had only a tiny bit in the tube much less than this one.</li>
            <li> In fairness, I haven&#x27;t used it consistently enough to rate this fairly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try to respond at a later date.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Excelente 100% recomendable&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have the original bottle, and wanted to buy a travel size for vacation instead of carrying the whole thing with me, so this is perfect!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product over 3 months ago and am sad to say that my dark spots have not diminished at all. They are still prevelent and I am covering them with makeup on a daily basis. I use this product once a day at night ,everyday and am still struggling with dark spots. I am a huge fan of clinique products and really had my hopes up for this one, but am dissapointed to say that this product has not worked for me.</li>
            <li> I feel like it was a waste of money the little bottle is smaller than my pinky and I have used all of it and see no progress nor change. Waste of time and money honesty</li>
            <li> This lotion really works. I see a difference in the few dark spots that I have. I love this product!</li>
            <li> It clearly says not for sale!!!! Its a sample size not any bigger than my pinky...such a waist!!!!!DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product works!  I have noticed a definite lightening with the dark spots (sun damage!) on my face.  I will say that the product must be used for many weeks, but the results are definite.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very mild. Excellent for sensitive skin. Gradual fade. Brightens and eases wrinkles for a smooth look. Not harsh as some others.</li>
            <li> IT WAZ NOT WUT I THOUGHT IT WAZ GOIN 2 B IT WAZ VERY VERY SMALL THE PRICE WAZ NOT WORTH WUT I PAID</li>
            <li> Much smaller than expected but great product</li>
            <li> did nothing for me...  Save you money :(</li>
            <li> Have been using this product 2 times a day for 2 weeks. No visible difference. would not buy this product again</li>
            <li> This is a fare and unbiased review in my opinion. Clinique states the spots will be corrected but they are not unfortunately.. After several weeks of usage, I dont see any improvement in these blemishes on the face , hands and arms.</li>
            <li> Will work good if you  use it continually.  I haven&#x27;t used it like I should, but I plan to do so.</li>
            <li> I received a box that said &amp;#34;NOT FOR SALE&amp;#34; sample only.. on it.. and it was SOLD TO ME.. I don&#x27;t think this is right... It is a VERY VERY SMALL tube and it LOOKS  like a sample.  One use... not good customer relations to do this.</li>
            <li> I tried this product, and I even bought 2 bottles.used it for 2 months and NOTHING. I give it 2 stars because both times I have ordered,it came so very fast in the mail. This product is not for me.</li>
            <li> this product is smaller than my thumb. it also states on the packaging &amp;#34; product not for sale&amp;#34;..... this is the trial sizes you can get from any clinique store to try before buying for free. This is a waste of money. do not buy this product. go to the store and ask for a free sample.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year, I am finishing my 4th tube. I bought the first one at Macy&#x27;s for around $45. since then, I have been getting great deals on eBay (usually 2 tubes for around $30). the MAIN THING I was told by the clinician at Macy&#x27;s was this product DOES NOT WORK for persons whose dark circles are hereditary so perhaps this is why some of you are dissatisfied. I am one of the lucky ones. mine is not hereditary and I am so happy to find something that really does what it is intended to do. I did have to wait 3 or 4 weeks before I saw real results and I am delighted that I was patient and didn&#x27;t give up. I am 60 yrs old and hated, when about 5 yrs ago, those ugly black, puffy rings started showing up. I always felt sorry for my friend&#x27;s sister because her&#x27;s are awful and add yrs to her face and then it happened to me! dab on MORNING AND NIGHT, let dry, put on your face cream and makeup. Love it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it. I hate that they sold me a trial size for $10 and it is clearly marked NOT FOR RESALE! How can they do that??</li>
            <li> Like others I paid for this.  It does seem to work on \\&quot;liver spots\\&quot;.  However, the tube clearly states this is a sample size and not for sale.</li>
            <li> It is a sample tube that they sent that is labed &amp;#34;not for sale.&amp;#34;  The tube also refers to &amp;#34;see enclosure&amp;#34; and there was none.&lt;br /&gt;I have not used it yet, so cannot comment on the product itself.</li>
            <li> my daughter swears by this product and loves it.  I do notice some difference in the color spots on her face.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks and I am beginning to see a difference.  I don&#x27;t know how much improvement there will be but it is definitely working.</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about the product.  My only problem is that I was sold a sample size item that clearly says not for resale.  What???  Is this a scam or what?</li>
            <li> I RECIEVED MY ORDER  FAST AND IT REALLY DOES WORK FOR CORRECTING DARK SPOTS I WOULD LIKE TO GET SOME  MORE.</li>
            <li> takes about a week of continuous use to see results. it is the travel size which it does state in the description however when you look at the price of the larger version and the amount of the smaller ones, it would be cheaper to buy several of the smaller ones than to buy one larger container</li>
            <li> It works! Started to see results in a week!</li>
            <li> this little tube didn&#x27;t work at all. this is a one time use only and it wasn&#x27;t worth it at all</li>
