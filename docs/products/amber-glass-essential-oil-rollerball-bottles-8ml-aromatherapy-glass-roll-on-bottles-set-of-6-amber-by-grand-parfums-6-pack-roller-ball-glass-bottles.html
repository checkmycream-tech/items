            <li> I love these roll on bottles, I use them for my essential oils. These are good for everyday use.</li>
            <li> These bottles are a perfect size for mixing essential and carrier oils for daily use. The tops are easy to pull on and off to refill, the glass is good quality and the cap twists tightly so there is no leakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for the three star review... the plastic rollerball does not roll well. It gets stuck so when I try to apply it a little comes out and then the rollerball stops moving so I have to take my finger and push the ball so it moves again and then a moment later it will get stuck. It is very frustrating. I contacted Grand Parfums II and they responded quickly but said they wouldn&#x27;t let me exchange or return the bottles for a refund. Instead they suggested I try putting my finger nail beneath the ball to help it unstick or I could buy the metal rollerball bottles which they admitted work better. So I guess I will have to spend more money to make these work. I suggest buying their metal rollerball bottles instead and avoid some headaches.</li>
            <li> The Roller Ball Bottles, were perfect for trying a new essential oil blend. Plus the Rollers actually work.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet but they are what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Nice product but beware. ..the roller sometimes flies off during use, which makes a mess.</li>
            <li> Seemed nice at first until I tried to put one of the rollerball pieces in the glass and the glass broke, therefore cutting my hand. Not easy to put rollerball in, but unsure if this is common for all rollerballs.</li>
            <li> quick delivery. however the filler tube was bent beyond use.</li>
            <li> quick shipment.product exactly as expected!</li>
            <li> Sealed easily when when I soaked in hot water as instructions suggested. I also added a bit of oil to outside of rim. No leaking so far. Wonderful product. Great seller. Good packaging, no issues.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery and great product. Thanks!</li>
            <li> as described; perfect</li>

            <li> Perfect little bottles for my essential oil blends</li>
            <li> Works well. Great Customer service.</li>
            <li> I have started using essential oils and the bottles from the company were expensive.  So I looked on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;and saw the same bottles at a much more affordable price.  They are nice, just hard to get the roller ball into the top&lt;br /&gt;of the bottle.  I mean extremely hard.  I contacted the supplier and they got back to me fast. They told me just to use&lt;br /&gt;a lot pf muscle. It worked with a lot of muscle from my son.  I have not taken them out to refill yet, but was told to use a butter&lt;br /&gt;knife.  I expect, that will be hard to. Does work though, great putting mu oils on.</li>
