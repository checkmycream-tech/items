            <li>How I love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>I was concerned because I know that although it smelled awesome on her - that our chemistry was different.  </li>
            <li>and I love wearing it.  </li>
            <li>definitively recommend it :)</li>
            <li>and I receive many compliments on it when I wear it.  </li>
            <li>sophisticated and sexy without trying, and still a bit sweet.</li>
            <li>It has a slightly sweet, fruity smell like a spring day but as it wears on a tantalizing clean sophisticated aroma that I could imagine someone like Marilyn Monroe or Audrey Hepburn wearing.  </li>
            <li>It smells sweet at first but then evolves into an elegant sophisticated scent.</li>
            <li>Its a wonderful scent all year round.  </li>

            <li>Just be sure to get the actual Parfum not eau de Parfum which seems to smell a bit off and wears off quickly.</li>
            <li>but you cant find it in most larger dept. stores....</li>
            <li>I have such a hard time finding a perfume that I like - this one is really wonderful</li>
            <li>Works very well with my chemistry.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the scent, but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little sweet and woodsy at the same time.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a little sweet and woodsy at the same time.</li>
            <li> It smells soft and delicate and a little bit sweet.  </li>
            <li> this perfume reminds me of something from my childhood, maybe someone wore it, but it makes me think of white summer dresses and long drives in convertibles.</li>
            <li> If you like the Hanae Mori Pink Butterfly you may like the Hanae Mori also , the scent of the parfums is quite similar , the wife loves them both ....</li>
            <li> But again, be careful what your purchasing.</li>
            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t mean to purchase this item.</li>
            <li> Little did I know the title was incorrect, but the image matched this one.</li>
            <li> She discovered it some months ago and now she likes to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> at least that&#x27;s what the description was stating.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells identical to the parfum I used to purchase from expensive dept store.</li>
            <li> U can&#x27;t go wrong with this perfume.</li>

            <li> This is my favorite perfume. It&#x27;s a little sweet and woodsy at the same time. I get so many compliments on it. Just be sure to get the actual Parfum not eau de Parfum which seems to smell a bit off and wears off quickly.</li>
            <li> How I love this perfume.  It smells soft and delicate and a little bit sweet.  Its a wonderful scent all year round.  U can&#x27;t go wrong with this perfume.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing fragrance. I am constantly getting compliments. I will always wear it.</li>
            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t mean to purchase this item. I THOUGHT I was purchasing Hanae Mori No4 at least that&#x27;s what the description was stating. Little did I know the title was incorrect, but the image matched this one. I attempted to return it since it wasn&#x27;t the one I paid for. The seller made excuses, a lot of excuses. In the end, because I didn&#x27;t see that the image was for this item and no Hanae Mori I couldn&#x27;t return it. Thank god I love this perfume. But again, be careful what your purchasing.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite!  Plus, I get lots of positive comments from people about the pleasing fragrance!</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments!</li>
            <li> I have worn this scent for years!! Always receiving compliments from men and women...it is the best if you like a more woodsy scent...if you like musk..etc..try this!!! Floral stay away. Cant say enough about Hanae Mori....but you cant find it in most larger dept. stores....so order here....your welcome :)</li>
            <li> My sister initially had me try this.  I was concerned because I know that although it smelled awesome on her - that our chemistry was different.  But it also smells wonderful on me.  It has a slightly sweet, fruity smell like a spring day but as it wears on a tantalizing clean sophisticated aroma that I could imagine someone like Marilyn Monroe or Audrey Hepburn wearing.  I am now on my 5th bottle and the complements never cease.</li>
            <li> Wife loved it:  Excellent product,&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Love the scent, but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> this perfume reminds me of something from my childhood, maybe someone wore it, but it makes me think of white summer dresses and long drives in convertibles. it makes me feel like how I always imagined a woman in her mid 20&#x27;s would be like as I grew up. sophisticated and sexy without trying, and still a bit sweet.</li>
            <li> I have such a hard time finding a perfume that I like - this one is really wonderful and I love wearing it.  Also I would buy it again from this seller.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a present to my daughter - she loves it!</li>
            <li> My Girlfriend is really happy with this perfume... She discovered it some months ago and now she likes to use it everyday. It&#x27;s a nice gift for a girl. It&#x27;s a sweet and youthful perfume...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitively recommend it :)</li>
            <li> Hanae Mori parfum will not work against your body chemistry. Amazon has the best price I can find for this parfum. And while you&#x27;re out and about,someone will stop to ask what is the smell of that perfume you&#x27;re wearing.</li>
            <li> Have really enjoyed this perfume - has a wonderful refreshing scent and I receive many compliments on it when I wear it.  Would not hesitate to recommend it to any of my friends.</li>
            <li> If you like the Hanae Mori Pink Butterfly you may like the Hanae Mori also , the scent of the parfums is quite similar , the wife loves them both ....</li>
            <li> the best fragrance ever</li>
            <li> I like but it doesn&#x27;t have the potency I remember.</li>
