            <li> I&#x27;ll give it one star because it has batman on it and my son loves that.  However I should have read the other reviews.  I can&#x27;t believe I had to put the battery in this thing first of all (most kids electric toothbrushes already have it in).  Plus it only works (vibrates- does Not spin) on occasion, if I shake it the right way.  So my son basically uses it as a regular toothbrush, because this was really the only batman toothbrush I could find on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 5 yr. old grand-son and he loves it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandson who is a batman fanatic. Cool looking toothbrush if your into Batman..more importantly is that he loves it. Probably paid too much as now I see them in stores but I had to have it at that time</li>
            <li> I didnt include the battery, and the battery is not easy to find.</li>
            <li> Cheap quality - brushes wore down after a week, battery power turns on and off randomly, poor quality overall on this product.</li>
            <li> not so fast or strong which i liked for my little boy.. it just made him excited to brush his teeth unlike usually.. I gave him this as a gift for the new school year with a batman bath set.. he loved all of them!</li>
            <li> I bought two of these for both my boys and they fell apart easily. Top part of the brush disconnects from the body while brushing. Spend the extra couple of bucks on a spin-brush.</li>
            <li> My 5 yr old was very excited to get a batman toothbrush, but then became very frustrated because he couldn&#x27;t turn it on/off himself.  The switch is on the bottom and is very difficult to move.  Plus, he didn&#x27;t like that it didn&#x27;t spin, just vibrates, which is what I have always bought and is recommended by our dentist.  We ended up throwing it away after a couple days.</li>
            <li> Gently used, replaced battery-Still didn&#x27;t wprk.  Oh well:) Should have paid more attention to reviews before I purchased. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> Handle just vibrates, not the brush. Marvel got the good HERO brushes. my Batman fan in the house cant get a good Batman toothbrush anywhere so had to get Wolverene.</li>
            <li> We have other superhero toothbrushes. We bought this one because are son wanted a Batman toothbrush. I&#x27;m really sorry that I bought this toothbrush, it is really cheaply made and the bristles do not move the only thing that vibrates is the handel.</li>
            <li> Broke the first time i used it actually the first time i bought turned it on. it is cheaply made i went to walmart bought a different one and it works great. dont waste your money</li>
            <li> first off, can&#x27;t open up the battery compartment no matter how hard I try. Husband also tried to no avail. Going in the garbage, especially since I realized the head doesn&#x27;t even spin, just a vibrating handle. Waste of money</li>
            <li> My granddaughter Bella just loves her Batman toothbrush and actually spends more time brushing her teeth.  Good product to get her motivated.  Product receivced in good condition and in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> this product didn&#x27;t last - the return window is so small I can&#x27;t return it but I can recommend buying a FIREFLY brand instead, we got one of those after this broke and it has lasted so much longer.</li>
            <li> I ordered a batman toothbrush and got an angry bird one... My 5 year old opened it the cried because it was wrong...</li>
            <li> Other than the novelty of being a Batman toothbrush, this is not an especially good toothbrush.  As several other reviews stated, it does not have a spinning brush.  Basically just a regular toothbrush that vibrates.  I didn&#x27;t have any issues with the battery compartment.  The bristles wore out very quickly.  More of a novelty item than anything.</li>
