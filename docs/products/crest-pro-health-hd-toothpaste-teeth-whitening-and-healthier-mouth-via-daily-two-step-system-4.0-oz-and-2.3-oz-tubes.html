            <li>and I&#x27;m so happy that I did!</li>

            <li>Best of all, no plastic beads!</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is AMAZING!!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Either way I&#x27;m very happy with the product, and the whitening part may be a &amp;#34;your</li>
            <li>The best thing about it is that it forces me to brush my teeth for 2 minutes, because you use each tube for a minute.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect alternative for me than to go get my teeth whitened at the dentist office.</li>
            <li>this is perfect for that.  </li>
            <li>In fact it is no issue at all; Incredibly convenient!</li>
            <li>My teeth were incredibly shiny - like beauty queen with Vaseline on her teeth shiny!  </li>
            <li>If you can get over that, then this is probably the best toothpaste I’ve used.</li>
            <li>this is literally the best toothpaste ever.</li>
            <li>Both of these products (fluoride anti-plaque toothpaste and whitening gel) have a wonderful, &amp;#34;peppy&amp;#34; taste and the whitening is awesome!!nO would recommend these products to anyone wanting whiter, protected teeth!!</li>
            <li>This product is great!</li>
            <li>Excellent job Crest I will continue to use this</li>
            <li>If they could could combine this into one paste or have the gel and the paste come out side by side a la Mentadent toothpaste that would be delightful.</li>
            <li>I think it works great!</li>
            <li>I was given this to try as a BzzAgent and have been really impressed with the results.</li>

            <li>awesome.  </li>
            <li>After using the Crest Pro Health HD I was very impressed with how it managed to whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li>This would be perfect for someone maintaining a whitening.</li>
            <li>I received the product as part of a promotion from Crest, and was very happy to try it out.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste (Step 1) cleans my teeth the best of any toothpaste I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The taste is a great too!</li>
            <li>Great job!</li>

            <li>And I have to say I am impressed.</li>
            <li>so this product is perfect for me!</li>
            <li>And, I also have done the crest whitening strips, which worked wonderful but at what point in my day do I have time to put strips on my teeth and let them sit for an extended period of time?</li>
            <li>And I have to say, it is amazing!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is really a great product, and it will be a staple in our oral care routine for years to come!</li>
            <li>Not so perfect, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>With that said, I think the Crest Pro Health HD would be an excellent product if you are looking to &amp;</li>

            <li>I was impressed.  </li>
            <li>My dentist was impressed by the change in my tooth color.  </li>
            <li>Once you get over the expectation that this should be a minty toothpaste and try it for a week or so, you will be impressed with the results!  </li>
            <li>Very great toothpaste.</li>
            <li>But still the results are impressive!</li>

            <li>I was really impressed and did not have the sensitivity issues I have had with the whitening strips.  </li>
            <li>I was immediately impressed with the two-step system.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say they are getting any whiter, but they feel awesome!</li>

            <li>This is perfect because it is just like brushing my teeth twice in a row.</li>
            <li>Just great!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been brushing with this system (made up of a paste and a gel that you brush with for one minute each) for about two weeks and have been surprisingly happy with the results!  </li>
            <li>impressed with the cleaner feel.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, I was very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>We are both impressed with the difference we&#x27;ve noticed in our smiles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use the paste and gel two times a day and have seen some great improvement in the color of my teeth!</li>
            <li>Great way to change up your routine and start feeling the difference in the health of your teeth!  </li>
            <li>In reality, I wasn&#x27;t as impressed with this product as I thought I would be.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Crest HD for a couple weeks now, and I am beyond impressed with the difference it has made with my teeth.</li>
            <li>Best price you can find for this product is here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>all of that being perfect</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with this product.</li>

            <li>I have been using Crest Pro Health HD for over a week now and am very impressed with the results!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, the flavor is not all that great!</li>
            <li>Suffice it to say I&#x27;ve been very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>This is the best toothpaste I have EVER used!</li>
            <li>It was a great touch up for my teeth for spring!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li>My teeth literally felt like perfectly buffed pearls in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Whatever the case, I can&#x27;t recommend this whitening toothpaste for its whitening properties - though it still does an impressive job of cleaning teeth.</li>

            <li>Crest Pro Health HD is awesome.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m so impressed with the results I have had.</li>
            <li>Not the best..</li>
            <li>If they could add that to the polishing paste it would be perfect!</li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s great!  </li>
            <li>The process is time consuming, and if you at best devote 30 seconds to dental hygiene in the morning, you will have to go thru the process before you go to sleep.</li>

            <li>Rinse and your mouth will feel awesome!!!</li>

            <li>AWESOME product.  </li>
            <li>Being a coffee drinker, this was a great feeling!</li>
            <li>I think this is the peroxide which is excellent for preventing gum disease.</li>
            <li>I have been VERY pleased and have suffered NO sensitivity!!  </li>
            <li>I was very happy to try this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>This system is great!  </li>

            <li>&gt; Both toothpastes taste great.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and for the price a great deal.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great addition to my morning routine.</li>
            <li>Even after two weeks of using product, my teeth still feel great--</li>
            <li>I was still happy with my results.</li>
            <li>And my breath smells great.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I got to try this product as a promotion by the Crest brand for a chance to review it and experience the product.</li>
            <li>This product was a great kit for offering a one box solution for caring for your teeth.</li>
            <li>Here are the details of what I experienced.</li>
            <li>, I purchased it for my girlfriend and daughter, both of whom have seen great results as well.</li>
            <li>The taste isn&#x27;t great</li>
            <li>Step 1 tastes great</li>
            <li>, step 2 doesn&#x27;t have a great taste</li>
            <li>The product is great</li>
            <li>The great part about the Crest HD is you get the benefits of both products in one package.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I bought one for everyone in my family.</li>
            <li>This is great.  </li>
            <li>I get that post-dentist office feeling which is great.  </li>
            <li>I have tried strips and gave up on them before ever noticing any great result.  </li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>Plus it tastes great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like that great feeling</li>
            <li>This 2-step brushing system is great.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed a great difference in whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, great product</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I tried Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I found that combining the Crest with my whitening routine was a great match.</li>
            <li>Both smell great.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums feel great.</li>
            <li>and it did a great job of whitening my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great Product.</li>
            <li>I am getting compliments from people about how great my teeth look</li>
            <li>All-in-all, this is a great product</li>
            <li>My mouth felt great after brushing with it.</li>
            <li>and I am so happy I did.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s great that it gets people to brush for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>, i have found it works great and have had no issues.  </li>
            <li>then this product is great.  </li>
            <li>but I am having great results with this product.</li>
            <li>I am beyone happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I was happy that the gel did not have an overtly chemical taste.</li>
            <li>and I felt it did a great job cleaning my mouth.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro Health HD did a great job whitening our teeth.</li>
            <li>Great Product.</li>
            <li>I used an electric toothbrush with the Crest Pro Health HD kit and have been happy with the results.</li>
            <li>you can be proud to show off.</li>
            <li>If you have the patience to use 2 tubes, this is a great toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Reason is, the whitening gel is like brushing with Vicks VapoRub, lol.</li>
            <li>Multi-benefit and great results.</li>
            <li>it is GREAT.  </li>
            <li>But it tastes great and doesn&#x27;t burn.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any sensitivity at all after using the product 2 times a day for 2 weeks, yet my teeth are noticably whiter and brighter.</li>
            <li>Amazon has great pricing on this kit if you&#x27;re shopping around.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had no gum issues and after using this product I can see a difference which i am quite happy with.</li>
            <li>Am I ever happy I did.</li>
            <li>Some reviews noted brown spots on the teeth, I have experienced none.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product...</li>
            <li>That part isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>Step One tastes great</li>
            <li>This product did a great job whitening my teeth</li>
            <li>The whitening is great also.</li>
            <li>I think Crest Pro Health HD is a great  two part whitening toothpaste system.</li>
            <li>This is a great toothpaste and brightener.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job but will also show if you don&#x27;t brush to your gums.  </li>
            <li>I think Crest Pro Health HD is a great way to keep teeth healthier and whiter.</li>
            <li>It also tastes great.</li>
            <li>You brush 1 minute with step 1 and 1 minute with step 2, which is great because everyone should be brushing for 2 minutes....</li>
            <li>so I use the product once a day instead of twice and now have found my happy medium.</li>
            <li>My hygienist also commented that my tartar looked great.  </li>
            <li>My husband has been using the toothpaste and is happy with the results.</li>
            <li>The taste of the toothpaste is great.</li>
            <li>I believe that it is a great product for some people</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I tried the HD product, and want to continue it as my routine brush.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s off to a great start</li>
            <li>I have also looked for it in Walmart and feel it&#x27;s a great price point for whitening products!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The oral hygiene aspect of the product is great.</li>
            <li>The pastes themselves felt great on my teeth too.</li>
            <li>though this paste contains stannous fluoride, I haven&#x27;t had any of the staining I experienced with the Crest Pro Health product I had tried.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the whiteness of my teeth has greatly</li>
            <li>but, I can tell you this is a great product.  </li>
            <li>The taste is great and minty.</li>
            <li>They are polished and look great.</li>
            <li>Great product for non dentist office teeth whitening.</li>
            <li>even my dentist commented on how great my teeth looked.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste part of this two step product has great taste and is recommended by my dental hygienist.  </li>
            <li>I have been happy with every Crest product I have ever used except this one -</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s a win win.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt great after I was done.  </li>
            <li>I am somewhat OCD with my teeth and what I use on them, but I can honestly say Crest&#x27;s Pro Health really impressed me!</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall its a great product I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>Great toothpaste and polishing routine.  </li>
            <li>, this toothpaste is a great alternative.</li>
            <li>The product is great</li>
            <li>By adding one minute longer to my brushing routine, I have seen great results in 6 days.</li>
            <li>The flavor tastes great and you can see and feel the difference immediately.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I was quite happy.</li>
            <li>so we are happy to continue to use.</li>
            <li>so it was  great that I could tell a difference.</li>
            <li>I used for 5 days and my teeth felt great</li>
            <li>If this toothpaste works for you, then that&#x27;s great, but just making some notes for those who may have gum or tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li>In terms of impact, it&#x27;s been great.  </li>
            <li>#34;your teeth look great, I think I might have to start using your toothpaste (refer to the Crest HD).</li>
            <li>All in all this product has been a great way for me to get whiter, cleaner teeth</li>
            <li>This product works great.  </li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>The step 2 hydrogen peroxide gel is great for removing surface stains.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>My concern is that this may not be great for my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I found that the toothpaste system is great tasting  </li>
            <li>Taste is not that great, but hey it&#x27;s not food.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great has already helped whitening my teeth that were stained.</li>
            <li>On the contrary, I noticed that the lipstick color looked great with my pearly whites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Did a great job whitening my teeth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product for those of you that are concerned about whitening and does what it claims.</li>

            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so happy I did.</li>
            <li>Step one is a cleanser which tastes great,</li>
            <li>Every once in a while, we have all must have experienced what plaque build up looks like and feels like on our teeth-</li>
            <li>, therefore not seeing great results.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great idea to have then whitener separate.</li>

            <li>trial started out great.  </li>
            <li>The presentation is great.</li>
            <li>I am always prepared for a not so great taste with teeth whitening programs and toothpaste</li>
            <li>I though this was a great opportunity.</li>
            <li>Works great, I noticed a difference after just one use.  </li>

            <li>I really liked this toothpaste!  </li>
            <li>and I was most impressed with the cleaning property of the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>And after all that I endured, the results often weren&#x27;t even all that spectacular!</li>
            <li>impressed me most about this toothpaste was its staying power overnight.</li>
            <li>I wish the whitening had more bubbles so that I could feel the product working in my mouth, but I was impressed wih the after picture.</li>
            <li>The mouth-feel of my teeth, however, is truly remarkable.  </li>
            <li>Remarkable and noticeable results....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am loving the product!</li>
            <li>at your own risk!</li>
            <li>Some toothpastes aren&#x27;t the best tasting, but I love the mint flavor.</li>
            <li>but I love the cinnamon flavor the best</li>
            <li>The gel (step 2) doesn&#x27;t taste the greatest, but nor do most whitening products on the market.</li>
            <li>My teeth are noticeably whiter, but I am even more impressed with the way my gum health has improved.</li>
            <li>I thought you couldn&#x27;t get better than the Pro-Health, which is a great product itself, but this is!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m loving the way my mouth feels healthier!</li>
            <li>I am LOVING this product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall though, I was more impressed with the toothpaste than I thought I would be.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall though, I was more impressed with the toothpaste than I thought I would be.</li>
            <li>This is truly a great product, one of the best I&#x27;ve tried and I would like to thank the Crest brand for allowing me to try a kit free of charge.  </li>
            <li>I think the most surprising result was how great my gums felt!  </li>
            <li>The toothpaste and Polish have a pleasant taste</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this 2 part kit since I received it about a week ago, and I&#x27;ve found the taste for part one to be pleasant.</li>
            <li>In the beginning there was an after taste that I wasn&#x27;t too pleasant.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste has a pleasant minty taste and the whitening part tastes like the whitening strips.</li>
            <li>The taste and smell are pleasant also.</li>
            <li>It also has a pleasant minty taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The taste is pleasant and the foaming texture makes the bubbles do their job.  </li>
            <li>but this was quite pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Step one had a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li>and I was so excited!!!</li>
            <li>Easy and great feeling!</li>
            <li>So easy to use, and best of all - visible results (i.e. whiter teeth) after just 5 days of use!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to wake up to a pleasant mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So clean!!!</li>
            <li>My teeth felt SO clean!!!</li>
            <li>I am soooo happy I was able to try this system!</li>
            <li>, I just changed up my toothpaste routine, its so very easy!  </li>
            <li>This was very easy and efficient!  </li>
            <li>It takes 2 minutes, the flavor is great, and you have a beautiful sparkling, clean feeling mouth afterwards!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy to say that I felt no pain or sensitivity with this product and saw nice whitening results, even on my filled tooth!</li>
            <li>I can see how bright they&#x27;ve become.</li>
            <li>I am a coffee drinker and was concern that they weren&#x27;t as bright as they had been before.</li>
            <li>And we both agree that it does leave your teeth glossy and gleaming bright.  </li>
            <li>Great taste and leaves your teeth feeling amazing.</li>
            <li>My results are awesome and my smile is great.</li>
            <li>All in all a good product though.</li>
            <li>and I feel like it does a good job at both cleaning my teeth and whitening them.  </li>
            <li>good-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Brushing my teeth with a two-step process doesn&#x27;t take much more time than doing one step, and the results are incredible.  </li>
            <li>did either, even though we&#x27;ve always had good oral hygiene.</li>
            <li>I loved the two step process.</li>
            <li>I do think it&#x27;s a good idea, but am not yet convinced that it works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a good amount of toothpastes and haven&#x27;t found one that had the three things I&#x27;m looking for:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>Brushing my teeth with a two-step process doesn&#x27;t take much more time than doing one step, and the results are incredible.</li>
            <li>It also has a good flavor.  </li>
            <li>And now I actually enjoy it because I know I am getting great results!</li>
            <li>The item did a good cleaning my mouth.</li>
            <li>Still, it made an improvement, and that&#x27;s a good thing.  </li>
            <li>I scored a free sample of this product and am so happy I did !!  </li>
            <li>I got it free from BzzAgent so that I could review it, and I think it is the best.</li>
            <li>A friend tested the product for me, and she loved it.</li>
            <li>Product arrived in time with a good quality.</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>It may be doing a good job of cleaning my teeth, but it burns my tongue in the process.</li>
            <li>Step 1 tastes good - minty</li>
            <li>It leaves a good taste in the mouth also.</li>
            <li>It is a good whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li>A good product, and one I will buy again, but</li>
            <li>It does not take any longer to brush your teeth, but you get superior whitening results.  </li>
            <li>This too may be a good thing, as it has me brushing longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a good texture too.</li>
            <li>I received my crest HD fhas an excellent from Smiley 360 a week ago, Crest has always had a fabulous product</li>
            <li>I feel like it did do a good job whitening and cleaning my teeth, but feel the after taste was not what I was used to or wanted.</li>
            <li>That is always a good thing!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good product in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>It’s a good feeling.  </li>
            <li>This seems like a good price because you get the whitener and toothpaste without the sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;Crest Pro Health HD</li>
            <li>Crest Prohealth HD is a good value because I can prevent cavities while I whiten my teeth and remove surface stains.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel really good after I brush.  </li>
            <li>his teeth are looking good.  </li>
            <li>TLDR; makes my mouth feel good, but the inconvenience of using with an electric toothbrush means I won&#x27;t continue to use it once it&#x27;s done.</li>
            <li>And I thought that was as good as it was going to get.</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>but otherwise it is good and does not irritate my gums.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>and/or effort is good in my book.</li>
            <li>The taste is good, and the two steps are not a hassle at all.</li>
            <li>As the package arrived I loved the presentation.</li>
            <li>The fact that I must use it faithful helps reinforce the oral hygiene good habit.</li>
            <li>Now that my teeth are looking good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit before trying this paste, I had sworn off Crest for good.</li>
            <li>and I totally loved it.</li>
            <li>I loved that this helped get rid of the surface stains.</li>
            <li>good tooth cleaning paste but weems like a lot of work for no noticeable difference in the color of my teeth</li>
            <li>I loved that.</li>
            <li>Aislinn the loved-</li>
            <li>It is as good as advertised.</li>
            <li>Step 1, the cleanser seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li>I still think it is a good product, if used sparingly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always taken good care of my teeth, brushing twice a day no matter what.  </li>
            <li>Best part of it all I got to try it for free from Crest and Bzz</li>
            <li>Good results.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t taste all that good either.</li>
            <li>The flavor of this toothpaste is good too - I&#x27;m a bit picky about that</li>
            <li>I received this for free from smiley360 to test out and the results were awesome!!</li>
            <li>I got this item free from Bzzagent and am impressed!!</li>
            <li>so I do have good oral hygiene.  </li>
            <li>For a whitening toothpaste I would say this is a good one to get.</li>
            <li>hold the maker P&amp;G in good esteem, so I had to try this product.</li>
            <li>After using for a couple of weeks, I think my teeth are a bit whiter, and the paste itself has a good flavor.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>you will probably need to do gel strips or see a dentist, but this is a good system if you want to just do it while brushing.</li>
            <li>My feeling was that the combo treatment wasn&#x27;t as good as using Crest&#x27;s 3D Polishing Treatment with Brilliance Boost.</li>
            <li>I have even noticed a good change in my breath, which to me</li>
            <li>I think it is a good product and would purchase it again&lt;</li>
            <li>The toothpaste part of step one tastes really good</li>
            <li>and i feel like you get a good amount of toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It tastes good.  </li>
            <li>As a coffee drinker, I noticed the difference in my teeth after about 3 days of usage (a good notice, as they&#x27;re whiter).  </li>
            <li>This product is so good.</li>
            <li>Brushing my teeth with a two-step process doesn&#x27;t take much more time than doing one step, and the results are incredible.</li>
            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>The step 1 paste has a good minty flavor...</li>
            <li>I received this for free and Crest Pro-health HD is the best toothpaste I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>I was given an opportunity to try this free through BzzzAgent, and I have to say, it was great!</li>
            <li>I must say this product is really good.</li>
            <li>I think this is a good product, but a bit pricy.</li>
            <li>but I have LOVED the results I have from using Crest HD.</li>
            <li>the end of the using the product I found my mouth feeling refreshed and smelling good.  </li>
            <li>good buy</li>
            <li>Although this might be a good product to try for those who don&#x27;t have time to set aside for that.</li>
            <li>Minty taste was superior to others.</li>
            <li>it is a good toothpaste that does have resutls</li>
            <li>Step 2 is a bleaching gel and doesn&#x27;t taste good.</li>
            <li>The taste is good to me-</li>
            <li>Again, maybe I have a predisposition with my teeth that does not allowing good whitening.</li>
            <li>IF the whitening portion of the toothpaste does as it claims, then I can see the product being a good value.</li>
            <li>Again, maybe I have a predisposition with my teeth that does not allowing good whitening.</li>
            <li>IF the whitening portion of the toothpaste does as it claims, then I can see the product being a good value.</li>
            <li>Took some time to see results but when I did I loved it.</li>
            <li>My teeth get a good cleaning with the grit of Step 1&#x27;s Purifying Cleanser.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I thought the product was good.</li>
            <li>has been sneaking my Crest Pro Health® HD because he has a lot of plaque and Step 1 makes him feel like he is doing something good for his health.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Crest Pro Health HD for over three weeks now and this is my review after a good usage of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crest Pro Health HD is a two step process to get Healthier and Whiter teeth.</li>
            <li>nothing else, this toothpaste has to be good for your oral health, as it is getting you to brush for longer.</li>
            <li>With that said, however, If your teeth could use some help and need to be whiter, than this could be a good product for you.</li>
            <li>The taste was good</li>
            <li>I have to say I was truly impressed how fresh my mouth stays throughout the night getting up with my newborn!  </li>
            <li>My teeth look and feel good! :)</li>
            <li>But the best part is the just-went-to-the-dentist clean feeling you get.</li>
            <li>My husband also used the toothpaste and was very happy with how his teeth looked and how clean his mouth fell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I noticed that my teeth felt clean and wonderful after each use.  </li>
            <li>wonderful because I remember the 1st time I used my electric toothbrush and my teeth felt like silk - so polished and clean</li>
            <li>Pros include:  Great price, great results, easy routine and</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed and decided to change it up going forward by doing a full two minutes on Step 1</li>
            <li>that &#x27;this must have been productive&#x27; kind of pleasant way.</li>
            <li>it is quick, painless and the results are great!!  </li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t believe this tooth paste is exceptional in whitening properties</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super awesome</li>
            <li>I received this from BzzAgent and LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!!  </li>
            <li>and I have to say that I am SUPER impressed!!</li>
            <li>My latest and what I thought would be greatest product I received (for free!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super impressed.</li>
            <li>Weirdness and all, I was super impressed.</li>
            <li>I must admit I wasn&#x27;t super impressed.  </li>
            <li>However, I was impressed from the first day!</li>
            <li>Add on top of that, the whitening ability to this kit and I&#x27;m in a happy spot.</li>
            <li>However, after getting a sample package and using it I am very, very pleased.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am very pleased with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Love Crest Prohealth works great</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>So be warned, it doesn&#x27;t taste like toothpastes who say they try to taste great, but it doesn&#x27;t taste like you&#x27;re brushing with baking soda, either.  :)&#x27;</li>
            <li>So be warned, it doesn&#x27;t taste like toothpastes who say they try to taste great, but it doesn&#x27;t taste like you&#x27;re brushing with baking soda, either.  :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>but it makes my teeth very smooth and feel like I was just at the dentist and got my teeth cleaned!</li>
            <li>I have been using Crest Pro Health® HD for about two weeks now and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied will recommend to family and friends.  </li>
            <li>The answer does not matter to me as I am very pleased with the results and will continue to use both HD products.</li>
            <li>thought that it was very refreshing</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I will also continue to use it as I am so very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s 2.5 times more to pay - happy with the product but price point</li>
            <li>I have used the toothpaste once a day for three weeks and have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li>And how great is it that I got it free through BzzAgent!</li>
            <li>The toothpaste leaves my mouth/ breath smelling so great and feeling even better.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I think this combined with a tooth whitening strip would be the best combination for getting a whiter smile, but if you just need a refresher then this toothpaste works well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I received this to try as a promotion and was very pleased to be included.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got a chance to try it, because this product works really great.  </li>

            <li>This will be my go to product to make surely smile is at its best.</li>
            <li>And to my surprise, I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>The packaging is very attractive and colorful.</li>
            <li>That also means I had fairly stained teeth when I first tried this product, and I have to say I was impressed.  </li>
            <li>I received the Crest Pro-Health HD as a promotion and have been very pleased with it.  </li>

            <li>Shipping was perfect, arrived right when stated.</li>

            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>I love this two-step toothpaste!</li>
            <li>This stuff was amazing, got a free sample to try by smiley360 and LOVED IT!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>I got this as a free sample!!</li>
            <li>There are so many things I like about this product!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>My mouth has never felt or looked better!</li>
            <li>With this product I am able to quit wasting money on at home whitening kits that don&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT!.</li>
            <li>use my Sonicare toothbrush with the Crest Pro-Health HD system, and it works perfectly for me because I&#x27;ll know when my first minute is up</li>
            <li>and once it was gone I&#x27;ve bought more @Walmart!</li>
            <li>I’ve noticed they are getting more whiter and brighter!</li>
            <li>Crest Pro Health HD is the most amazing product ever!</li>
            <li>Love how my teeth look and feel!</li>
            <li>added bonus is that after my latest dental appointment I can say this stuff is dentist approved!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>BUT, after trying it, I love it!  </li>
            <li>How great is that, right!?!  </li>
            <li>I would love if they had just a tooth paste that provided the awesome clean feeling.</li>
            <li>its a very effective way to clean your mouth and make your teeth whiter!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Whereas I am not so happy with the Perfecting gel, it is too strong mint flavored and leaves a burning sensation in my mouth.</li>
            <li>This system is really easy an yields great results.</li>
            <li>At first I honestly was nervous to change toothpaste because I thought the one I was using was the best.</li>
            <li>Very Rare!! .</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say this is the most effective &amp; pleasant toothpaste I think I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>You brush first for one minute with the toothpaste which tastes minty and has a very pleasant flavor.</li>
            <li>It is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>step 2 gel makes my mouth feel amazing</li>
            <li>However, the results aren&#x27;t quite as amazing as when used as directed.  </li>
            <li>the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for 1 month now and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>but its is an amazing product</li>

            <li>Got Pro Health HD free from Crest to try and quite happy with it!&lt;br</li>

            <li>Crest Pro health HD is absolutely amazing. ..</li>
            <li>The Crest Pro-Health Two-Step system is amazing.</li>
            <li>, it also has whitened my teeth within one week of using it, so the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li>I had AMAZING results</li>
            <li>I liked this product to the point where I purchased another box at Walmart.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Final thoughts: Effective, yes, but with side effects.</li>
            <li>my review is completely my own thoughts and opinions.</li>
            <li>I also liked the taste of step 2.  </li>
            <li>but honestly I can not tell which picture is the before and which is the after.</li>
            <li>BUT I must say I am THRILLED with the results.  </li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own.”</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I liked the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>A couple of things to note about this product that I am not too thrilled about are:</li>
            <li>I must be honest</li>
            <li>Step two kind of tastes like the whitening strip paste</li>
            <li>Opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>I brush my teeth three times a day and have gone through a variety of toothpastes trying to find one that I liked.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own without the whitening gel.  </li>
            <li>There was a nice minty, but not overbearing, taste after brushing as well.  </li>
            <li>I liked the two-step process.</li>
            <li>my own</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just a routine that has a nice ending....</li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>I got this product thru bzzagent at no charge so that I can review it and give it my honest opinion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>but this has honestly changed my relationship with my toothpaste routine.</li>
            <li>Step 1 has a nice minty taste that doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The flavor is nice and minty.  </li>
            <li>But I found a remark in someone else&#x27;s review that I thought was amusing and not at all inaccurate.  </li>
            <li>recieved this product as part of a promotion all reviews are my own</li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>It also kind is a pain to use both products given.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>or I probably would not have purchased this on my own.  </li>
            <li>I liked a lot of things about Crest Pro Health HD.</li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of convenient that Crest has chosen to minimize that side effect through including a whitening agent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of convenient that Crest has chosen to minimize that side effect through including a whitening agent.  </li>
            <li>However, my analysis and opinion drawn from the results of use are that of my own.</li>
            <li>Thanks Crest for marketing this great product!</li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own.  </li>
            <li>I liked that it had the two steps</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s package nicely with both tubes together.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Crest Pro-Health HD two step whitening toothpaste for a couple of weeks and have been been loving the results.  </li>
            <li>feeling of the toothpaste kind of dries your mouth out...</li>
            <li>but my comments are my own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s shame that i&#x27;m a smoker, but this item really good, make my teeth more cleaner.</li>
            <li>One nice thing is my Sonicare has a built in timer for two minutes.</li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>, I really LIKED this two-step process.  </li>
            <li>I liked this product.</li>
            <li>I was happy to be invited to this campaign (from Crest) as I love being able to try the newest dental products out on the market.  </li>
            <li>I feel like anyone can you their own toothpaste preference for step 1 and then use the step 2 product for whitening.</li>
            <li>I really liked that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In theory, that should be a good thing, but it feels too abrasive to be healthy.  </li>
            <li>I liked the recycled packaging of the Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It is effective, but I won&#x27;t recommend it if you are suffering from mouth ulcers.</li>
            <li>It is also kind of a pain having to use two separate steps without rinsing in between.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste is really, really nice.</li>
            <li>and I have to say I really was impressed.</li>
            <li>I received it from Crest/BzzAgent to try and provide my honest feedback</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>The purifying cleanser has kind of a foamy feel in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>I also liked not having to bother with the strips, remembering which way they go on and having to throw them away because they get stuck and wadded up.  </li>
            <li>I am so impressed with how much whiter my teeth are.  </li>
            <li>I really liked that you didn&#x27;t have to keep the product away from your lips while using it.</li>
            <li>Thanks to BzzAgent and Crest, I tried this product for free!&lt;br /&gt;I am really happy with this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>Step 1 is great as it has a grittiness to it that really cleans my teeth and a great mint taste, Step 2</li>
            <li>I have to say that I really liked this product.  </li>
            <li>and I actually really liked it alot.  </li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>and honestly I cannot comment as yet as to whether or not my tooth sensitivity has improved.</li>
            <li>Step 1, the cleanser, has a nice wintergreen-type flavor.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m impressed with this gentle alternative to whitening strips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used whitening product because to be honest</li>
            <li>I like the nice minty taste of it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a pain to have to untwist a cap and deal with that when you have your toothbrush in hand</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I really liked the Crest Pro Health HD two step whitening system.</li>
            <li>It has done an incredibly job whitening my teeth but as a toothpaste alone it might be worth a try.  </li>
            <li>I will be honest though</li>
            <li>for my candid opinion, I will say that In the seventh grade I did a toothpaste research project for my science class testing all brands of toothpaste.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m writing this because I liked the product,</li>
            <li>would I buy this on my own, probably not.</li>
            <li>* Switching pastes halfway through brushing is kind of a pain in the neck.</li>
            <li>Whitens teeth nicely.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product.  </li>
            <li>I liked the 2-step process.  </li>
            <li>A flip lid on both tubes would be nice.  </li>
            <li>They did ask me to write a review, but I tried to be completely honest.</li>
            <li>I think that Crest Pro Health HD is a good product-it made my teeth a bit whiter and my mouth does feel healthy.  </li>
            <li>I liked the results from this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>All views and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>I really liked the flavor of the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>but my opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>but I soon got use to that and liked it.</li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own</li>
            <li>These are my own views and opinions.</li>
            <li>It kind of reminds me of going to the dentist--they scrape all the gunk off your teeth and then polish them for you.</li>
            <li>I have since bought this toothpaste system on my own as well</li>
            <li>b/c it it kind of pricey,</li>
            <li>my dentist had told me that my teeth were good and healthy.</li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own</li>
            <li>The two-step system is kind of a pain to use if you don&#x27;t have a way to manage the amount of time you are supposed to be brushing with each paste;  I use a Sonicare</li>
            <li>so it beeps every thirty seconds and is handy for knowing when to switch from step one to step two.  </li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>I do have nice looking teeth already</li>
            <li>Nor do I like the whitening strips that are so popular.  </li>
            <li>I would purchase this product on its own.</li>
            <li>My family is now using it and loving it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product and the opinions in this review are 100% my own</li>
            <li>So I guess I should expect this kind of reaction.</li>
            <li>I really liked it.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t mix them up, which is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>It also contains hydrogen peroxide in the perfecting gel, which of course is a proven effective whitening and oral debriding agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>However, al of the opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>All in all I will continue to use the product and would probably continue purchasing on my own in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say I like it.  </li>
            <li>I liked the taste, thought the foam got around all of the teeth and think it&#x27;s a really nice improvement.</li>
            <li>I love the taste, and a good mouth feel.  </li>
            <li>Can they create a senstive teeth/gums version or would that not be effective in the whitening process?&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Toothpaste has a nice minty flavor&lt;</li>
            <li>I loved the taste of the cleanser and tasted somewhat like spearmint, which was so refreshing.</li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>As a coffee drinker my teeth looked kind of dingy.</li>
            <li>It is kind of a pain to brush two times, but I have truly noticed a difference in the way that my teeth look.  </li>
            <li>and I liked the results that I saw.</li>
            <li>I really liked using this.  </li>
            <li>Save your money with just the toothpaste, and ask your dentist for the best way to whiten your teeth if you really desire that.  </li>
            <li>But I have to honest</li>
            <li>Nice job, Crest</li>
            <li>and she told me that she liked it</li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own</li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>my own</li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>and my opinion is 100% my own.</li>
            <li>Step 1, the cleanser, has a nice wintergreen-type flavor.</li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>Best of all, my teeth really are cleaner and brighter-looking.</li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own</li>
            <li>I honestly feel like the product worked for me.</li>
            <li>There were things I liked about the toothpaste and things I did not like about the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have an issue with the two step system but the perfecting gel doesn&#x27;t taste nice at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely impressed with how much plague the toothpaste removes.</li>
            <li>because I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d have chosen this to try on my own.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest  </li>
            <li>but my opinions are very much my own.</li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>It makes your mouth feel amazingly fresh and the whitening agent is incredible.  </li>
            <li>I wish there was some kind of strip included to judge the difference.  </li>
            <li>As a tax CPA, I drink more than my fair share of coffee at work.  </li>
            <li>Crest provided me with this system to test it out, and although I&#x27;ve been a fan of their whitening strips, I wasn&#x27;t sure this system could get me to give up my beloved baking soda/peroxide toothpaste.</li>
            <li>These opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>and if I hadn&#x27;t got the chance to try it for review, I probably would not have tried it on my own.  </li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve kind of gotten used to it</li>
            <li>all, I really liked this system, and the pros outweigh the cons because of the whitening power.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own</li>
            <li>So I guess I should expect this kind of reaction.</li>
            <li>I also like that my husband can use the system, because you use it with your own toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I liked that I could control where I applied the gel, focusing it on my front teeth and avoiding my gums.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste for step one is grainy and the taste is not as good as many toothpastes.</li>
            <li>all, if you have good, healthy teeth and have used teeth whiteners without issue, I&#x27;d probably recommend this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li>At 12$ dollars/kit, it&#x27;s not cost effective for me to continue to use the product.  </li>
            <li>may be as effective at whitening as this.</li>
            <li>So my opinions are totally my own.</li>
            <li>I think that Crest Pro Health HD is a good product-it made my teeth a bit whiter and my mouth does feel healthy.  </li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need that kind of negativity in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My dentist tells me we are supposed to brush for 2 minutes anyway, so the 2 steps just keeps me honest.  </li>
            <li>The dual process is kind of a hassle</li>
            <li>And I can honestly say that nothing has ever worked as well as Crest HD.</li>
            <li>I would however, purchase it on my own to keep using it.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Crest, for a great product!</li>
            <li>Honest.</li>
            <li>Honest.</li>
            <li>The packaging of the Crest Pro Health HD was eye catching.  </li>
            <li>Then, you brush with the (kind of flavorless) gel for one minute.</li>
            <li>wintergreen flavor was nice</li>
            <li>The product is effective but not in a week&#x27;s time frame.</li>
            <li>I liked the taste and ease of use.  </li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the system for about a week now and have seen nice results.  </li>
            <li>I actually liked the smell and the taste of a Step 1 Purifying Cleanser that uses Stannous Fluoride to strip away plaque.  </li>
            <li>My opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>I started using warm water and it lessens the effect, although the feeling is still there.</li>
            <li>My husband also tried this product and asked if I would buy it again as he really liked it.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of Crest Pro-Health HD to try and provide my honest feedback as a bzzagent.  </li>
            <li>my own based on my experience with the product.</li>
            <li>You just need to have a timer or a watch handy when brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste has a nice texture and grit to it.</li>
            <li>and I was thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>However, I loved the smooth mint flavor of the toothpaste and my teeth did, in fact, feel cleaner throughout the day!  </li>
            <li>I love love love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>The Crest Pro Health System is easy and effective!</li>
            <li>and I thank Crest Pro Health® HD™ for making it so easy and effective!</li>
            <li>The best part was how quick and easy it was to use -</li>
            <li>This toothpaste makes my mouth feel very clean and leaves a good taste in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with this toothpaste and I am excited for the results once I finish my tubes.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant change in the whiteness of my teeth, but I was happy with the color of my teeth to begin with.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited to how my mouth feels after a month with this toothpaste!!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get my Crest Prom Health HD in the mail!!</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with this new product!</li>
            <li>This 2 step process is the best new toothpaste I have ever used!</li>
            <li>This has a great taste and it makes your teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li>I experienced no sensitivity, but my mouth feels so clean.</li>
            <li>It has a great minty taste, and leaves my teeth feeling clean after each brushing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I have been consistently using Pro-Health HD for over a month, and I&#x27;m satisfied with the result and am impressed with the amount of toothpaste and whitening gel that comes in the two tubes.</li>
            <li>Gives your teeth a great clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>My gums and teeth feel great and clean.  </li>
            <li>Each day feels like a great trip to the dentist, and I know my teeth are clean.</li>
            <li>Step one provides a great clean feeling, while step two has the whitening power in a one-two punch system.</li>
            <li>STEP 2  HAS PEROXIDE WHICH IS GREAT TO WHITEN AND CLEAN.</li>
            <li>I experienced no sensitivity, but my mouth feels so clean.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean afterwards and they are looking great.  </li>
            <li>I use a Sonicare electric toothbrush and had been previously happy about how clean my teeth felt using</li>
            <li>Both solutions have a pleasant taste and are easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This product is very easy to use and makes your teeth feel amazing when you are done.</li>
            <li>But the best part is that after just a week or so, my once very sensitive teeth were not bothering me at all!</li>
            <li>Excellent product,  comes highly recommended.</li>
            <li>but the difference in how your teeth feel is pretty incredible.</li>
            <li>The flavor of Step one was very pleasant and it was super easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not time effective for me, sorry.&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention, Step 2 doesn&#x27;t really taste very good.  </li>
            <li>The two steps seemed daunting at first, but I was so impressed by how clean my teeth felt, and the feeling lasted almost all day!  </li>
            <li>Having an opportunity to try new Crest Pro Health HD through BzzAgent seemed ideal!  </li>
            <li>This new Crest Pro-Health HD tooth-whitening system provides excellent whitening with no sensitivity.</li>
            <li>THIS NEW PRODUCT IS THE BEST</li>
            <li>The timing was perfect because I have been wanting to try a new toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>(if I am thinking about my time it&#x27;s not such a good thing, but if I am thinking about my health it is a great thing!).  </li>
            <li>The two step process is easy, and both products are good tasting.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve ever washed your face with any St Ives Face Scrub and experienced the way your face feels super polished and buffed out, this is how your teeth will feel.  </li>
            <li>This product is a great value for quick results.</li>
            <li>and I am super happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>It was a good thought, and ok product, but it is not something I would go out and buy when I can use my favorite toothpaste and my whiten trays/whitening strips than use two toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this toothpaste to a friend just for the excellent cleaning ability, and chance that it&#x27;ll whiten better for them than it did for me.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt bright and strong after just once use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and promotes good brushing.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with how white my teeth are and how good they look after one use.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste works great, works fast, feels good.</li>
            <li>This product is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The product is very easy to use-</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, just two minutes twice a day.  </li>
            <li>that said, this is very strong stuff.</li>
            <li>very easy</li>
            <li>I have found that some minty toothpastes can be very strong in flavor that could even upset my stomach.  </li>
            <li>This was very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It was very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I found there to be some very strong pros and very strong detractors to this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This two-step toothpaste is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I gag every time I use step 1, very strong wintergreen flavor.</li>
            <li>After a week of using Crest Pro Health HD I still find its 2-step regimen very easy and convenient to use.</li>
            <li>more taste 3) more foam!  </li>
            <li>I think this product is awesome for people with sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I was because I really do love it!</li>
            <li>I was real excited to be chosen to try this product.  </li>
            <li>It also leaves my mouth and breath very fresh and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a great product, I love what it&#x27;s done for my smile!</li>
            <li>Super Super Happy!</li>
            <li>I received a sample before the release from Smiley360, I love this amazing product.</li>
            <li>So far one of the best toothpaste brands that I have tried.</li>
            <li>The taste of the paste is also great and leaves my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best toothpaste set I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Wow, this product was great!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>Works great, whitens teeth, leaves your mouth feeling fresh</li>
            <li>I loved these detailed instructions</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for nearly 2 months now and have LOVED the results!!</li>
            <li>It has a nice minty flavor that is not at all overpowering, it reminds me of some of my favorite gums.</li>
            <li>There are two steps to complete the process of whitening and cleaning your teeth which should be done twice a day for the best results.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Taste is nice, refreshing and minty without the &#x27;fluoride&#x27; taste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The best part of my experience so far with Crest Pro Health® HD™?</li>
            <li>Besides the whitening aspect, I liked that the two step process made me spend more time brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best whitening toothpaste system I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>As far as ease of use, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>I loved these detailed instructions</li>
            <li>I use it with a sonic care which I believe makes it more effective.</li>
            <li>I got a free sample from BzzAgent and after trying it my teeth have never felt so good.</li>
            <li>so I would have liked this more if it was just one tube to dealt with.</li>
            <li>My breath was fresh and my gums looked great.  </li>
            <li>this was one of the most amazing products I had used for my teeth.</li>
            <li>The mint flavor made the whitening process kind of enjoyable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very happy with the results of this toothpaste so far, and plan on continuing to use</li>
            <li>It works, and my mouth feels clean and tastes pleasant -</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t enjoy the 2 step process, wish it was an all in one, but over all good.</li>
            <li>a matter of fact, my FAVORITE aspect of using Crest Pro Health HD is the amazing &amp;#34;fresh from the dentist CLEAN&amp;#34; feeling I get each time I use it.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best product I have tested through that program.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not a smoker - nevertheless my teeth had yellowed more than I would&#x27;ve liked</li>
            <li>Step 1 has a pleasant taste and makes my teeth feel insanely clean.  </li>
            <li>Wow, Crest Pro Health HD is the best at-home whitening I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It even tastes clean and pleasant -</li>
            <li>It even tastes clean and pleasant -</li>
            <li>Even though Crest Pro-health HD seemed to give me a brighter smile a result which I am happy about.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth this may not be the best for you...  </li>
            <li>I gave this product a good try for 2 weeks after receiving it free as a BzzAgent from Crest.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I received a sample from Crest and BzzAgent to review with my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>It gives your mouth a very fresh feel, but it doesn&#x27;t taste good.  </li>
            <li>so I am sure happy that Step 2 makes me teeth super</li>
            <li>The product is very easy to use, and the flavor is mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li>right now.&lt;br /&gt;I was eager to try tis product solely because of the reputation of the Crest brand and was looking forward to great</li>
            <li>think Crest is on the right track for a great product, but they still have some work to do.  </li>
            <li>The newness of the feel was quickly diminished when we saw how amazingly it worked!</li>
            <li>and I think the product is easy to use!</li>
            <li>This is so easy because all your doing is brushing!</li>
            <li>Easy to use!  </li>
            <li>It was surprisingly easy to incorporate the two steps!</li>
            <li>The 2 step system is easy to follow and doesn&#x27;t require any wait time!</li>
            <li>The  two step system is easy and  you can spit  after step one, but no rinsing!</li>
            <li>Its ridiculously easy: brush with #1, spit, brush with #2, then spit and rinse - DONE!</li>
            <li>EASY TO USE!  </li>
            <li>Easy peasy!</li>
            <li>The two step process is easy!</li>
            <li>Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste is a good system for getting a great clean while also helping to remove stains and provide a whiter smile.</li>
            <li>liked the very clean feeling after brushing with both steps.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that this is one of the BEST products I have used in a long time that has amazing results.</li>
            <li>I first tried this when I received a free product sample as part of the BzzAgent program and after three days of use, I was so impressed with my results that I ordered three more to share with family members.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with the product because despite the discomfort, I am seeing results I am happy with.  </li>
            <li>After just one use, I was amazed to discover my teeth felt as clean as they do after a good dental cleaning.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for clean teeth and mouth, this is a good product.  </li>
            <li>It is a good product, but I do not see much difference whitening wise.  </li>
            <li>I take great pride in my smile and am always perusing the dental isles looking for something that will be even better.  </li>
            <li>But, I would imagine it would be more effective if my teeth were more stained to begin with.</li>
            <li>has not made my teeth more sensitive, so I&#x27;m happy!  </li>
            <li>I loved the clean that I received when using the Step 1 Purifying Cleanser.</li>
            <li>He said I was doing a really great job flossing, and honestly, I don’t floss as much as I should.</li>
            <li>He said I was doing a really great job flossing, and honestly, I don’t floss as much as I should.</li>

            <li>Honestly feel as clean as a trip to the dentist!</li>
            <li>After the first brush my mouth felt great.</li>
            <li>The first bottle/tube has a flip cap which is great for one hand use.  </li>
            <li>The first step does a great job at removing the plaque from your teeth.</li>
            <li>Loved that it was not only whitening but under the Pro Health brand so good for your teeth!</li>
            <li>The first tube is the toothpaste that does a really great job of cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Just after the first use I noticed a great change in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li>The first step tastes great.  </li>
            <li>I am an avid coffee and wine drinker with what I think are great teeth.</li>
            <li>Wait a week for full results then show off your beautiful smile !</li>
            <li>After the first brushing, my teeth felt great even though I just went to the dentist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The taste isn&#x27;t that great at first</li>
            <li>First couple days I thought it was great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, the sucralose ingredient in the whitening gel leaves an after-taste that&#x27;s too sweet, but can be mitigated with a good water rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I got this from bzzagent and thought that it was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>but it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>but it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>#34;This is a good way of getting me to brush for a full 2 minutes&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;-High</li>
            <li>I think it is a great way to whiten your teeth quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>I do feel like it leaves my teeth feeling clean and smooth after use, which is great.  </li>
            <li>Denial health is very important to me.</li>
            <li>The whitening paste makes your teeth feel very smooth</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t taste much for the whitening paste, which is good since most don&#x27;t taste that great!</li>
            <li>It was very smooth.  </li>
            <li>I think they look &amp;#34;healthier&amp;#34; and that is very important to me.</li>
            <li>Oral care is very important to me</li>
            <li>Okay, positives first: Great packaging.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In addition to keeping the stains away, the toothpaste leaves my mouth feeling fresh and has a pleasant flavor.</li>
            <li>since I&#x27;ve never tried any product with this quick or good of a result.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is quite a pleasant minty taste and leaves my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>I studied my teeth in the mirror before my first use to get a good image in my mind of their appearance and honestly, they were dingy.</li>
            <li>this is you are looking for something easy to use and effective.  </li>
            <li>I found that Crest ProHealth HD worked effectively and it was easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is easy and effective.</li>
            <li>I received Crest HD to try for free and I love it!</li>
            <li>Tried it for free and am I ever glad I had the opportunity!</li>
            <li>I got to try this for free as a part of a BzzAgent campaign, and I am really glad I did!</li>
            <li>I got my kit as a free sample which made it all the better!</li>
            <li>I got the opportunity to sample the Crest ProHealth HD for free (#GotItFree) and really love it!</li>
            <li>I have to say that I greatly enjoy this Crest Pro - Health product and love the results!</li>
            <li>i got a kit of the crest pro health hd 2 step toothpaste for free through bzzagent and i am so glad i got a chance to try it!</li>
            <li>I received this kit for free from crest as a trial and boy am I glad I had the chance to try this out!  </li>
            <li>Leaves your teeth feeling clean and smooth, your breath very nice and refreshing, and whitens your teeth to boot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super convenient, and really the best whitening system we&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li>I love this great tasting toothpaste, and would suggest it to anyone looking for a toothpaste that promotes a clean and fresh feeling mouth and whiter teeth!</li>
            <li>, I am very pleased with how clean my teeth feel and</li>
            <li>Give it a try for a beautiful, clean smile.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s a certain potency or, may I say, stinging to the cleaning process, but a good rinse at the end with warm water remedies</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy that I got to try this product free from Crest/Bzz as part of brand promotion, but it is worth the price</li>
            <li>The whitening is also a huge advantage!  </li>
            <li>After the 1st use I noticed a huge difference!</li>
            <li>Noticed a huge improvement in just 1 use!</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t quite been a week and my teeth are brighter and after every brush it is cleaner than my mouth feels leaving the dentist, without the huge bill!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed a difference in my gums but also in how my teeth just feel better.</li>
            <li>OK, but 6x whiter?</li>
            <li>However the product works better than cheaper &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I also find myself rinsing a lot more to get the product out of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I pay greater attention to the time I spend brushing because of the two-step process.</li>
            <li>Step two doesn&#x27;t taste as good but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li>I was a smoker for many years, so I have had plenty of experience with whitening products.  </li>
            <li>It making my teeth whiter I been using it for 1 week with lovely results.  </li>
            <li>it is more of a gel-</li>
            <li>and it is quite enjoyable.</li>
            <li>I tried the Crest Pro Health HD system by Crest in return for a review and was hoping for the best as I&#x27;ve always had issues getting my teeth white (years of drinking coffee).</li>
            <li>This tube doesn&#x27;t have the most pleasurable taste at all</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like Step-2 added an invisible, magical force field to my teeth to repel any and all build</li>
            <li>It tastes a lot like the stuff that&#x27;s on a Crest WhiteStrip, so definitely not the greatest taste in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I have tried many teeth whitening products over the years, but never stuck with any of them.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>I would be able to keep up this 2 step process for more than a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>No way would I be able to keep this up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to keep it up all week without a problem and plan on keeping it up since it has been so easy.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I love my HD Crest toothpaste...</li>
            <li>But after so many years, I wrote it off as, \\&quot;well, time to go the dentist and get the job</li>
            <li>I LOVE the way my teeth feel after.</li>
            <li>You can visit their website for more details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the taste of step one and sorta dislike the taste of step 2</li>
            <li>I love how my teeth are whiter and feel cleaner.</li>
            <li>What I REALLY love is the way my teeth &amp; mouth feel afterwards.</li>
            <li>I love the results of whitening strips</li>
            <li>I continued to see my brightness improve the more I used it.  </li>
            <li>Some things I love, some are just okay.</li>
            <li>Not too many people will be able to afford this product.</li>
            <li>I would also want better results for the retail price.</li>
            <li>When I received the package, I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like using a toothpaste that required two steps.  </li>
            <li>We were provided this product for free to try from BzzAgent and Crest!</li>
            <li>and I do a better job at brushing.</li>
            <li>I love this kit.</li>
            <li>but I must say that I enjoyed this product better.</li>
            <li>My teeth seem brighter, but more time will tell.</li>
            <li>You brush your teeth for two minutes twice a day--one minute for each step--and you get visibly whiter, brighter, more even-toned teeth.</li>
            <li>so perhaps I am more maintaining with this</li>
            <li>i love this  </li>
            <li>I got a sample of this to try for free and give my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>the flavor for the HD is more subtle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but this did not happen in a week, it took more like two weeks or more to achieve a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>The flavor is also okay.</li>
            <li>product is a 2-part whitening and better oral health product that claims to work within a week.</li>
            <li>I really love the taste of the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Within a week you really notice a difference and your teeth look and feel great.  </li>
            <li>I will say that my teeth and gums do feel healthy, but the reason I tried this was for the whitening.</li>
            <li>review is in return for enjoying this product FREE from Crest!</li>
            <li>I have found that many whitening products burn my mouth, but this product does not do that.</li>
            <li>I feel myself smiling more these days to show off my pearly whites :)</li>
            <li>To me this works better than the strips and there is never any sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed using this toothpaste and would buy it again.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this toothpaste, which I received free from Crest!!</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>On top of the color, once i finish with step 2</li>
            <li>I love the two-step system.</li>
            <li>I am not a cola, coffee, or tea drinker, and I don&#x27;t smoke, so I don&#x27;t have surface stains, but I can still see notable improvements in the color of my teeth after just 10 days of use.</li>
            <li>chair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product as part of a promotion from Crest, but I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>My teeth did whiten some, even my crowns looked better.</li>
            <li>I feel my oral health is much better now after using this product.  </li>
            <li>I love that this product can help me by removing plaque and reducing my chances of getting gingivitis.  </li>
            <li>I needed to know that it was safe before using it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it and am using it.  </li>
            <li>Glad I tried and now my wife and friend will be checking it out too.</li>
            <li>love the 2 step system.</li>
            <li>2 steps are too many.</li>
            <li>They both leave a refreshing taste...and my teeth have indeed whitened.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to feel the difference before but</li>
            <li>I think I am even beginning to notice a change with how my teeth look. :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I had a visit to my dentist and my hygienist noted that my teeth look great and it was obvious I was doing a good job brushing</li>
            <li>It seems to be much more than that, though...</li>
            <li>and  I feel this step whitens better than anything on the market.</li>
            <li>Got it free from Bzz Agent for reviewing purposes!</li>
            <li>With this two-step toothpaste, I am able to whiten while brushing and see immediate results.</li>
            <li>The product is much easier to use than the trays or strips and seems to have great results.  </li>
            <li>I really liked how smooth my teeth felt from the polishing step.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Crest Pro-Health HD for more than a week now twice a day</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt or look more cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I love it .  </li>
            <li>What else is better than this.</li>
            <li>I found this system to be a much better alternative to whitening strips or</li>
            <li>Did i notice better morning breath?</li>
            <li>Not overly minty but still fresh, which I loved.  </li>
            <li>I probably paid more attention to the health of my teeth than ever before and have grown to realize my teeth deserve the attention.  </li>
            <li>I have to say, I didn&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>I just love not having that fuzzy feeling on my teeth.....</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d love for this to work</li>
            <li>Overall very impressed with the product for the price.</li>
            <li>and it added more whitening for sure.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t felt any sensitivity on my gums or teeth for using it, but the box does warn that it can happen, I love it and will keep on using it, maybe longer use will get better results in the whiting department</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Let me start off saying that this is probably a fantastic product for SOMEONE ELSE!  </li>
            <li>AND you brush more, which is also better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The flavors aren&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Some toothpastes can be overwhelming with the mint flavor</li>
            <li>I also really love the way my teeth feel after.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I got this product free as a BzzAgent to try!</li>
            <li>I would also like for it to have more of a minty taste.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure and read the directions in the package, as I get the impression if you don&#x27;t follow that, it won&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and can&#x27;t believe the results.</li>
            <li>Love the way this works.</li>
            <li>I like to cook a lot, and when I make something at home, I always think that it tastes better because I put all of that work into making it myself.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>even more so, my teeth have never felt cleaner.</li>
            <li>I was glad that I could try out the Crest Pro Health HD two step system for BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>I made sure not to rinse my mouth in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Been many, many months now</li>
            <li>I mentioned the Crest Pro Health HD cleaning system and she was very impressed with the results after only one month.  </li>
            <li>The whole process takes about 4-5 minutes and my mouth feels great for hours.  </li>
            <li>: The two step process forces me to spend more time brushing my teeth, instead of rushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the results weren&#x27;t as prominent.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take any more time out of my brushing routine to use.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to receive my free Smiley360 kit for the Crest Pro-health HD.</li>
            <li>I would expect to see an even more noticeable difference the longer</li>
            <li>for whiter teeth, her teeth seem to have responded better than mine.  </li>
            <li>I do feel that my teeth and gums look and feel healthy, I just which sensitivity was not a side effect.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the flavor of the Step 1 toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use the product for another month and then I will be able to tell you if my teeth look whiter.</li>
            <li>I love how coffee and tea stains don&#x27;t even appear anymore.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I had an opportunity to try this product...</li>
            <li>I love fruits</li>
            <li>and we have to say that we absolutely love how this product leaves our teeth feeling.  </li>
            <li>AND I now have whiter, brighter, cleaner teeth and better smelling</li>
            <li>But I was so pleased when my spouse noticed the change.  </li>
            <li>I am a smoker, coffee drinker, and love soda</li>
            <li>I used it for a week straight and felt great about the shade of white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I love that I can use Crest ProHealth HD to brighten up my teeth on any given day</li>
            <li>I was able to sample this 2 step toothpaste through bzzagent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like the two step process of brushing.  </li>
            <li>and I thought this one probably wouldn&#x27;t be any better</li>
            <li>This is what I&#x27;m most pleased about</li>
            <li>, I received this for free, and am now a convert to the HD Two-Step Toothpaste by Crest!</li>
            <li>The two step process doesn&#x27;t take much more time -- you do step 1, spit without rinsing, and then do step 2.</li>
            <li>I love that this is a pro health and whitening in one.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t notice anything off-putting now and love that it has whitened my teeth.</li>
            <li>and I am smiling with more confidence.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use for a couple more months in hopes that they do.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the feeling after using this product.</li>
            <li>Bzz Agent Opinionated here, with the latest on Crest Pro Health® HD™.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really glad I had the opportunity to try it.  </li>
            <li>My teeth have a nice smooth surface as well.</li>
            <li>Step 2 was a lot better.  </li>
            <li>Ok so im a bzz agent.  </li>
            <li>I did appreciate the flip top opening, though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as if having a longer process has convinced me that I need to take better care to do the tooth brushing procedure with more</li>
            <li>I love love teeth whitening products.  </li>
            <li>I felt more confident after using this toothpaste</li>
            <li>/&gt;I can recommend this to anyone and most of all, no sensitivity problems, which I was worried about too.  </li>
            <li>I was able to try this product as a BzzAgent member.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t figure out how toothpaste would be able to whiten my teeth in a week.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste makes your teeth and gums feel so much better, cleaner and healthier.</li>
            <li>This paste tastes great, freshens your mouth, and makes everything feel super clean.  </li>
            <li>I was able to review this product courtesy of Crest.</li>
            <li>I love this system.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to but another whitening product any more</li>
            <li>I love the Crest Pro Health HD that I received free from Crest through BzzAgent to try!  </li>
            <li>They are better at removing the surface staining.</li>
            <li>because I wasnt sure if I could brush with my tongue and the roof of my mouth with the Pro-Health ...</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Also I didn&#x27;t take a before picture so there may be more of a change, but I just didn&#x27;t notice since it was gradual.  </li>
            <li>Love the Crest HD.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about my coffee or favorite garlicky foods lingering on my breathe</li>
            <li>ok, they want to scrub the tartar and stains away.</li>
            <li>not so good:&lt;br /&gt;My gums where I use the product in step 2, which is the front area of my top and bottom teeth</li>
            <li>I like the separation of the tooth care and whitening; it feels like it is more specialized.</li>
            <li>Her smile is already perfect, so she doesn&#x27;t need much help.</li>
            <li>Her smile is already perfect, so she doesn&#x27;t need much help.</li>
            <li>and I love this product so much more than I ever imagined that I would.</li>
            <li>I read the instructions on the box to make sure that I was using the toothpaste correctly and gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use it, and hope that over more time the whitening effects will improve.</li>
            <li>After using it now for two weeks, i can safely say that it somewhat helps in keeping my teeth whiter.</li>
            <li>If nothing else, I&#x27;m glad that Pro-Health HD made me realize this.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>I am always glad it is over.</li>
            <li>I did receive a free sample but will continue to buy!</li>
            <li>I love the way that my teeth look and feel.  </li>
            <li>and i am always changing up the toothpaste i buy to see if i can find something better and better.</li>
            <li>i did receive this product to try for free, but the reviews that i am sharing are all my own.</li>
            <li>Most whitening toothpasts will do that.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I always feel confident after brushing with this product - fresher breath, and whiter teeth.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind not being able to rinse my mouth out between steps, but it did bother me that I would brush my tongue after Step 1, and then have to rinse my toothbrush before Step 2 (which I feel like would defeat the purpose of not rinsing - it wiped out most of the residue</li>
            <li>results were fantastic!  </li>
            <li>enjoyed the taste.</li>
            <li>taste, although I prefer a more &amp;#34;Minty Taste&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure under a microscope</li>
            <li>You will find this with most whitening products.</li>
            <li>and I love this product.</li>
            <li>I was able to try a free sample of Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste and I really liked the results I saw.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that my morning breath seemed better</li>
            <li>but I love the way my mouth felt after using it.</li>
            <li>The two minutes each morning and night helped me establish a better routine.</li>
            <li>Enjoyable.</li>
            <li>but I must say this is phenomenal  </li>
            <li>Overall impressed by the time I have to put in and the job that this product does.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I have it and plan on rebuying as soon as I can.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many tooth whiteners before.  </li>
            <li>I think this product is ok</li>
            <li>I love to drink tea, coffee, and wine...</li>
            <li>My teeth feel healthy and they look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for good plaque control, cavity control, fresh breath and whitening all in one product.</li>
            <li>I love Crest Pro Health HD.  </li>
            <li>I was able to tolerate the taste for the 1 minute that it takes to brush</li>
            <li>Mostly I like the toothpaste, but there are a couple of things I dislike.  </li>
            <li>I understand some people will love a product and others will say eh.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>so I made sure I scheduled a cleaning before even opening the box.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m looking forward to the results with the end of the tubes :)</li>
            <li>You get the same tingling as you do from the strips and equally as impressive results.</li>
            <li>I love my coffee, which does a number on teeth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know for sure if it worked, but it sure felt like it did.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure my teeth were whiter but</li>
            <li>However, it may have more to do with the extended brushing.</li>
            <li>After six days of using both tubes twice a day, I can tell you my teeth were whiter and better yet</li>
            <li>But it does require more time.</li>
            <li>I am able to use Crest Pro Health HD twice a day with no issues.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I believed using two products would make a difference...</li>
            <li>and I have to say I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use the product to see if there is any more change in shade.  </li>
            <li>I would like to thank Crest ant BzzAgent for the opportunity to try this :-)</li>
            <li>I am used to a more pronounced flavor of toothpaste, but when I tried this the flavor was more mellow</li>
            <li>I love that the whitening is part of a system because it&#x27;s easier to make into a habit.  </li>
            <li>It takes some adjusting since I&#x27;m not used to having 2 tubes and taking more time to brush.  </li>
            <li>Got this as a free trial from Crest then also bought another on my own so my wife could use it.  </li>
            <li>It seems to have done the job better than all of those combined.</li>
            <li>This product is better than most I have tried</li>
            <li>and I love the results.  </li>
            <li>I cannot speak on the gingivitis as well as I have healthy teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>, there are also many more benefits to this product than the whitening.</li>
            <li>sure does what it promises.  </li>
            <li>I told my husband it was OK for him to try it out instead of me - he asked me, I didn&#x27;t ask him BTW.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed, however, if my teeth are whiter, so I might give the product more time to see if I can notice a difference.</li>
            <li>I love most about the 2 part system</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>To me, I love the taste.</li>
            <li>Tube number 2 is cumbersome and needs a flip top cap like tube number 1.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>And, the best part is, it doesn&#x27;t take any extra time!</li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve never tried this on my own without getting this for free to test out through Bzzagent.  </li>
            <li>but I took a star off because I felt that this would have been better if step 2</li>
            <li>Maybe it will take some more time.  </li>
            <li>I got to try this for free, but these opinions are my own.  </li>
            <li>This is a 2 step process, which i was like, ugh, who has time in the morning for one more thing.  </li>
            <li>, I received the product free as part of a promotion from Crest!</li>
            <li>The teeth cleansing system is an interesting experience.</li>
            <li>Its an OK product, I would say if you want to try it once and see for yourself go ahead</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up more of your time, but there are habits that need to be adjusted.</li>
            <li>I have been complemented on my whiter teeth, and my favorite benefit is having fresher breathe when I wake up each morning.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad to have the opportunity to try the product before buying.</li>
            <li>: Make sure to spit and rinse since there’s a warning on the container not to swallow the gel.</li>
            <li>I am pleased to tell you that since trying out this product I have noticed a change in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li>After about a week of brushing - I noticed that my teeth were indeed whiter. :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Brushing twice vs whitening strips is much more convenient to me.</li>
            <li>Love this product though and it will by toothpaste system from here on out.</li>
            <li>they even became more polished.</li>
            <li>I love the way my teeth feel now.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclosure I got a free trial of this product from Crest, but my review is entirely my own opinion.</li>
            <li>After all, whitening your teeth can take time, and I wanted to make sure I could see any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Love that feeling.</li>
            <li>However, the greatest thing is that the whitening actually works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit that I haven&#x27;t been 100% diligent using this at every opportunity, but I will say that somehow the &amp;#34;two tube&amp;#34; system that they have makes me more encouraged to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li>but i love it.</li>
            <li>I used to brush my teeth in 15 seconds and be done, now i consciencely take two minutes and as a result take better care of my teeth.</li>
            <li>I think I could have had better results with just a day or two of WhiteStrips.</li>
            <li>love Crest.</li>
            <li>I love that this toothpaste provides me with cleaner and whiter teeth without having to pay hundreds of dollars to my dentist.</li>
            <li>I also did notice my teeth are whiter, this is not drastic and though my husband noticed, it might just have been because he was looking for it &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>The two step process encourages me to brush more thoroughly and for a longer time, which has to help with dental health.</li>
            <li>Although I was provided a free sample of this product in exchange for my candid opinion, I will say that In the seventh grade I did a toothpaste research project for my science class testing all brands of toothpaste.</li>
            <li>time you&#x27;re at Target Walgreens or Walmart- pop it in your cart and give it a shot :-)</li>
            <li>You would think that a 2-step program would require more time brushing but this system doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how it was going to work.</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks I noticed even more results.</li>
            <li>I am so impressed with the fact that it only takes two minutes twice a day.  </li>
            <li>its actually whitening my teeth and its awesome!</li>
            <li>The whitening gel tastes a bit like peroxide, but since you are using it on your brush without rinsing, the taste of the toothpaste masks most of the yucky taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>There is not too much more to say except just brush your teeth &amp;#34;twice&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I love the product and am so glad I had the chance to try it.</li>
            <li>I hear about a product with magical claims, and dismiss them as marketing &amp;#34;mumbo jumbo&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>But, I am pleased to say that their claims are sincere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not because they are putting me up to anything or rewarding me in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to say I love this product and saw an improvement within 4 days of using it.</li>
            <li>had I been able to continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>but I think it would take some more time for anything visible.</li>
            <li>I got this Crest HD kit free through Bzzagent!</li>
            <li>I am glad I did not spend money on this.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using the Crest Pro Health HD product.</li>
            <li>I love Crest for all there products, and this did not disappoint.</li>
            <li>It came in perfect time, since I was already planning to get the white teeth strips.</li>
            <li>The one improvement I would suggest is making the cap on product 2 a flip top as the cap is on product 2 -</li>
            <li>I wanted to be sure about the whitening aspect</li>
            <li>Plus the two tubes take up more space in my medicine cabinet.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the way this system makes my mouth feel.</li>
            <li>This is a warning that Crest has listed, so I know many consumers experience this reaction.</li>
            <li>My mouth has only shed 1 the surface layer once, which is the best I&#x27;ve experience since the whitening craze took over the toothpaste aisle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried SO many of them.  </li>
            <li>and the gel smooths everything over; both are refreshingly minty.  </li>
            <li>I really love the product, but I take one star off for two reason:  </li>
            <li>do love the taste.</li>
            <li>So, yes, the Crest Pro Health® HD™ _did_ whiten my teeth as promised - not dramatically, but I think with extended usage, the whitening would become more</li>
            <li>I am pleased that Crest continues to develop ever improved product offering.</li>
            <li>The packaging of step two wasn&#x27;t much better.</li>
            <li>If it weren&#x27;t for the packaging I would love this product, but the packaging makes me unsure I&#x27;d want to continue to purchase.</li>
            <li>and I love this product.</li>
            <li>To top it off, I just went in for my semi-annual cleaning today and my hygienist commented on the lack of tartar and staining on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>What I love most is that polished feeling</li>
            <li>It would just make it more convenient for the consumer.</li>
            <li>You will love the way your teeth feel like you visited the Denitist</li>
            <li>and you will love the results.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love anything I can use that</li>
            <li>I also make sure I get every portion of my mouth, so I work in quadrants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re a better dental patient than I am, you&#x27;re probably already brushing for two minutes.</li>
            <li>My dentist will be pleased, I&#x27;m sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>if you absolutely love drooling on yourself.  </li>
            <li>I honestly cannot notice any huge difference in whiteness.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t agree 100% because the act of brushing it around your teeth and gums seems like more focused coverage to me.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to go back to the dentist because I KNOW that they will be impressed with how healthy my teeth and gums are.</li>
            <li>he bottom of the toothbrush) in combination with the toothpaste and found much better results and faster results.</li>
            <li>I could tell more of a difference with this than whitestrips.</li>
            <li>Wish the results were more striking faster.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was an ok product - my teeth were whiter</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>Honestly, if I had not have been given this for free to try, then I probably would not have bought this.</li>
            <li>I truly love this and have been telling everyone about it.</li>
            <li>Love that I can kill two birds with one stone - whiten without sacrificing a quality brush.</li>
            <li>I am so impressed with the product, the second day I used it my husband asked me what I was doing.  </li>
            <li>My teeth have mostly been stained from coffee, I don&#x27;t smoke or drink.  </li>
            <li>I feel more confident smiling in pictures now.</li>
            <li>This is now my favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Interesting product.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>I am noticing that over time they are looking much better, too.</li>
            <li>In addition to the whitening, this is a notable product for cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It would make it a lot more convenient.</li>
            <li>Love the Crest Pro Health that I received from Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li>I do like getting a better quality whitener from just a toothpaste versus using strips though.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>, Let&#x27;s try one more time&#x27;</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love this process much better.  </li>
            <li>so I see the need to brush more often.</li>
            <li>but like i said your teeth feel better and cleaner when you use it</li>
            <li>The step 2 paste was really interesting.  </li>
            <li>I was able to try this product through Bzzagent.  </li>
            <li>The taste wasn&#x27;t my favorite</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not terrible.  </li>
            <li>I will admit, I love having cleen teeth.</li>
            <li>I got the opportunity to sample the Crest ProHealth HD for free and loooove it!</li>
            <li>I got it free from Crest all for being a BzzAgent!</li>
            <li>I love this tooth paste.  </li>
            <li>I have never found a toothpaste that works better.  </li>
            <li>and I am getting more used to the taste and tingle of Step 2.  </li>
            <li>Just wish they&#x27;d use a sugar alcohol in place, but I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a reason.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this to someone who is looking to start a whitening regime but isn&#x27;t sure where to start.</li>
            <li>I love the way this tastes, and feels.</li>
            <li>but I love this.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my teeth feel after brushing.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more Crest Pro-Health HD when my free bottles run out!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really more like 4 1/2 stars to me.  </li>
            <li>The most important thing is that it works!  </li>
            <li>It starts to irritate my gums if I use it more than once a day.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m already watching the timer to make sure I&#x27;m brushing thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>, if you spend just a moment reading the label on the toothpaste, this interesting gem comes up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, the separate steps produce a better result.</li>
            <li>I love going to the dentist, and my mouth feels like I have been to the dentist every time I use it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure how to do the routine.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should stick with the 2 minutes between the 2 toothpastes or add 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I decided I was over thinking &#x3D;) and just did each toothpaste for 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you Crest for letting me try Crest Pro Health HD for free!</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I was asked to try this product for free!</li>
            <li>Thank you Crest for allowing me to try the product for free!</li>
            <li>The results after just a couple days of use were fantastic!</li>
            <li>through BzzAgent, I could already tell it would become my favorite toothpaste ever</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I used this for a couple of weeks before writing a review.</li>
            <li>While I did not see my teeth lighten by 6 shades as promised, they are noticeably smoother and more polished, and have that &amp;#34;I just came from the dentist&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li>I have been extremely pleased by this product and would recommend it highly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>did receive this product for free to review from Crest through Bzz Agent, but my opinion is my own.</li>
            <li>After two weeks use, my mouth felt better than before.</li>
            <li>And it was more than the whiteness; it felt healthier and clearer.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried it</li>
            <li>After a couple more days, the numbness went away.  </li>
            <li>I was glad I did.</li>
            <li>And they were even more noticeably whiter after one week.</li>
            <li>Not only does it do an awesome job by whitening my teeth, it feels good and leaves my mouth feeling fresh and healthy.</li>
            <li>My teeth, that is :)</li>
            <li>Honestly,not sure if I would purchase this product yet,</li>
            <li>and I would love to continue using this product</li>
            <li>I woke up in the morning with NO horrible morning breath taste in my mouth!</li>
            <li>Yeah, my teeth seem more white/brighter than a week ago.  </li>
            <li>The taste is good and as i have already mentioned, it makes my mouth feel fresh and cleaner for a longer time than</li>
            <li>But I would surely recommend using it once for sure.</li>
            <li>This even made my fianc&amp;eacute; have to use it :)  </li>
            <li>I thought this would be more time consuming</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m much more used to the routine.</li>
            <li>Received this product for free in the mail by the Smiley program!</li>
            <li>Much better now.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t love stannous fluoride.</li>
            <li>I just prefer one step, but this is a refreshing paste.  </li>
            <li>It takes more time without the added benefit of making my teeth any whiter.</li>
            <li>The dentist did notice that my gums were in better shape.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I tested it for 1 week then compared a before and after to see if their claim of &amp;#34;6x healther teeth &amp; 6x whiter teeth in 1 week&amp;#34; was an accurate claim, and I can honestly say I feel like I got an even better result than that.  </li>
            <li>I really love the way this feels after i use both steps.</li>
            <li>I would buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this for the last two weeks and am very impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>and I loved the minty fresh breath.</li>
            <li>And as an added bonus makes my breath so much better.</li>
            <li>Not any more.</li>
            <li>My breath has never been better.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>Crest even let me try it out for free through BzzAgent!</li>
            <li>This gel tastes more like a product from the dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>In my experience, those strips whitened my teeth faster and more noticeably.  </li>
            <li>This Pro Health HD product seems to me better at reducing stains or maintaining whiteness than whitening itself.  </li>
            <li>As I have found most whitening systems do not work.</li>
            <li>But I fell in love with the crest 2 step system.  </li>
            <li>and I’m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>and I never seemed to be able to follow through on those to get them to work well.  </li>
            <li>I read the directions, which I am glad I did, because you use the step 1 for a minute (the fluoride toothpaste to protect against cavities &amp; gingivitis)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not quite sure what the advantages are yet.</li>
            <li>This product seemed interesting.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use it to see if there is an improved whiteness with more time.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did because I would have never thought that I needed a 2 step cleaning process for healthier teeth.</li>
            <li>Anyways, the 2 step process feels clinical and it does take a bit more time and effort, but when I do it, I feel a bit like a dentist.</li>
            <li>This is an interesting product.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE it.</li>
            <li>As my hubby said more kissable now.  </li>
            <li>Sure- strips work</li>
            <li>I have yet to see outstanding results</li>
            <li>okay I guess.</li>
            <li>and yea you may have to devote a couple of more minutes to your tooth-brushing routine</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more Crest [HD].  </li>
            <li>I was given the opportunity to try out and review the Crest Pro-Health HD Two Step product and am extremely glad I was given this opportunity by Crest.</li>
            <li>Another benefit was it was a product from Crest which is a brand I have enjoyed using in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She enjoyed the product and would recommend it for this reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was hoping for better whitening capabilities, but would recommend using it if you want cleaner, healthier teeth.joyed the product and would recommend it for this reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was hoping for better whitening capabilities, but would recommend using it if you want cleaner, healthier teeth.</li>
            <li>but my results continued to get better.</li>
            <li>guess this is okay .&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>$6 for this , -I can&#x27;t complain . :)</li>
            <li>I love feeling cleen teeth.</li>
            <li>but that is ok</li>
            <li>/&gt;The taste is good, leaves you with fresh breathe that lasts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t control how sunny it was though, so brightness may differ :)</li>
            <li>I am smiling so much more because my teeth look better than in years.</li>
            <li>I was sent this toothpaste system for free from Crest and BzzAgent and was asked to write a review, which is my own opinion of the product.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am impressed!</li>
            <li>I wish both tubes were flip top.  </li>
            <li>The thing I love most about this toothpaste is that it feels like I visited the dentist office for a cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think my mouth has ever been this healthy.  </li>
            <li>I have a dentist check up at the end of July, and I fully anticipate my hygienist to comment on how much better my mouth and teeth are.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much more time to whiten when you&#x27;re already brushing vs doing whitening strips or whitening trays</li>
            <li>However, I still enjoyed using the toothpaste and will probably be buying more.</li>
            <li>I can lick the top of my teeth, and they have a polished feel to them that I also have when leaving the dentist office.</li>
            <li>Those will be the times I make sure to stock up on this toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>Those will be the times I make sure to stock up on this toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I got the opportunity to try this product out for free and let me tell you I don&#x27;t regret trying this one out!  </li>
            <li>THIS IS MUCH BETTER THAN DEALING WITH WHITENING STRIPS.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a smooth gel that polishes the teeth, it also has a nice taste.</li>
            <li>The taste of the Crest Pro Health HD is not quite a minty as some I&#x27;ve tried, but It seems like the fresh taste lasts longer and my mouth feels really good.  </li>
            <li>I got to try this free as a promotional sample review from Crest but opinions are all my own.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesnt take up any more time during my toothbrushing routine.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product free from crest on bzzagent!  </li>
            <li>teeth love this</li>
            <li>It only bothered me if I happen to be in a rush, but otherwise, the product is GREAT!</li>
            <li>Flip top, use, close top.  </li>
            <li>My teenaged daughter and myself love it, too.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using this product.  </li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt or looked better.</li>
            <li>and they are already looking whiter! :)</li>
            <li>You use the cleanser and brush your teeth for one minute  and spit when the time is done (dont rinse) and then use the perfecting gel and brush your teeth for one more minute.</li>
            <li>and I love the way they feel after I use this stuff.</li>
            <li>I always taken the best care possible for my mouth.</li>
            <li>My favorite part of this product....</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not feeling the love.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased to be selected to try this kit from BzzAgent as it&#x27;s not something</li>
            <li>Been using Crest for most of my life...</li>
            <li>one more day before I quit using it.</li>
            <li>I do think my teeth look whiter and for sure they feel way healthy and better.</li>
            <li>packaging is compact, sleek and stylish.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love a product that whitens teeth</li>
            <li>After a minute I was able to spit and rinse.  </li>
            <li>after one minute, spit (DO NOT RINSE) and then use the perfecting gel and brush your teeth for one more minute).</li>
            <li>Its important to note that Step 1 you brush for 1 minute and then DON&#x27;T RINSE!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will be purchasing this product over and over as I just love the simplicity of it.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more for my family and myself once our sample runs out .</li>
            <li>I wish that it had more of a minty flavor.  </li>
            <li>If I floss before, my gums are more tender.  </li>
            <li>I will def be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure it was whitening my teeth - they almost look like they were turning green-ish.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to tell if they are whiter yet</li>
            <li>More complication is not what I am looking for in morning or bedtime routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>From my research also found it had more anti-microbial properties.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>I did receive a free product for the purpose of my review and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>I have tried many whitening systems, and.</li>
            <li>I received this system through a sampling site for free, but my opinions are all my own.</li>
            <li>After using the system, I was very happy that no such residue occurred.</li>
            <li>I was sure to give this a try.</li>
            <li>I do love the product.</li>
            <li>I am a bzzagent, which means I get to try products for free and share my honest opinions.  </li>
            <li>The instructions are to brush teeth for one minute with tube 1 paste, spit but do not rinse, brush for one more minute with tube 2 paste, and then spit and rinse.  </li>
            <li>Will finish the tube and post more pics.</li>
            <li>With that said, if you are expecting a bright glowing white smile, this probably is not the best product for that.  </li>
            <li>Give it a try and see for yourself how wonderful this daily system truly is!</li>
            <li>love this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Perhaps after continuous use, I will see better results.  </li>
            <li>Then the whiting/polish step can work it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li>It can be more concentrated and get everywhere</li>
            <li>Having the whitener separate lets it work better</li>
            <li>My teeth felt smooth and polished immediately, and after a week I have noticed that they are whiter too!  </li>
            <li>My teeth did look good for what that&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>I saw a bit more whitening after three uses,  </li>
            <li>I drink a lot of coffee and after using the product my teeth looked noticeably whiter to me, but I asked my wife just to make sure.</li>
            <li>The more I used it, the stronger the sensation.</li>
            <li>Now, I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>i love it -</li>
            <li>I am happy to report that my teeth look a lot brighter thanks to this kit.</li>
            <li>and I am planning to continue this regimen for a longer period of time to get more benefits from it.</li>
            <li>I received this free product to try and give review, Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>The whitening strips were always a pain to use, so I thought this would be more convenient.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also not at all inconvenienced by the amount of time it takes to use this product as it does not need any more time than we should already be giving when brushing our teeth.</li>
            <li>No doubt will result in a healthy mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>what most pleases me is that the whitening effect is immediate.</li>
            <li>You brush for 1 minute with the step 1 purifying cleanser, spit, and brush for 1 more minute with the step 2 purifying gel.  </li>
            <li>On top of that, stannous fluoride can also help to address tooth sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li>That said, I wasn&#x27;t expecting to see any more of a change in the whiteness of my teeth...</li>
            <li>I love this system.  </li>
            <li>It claims to do a better job at cleaning plaque, fighting cavities and gingivitis, and whitening teeth.</li>
            <li>Where it is supposed to differ is that it is supposed to reduce existing gingivitis and whiten more over three weeks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s making me be more deliberate about my brushing</li>
            <li>His teeth have much more yellowing.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t too sure I would like the Crest Pro-Health since it&#x27;s a mint flavored experience.  </li>
            <li>the taste is really, really refreshing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that much better.  </li>
            <li>I experienced sensitivity, my gums were very tender</li>
            <li>This is more than toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I was incredibly pleased.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll run out of Step 2 before Step 1, at which point I&#x27;ll throw Step 1 away.</li>
            <li>I picture the Crest executives wondering how to make more money off of what that they already produce.</li>
            <li>Many people forget about oral health</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this duo that I received from Crest to try for free to review!  </li>
            <li>: I did receive this for free for review purposes and this is my honest opinion about this product.</li>
            <li>The product itself is ok.  </li>
            <li>Okay, there are plenty of whitening toothpastes out there, so</li>
            <li>Much more so than trays and strips.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed using this product, but did have some reservations.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received this and love the way it works.  </li>
            <li>My smile was bright in the millions of wedding photos in which I had to partake.  </li>
            <li>Crest really did a great job with this product.  </li>
            <li>The product has lasted me all this time, and still many more brushes to go.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I need to give it more time to work, as I&#x27;m halfway through each tube.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more than tolerable.</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Love the packaging, love the taste, don&#x27;t even mind the two step process one</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>Glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s even better is I #GotItFree.</li>
            <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve tried a number of whitening products, some that work, but many, many more that don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The minty-ness always leaves my mouth feeling great afterwards, too, which is really what I&#x27;m looking for out of any toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I was also glad that I didn&#x27;t notice any sensitivity caused by this product.</li>
            <li>They should have made that bottle with a flip top like they did the toothpaste bottle.</li>
            <li>Prior to using this I used Crest Pro-Health toothpaste and was very happy with it.</li>
            <li>but somehow they got deleted from my phone).&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all this product is okay.  </li>
            <li>Crest is my favorite brand of toothpaste</li>
            <li>I am assuming it was working its magic.  </li>
            <li>I honestly did not notice a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s plausible.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>My dentist will be pleased to see me</li>
            <li>I feel that the teeth whitening strips do a better job for that.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d say this is better).</li>
            <li>Taste- Not my favorite but tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I got this as a free sample from BzzAgent and would not purchase this on my own once my sample runs out.</li>
            <li>they are smooth all day, even after I eat!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While this product is great and actually really does work, there are some negatives that I will address:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product because #1 it works, and #2</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I can say I&#x27;ve ever really enjoyed brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>I love the tingling/tightness I feel in my gums after step 1, and my teeth appear whiter as well.  </li>
            <li>My teeth were not terribly discolored to begin with, so maybe it works well for those people.</li>
            <li>I was able to try it through the survey site im on bzzagent.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>Works as it States it does but needs a sensitivity treatment added and a better flavor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products for teeth whitening but many do not work because they require that you put paste or a strip on your teeth.</li>
            <li>After trying the product for now 4 weeks, I am glad I received this sample</li>
            <li>It is definitely more convenient than the strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I was sure to always do a minute per step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never been able to replicate that feeling.  </li>
            <li>I made sure not to rinse my mouth in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product as part of thr promotion for the brand, but I love it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad i took the time and followed the 2-step process - I made sure I kept it up and used it as it was designed.</li>
            <li>But I opted to give this a shot, as I truly would love whiter teeth without the cost of having it done at the dentist.  </li>
            <li>It helped me to pay more attention to these spots</li>
            <li>I will be using again :)</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I got into Bzzagent and got a free sample of Crest Pro Health HD!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been letting my husband use it until I found out that I could get more :)</li>
            <li>I was able to receive this toothpaste as part of a promotion</li>
            <li>I have to say that when I received the package  and saw that there were two products and two steps, I felt like it was going to make brushing my teeth more of a production and take longer than I had time for.  </li>
            <li>The polishing paste is where I think the magic happens.  </li>
            <li>Love that it doesn&#x27;t add any time to my routine.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the result as well as I can definitely see a difference in my teeth appearance.</li>
            <li>a nutshell, if you use this product you spend an extra minute brushing, but the results are impressive.</li>
            <li>I received this kit free from BzzAgent for honest opinion.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s more to carry around when traveling and more times to setup/</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d also like to note that I think the color on my teeth looks a bit more even (</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d also like to note that I think the color on my teeth looks a bit more even (</li>
            <li>My teeth feel healthy but they also look healthier.</li>
            <li>Now I pay more attention and make sure I brush for 1 minute using step 1 and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Convenience: Not so much... it would be great if this product were combined into one gel.  </li>
            <li>Was ok but not something I&#x27;d recommend or advise against...</li>
            <li>I am totally in love with the effects of this dental cleaning system.  </li>
            <li>I love the ease of use every morning.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be purchasing more when my sample runs out.</li>
            <li>I love that it ensures I don&#x27;t rush when I brush, so my teeth ALWAYS feel cleaner - even when I am falling asleep while brushing.</li>
            <li>Hey, free toothpaste!</li>
            <li>The packaging colors pop at you and had a sparkle that was appealing to me.  </li>
            <li>I drink tea and coffee every day, and I was able to notice visible whitening after a day&#x27;s brushing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I thought that maybe there was finally a simple (although a bit pricey) way to get impressive whitening + cleaning results in no time at all.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to use it more than a couple days because of the pain on my gums</li>
            <li>many wats</li>
            <li>I will for sure continue to use the product until it is gone.</li>
            <li>I felt it most noticeably on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the way this product whitened my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I found that part of the product to be more time consuming than I would have preferred.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this 2 Step system.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It cleans teeth better than any toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>and it felt refreshing.</li>
            <li>I would advise a mouthwash follow up for sure.</li>
            <li>Most people don&#x27;t brush for the recommended two minutes.  </li>
            <li>I received a free trial of this system from Crest, and I am so thankful I gave it a try!  </li>
            <li>It took some convincing to get my husband to agree to using the 2 paste system but he has been compliant.</li>
            <li>but since I was able to convince my husband to do it</li>
            <li>I received this product for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since there was not a lot of discoloration, I was hoping for much better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m really pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I found myself touching my teeth with my tongue all day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a Sonicare toothbrush for many years now</li>
            <li>but I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Was given this  product for free to try and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>but I feel like my teeth look better after using it for a week.</li>
            <li>I like using this two step system better than teeth whitening trays.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample through Smiley360, however the opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>I love the way that my teeth feel after my two minute brush and polish.  </li>
            <li>There was a noticeable whitening of my teeth after about a week and even more so after two weeks.  </li>
            <li>Because of this, I am always on the lookout for better oral hygiene products.</li>
            <li>and I really wanted to like this product because it sounded great</li>
            <li>and I love whitening toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE this product I love</li>
            <li>and I love the Texture.</li>
            <li>One tip I have would be to be sure not to rinse before using step 2.</li>
            <li>This cleared up after a bit, but I&#x27;m sure that something like this varies from person to person.</li>
            <li>I have been using home whitening kits/products off and on for the better part of 15 years.</li>
            <li>I have found that, like most things, some worked well, and others flopped.</li>
            <li>I gave it an OK</li>
            <li>Will definitely continue using Crest Pro Health HD and am happy to change my brushing habits from here on out!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this 2-step Crest Pro-Health HD works for some people, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>By the time it was two weeks, it was prominent difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not a hard process and probably my own issue, but in the spirit of being completely honest that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m at with the toothpaste!</li>
            <li>My teeth feel incredibly clean and are many shades whiter!  </li>
            <li>I was very excited when I was able to test this product (for free!)</li>
            <li>The taste is fine for both steps, but it&#x27;s just very mild, which I suppose is good for people who don&#x27;t like a strong mint taste.</li>
            <li>I happily returned to my normal toothpaste, and I will not keep Crest HD in my medicine cabinet!  </li>
            <li>I got my Crest Pro Heath HD sample for free from Crest via BzzAgent  and was so excited to try this!!</li>
            <li>the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;second step is good too...... very strong bleaching agent as you certainly feel a burn in your mouth.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt smooth and I loved the minty fresh breath!</li>
            <li>I tried this toothpaste free, thanks to Crest, and I loved it!</li>

            <li>It does a great job of giving you a fresh from the dentist clean feeling, but the whitening?</li>
            <li>The toothpaste tastes great, your breath smell kissably fresh, and makes your teeth feel dentist office clean.</li>
            <li>Now, who doesn’t want to have that great, fresh, and clean feeling every time they brush their teeth?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really love the clean feeling after using the paste and its so nice and convenient that the whitener is included.</li>
            <li>In addition to the results, the taste is refreshing and my mouth feels very clean.</li>
            <li>I wish the flavor was better, my teeth feel very clean after I brush, but I do not have that minty feeling in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>After use my mouth and teeth feel better and very clean - and the feeling lasts for a while.</li>
            <li>The fact they did notice was very exciting!  </li>

            <li>I was very excited to see how this 2 step toothpaste would stack up.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive the CrestProHealth HD two-step system from BuzzAgentto</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how clean my teeth feel after a night of falling asleep and not brushing....</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product that gives you a clean like never before.</li>
            <li>You just have to add this to your normal brushing routine, and I have experienced NO sensitivitely, and I feel like the results are more immediate</li>
            <li>It is amazing and the clean feeling lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>, I think it is good to use, the results are not as good as the general toothpaste brush and comfort.</li>
            <li>My teeth honestly feel so clean after I use this product.  </li>
            <li>There’s almost a afterglow where my teeth feel nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>* Leaves my teeth nice and clean</li>
            <li>The two-step process to brushing is really nice, and it helps focus on spending the required amount of time brushing to get my teeth really clean.  </li>
            <li>I liked the feeling of clean while brushing.</li>
            <li>The most remarkable thing I noticed was that my teeth felt much cleaner use this toothpaste compared to another toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I have also noticed that my mouth still feels clean in the morning, which is so nice.  </li>
            <li>The positive aspect was that my teeth did feel especially clean after brushing, which lasted until I woke up in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this great duo.</li>
            <li>It is a very easy process and the product tastes great and leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean, almost as clean as after a visit to the dentist.  </li>

            <li>Fast easy and great minty taste.</li>
            <li>The Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste System is so easy to use and very effective!!  </li>
            <li>This is a pain for me because Step one has an easy flip top and Step two has a twist top.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that is worth a try and lucky for me</li>
            <li>An excellent, easy way to whiten daily!</li>
            <li>The Smooth Mint flavor is pleasant and your mouth remains feeling fresh for hours.</li>
            <li>Had pleasant taste and made my teeth feel super clean.  </li>
            <li>I was very impressed with how it immediately left my breath feeling strongly minty.  </li>
            <li>After about three weeks, I&#x27;m starting to see some solid results (photo isn&#x27;t very good, but I think my teeth look great!).</li>
            <li>This toothpaste leaves your mouth feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels very clean and I feel as though I wake up with a cleaner mouth.  </li>
            <li>My teeth were noticeably whiter, and my mouth felt very clean.  </li>
            <li>and my teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li>It also feels very clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel very clean.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my teeth and mouth feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>It made my teeth feel very clean and</li>
            <li>teeth felt very clean after this 2 step process.</li>
            <li>After using both pastes I felt that my mouth was very clean and my teeth also looked brighter.  </li>
            <li>and it makes my mouth feel very clean after using it</li>
            <li>My mouth felt very clean.</li>
            <li>I felt like it didn&#x27;t leave my teeth feeling very clean -</li>
            <li>The cleaning paste does an excellent job of getting that morning and evening scummy feeling off my teeth, while the polishing and whitening paste does a better job of making my teeth sparkle than others in a single tube.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy I was able to try out this product for free, thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li>:) Plus, my teeth are bright and white, which of course makes me feel good about myself.</li>
            <li>I smile even more often because my teeth have been looking better!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s actually pretty good at whitening.  </li>
            <li>your breath is pretty good this morning&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;no morning breath&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I am looking forward to it becoming available for purchase!</li>
            <li>But the step 2 toothpaste was not bad tasting, and was effective for an at home product.</li>
            <li>However, the first application of toothpaste tastes good and takes care of your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to try this product as part of a promotion from the Crest through BzzAgent and was pretty happy with it the first two weeks.</li>
            <li>It does nothing to freshen your mouth after the first step or even as a good tooth brushing would.</li>
            <li>I was pleasant with the long-lasting fresh breath in the morning as well as the clean and refreshing feel of my teeth after using this set.</li>
            <li>Step 2 is completely clear of color and whitened my teeth beautifully after Step 1 cleansed my teeth of plaque.</li>
            <li>did_ do a pretty good job of whitening, with a minimum of hassle</li>
            <li>However, I was willing to give this a try and wanted to give it a fair try.  </li>
            <li>This is the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve used in a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The flavor was pretty good.</li>
            <li>First the good.  </li>
            <li>first thing I noticed was how good the toothpaste tasted.</li>
            <li>After the first two or three day I knew I loved the minty taste of it</li>
            <li>The taste was pretty good.  </li>
            <li>The taste is pretty good and the texture as well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty good tooth brusher.</li>
            <li>Pretty good product.</li>
            <li>I was interested to see how it worked as I figured it couldn&#x27;t be as good as it claimed.</li>
            <li>Professional whitening made it easy and affordable !!!</li>
            <li>The first step is a tarter control paste that tastes great and leaves your teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited that this can help reduce/reverse gingivitis as well!</li>
            <li>Original sample came from BzzAgent!</li>
            <li>I have been using Crest Pro Health HD Toothpaste for one month now and the difference it has made in the brightness of my teeth is nothing short of remarkable!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try it!</li>
            <li>I have been using Crest Pro Health HD Toothpaste for one month now and the difference it has made in the brightness of my teeth is nothing short of remarkable!</li>
            <li>so I was excited to use this product!</li>
            <li>and I was really excited about this product!</li>
            <li>I am really excited about this product!</li>
            <li>either it&#x27;s is a great new morning routine</li>
            <li>So happy I got to try this and make this my new toothpaste.</li>
            <li>A great new product from Crest.  </li>
            <li>Im having a great time using this system that I got for free thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li>am a huge fan of this product, great toothpaste with whitening that is comparable to using strips, but so much easier.  </li>
            <li>Love it 2 steps is easy to do.</li>
            <li>After 2 days my teeth are definitely whiter, but more impressive is how clean my mouth feels.</li>
            <li>I was able to easily add this 2 step toothpaste to my morning and evening routine.  </li>
            <li>I also liked how quick and efficient it wAs</li>
            <li>So why 4 stars instead of 5 not my favorite in the taste department but easy to use.</li>
            <li>The paste had a surprisingly nice mild taste that wasn&#x27;t overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too sure about adding another step to my toothpaste routine, but it is really easy to adjust to.</li>
            <li>so it was easy for me to know when I need to switch from top to bottom on my mouth or switch toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I myself love this easy two step toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s a 2 step process, it&#x27;s easy and you are sure to see results.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and has no horrible aftertaste.</li>
            <li>, I love this product, I have cant tell you how easy it is</li>
            <li>I would use this product again, because it is so quick and effective.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s so easy to use with no strips or trays to put on.</li>
            <li>I needed something quick and effective.</li>
            <li>Nothing&#x27;s perfect, though, and I do notice that my mouth seems dry for about 30 minutes after use.  </li>
            <li>I also liked the mild minty flavor of the purifying cleanser (step 1).</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is thicker than most and doesn&#x27;t have a strong mint taste.</li>
            <li>The whitening/polishing gel was gentle on my teeth, and didn&#x27;t cause sensitivity the way trays or whitening strips do sometimes, and also had a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li>With all the claims of one toothpaste being able to clean, whiten, etc it is refreshing to see a dental care system that shows specialized products are probably better.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest, we&#x27;re able to give this toothpaste a good run at no cost.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product for free through Bzz Agent and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I loved step 2 as it made my teeth feel super clean</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product for free, and I am forever grateful!I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I got this product for free from BzzAgent and Crest, but I will definitely be buying this great product once again!he toothpaste aisle at the store!</li>
            <li>I got this product for free from BzzAgent and Crest, but I will definitely be buying this great product once again!</li>
            <li>I am a coffee and diet soda drinker, and the light brown staining seems to be disappearing more and more after every use.</li>
            <li>It thoroughly cleanses your teeth while giving you a healthy feel and white brilliant teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many commercially available tooth whiteners, including strips, gels and toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I thought it was a good product and a good whitener.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit suspicious of a tooth paste product that required 2 brushings, however, after a week of brushing with &amp;#34;Tube 1&amp;#34; then &amp;#34;Tube 2&amp;#34;, I am more than pleased at the whitening and smooth feeling on my teeth.</li>
            <li>I love that Step 1 really feels like I&#x27;m getting a good scrub like the dentist</li>
            <li>However, if you are looking for a daily way to keep your teeth looking good then this is is a good product to try.</li>
            <li>over-well worth the investment in a smile to be proud of</li>
            <li>I find the flavor to be minty and refreshing and the most important factor is that it WORKS.  </li>
            <li>I was able to snag this as a free sample thank to Crest, and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>It tastes nice, feels nice, and I absolutely feel like my teeth are cleaned.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is a great system for whitening and cleaning in the comfort of your own home.</li>
            <li>I was able to receive this product free for review and Im glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li>Healthy teeth and gums are more important.</li>
            <li>I received this free from Crest for a Bzz agent campaign and am so glad I was able to try it.</li>
            <li>Glad I was able to try this with a free promotion.</li>
            <li>So when I was able to try the CrestHD for free through a promotion from Crest, I figured I&#x27;d give one more product a try.  </li>
            <li>Not in a fakey, car-salesman kind of way, but in a real, &amp;#34;hey- you-have-nice-teeth&amp;#34; kind of way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>However, a couple days later, I was offered Crest Pro Health HD through BzzAgent for free, so I thought it was perfect timing and figured I would try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My mouth does feel fresh and clean after using the toothpaste and it has a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li>I have use a whitening system before and it was not that good, but this new Crest Pro-Heath HD whitening toothpaste and gel was very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>I was also happy that I was able to use this for the full week without the tooth pain that I had previously experienced with other whitening solutions.  </li>
            <li>Aside from whitening strips, this is the single best product I&#x27;ve found for whitening my teeth.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it makes your mouth healthy and beautiful at the same time.</li>
            <li>I received a product sample of Crest ProHealth HD from Crest and I am so happy with the results so far!</li>
            <li>The taste of both products is successfully underwhelming and leaves a clean feeling and super smooth surface to run your tongue</li>
            <li>What I liked best with this product is how long my teeth stay feeling fresh, no yuck build-up on them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy, and it tastes pretty good.  </li>
            <li>So, full disclosure, this stuff does not leave a pleasant minty fresh taste...</li>
            <li>The taste was pretty good and the process to use it twice a day was easy.</li>
            <li>These products were easy to use, tasted good, and really whitened my teeth!</li>
            <li>I actually enjoy the first step because the taste is so pleasant.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro Health® HD toothpaste works pretty good and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed was the mild taste and great feel to the system.</li>
            <li>I was very fortunate to receive this Crest Pro-Health HD whitening set free to test and review from Crest through Bzzagent.</li>
            <li>A good toothpaste that&#x27;s best qualities are whitening capability with less sensitivity and a smooth, clean feeling for your teeth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super excited to see what they will look like after a couple of weeks!!  </li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt so clean!  </li>
            <li>So Clean!</li>
            <li>2 minutes of your day is all it takes to make your teeth dentist-cleaned clean!  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s that clean!</li>
            <li>I also couldn&#x27;t believ how incredibly clean my teeth felt after just one use!  </li>
            <li>My teeth stay fresher longer and feel squeaky clean after using it with the freshest breath!  </li>
            <li>To me that is CLEAN!</li>
            <li>I almost look forward to brushing because of the flavor and the clean feel!  </li>
            <li>You wake up with your  mouth feeling as clean as it did when you went to bed!</li>
            <li>I woke up this morning and my mouth still felt clean!</li>
            <li>I was amazed that my mouth felt so clean!</li>
            <li>My mouth felt so clean, cleaner than it ever has!</li>
            <li>With this toothpaste my teeth always feel clean!</li>
            <li>and my teeth still felt clean!</li>
            <li>MY TEETH HAVE NEVER FELT THIS CLEAN AND SPARKLING!</li>
            <li>I was excited to see if this would work and be as easy as it sounds!</li>
            <li>Between the clean feeling and whitening I feel more confident and SMILE MORE!</li>
            <li>My teeth are clean though!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a couple of weeks and my teeth feel clean and whiter too!  </li>
            <li>It makes my teeth feel so clean!</li>
            <li>and with as clean as my mouth feels, I may never use Colgate again!</li>
            <li>and my teeth feel every bit as clean as they do when I&#x27;ve just had a dental cleaning!</li>
            <li>and I do not have a lot of time for myself, but I love that in 2 quick minutes I can whiten my teeth!  </li>
            <li>While it did not make my teeth significantly whiter, I was impressed by the overall feel and quality of the product.</li>
            <li>I love my new teeth!!!!!</li>
            <li>all whats a face without a clean and bright smile.</li>
            <li>The taste is good, and it makes my mouth feel fresh and clean (as does Crest Pro Health toothpaste in, um...regular definition, I guess).  </li>
            <li>HD is definitely effective at whitening and keeping teeth smooth and clean but it can irritate the mouth.</li>
            <li>I think that Crest Pro Health® HD™ is an awesome product at getting your mouth clean, while at the same time it does not work in the time-frame it boasts towards whitening.</li>
            <li>The texture of the paste and the minty freshness makes my mouth feel clean, and I notice it most with better smelling breath in the morning.</li>
            <li>What I&#x27;ve enjoyed the most is how clean my teeth feel.  </li>
            <li>I did enjoy though the nice clean feeling on my teeth after use.</li>
            <li>I have the Sonicare diamond clean and until recently I used what I though was the best toothpaste around.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, an effective, clean, smooth effect.</li>
            <li>But after using it I was really impressed how clean and white</li>
            <li>Overall I am very impressed with how clean my teeth are.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m impressed at how clean my teeth feel compared to using my regular toothpast.</li>
            <li>My teeth looked whiter and I loved the fresh clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>My favorite thing is how clean and healthy my teeth feel after cleaning them with Crest Pro Health HD.</li>
            <li>I love this two step system.my mouth feels so clean after using it.i love that it&#x27;s done from step one to finish in</li>
            <li>Instantly, my teeth feel cleaner--dentist clean would be the best way to describe it.  </li>
            <li>My mouth does feel much more clean in the morning when I wake up, so I&#x27;d wager that my breath smells better</li>
            <li>I also loved how clean my teeth felt and how fresh my breath was.</li>
            <li>and they end up very bright and white when you are done.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to use and my mouth did feel very clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>I love the results and how easy it is to get and maintain a nice, clean smile!</li>
            <li>There are two steps to the process, but it was very easy and didn&#x27;t take that much more time and well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Love the new Crest Pro Health HD , I did receive it free from Crest, but truly and honestly love it!!  </li>
            <li>Recenetly got a free sample from Crest through the awesome peeps at BuzzAgent and have been enjoying the extra clean feeling the two step process leaves.  </li>
            <li>A dazzling smile, fresh breath that lasts for hours and teeth that feel polished and so CLEAN!</li>
            <li>I love the feeling of the first step as it foams up and works to remove plaque - it kind of reminds me of scrubbing our tub clean!</li>
            <li>I was even more thrilled with the results; my teeth and gums actually felt like I had been to the dentist for a cleaning!&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the results from this product, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>All my friends and family are asking what I have been doing because my smile looks amazing.</li>
            <li>effects: With continued use, my teeth are becoming sore, as are my gums.  </li>
            <li>It does require that you brush your teeth for 1 full minute with each step which for most people is probably more than they&#x27;re used to brushing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hesitate to say this since this is a whitening product, but they FEEL even better than they look, polished and smooth.</li>
            <li>My teeth are becoming whiter, they do not look like they have the yellowish tint anymore.</li>
            <li>received this free from BzzAgent but will be purchasing more when I run out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I got to try it for free from Crest.  </li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s been a great product.</li>
            <li>I received a free package of this product, tried it, and now I love the Crest HD 2 Step System.  </li>
            <li>So I got this product as a free sample, and I&#x27;m probably going to be buying more.  </li>
            <li>The fact that it was from Crest and P&amp;G made me more comfortable with it.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get a free box through a promotion from crest.</li>
            <li>Having a healthy feeling mouth is important to me.  </li>

            <li>I received the product to try for free, so I used it, but I don&#x27;t think I can use it more than one time.</li>
            <li>I am using this product as a free trial from Crest :)</li>
            <li>I was able to give Crest HD a try for free.</li>
            <li>The smell is great and not harsh to the nose.</li>
            <li>I used this as a FREE trial from Crest, so I was able to try it before purchasing...</li>
            <li>I received it free through a crest promotion and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>This is great to use if you are sensitive to the whitening strips (like I am).</li>
            <li>When I got a free sample of this product I wasn&#x27;t sure I would truly see or feel any difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great to use with my sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>From the very first brush my teeth felt smooth and I loved the minty fresh breath!</li>

            <li>I have been using a free sample of Crest Pro Health HD for almost two months now and am really enjoying this</li>
            <li>I have to say that I love this toothpaste, which I did get for free as part of a promotion from Crest.  </li>
            <li>When Crest offered me a free sample of Crest Pro Health HD I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work</li>
            <li>Purifying Cleanser seemed to be like the Crest Pro Health Advanced toothpaste that I was already accustomed to using, and I found that to be enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>I was a Crest user before, but enjoy this product much more.  </li>
            <li>I received my Crest Pro Health HD free from Bzz Agent and I love this product.  </li>

            <li>It has a great flavor and did not bother my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Thanks to the generosity of Crest, I was able to try this product for free*</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product for free</li>
            <li>I recieved this as a free sample to test and absolutley love it.</li>
            <li>What I have noticed (and more importantly my friends and family) is that that the Crest Pro Health HD whitening system that BzzAgent sent me did make a difference in the brightness and whiteness of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say, Crest Pro Health HD kept stains away and my dental assistant complimented me on their natural looking brightness.</li>
            <li>Works great and gives you the incentive to brush completely.</li>
            <li>I have been using Crest products most of my life and started using the Pro Health line last year because of how healthy it made my mouth feel and the results I experienced at the dentist.  </li>
            <li>I received a free sample as part of a promotion from Crest as a BzzAgent, but I&#x27;ll gladly pay for this when it comes out.  </li>
            <li>I received it free to try from Crest, and I&#x27;m so glad-</li>
            <li>and if I notice (or more importantly my dentist notices) reduced gingivitis and brighter teeth, then the rating slips up to five stars.</li>
            <li>, I enjoy being healthy, and I have an HD TV-</li>
            <li>I love the just cleaned feeling of shiny, smooth teeth after every visit with a hygienist.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will continuer to use it regularly to keep my teeth and smile looking their best!</li>
            <li>My superficial stains are noticeably gone and most importantly, my teeth always appear 1-2 shades lighter after use.  </li>
            <li>I was able to try this product for free courtesy of Crest.  </li>
            <li>After using the product for a couple of weeks I do have to say I&#x27;m becoming a believer.  </li>
            <li>Even using this product every couple of days still shown signs of my teeth becoming whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth, this product may be great for you.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample to try out and review and thought \\&quot;sure why not\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>However the most important thing is if a product lives up to its claims.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the results so far after 2 weeks of using it.</li>
            <li>I love the Crest PH Advanced because it freshens my breath, and cleans my teeth.</li>
            <li>My teeth went from coffee and wine stained to brilliant, youthful white in under two-weeks.</li>
            <li>I have always had the kind of smile that never seems to get any brighter, no matter what products I use.  </li>
            <li>The toothpaste has a nice minty flavor that leaves your mouth feeling fresh.  </li>
            <li>I loved it so much</li>
            <li>If you are looking for your own at home fresh from a dental cleaning, this is it.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that my smile is brighter</li>
            <li>Have been using for a couple of weeks now, and my teeth feel nice and fresh</li>
            <li>Leaves nice fresh breath after.</li>
            <li>Really nice fresh breath that lasts and</li>
            <li>I received this complimentary from Crest and Bzzagent, but all opinions are of my own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Thanks to the generosity of Crest, I was able to try this product for free*l feel like the system is a good upgrade from my normal brushing</li>
            <li>I enjoy the fresh feeling of the pastes, but I am more of a one step kind of person.  </li>
            <li>Someone even commented on my nice smile two days ago.</li>
            <li>To give this product a fair review, I did use this product for a whole month.  </li>
            <li>He started using the toothpaste and loved it so much that he bought some for when he travels.</li>
            <li>It has made brushing actually a nice activity and not a chore knowing the results will be a cleaner brighter smile.  </li>
            <li>I loved how it made my whole mouth feel, including my gums and teeth.</li>
            <li>I continued to do this, rather than the straight two-week trial so that I could give a fair comparison of the toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>On top of that you get a fresh, clean mouth and a healthy mouth that lasts for hours and hours!</li>
            <li>It not only does a great job whitening my teeth, but it makes my mouth feel clean and healthy as well!  </li>
            <li>I do think this product would be good for maintaining whiter teeth since it seemed to help me from making new stains which is good because I am an avid tea drinker.  </li>
            <li>The two step process is easy and leaves my teeth feeling clean and sparkling!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true you could brush your teeth with straight hydrogen peroxide, but this is a MUCH more pleasant alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to say that having gotten the opportunity to try the Crest ProHealth HD for free was a great chance to find something new.</li>
            <li>I love knowing the floride paste is keeping my teeth strong and cavity free.</li>
            <li>Step 2 is more mild flavored, way more tolerable.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t super impressed with the whitening ability of this toothpaste - it claims to make teeth 6x whiter in a week, but I definitely didn&#x27;t see results even close to that.</li>
            <li>The polishing paste really does give you a &#x27;dentist clean feel&#x27; - I was impressed, however the whitening agent was only slightly more effective than the Crest (non-HD) whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt so clean, very smooth like glass.</li>
            <li>so my teeth always have a very smooth and clean feeling after brushing.</li>
            <li>This new, 2-step teeth-brushing system provides amazing results!  </li>
            <li>Loving BzzAgent right now.</li>
            <li>step 2 is a smooth gel, and once you start brushing with it, you really begin to feel that great, clean feeling as it polishes your teeth.</li>
            <li>The two step system makes your teeth feel SUPER clean, which I love!  </li>
            <li>mouth felt squeaky clean immediately, there was no horrible after taste and most importantly.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt very clean and smooth</li>
            <li>Of course, most of my own observations are purely anecdotal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of course, most of my own observations are purely anecdotal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Certainly the fresh taste is great</li>
            <li>perfecting gel, on the other hand, I was not so impressed with.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t say that is completely true!</li>
            <li>I would also recommend it to others who are looking for a feeling of healthy teeth and long-lasting fresh breath!</li>
            <li>Overall a good toothpaste!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so quick and easy!</li>
            <li>I received my first box as part of a promotional campaign via bzzagent, and I promptly stopped by Target on my way home and bought more!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I saw the BzzAgent campaign for Crest Pro Health® HD and was able to try this product as part of a promotion.</li>
            <li>Was able to try this free thanks to Crest and BzzAgent and am VERY glad I did.</li>
            <li>I know this product is a bit more costly, but it&#x27;s worth it for the results you get!</li>
            <li>OK, so my expectations of getting 6 times whiter teeth in just a week went out the door immediately, but I was still hopeful they would be significantly</li>
            <li>I was really impressed and could tell a big difference the first time I used it!  </li>
            <li>LOVE my smile after I brush with the 2 pastes!</li>
            <li>i think the first step paste is much more viscous (flows better) than most competing products.. that could be</li>
            <li>BzzAgent is so cool, if you&#x27;re not part of it, you should check it out!</li>
            <li>Plus, it is super easy!  </li>
            <li>This is one of the most unique products on the market.  </li>
            <li>and I found that to be true!</li>
            <li>toothpaste system came in an awesome little package that looked appealing.</li>
            <li>First off, I love this product!</li>
            <li>if I don&#x27;t like the taste, but this one actually tastes really good!</li>
            <li>Crest Pro Health HD gives me even more reasons to smile - and often!</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the results of a whiter smile!</li>
            <li>the one thing I was most excited to test was Crest Pro Health HD&#x27;s claim to whiten teeth up to 6x after a week&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>the one thing I was most excited to test was Crest Pro Health HD&#x27;s claim to whiten teeth up to 6x after a week&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>The best part is that I didn&#x27;t feel I was sacrificing the cleaning quality of my toothpaste for these other benefits.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The most significant thing that I noticed was that my felt a lot cleaner after brushing with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Probably the most significant drawback is the price.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s making me brush my teeth longer, so that&#x27;s probably not a bad thing either!  </li>
            <li>This new Two-Step has a great taste and the fact that the first tube  helps to get rid of plaque while the second tube polishes and whitens makes it the best mouth product I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>fresh, clean !!</li>
            <li>The new system is a great, easy way to clean and whiten teeth.</li>
            <li>had the wonderful opportunity to try this new product for free thanks to Crest and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>I think this is an easy system to use compared to others.  </li>
            <li>Easy enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I am so much more confident in my smile now.</li>
            <li>I have used many many types of whitening products— toothpaste, strips, dentist trays, at home lights— all with varying degrees of success.</li>
            <li>It is an easy to use 2 part system (just like Supersmile).</li>
            <li>I use this product when I wake up and again before bed with my electric toothbrush and it is a BETTER than the dentist clean in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>But the Crest Pro Health HD whitening toothpaste really is easy to use.</li>
            <li>The flavor is also very mild and doesn&#x27;t sting.</li>
            <li>I also love the clean feeling the toothpaste gives.</li>
            <li>so you certainly will feel the difference right away - great for plaque removal.</li>
            <li>I love the dentist clean feeling I get after using Crest Pro-Health HD Two-Step Toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>They are all amazed at how easy the process is: brush for one minute with step 1 then brush for one minute with step 2 and rinse.  </li>
            <li>This product truly does what it promises it whitens teeth and gives you that clean mouth feel in two easy steps with better morning breath.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to be engaged in it.  </li>

            <li>You aren&#x27;t supposed to rinse your mouth between steps, and it&#x27;s easy to understand why once you&#x27;ve used the system:</li>

            <li>This seems like a porr design and something that could easily be improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The two step process is really easy.</li>
            <li>My mouth felt healthy and my smile was looking much better as stains began to fade.  </li>
            <li>and you will see results very quickly.</li>
            <li>But, after a week of using it, I realized it was a rather easy process since the 2 minutes is split between the 2 tubes.</li>
            <li>The process of using two-steps is easy to adjust to.</li>
            <li>That &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling after a dentist visit is the best, but it never lasts more than a few days after brushing with a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>but once I used it, I forgot all about the time as I love how clean it makes my teeth feel.  </li>
            <li>I love having clean teeth.</li>
            <li>This two step system is easy and convenient for every day use and is truly the Power Couple for my mouth :</li>
            <li>Adding Crest Pro Health HD to my routine was easy.  </li>
            <li>I have always enjoyed the way Crest toothpaste leaves my mouth feeling and have always had great results keeping my teeth white with their products.</li>
            <li>I like this system because it is really easy to use.</li>
            <li>It was easy to incorporate 2 steps in my morning routine and it took 2 minutes of my time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really easy process:  </li>
            <li>It is literally the closest thing I&#x27;ve experienced to the feeling of getting my teeth cleaned at the dentist, only much more convenient.</li>
            <li>It is literally the closest thing I&#x27;ve experienced to the feeling of getting my teeth cleaned at the dentist, only much more convenient.</li>
            <li>My teeth look and feel great for many hours after I&#x27;ve brushed them!  </li>
            <li>Makes your teeth feel healthy and clean.</li>
            <li>The directions were easy and printed on each tube which helped because I wasn&#x27;t use to &amp;#34;spit/</li>
            <li>The two part system is so easy to use; one minute with the purifying cleanser to help with plaque buildup and one minute with the perfecting gel which polishes and whitens your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Product is great for whiter teeth, however I have to use a regular toothpaste afterwards because I prefer a more minty flavor after I brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to incorporate 2 steps in my morning routine and it took 2 minutes of my time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me, you love it when your mouth feels clean.</li>
            <li>The two step process is easy to follow.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s quite strong</li>
            <li>The taste is minty and strong with an after taste of hydrogen peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strong, wintergreen sort of flavor.  </li>
            <li>The strong flavor also helps to cover up the flavor of Step 2, which is why I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s so strong</li>
            <li>It also had that mouthburn type of reaction that you might get with a strong mouthwash.</li>
            <li>if this is the toothpaste for me, it may just be too strong for my mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also had that mouthburn type of reaction that you might get with a strong mouthwash.</li>
            <li>The taste was like the whiten strips but not as strong</li>
            <li>The smell was like the whiten strips but not as strong</li>
            <li>I also noticed in the ingredients list that in contained hydrogen peroxide, which I tasted strongly in Step 2.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy on the teeth and leave a fresh minty taste.</li>
            <li>got to try this product for free thanks to Crest and Bzzagent, and I&#x27;m glad I did because I was able to discover a quality product!</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest and Bzz Agent, I was able to try this item for free, and so glad I did!</li>
            <li>It leaves your mouth feeling great and the whitening is a major bonus.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it works as good as their high end whitestrips, but it does remove surface stains.  </li>
            <li>My husband tried the product and liked it very much.  </li>
            <li>I have nothing but good things to say about the product, and highly recommend it to anyone with teeth sensitivities looking for a whiting product.</li>
            <li>I liked that very much as mornings can be a bit hectic.</li>
            <li>Leaves your teeth feeling so smooth and clean!</li>
            <li>Even though I receieved this product free of charge I can honestly say I absolutely LOVE this new toothpaste!!  </li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t seen this wonderful product at major retailers just yet, but if you are interested, it is available at CVS for $15.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be sure to go to my local Target and buy more!!</li>
            <li>After finishing the process my teeth felt very clean and my breath fresh!</li>
            <li>I experienced gum bleeding with the 3D white toothpastes and didn&#x27;t feel like my mouth was very clean after use.</li>
            <li>Still, a solid 4 stars for leaving a very clean \\&quot;from the dentist\\&quot; feel, and for the great whitening effect in about 10 days.</li>
            <li>I got results, but I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call them amazing.</li>
            <li>Human nature is to give a better review when someone gives you something, i.e. they where nice I should be nice.  </li>
            <li>to summarize, the step 1 toothpaste does not taste or feel the best, and if you overuse the product you will get sore and irritated gums, but it is still worth it if you want smooth and white teeth!</li>
            <li>Cudos to Crest for another amazing product that delivers exactly what it promises</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this product due to the wonderful people at Crest and BzzAgent, and I&#x27;ve been using the system for about a week now.</li>
            <li>I honestly feel that you will see a very noticeable difference if you try it!  </li>
            <li>This tastes kind of funny compared to the toothpaste I am used to...</li>
            <li>This tastes kind of funny compared to the toothpaste I am used to...</li>
            <li>To be completely honest the first step makes your mouth feel like a cats tongue and has a funky taste.</li>
            <li>pretty nice product...</li>
            <li>Upon first using the 2 step pastes, I was thrilled.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that really like this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s what it takes to get me to make sure I get 2 full minutes of brushing in--well</li>
            <li>and I really liked it at first.</li>
            <li>This tastes kind of funny compared to the toothpaste I am used to...</li>
            <li>While I found it challenging to brush my teeth for 2 full minutes, there was a noticeable difference after.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t my favorite flavor, not bad</li>
            <li>Keeping fingers crossed because I am very pleased with it so far!!!</li>
            <li>Amazing product provides a fresh from the dentist clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Most importantly my teeth and gums feel and look clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that my mouth feels really clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I love the smooth clean feeling of my teeth after each brushing with Crest Pro-Health HD.  </li>
            <li>Like a fresh from the dentist kind of clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel more smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>My husband and I love how quick and easy this product is.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel incredibly clean (pearly smooth) and the taste is refreshing.</li>
            <li>: I loved how clean my teeth felt after using this toothpaste and it whitened very well (though perhaps not as dramatically as the producer is suggesting).  </li>
            <li>The paste does have a nice, fresh, clean feeling though.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s pro health advanced this toothpaste does everything that my teeth need to be healthy and clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel more clean &amp; smooth than ever.</li>
            <li>I didn’t enjoy a clean refreshing feeling in my mouth after brushing.</li>
            <li>The BEST part of this product is that my &amp;#34;morning breath&amp;#34; is extremely reduced!</li>
            <li>I mean I&#x27;ve tried a number of toothpastes over the years and while I&#x27;m happy with the kind I&#x27;m using now, toothpastes always seem to overstate how effective they are.</li>
            <li>The two step system is very easy and fast--just 2 minutes of brushing and your teeth have that just-from-the-dentist super clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>I am more confident with my smile and my fresh breath!</li>
            <li>a BzzAgent, I was sent a free sample by Crest and couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to get my teeth whiter in two-minute, twice-a-day brushings after about a week of use.</li>
            <li>Best of all, my mouth felt fresh and clean, using such a user-friendly whitening regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to try a full size sample for free and being a fan of crest whitening strips</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks and overall am pretty impressed.</li>
            <li>so I’m glad that the process helped me become more aware of that.  </li>
            <li>Read the fine print...</li>
            <li>Both tasted fine, and went well together.  </li>
            <li>the taste wasn&#x27;t the greatest and brushing second time without rinsing first</li>
            <li>/&gt;The fine folks at Crest provided me this sample</li>
            <li>The taste is fine and there&#x27;s no sensitivity like I had with the strips.  </li>
            <li>Which is perfectly fine as you do not rinse the mint out from step one.</li>
            <li>The entire process took literally two minutes and really impressed me after my first use.  </li>
            <li>I already had a healthy brushing regiment and white teeth to start &amp; still experienced a noticeable difference in how clean the surface of my teeth felt.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste tastes fine.</li>
            <li>First I&#x27;d like to say while i received this product free from Crest, my review is honest</li>
            <li>my mouth felt clean and smooth with  nice minty fresh breath.</li>
            <li>Besides that, the way it left our teeth feeling so fresh and clean was awesome!</li>
            <li>My first box may have been free, but I have continued using it on my own.</li>
            <li>I was more than satisfied with my experience and would recommend it to anyone willing to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Taste was fine.  </li>
            <li>I am more than impressed and just after  a few days my teeth have started to whiten!</li>
            <li>The pros:  1) Tastes fine.  </li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, I have noticed that my teeth are actually whiter from a toothpaste, and that is a great feeling!  </li>
            <li>and you will be fine.</li>
            <li>Not the best taste, Slightly whiter teeth but not 6x as claim.  </li>
            <li>I have been using a Sonicare toothbrush for years, and this system works just fine with it too.  </li>
            <li>I was super exited for this because I love having whiter teeth</li>
            <li>The idea that you had to brush for one minute with each step was also beneficial as it caused me to focus on the time versus just a quick (too-quick according to many dental studies</li>
            <li>did notice a modest amount of whitening but not anything bold or significant.&lt;br /&gt;The taste and texture of both products is appropriate and pleasant, not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky to have naturally healthy teeth, so</li>
            <li>But, it quickly became routine and does not bother me any more.</li>
            <li>Thank you Crest for a super product!</li>
            <li>this two-step process that is quick and thorough!</li>
            <li>When the package arrived, the package was visually bold and striking.  </li>
            <li>The real positive that came from my free promotional kit (I got it free from Crest through a Bzzz promotion!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great thing to do if you are wanting a cheap way to whiten teeth, super easy, and won&#x27;t make teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li>I can reiterate what many other reviewers appear to be saying - although my teeth do feel very clean with use of this product, I haven&#x27;t experienced any noticeable difference in the health of my mouth or the whiteness of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am pretty confident I will see a difference and am happy with the product so far.</li>
            <li>It has a clean, but not overpowering flavor, and after one week of use I went to a dentist appointment and was complimented by the dentist on my clean teeth!</li>
            <li>The two-steps aren&#x27;t really any more work!</li>
            <li>I took the \\&quot;one-week\\&quot; Crest challenge with a free sample, and I gotta say, my smile is looking pretty good.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest for sending me my free sample!!</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest, I got to try the product for FREE!!</li>
            <li>Thanks to Bzzagent and Crest, I was able to try this product!  </li>
            <li>Thanks Crest for making a better whitening product!</li>
            <li>I have started to recieve more compliments on my smile and the yellowness that happens over time is disappearing into a beautiful white sparkle...</li>
            <li>Crest Pro Health HD was easy to use, the taste was great, and it only takes 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>This two step system has given me more confidence in my smile and breath while still being fairly easy to use.</li>
            <li>I especially like how easy it is to use and how great your mouth feels after</li>
            <li>liked it since it is easy and fast.  </li>
            <li>it did not foam very much, and had a distinct minty taste, which was strong but very refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I have been a fan of Crest for many years- and applaud them for launching new products that just keep getting better and better.  </li>
            <li>I had the opportunity to try this product for free thanks to Crest and through my role as a BzzAgent, and boy, am I glad I did!</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of Crest Pro Health HD thanks to Crest, and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Toothpaste is super important to me and the aspects that are most important to me are taste, price, availability, ability to whiten, anti-cavity, packaging and ingredients.</li>
            <li>I received this as a Free Sample and I am so lucky I did!</li>
            <li>Love this its super easy to use kept my teeth feeling clean all day</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s very easy to use...</li>
            <li>Very easy to use the two step system, not complicated at all.  </li>
            <li>I think that the system is easy to use - much more time effective for me than white strips or trays, and I feel it had better results.</li>
            <li>This product works and I was lucky to receive this product for free to review and I am glad that I did because I now have a whiter smile :-)</li>
            <li>Overall, I was very pleased with the product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, one of the best things about this toothpaste is it doesnt have those really little abrasive balls that everyone found out was getting under the gums and dentists</li>
            <li>I never said anything to the dental hygienist, but she commented on how little plaque I had on my teeth and that I had been doing an excellent job brushing.  </li>
            <li>But I was very pleased with how the one two-step process made my teeth feel clean and look much wider.</li>
            <li>I am very glad that Crest chose me as a recipient of a sample product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel smooth, fresh and look amazing just after the first brush!  </li>
            <li>I am so fortunate I was able to try this for free thanks to Crest!!</li>
            <li>The system is easy to use and you will forget to brush your teeth because your teeth really do feel clean all day!!.  </li>
            <li>I was super excited to try this product as a part of BzzAgent&#x27;s sponsored trials!</li>
            <li>a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>I must start by saying that I am a HUGE Crest fan.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge difference in the shade my teeth are</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t notice a huge change in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li>: While there wasn&#x27;t a huge improvement in whiteness, there was an improvement nonetheless.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a huge bathroom vanity, so for me, having to store 2 tubes of toothpaste</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a huge whitening transformation, but I do not drink coffee</li>
            <li>$20 is a huge rip off.</li>
            <li>: I got to try this free thanks to Crest, but I am reviewing it honestly.</li>
            <li>I am trying this sample for free thanks to crest however all opinions are my own.  </li>
            <li>My teeth seem to be whiter too and that is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I noticed a huge change in the whiteness.  </li>
            <li>it really whitened teeth from what i see - not considering it as the biggest breakthrough but seems to me like whitening was gentle - so quite happy here</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a huge difference in the whiteness of your teeth, I don&#x27;t think a toothpaste is going to cut it.  </li>
            <li>The cleanliness factor is huge with this</li>
            <li>As far as whitening and leaving your breath fresh this is a great product.</li>
            <li>I tried this product for free thanks to Crest, but the opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say there was a huge change, but anything is miles ahead of the competition.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took before and after photos to see if there would be a huge difference in my teeth.</li>
            <li>there was zero tooth sensitivity noticed which had been a huge concern of mine with any whitening</li>
            <li>so that is huge to me.  </li>
            <li>but after about a week of using Crest Pro-Health HD twice a day I saw a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t notice a huge diffference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li>tried this product for free thanks to Crest and BzzAgent, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>while I might not have been expecting a huge leap forward, this is probably the most powerful toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I used it for 1 week and noticed a huge difference in the color of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t notice a huge change.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d tried a few whitening toothpastes and hadn&#x27;t been impressed, but I&#x27;d received this as a free sample.</li>
            <li>I actually enjoy brushing my teeth every morning and night now because I get to see results and my teeth have never felt so clea.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel smooth, just like how they feel after leaving from a dental appointment.</li>
            <li>I have tried every whitening toothpaste and product available.  </li>
            <li>I had not received the free trial of Crest -Pro Health HD through BzzAgent</li>
            <li>But worth it because I love my whiter teeth.</li>
            <li>got this as a part of a free promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li>I received this as a free marketing sample.</li>

            <li>The package warns that white spots may appear on the gums after using the brightening gel and I experienced those each time I used the product (though they disappeared within an hour).  </li>
            <li>I got the product free to review.</li>

            <li>It was as good as professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I love the super clean feeling this system leaves me with.</li>
            <li>This seems to be as good as I can expect, unless I get it professionally done at the dentist, which I don’t think I’ll be doing anytime soon.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest, I was able to try it for free!  </li>
            <li>My teeth are naturally not-that-white, and I don&#x27;t help things by drinking lots of tea, so I was hoping to see some good results after the week was up.</li>
            <li>Overall the product does a good job cleaning, and an okay job whitening, considering it is an over the counter product</li>
            <li>For me, I was much more interested in the health aspects of the Crest Pro Health® HD(tm)toothpaste, so I still feel like the system is a good upgrade from my normal brushing</li>
            <li>but I really was impressed by how white my teeth were!</li>
            <li>This is better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and thanks to Crest for letting me try it for free!</li>
            <li>I think that the biggest advantage of this system is that it&#x27;s fairly affordable compared to whitening strips or professional whitening.</li>
            <li>far so good.</li>
            <li>I feel more confident, and my teeth really do look whiter.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest, I was able to try Crest Pro-Health HD for free!  </li>
            <li>I love the super clean feeling I get with Crest HD.</li>
            <li>I got this product and so far have mostly good things to say.</li>
            <li>but it really isnt anything more than just one more step.</li>
            <li>Once I got into the rhythm of brushing, spitting, remembering to not rinse!, and then repeating with step 2, I realized that it really wasn&#x27;t that more more work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to find this product in my local stores, so that was a good thing for when I need a refill.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say I love the super clean feeling and no morning breath.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not uncomfortably gritty - in fact it feels kind of nice.  </li>
            <li>So far after two weeks of use, this seems like a good product.  </li>
            <li>After step 2 is added and complete, a good thorough rinse takes away the &amp;#34;chalky&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li>and I love that the step one gives me that super clean feeling and the step two polishes and shines.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt as smooth right after brushing and felt and stayed smooth for most of the tie till I ate another meal which is really a fantastic plus</li>
            <li>How much easier can it be to have a great white smile!!!</li>
            <li>in all, if you&#x27;re looking for super clean feeling, whiter teeth, give this stuff a shot!</li>
            <li>The first bottle of actual tooth paste was pleasant and nice to use.  </li>
            <li>After the first use, my teeth looked whiter and felt very clean, dentist clean!</li>
            <li>The two step process is easy to do and doesn&#x27;t end up taking any longer than my normal routine, so that&#x27;s nice.  </li>
            <li>It is nice to use a whitening product that is easily integrated into my normal routine</li>
            <li>The first toothpaste is super foamy, I liked the flavor of it</li>
            <li>I got to try this product for free, which is nice because I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought it other wise.  </li>
            <li>and I am ordering more for me and my family at my expense right away.</li>
            <li>I am HIGHLY recommending that you try this product, you will love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, and my mouth was definitely clean, but the whitening is the stand out feature</li>
            <li>and he instantly loved the clean and refreshing feel it left.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I tried this product and would definitely recommend it to anyone that is looking for a brighter, fresher smile!</li>
            <li>Crest PH Advanced helped me feel confident when dealing with others because my breath was fresh and my teeth were clean.</li>
            <li>I also find the taste to be pleasant in general, and I do feel that the stains on my teeth are disappearing and my teeth are getting whiter.</li>
            <li>It’s is vey easy to use and the taste is not bad.  </li>
            <li>After getting this free kit and having such good results I&#x27;m excited to try more new free products!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tried out this Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste that I got through BzzAgent and can see my teeth are whiter after the first application!!  </li>
            <li>Thanks Crest!!!</li>
            <li>It leaves your mouth feeling very fresh and my teeth were shiny</li>
            <li>The reason I removed a star, though, is because my mouth didn’t feel very fresh and minty as I would like after brushing.</li>
            <li>but to me very worth it.</li>
            <li>but it definitely whitens very effectively.</li>
            <li>It is very powerful and I could feel the difference in terms of the plaque being removed.  </li>
            <li>system worked well for me, leaving my mouth feeling very fresh for hours after brushing.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh, clean feeling of my teeth after checkups at the dentist.  </li>
            <li>I feel fresh, clean and confident.</li>
            <li>I love how clean my mouth feels and how fresh.  </li>
            <li>I feel so fresh and clean after using the product and the freshness that it leaves after brushing lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt and looked really smooth, clean and tartar free.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt and looked really smooth, clean and tartar free.</li>
            <li>The toothpastes had a great taste to them and definitely left my mouth feeling clean, but there were two drawbacks in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li>In the course of a month, I had to use my old toothpaste while I was traveling and did not feel like my teeth were clean and bright</li>
            <li>This product is great for use in between dental cleanings to keep your teeth clean and white.</li>
            <li>I love how fresh and clean my mouth and teeth feels.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s minty and fresh, and generally decent, bordering on good.</li>
            <li>My teeth also feel very clean and my breath fresh after using the Crest Pro Health HD set.  </li>
            <li>My teeth felt very clean and my breath smelled fresh.</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this kit and never be without it, it&#x27;s made a huge difference in my smile!</li>

            <li>You should know at a high level this product does work better than most toothpaste if your looking for whiter and cleaner feeling teeth.  </li>
            <li>First I have to preface by saying that I do take very good care of my teeth, see my dentist regularly and always use whitening toothpaste and mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>Although I haven’t seen much change in the shade, my teeth feel extremely clean all day!!  </li>
            <li>After only one use of the toothpaste and whitener I was delighted to find out how clean my teeth felt!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving my new Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste!</li>
            <li>Thanks to the good people at BzzAgent and Crest, I was able to give this product a test run for free!&lt;br /&gt;Although I cannot say with any scientific certainty that this toothpaste does in fact make you teeth whiter, but what I can say is that it makes your teeth and mouth feel brand spanking new.  </li>
            <li>Clean feeling is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Then when you apply the finishing step, my teeth become so smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I would recommend if you are looking for a clean mouth with smooth feeling teeth and do not mind a 2 step brushing process.</li>
            <li>It leaves my teeth feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel smooth and clean even up to when I do my nightly brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth felt extremely clean and smooth after using it.  </li>
            <li>After I rinse, my teeth feel so smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>But, my teeth feel remarkably smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>it feels like you just got a cleaning at the dentist, teeth surface feels clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>My gums feel healthier, my teeth are becoming plaque free and my smile is sparkling.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel smooth and clean longer throughout the day, and I have the post-dentist feeling in my mouth every time I&#x27;m finished.</li>
            <li>Then, Step 2 leaves your teeth feeling silky smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>Running my teeth on my gums insured they were clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I do notice that my teeth feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>it leaves my teeth feeling soo smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>What I can say is that after I brush my teeth they feel smooth and clean</li>
            <li>And that clean, smooth feel lasts all day even after I eat.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>, my teeth still have a clean, smooth feel.</li>
            <li>I wake up with really smooth and clean teeth.</li>
            <li>The smooth clean feeling lasts through food and sleep.</li>
            <li>I found that the Crest PH Advanced kept my teeth feeling clean ALL day; even after eating.</li>
            <li>All in all, after 2 days, I&#x27;m pretty happy with Crest Pro Health HD so far.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>No morning breath and clean, smooth teeth.  </li>
            <li>The 2-step process is super easy.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s super easy and the added steps, in my opinion, are what make the difference.</li>
            <li>I also have really brilliant white teeth now, and I am an avid Dt. soda drinker.</li>
            <li>My Listerine Whitening rinse is far superior (if I use it twice per day for one full minute before brushing).  </li>
            <li>I like the quick and easy steps to also get my whitening in</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of strange, but nice.  </li>
            <li>Super easy to use.</li>
            <li>The first toothpaste is the cleaner, which really seems to do a good job with the cleaning.</li>
            <li>I was able to test this product free thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li>but it was quick and easy.</li>
            <li>This system is 2 steps,but really easy and quick to use.  </li>
            <li>I was able to try Crest Pro-Health HD free thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li>can honestly say that my teeth have never felt cleaner than when I used this system with my Spinbrush classic.</li>
            <li>The flavor wasn&#x27;t the best and left my mouth feeling kinda dry, but it was effective at whitening without causing tooth discomfort.</li>
            <li>The gel also tasted fine, was cool and cleansing.  </li>
            <li>, that was the first thing i noticed (and it smells good too haha).</li>
            <li>The directions were easy to follow and it was a quick process.</li>
            <li>I have to admit, when this popped up as my first BzzAgent free sample, I was not the most enthused</li>
            <li>So glad I got to try this product for free thanks to bzzagent and crest!</li>
            <li>sweet boyfriend has told me that my smile looks better than ever.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro Health HD is my favorite, new #HealthyObsession!!!  </li>
            <li>I am in LOVE with the new Crest Pro Health HD!!!</li>
            <li>Love this new toothpaste!!!</li>
            <li>and I really like the product it was very easy to use</li>
            <li>What I did not like about step 2 is that it had a very &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; hotness taste like a VERY STRONG peppermint taste.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really my new healthy obsession!  </li>
            <li>I will admit that my teeth feel so clean and smooth after using it and my breath is so fresh!</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health HD is a quick and easy way to a whiter smile!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>You do have a nice clean feeling when done, but I think that most people do not typically brush for a full 2 minutes like they should.  </li>
            <li>- my mouth feels really clean and fresh and so easy - my smile is brighter and the minty taste is refreshing.</li>
            <li>I let them know that not only is this amazing toothpaste easy to use, and helping to keep my teeth clean and healthy...</li>
            <li>In addition to cavity-fighting fluoride, the toothpaste contains some sort of abrasive which does not damage teeth but gets them super clean, nice and smooth and very shiny.</li>
            <li>I had that fresh clean smile....and breath!</li>
            <li>My mouth is so fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>Mouth feels fresh and clean after every use!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product and will definite continue to use this as my new toothpaste and recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my new morning routine and will keep using Crest Pro-Health HD.  </li>
            <li>I was really impressed with the new Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step system toothpaste.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels very fresh and minty clean after brushing.  </li>
            <li>It makes your breath feel very fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>This gel had a very medicinal flavor which I didn&#x27;t find pleasant, but it wasn&#x27;t off-putting too much.</li>
            <li>the product takes way more time to work ... for me worked really smoth and easy ..</li>
            <li>: Tastes good despite being a function focused product, easy to use, immediate results, will last a while&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>All my teeth were super smooth and free of plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved how easy the system all you needed to do was just simply brush with each step for two minutes.</li>
            <li>This was super exciting since I assume with continued use I can expect even greater results.</li>
            <li>This gel had a very medicinal flavor which I didn&#x27;t find pleasant, but it wasn&#x27;t off-putting too much.</li>
            <li>The two step process is easy but your teeth feel super clean when finished.</li>
            <li>I started using it right away and was excited about the results, my teeth felt cleaner longer and were visibly whiter!  </li>
            <li>This product is very easy to use and makes my teeth very shiny and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>The two-step process takes no time at all and left my mouth feeling - amazing!</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health HD toothpaste is a great way to whiten your teeth, I have to say that I have tried other product but never had great success and could never bring myself to spend money to have my teeth professionally whitened.  </li>
            <li>At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure about the taste, but I like it</li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am willing to keep using this, just for that magical force field alone.</li>
            <li>First you brush for a minute with the purifying cleanser which has a refreshing minty taste, then brush for another minute with the perfecting gel.  </li>
            <li>he too was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>Upon waking my mouth and breath feel fresh!</li>
            <li>I was excited.</li>
            <li>I think having two steps also makes me more aware</li>
            <li>My mouth feels fresh and glossy all day!</li>
            <li>thanks to Smiley360&#x27;s free sample offer I was able to try for free before buying.</li>
            <li>, I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant whitening, compared to the label which says up to six shades lighter teeth in a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>I have noticed a significant change in the color of my teeth</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s a significant difference.  </li>
            <li>My husband has seen more than stellar results.</li>
            <li>Within the first day I was able to tell a difference in the way my teeth felt.  </li>
            <li>This bothers me a bit, but let me tell you the pluses for this makes it all worth it!</li>
            <li>The first tube you use has a &amp;#34;wintergreen&amp;#34; taste -- not one of my favorite flavors.</li>
            <li>Does this product deliver significantly whiter teeth?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure my teeth would be whiter than they have been in years.</li>
            <li>The flavor is great and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re trying to whiten your smile, give this a shot!</li>
            <li>I was so excited because I have been using crest products exclusively for years.</li>
            <li>The one big issue I have is that tube 1 has a flip top (great!), but the 2nd tube is a twist cap.  </li>
            <li>Instead of being excited to use this stuff, you&#x27;ll feel like it&#x27;s a chore.</li>
            <li>but when I looked in the mirror and saw the instantaneous results it made me smile!</li>
            <li>my smile look happier!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product because I am a fan of Crest whitening strips.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the first step of this teeth whitening system.</li>
            <li>Although I could be sure that there was a difference, a friend came by today and the first thing she said when she hopped out of her car was, &amp;</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my mouth feel fresh and, after a week of use, my teeth are noticeably whiter and brighter!  </li>
            <li>, is how it allowed me to like my smile!</li>
            <li>i was excited to receive this to try out as a bzzagent.</li>
            <li>Yeah worth it!</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this courtesy of Crest (thanks Crest!), but, rest assured, my review is exactly as it would be if I&#x27;d bought it with my own hard-earned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 2-step process is unique.</li>
            <li>The first time that I used this product, I truly wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from it.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate to be selected by BzzAgent to try out a full size sample of Crest ProHealth HD toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>The two steps, at first I thought would be a pain, but super easy!</li>
            <li>and I did not notice a significant difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li>and I was so excited to do so.  </li>
            <li>I received a sample of the Crest Pro-Health HD system from BzzAgent and was excited to try it out.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend Crest ProHealth HD to everyone, the world deserves a brighter smile!</li>
            <li>Also, each day after brushing the night before, I woke up with fresh breath!</li>
            <li>The most noticeable change will be during the first use.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can smile with confidence now!</li>
            <li>What makes this product unique, as the name says, is that it is a two-step process designed to get teeth both cleaner (by stripping away plaque) and whiter (by polishing teeth).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit that I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how to feel about it at first.</li>
            <li>My biggest challenge with the two steps at first was making sure I didn&#x27;t rinse in between, but even after 2 days or so, I got the hang of that too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first 7 days of using this product, my teeth sure were whiter.</li>
            <li>I supposed I may buy it again to use in between real whitening treatments as a way to keep my teeth bright, but I dont think it will MAKE your teeth white on its own.</li>
            <li>This is a fun product: an oral hygiene adventure!</li>
            <li>Step two is the unique part-</li>
            <li>The taste is minty fresh too!</li>
            <li>Step two is the unique part, it whitens and polishes your teeth.</li>
            <li>We are 2 weeks into it and they are even better than the first week.  </li>
            <li>first i wasn&#x27;t sure about the way my mouth felt</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>I have the smile of a star!</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s also the best product to use if you are looking for the quickest way to whiten teeth since 2 minutes is significantly shorter than the usual 60 minutes.</li>
            <li>Step 1 and Step 2 equals a brighter smile!</li>
            <li>and I was really excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to see the results as I continue to use this system.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this product.</li>
            <li>Buy it, try it, &amp; start showing a whiter smile!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try a whitening product as I have never had my teeth whitened or used whitening strips.  </li>
            <li>anyways, i love this toothpaste so much!</li>
            <li>In full disclosure- I received a free trial of this product from Crest.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>My mouth felt healthier, and my smile was brighter!</li>
            <li>Its worth it!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the try!</li>
            <li>No one gets excited to brush their teeth as it is an automatic routine.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to receive the Crest Pro Health HD system as part of the BzzAgent campaign.  </li>
            <li>It seemed like a unique product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it!  </li>
            <li>For $13, this is definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>I have not noticed a significant whitening difference but look forward to finishing the set and to see if I get my desired results.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Full disclosure -- I was given this product free by the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>It adds another minute to your dental care, but it&#x27;s really worth it!</li>
            <li>I received full size tubes of Crest pro-health HD 2 step whitening toothpaste from BzzAgent for free.</li>
            <li>In the sake of full disclosure, I did receive a free sample of this product through BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sure the toothpaste is two steps and at first looks like it will take longer.</li>
            <li>I was excited to be invited to use Crest Pro Health HD as a Bzzzagent.  </li>
            <li>At first I was like, okay,</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my smile within one week!  </li>
            <li>While it probably maintained my original color, I didn&#x27;t see any significant difference in the whiteness or brightness of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Six shades, to me, is a significant difference.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li>First of all, I have to say I don&#x27;t love the taste.  </li>
            <li>When I used it the first time, I found I enjoyed the taste</li>
            <li>I do not have the whitest teeth, so I was excited to try this product from Crest and BzzAgent, Crest Pro Health HD.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t love the flavor, but willing to overlook that for results!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However after the first use I found that it is more than just &amp;#34;another toothpaste&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I was selected for this campaign</li>
            <li>I was excited about trying this product, after all who&#x27;s teeth couldn&#x27;t use some whitening.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Initial pros: the full size package we received is huge</li>
            <li>I was able to use it to quickly and easily clean AND brighten my smile.  </li>
            <li>brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really excited to try this because I drink a lot of coffee and the coffee was beginning to noticeably stain my teeth.  </li>
            <li>So full disclosure, I received Crest Pro Health® HD™ toothpaste for free to try as part of a promotion with Crest and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>Other than that I have loved it!</li>
            <li>I was excited to continue using the product to see the results.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get my BzzAgent Crest Pro Health® HD™ kit in the mail, but a bit leery as well.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s actually pretty fantastic!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s actually pretty fantastic!</li>
            <li>but well worth it!</li>
            <li>I received a sample from Crest and BzzAgent and am so excited with the preliminary results .</li>
            <li>I received a full size product to try for free from Smiley 360.  </li>
            <li>What makes the Crest Pro Health® HD system unique is the two step process.</li>
            <li>I have been using the product for 6 days and have seen a significant change in the whiteness of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I plan to continue using it until it is gone and then determine if the difference is really significant.  </li>
            <li>my smile has after using this product!</li>
            <li>I know the change must be significant.</li>
            <li>Worth buying!</li>
            <li>A brighter smile, cleaner teeth and fresher breath!</li>
            <li>9 days later, I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li>and my mouth feels so fresh!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 100% worth it!  </li>
            <li>I was able to tell a difference in the first week.  </li>
            <li>you aren&#x27;t sensitive and you&#x27;re looking for a toothpaste that gives you a super clean feeling, this is a good</li>
            <li>I did not however notice a significant difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li>Even if it doesn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s the cleanest any toothpaste has ever made my mouth feel and that alone is worth it!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I was selected for this campaign</li>
            <li>Also I was excited to try this product since its claim was providing cleaner, whiter teeth within a week.  </li>
            <li>Over the past 3 weeks, my wife and I have used the Crest Prod Health HD product (as part of a BzzAgent campaign we were supplied with the kit from Crest) and the results have been great!  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>How refreshing that a product works.&lt;br /&gt;I was sceptical at first, but as soon as I received Crest Pro-Health HD (I am a BzzAgent)</li>
            <li>my free full size sample runs out</li>
            <li>I am even excited to go to the dentist</li>
            <li>I did not see any significant change in tooth color.  </li>
            <li>I originally thought it would be a hassle</li>
            <li>So join me in making your smile what they noticed about you &amp; remember!</li>
            <li>I received a free full size sample from Crest.</li>
            <li>The result is so worth it!</li>
            <li>I am going to have my husband test out the product to see if he sees any significant whitening.</li>
            <li>I am going to have my husband test out the product to see if he sees any significant whitening.</li>
            <li>Many times, I have just used the first - spit it out and rinsed because I forgot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a small thing, but if there were some way it could be in one tube - it would be wonderful.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to give this a go.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Whitening: Im not sure this product did a superb job at making my teeth whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would like something that whitens and makes my mouth feel fresh!</li>
            <li>After several weeks, they were remarkably whiter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li>When Bzzagent offered me the chance to try this product, I was somewhat excited.</li>
            <li>When I first heard about Crest Pro Health HD, I have to admit that I had hoped it would involve a bit of magic.</li>
            <li>I am part of a campaign through Bzz Agent to try this unique product.  </li>
            <li>so I have to admit I was excited when this product (Crest pro Health HD) came out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m big on having a real healthy mouth...</li>
            <li>I made this mistake the first time &amp; the system works much better when directions are followed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I did not notice a significant improvement in the whiteness of my teeth or significantly improved oral health after using the product for a month when compared to a tube of toothpaste that costs 1/3rd the price.</li>
            <li>I will not only continue to use Crest Pro Health HD myself, but I have already spread the good word to my husband and he&#x27;s excited to have the fresh, clean, healthy experience too.</li>
            <li>After my first use I noticed a difference in the clean feel of my teeth, they felt so smooth!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure whether I&#x27;ve had the 6x whiter teeth that the product claims, but I&#x27;m very happy about how clean my teeth feel.  </li>
            <li>It made my teeth feel so clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>Without a doubt, my mouth feels clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>My mouth has never felt so clean or fresh!  </li>
            <li>And in addition to feeling clean, the added bonus was that my teeth were significantly whiter after just two days of using the product.</li>
            <li>Loving my new smile!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pretty impressed with how nice my mouth feels and looks after using this toothpaste, and despite the hefty cost and extra sensitivity, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase Crest Pro Health HD in the future.</li>
            <li>I was super excited when I received it for free in the mail from Crest to review.</li>
            <li>but I was super excited to receive this toothpaste for free via BzzAgent and Crest.</li>
            <li>For free courtesy of Crest, I was super excited.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try the product , but after the first use of it I realized this product is not for me ...</li>
            <li>I use a Sonicare toothbrush, so before trying this new product I was already used to an effective brushing.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay foamed very long, so you have to be quick.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product.</li>
            <li>Works great, super easy to use, no funny tastes or feeling when you are done, my new favorite whitener!</li>
            <li>But this does give me a clean feeling.</li>
            <li>my teeth did not feel clean any of those times.</li>
            <li>It bubbles in your mouth like hydrogen peroxide and makes your teeth squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product free thanks to Crest and I am so thankful to have had the opportunity.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky to receive this toothpaste for free from Crest as a BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>Not once has ANY of the toothpastes I&#x27;ve used ever gotten my teeth as clean feeling as this 2 step program did.</li>
            <li>It did make my mouth feel clean.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels really clean after brushing, which I love.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although, thanks to Crest I was able to try this product out for free I cannot get over the cost.</li>
            <li>Foods no longer stick to my teeth and my mouth feels clean throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I was able to try this product for free and really looked forward to using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Step 1 is to clean your teeth and remove plaque.</li>
            <li>I will say however if you are using this product to get your teeth clean</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s effective, fast to bring results, and fun to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>peppermint flavor gel toothpaste (Step 1) made my mouth feel incredibly, incredibly clean.</li>
            <li>No bleeding with this product, and even 7 hours after morning brushing and eating, my teeth still feel clean.</li>
            <li>my teeth felt so clean.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean and I feel they are whiter.  </li>
            <li>stopped bleeding&lt;br /&gt;After-Dentist clean feeling that lasts&lt;br /&gt;Really does whiten teeth&lt;br</li>
            <li>That being said, I will still recommend this product to others and probably purchase it once it runs out, as you can&#x27;t beat the clean feeling and ease of whitening.  </li>
            <li>Overall though this is a great product and worth a try.</li>
            <li>My mouth has never felt so clean...</li>
            <li>After brushing with both products...my teeth feel dentist clean after each use.</li>
            <li>I like how it makes my teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li>It made me think that my teeth were not that clean.  </li>
            <li>but my teeth do feel really clean.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste gives you the clean fro!m</li>

            <li>I have never felt my teeth so clean.</li>
            <li>Even after leaving the dentist my gums and teeth never felt this clean.</li>
            <li>Given this purported to clean your teeth too, I figured it had to have some stuff closer to the stronger things the dentist uses.  </li>
            <li>It does not taste as minty as the toothpaste I was used to using but it does make my mouth feel clean.</li>
            <li>Clean, clean, clean.</li>
            <li>no pain AND clean teeth.  </li>
            <li>The clean lasts through the night and if I forget my morning brushing or don&#x27;t have time, the clean feeling lasts well into the afternoon .</li>
            <li>While this product made my teeth feel clean, I didn&#x27;t see any difference in the color of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>My teeth still felt clean</li>
            <li>My teeth were amazingly clean every day.  </li>
            <li>After using it, my teeth are slippery and feel really clean, I just didn&#x27;t like the added sensitivity I had from long-term use.  </li>
            <li>but they did feel clean.</li>
            <li>Before using this I would always feel like my toothpaste didn&#x27;t get my teeth completely clean.</li>
            <li>But after using this I can&#x27;t believe how clean my teeth feel.</li>
            <li>the ultra clean mouth feel you get after use.</li>
            <li>a fully clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>in makes sense - clean your teeth then polish &amp; whiten.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Your teeth feel clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li>and I felt like my teeth were clean after this</li>
            <li>I think it is a lot more convenient than trying to remember to do white strips, and I think it is as effective at whitening.</li>
            <li>I did feel like my mouth was clean</li>
            <li>It made my teeth feel squeaky clean.</li>

            <li>My teeth feel amazingly clean.</li>
            <li>My mouth felt clean all day...and still feels clean every day.</li>
            <li>the whole process is much more comfortable than whitening strips.  </li>
            <li>For me, I felt like it gave that fresh-from-the-dentist clean feeling, and that lasted each day.</li>
            <li>Fresh breath, white teeth, and that clean feeling all the time are all great things in toothpaste.</li>

            <li>My mouth/teeth did not feel as clean after using that toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>My mouth feels extremely clean; I&#x27;ll continue using this toothpaste.</li>

            <li>My teeth feel so clean afterwards</li>
            <li>One thing I liked about these products is that you feel more inclined to brush for longer; they recommend 3 minutes total of brushing (1 for the cleansing, and 2 for the purifying gel).  </li>
            <li>My mouth felt really clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li>However, my mouth still feels clean after using the HD system.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t give this product 5 stars because while step 1 makes your teeth and mouth feel clean as hell it also dries your mouth out.  </li>
            <li>I received this toothpaste for free and I cannot say enough good things about Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste.</li>
            <li>clean feeling even lasts through the night so that never once did I wake up with &amp;#34;morning breath mouth&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even better, I got to evaluate the product for free thanks to Crest.  </li>
            <li>I was initially given this kit for free to try this toothpaste out, but loved it so much I ended up buying 4 more kits to have available when I run out.</li>
            <li>my mouth, even after meals, remain clean until my bedtime brushing.</li>
            <li>I received the product for free (BzzAgent/Crest HD Sponsored) and was intrigued by the bold &amp;#34;6x whiter in a week&amp;#34; label.  </li>
            <li>I was able to try Crest pro health HD toothpaste for free thanks to Crest.  </li>
            <li>(what my dentist recommends no matter which toothpaste I use) clean for 1 min polish for another.</li>
            <li>When I get finished brushing, my teeth and gums feel squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>I have never had a toothpaste clean as well as this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an overly mint-y toothpaste, so don&#x27;t expect that &amp;#34;refreshed&amp;#34; feeling in your mouth, but it does leave them feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that sort of clean</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to people who wanted a multi-purpose, affordable way to whiten their teeth while at the same time having more effective cleaning.</li>
            <li>When I am done brushing my teeth and my whole mouth overall feel incredibly clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product free thanks to Crest and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt clean and polished.</li>
            <li>I am so glad Bzzagent chose me to  try it free thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li>Now that build up is all but erased, and his smile looks great and white!  </li>
            <li>The flavor is not overpowering, yet my mouth feels clean all day.</li>
            <li>I remember the 1st time I used my electric toothbrush and my teeth felt like silk - so polished and clean</li>
            <li>Once the gel combined with the cleanser, my mouth was already feeling extremely clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how this great system will affect my smile within the next week.</li>
            <li>My teeth never felt this clean after a brush.</li>
            <li>I read the directions which were not only easy to understand but easy to locate as the package and both tubes are labeled effectively.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my teeth feeling so clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt clean, looked clean, and we&#x27;re super-smooth.</li>
            <li>The step 1 toothpaste is used to clean your teeth and remove plaque.</li>
            <li>My mouth has never felt so clean...</li>
            <li>i was lucky to sample this product for free from CREST thru BuzzAgent -</li>
            <li>I was able to try it free thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel about as clean as they do after a dental cleaning.</li>
            <li>I also like how the toothpaste makes my mouth feel clean.</li>
            <li>I know I will continue to use this product because my teeth never felt this clean before</li>
            <li>so I figured I have a clean slate to start this journey on.</li>
            <li>It is actually more effective than sodium fluoride because not only does it strengthen teeth, it is also antimicrobial!</li>
            <li>It leaves your mouth with a dentist-esque clean.</li>
            <li>I had to go to the dentist and have them clean my teeth to get the stains off.</li>
            <li>My teeth did feel clean after brushing and had the feeling of going to the dentist.</li>
            <li>However I don&#x27;t think the benefit of a clean feeling outweighs the increased sensitivity and lack of whitening.</li>
            <li>but it is super important.</li>
            <li>I received this FREE PRODUCT thanks to Crest and I am completely in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed how whiter my teeth were and how clean my mouth felt.  </li>
            <li>but I do like the clean feeling.</li>
            <li>white.&lt;br /&gt;Super clean mouth?</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel as clean.</li>
            <li>So I had a chance to pick this up for free, because it really sounded interesting</li>
            <li>I will say that my teeth feel clean after use</li>
            <li>I tend to have more sensitive gums than many others, so I didn&#x27;t want to firebomb this</li>
            <li>my mouth still feels clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean</li>
            <li>Step 1 is intended to clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li>were literally squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>I felt like my teeth stayed cleaner longer during the day and in the morning I woke with them feeling clean still.  </li>
            <li>They never felt clean and I also seem to have a film on my teeth (maybe from the step 2).  </li>
            <li>but my mouth doesn&#x27;t feel as clean anymore....</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest, I have been able to try this product for FREE through BzzAgent.  </li>

            <li>My mouth has never felt so clean before.</li>

            <li>I like the clean feeling that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I like the clean feeling that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>And that clean feeling lasts for hours!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The spray got everywhere and it just became a hassle to clean up..</li>
            <li>And even though the molars do not feel completely clean all day, they still feel cleaner than they did before using this product.</li>
            <li>but it does give a clean feeling in the mouth when I run my tongue over my teeth.</li>

            <li>I think that I have never before used a toothpaste or cleaning system that has made my teeth feel so clean as Pro Health HD.</li>
            <li>What I found is that the toothpaste works well to clean my teeth</li>
            <li>This two-step system which includes a purifying cleaner and perfecting gel does work to clean and brighten your teeth.  </li>
            <li>process makes you feel clean and your teeth feel</li>
            <li>and they always feel squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>That said, it does get my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>I never felt like I got my teeth as clean as they could be...</li>
            <li>My mouth feels so clean afterwards, like going to the dentist.</li>
            <li>Step 2 almost feels like relief gel because step 1 gets the teeth really clean.  </li>
            <li>It makes your teeth feel clean</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so shiny and clean after using this product...</li>
            <li>I got the Crest Pro-HD product free as part of a promotion from the brand but love the product so much I have stocked up on it for the rest of the family.  </li>
            <li>My teeth felt like they were clean by a dentist.  </li>
            <li>&quot; clean when I rinse with mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>; clean after using it.</li>
            <li>I was able to try if for free thanks to CREST.</li>
            <li>It is super smooth and makes them sparkly</li>
            <li>This one has a focus on plaque removal and gives you that really CLEAN feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2: is the gel that gives your mouth a thoroughly clean feeling.</li>
            <li>but truly whiter and SQUEAKY clean, without a doubt.</li>
            <li>love the pro Health toothpaste in the 2 step kit, it is much better than the regular Crest Pro Health Whitening Toothpaste, it removes the plaques better giving a nice smooth clean feel on the teeth and leaves my breath fresh longer, also while brushing it foams more than the regular one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use my electric toothbrush to help me time the application of each paste (it beeps every 30 seconds) and find both pastes pleasant enough.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant taste that is reminiscent of wintergreen altoids.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant taste that is reminiscent of wintergreen altoids.</li>
            <li>Another thing I liked was how the directions were very clearly written on the backs of both tubes so you didn&#x27;t have to keep the box.</li>
            <li>It had a nice minty flavor that wasn&#x27;t too strong, and it left my mouth feeling super clean!</li>
            <li>Not only did they feel great moments after brushing but the WHOLE day my teeth felt clean, even after eating &amp; drinking!</li>
            <li>I regularly use another competing whitening toothpaste and received this to try for free, so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because it whitens better or just does a better job of creating a more brilliant luster.</li>
            <li>I went into this positive for most whiteners in my opinion do not work well.</li>
            <li>I can barely get one step done on most days before but now, after feeling the incredible clean feeling after the two steps, I will NEVER go back!!  </li>
            <li>after the first use, my teeth did feel very clean.</li>
            <li>I love that I get a cleaner feel that lasts longer, and my teeth are whiter, but not a fake bright white.  </li>
            <li>I was very interested in trying this two-step toothpaste when I got a free sample.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other whitening products before that didn&#x27;t yield results this good, this quickly, or this easily!</li>
            <li>Before I review this product I think there should be full disclosure, I was able to try this product free thanks to a promotion by Crest.</li>
            <li>The Crest Pro Health® HD™ is a good product but not a long term toothpaste for me.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have had my teeth cleaned professionally every day and love it!</li>
            <li>Total win, right?</li>
            <li>So I was most definitely whistling a different tune when my hygienist told me how beautiful my teeth looked and gave me a clean bill of health with no scraping whatsoever!</li>
            <li>Let me first start off by saying that I was a very lucky girl that I got to try this for free from P&amp;G.  </li>
            <li>It only takes two minutes each morning and night for a clean and bright smile!  </li>
            <li>It works much better than other whitening products I have tried and is very easy to use!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely incredible how clean they feel, but I am a little worried about the whitening portion.  </li>
            <li>so my teeth can look stained easily, but this toothpaste cleaned it right</li>
            <li>Pretty excited about this process!</li>
            <li>Do you like a bright, white smile!  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and does not require any more time than a regular toothpaste but the effects are phenomenal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to fit this into your morning and evening routine and it&#x27;s kind of addictive because it works so well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Crest Pro-Health HD for about a month now and am pleased to say that I see significantly reduced plaque buildup and much whiter teeth.  </li>
            <li>I was reading through the other reviews and most seemed not so good</li>
            <li>When I read that it would take a week to see results I honestly didn&#x27;t think that would happen, but my own family made a comment that my teeth looked &amp;#34;really white.&amp;#34; I used other Crest toothpaste</li>
            <li>you can afford the cost (which is considerably less than a dental cleaning), I believe that this is the best home treatment available both for real cleaning and for whitening.</li>
            <li>Really gets the mouth feeling so fresh and clean!!</li>
            <li>most certainly made my teeth whiter.</li>
            <li>If you love that just from the dentist feeling, you will certainly get it from this toothpaste system</li>
            <li>Years ago I switched from Listerine to Crest mouthwash and my teeth became so stained that the dentist had to use a special ultrasonic cleaning system on me to get them off.</li>
            <li>today,&amp;#34; without even remembering that I was using a special toothpaste.</li>
            <li>so I have not noticed any special whitening powers after a week of use.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice the part 2 doing anything special for my teeth though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not anything special either in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any special dental needs i.e. sensitivity, but do feel that I have thinner enamel.</li>
            <li>This product worked right away!  </li>
            <li>When I got my kit in the mail, I wanted to start using it right away!  </li>
            <li>My wife noticed right away!</li>
            <li>I felt and saw the difference right away!</li>
            <li>So treat them right!</li>
            <li>so the price was right!  </li>
            <li>I am not obligated to give a positive review, and my evaluation is honest and is based on my own personal experience.ng period.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I am not obligated to give a positive review, and my evaluation is honest and is based on my own personal experience.</li>
            <li>I was given the opportunity to try CREST HD for free and at first I was nervous because it was a two step process, but I got over that quickly because of how great my mouth felt the next day.</li>
            <li>But I will say that it is by far the easiest, simplest, most straightforward teeth whitening system that I have ever used!</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of Crest Pro-Health HD 2-step (Thanks CREST!!)</li>
            <li>Another bright spot is that it leaves your mouth feeling ridiculously clean even without following with a mouthwash.</li>
            <li>every use my mouth feels fresh and clean and my teeth feel smooth as glass.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Crest PH Advanced has a fresh clean taste.</li>
            <li>My whole mouth feels clean and healthy..</li>
            <li>I love how clean my teeth feel after brushing with Crest Pro-Health HD, but I really haven&#x27;t seen any whitening after a week of use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an overwhelmingly minty flavor which I do tend to prefer and it doesn&#x27;t really foam up, but, my mouth did feel extremely clean.  </li>
            <li>however it was quite a quick process and the the sensation was actually quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>I had been using a particular brand of toothpaste for 10+ years and had not found anything that even compared to it until I was able to try Crest HD for free as a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li>I really loved the clean feeling it left in my mouth.</li>
            <li>I loved the clean feel it left</li>
            <li>This toothpaste after the first use gave me a just left the dentist clean feeling that I hadn&#x27;t experienced in years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was super excited to try this toothpaste out</li>
            <li>I was super excited to try this product</li>
            <li>I will say I was super excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>I was super excited when Bzzagent sent me</li>
            <li>/&gt;Flavor: I wasn&#x27;t super excited about the flavor.  </li>
            <li>If the results are the most important thing for you, then I highly recommend Crest Pro Health HD.</li>
            <li>Most important feature is efficacy, and I say in this category Crest Pro Health HD scores high.</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t think the 2nd step tastes very good, but it&#x27;s not awful either.</li>
            <li>I used it this morning (~ 6:30am) and my teeth still have that clean smooth feel right now (~ 4:30pm).</li>
            <li>am excited to finish out Pro-Health HD to really see results, but as of now, I would recommend this product because it makes my teeth feel very clean after I use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now, and while I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference in the whiteness of my teeth, I do feel like my smile is brighter</li>
            <li>bright white</li>
            <li>We received a product package free from Crest and tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;After a week&#x27;s time my teeth were whiter colored and my mouth really was feeling more fresh and clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a week of using Crest Pro Health HD I noticed a difference in my smile and teeth color, and now after 4 weeks, I have noticed a huge difference....</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a huge whitening effect but did have a noticeably cleaner smile.  </li>
            <li>As far as whitening, I haven&#x27;t noticed anything amazing there, but I&#x27;m still going to give it some time.</li>
            <li>I use the mouth wash too and my teeth stay white and bright.  </li>
            <li>My teeth, while still bright and shiny, are definitely whiter than they have been in years.</li>
            <li>while I feel that I&#x27;m still not seeing bright teeth, it is definitely whiter than what I had.</li>
            <li>This cleaning provides a great surface for the Step 2 whitening paste to whiten your teeth with results definitely visible after the first application.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do as great a job in whitening as I had expected.  </li>
            <li>and I know that my teeth don&#x27;t always look bright and white.  </li>
            <li>My smile is dazzling white, after just two weeks of using the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I was definitely interested in trying Pro Health® HD(tm) being a regular coffee drinker, so I was happy to get a sample of the product as part of a promotion from Crest.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone willing to sacrifice time and taste for a more powerful brushing session.</li>
            <li>I did notice my teeth were becoming more sensitive</li>
            <li>I must say, I am a huge fan of the super clean and ultra fresh feeling that I get in my mouth once I am done brushing with this two step system.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as white and bright as they claimed but there was a noticeable difference.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>On top of just feeling overall great, my teeth have whitened considerably.  </li>
            <li>I prefer to brush my teeth for a full 2 minutes with the &#x27;step 1&#x27; to get an adequate clean and cavity prevention, and 1 minute with the &#x27;step 2&#x27; whitening paste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Step 1 leaves your teeth feeling super clean, and Step 2 helps lift and remove stains.  </li>
            <li>The good news is, my teeth did get whiter, but how the toothpaste and gel made my mouth feel left me not wanting to continue use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After over a week of brushing morning and night with both Step one and two, I can confidently say that it really does work.</li>
            <li>I do feel like my teeth are super clean</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re supposed to brush with each paste for one full minute each, with no rinsing in between.  </li>
            <li>I received Crest Pro-Health HD for free complimentary of BzzAgent as part of my bzzAgent campaign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very concerned about keeping my gums healthy.</li>
            <li>My teeth are not noticeably whiter, but to be fair, my teeth are naturally very white.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this is a good product, just maybe not for anyone with OCD.</li>
            <li>The tooth paste (step 1) was very minty and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Thanks Crest for the free sample!</li>
            <li>This product left my teeth feeling and looking good, but there were some things about the product that I&#x27;m not 100% sold on.</li>
            <li>Thanks to BzzAgent, I get to try it for free!</li>
            <li>After using step one, my teeth felt super clean.  </li>
            <li>I really have enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li>After just 1 week we both noticed that our teeth felt much cleaner and the shade had more brightness.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see how they feel after a full week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was provided with a full sized sample of crest ProHealth HD from the BzzAgent program.  </li>
            <li>My mouth tingled a bit after use, but it was not painful at all.  </li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t take any more time than what I was doing before.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel super clean however</li>
            <li>So, while it&#x27;s a cool product/concept, it didn&#x27;t provide the advertised benefits for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a bzz agent and recieved a full size product for sample.</li>
            <li>Also, why is this toothpaste so sweet?</li>
            <li>you can get a good deal on this, or you have really yellow teeth</li>
            <li>you can get a good deal on this, or you have really yellow teeth</li>
            <li>Thanks for letting me try this out for free!</li>
            <li>Full disclaimer, I received a sample of this to test.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write many reviews so that should tell you how much I like it.  </li>
            <li>But instead, think of these as two separate brushings, each requiring the full amount(give or take a bit)</li>
            <li>I used it for a week and it really made my teeth whiter :)</li>
            <li>So when I was offered the chance to try Crest Pro Health HD for free through BzzAgent.com, I figured it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t a challenge to brush for the full 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Full disclosure:  </li>
            <li>Gives me the feeling that my teeth are super clean.  </li>
            <li>I received a full sized product as part of te BZZ Agent campaign going on</li>
            <li>I was able to try this free with BzzAgent but will gladly pay to keep using it in the future!</li>
            <li>I received a full size product to test and review as part of a campaign.</li>
            <li>Received a full size sample of Crest Prohealth HD from the maker.  </li>
            <li>although I have yet to have a dental cleaning so whether my dentist says anything will be the true test for me).  </li>
            <li>far I&#x27;ve really liked these.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest for inviting me to try this product for free!</li>
            <li>I loved the idea that I could potentially have whiter teeth without the cost of going to a dentist.  </li>
            <li>I really think it makes them 6x more brighter?</li>
            <li>As an extra benefit, the tube that has the whitener tastes good.</li>
            <li>I received this as a BZZ Agent, but I will continue to buy it because I love it so much.</li>
            <li>After a full week, I cannot believe the difference.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product for another 4 weeks to get the full effect</li>
            <li>Overall good product as all crest products, but</li>
            <li>After a full week&#x27;s trial, did I see the 6X brightness, as promised on the box?</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this, but I had to stop using it because it was tearing up my gums with its abrasive material.</li>
            <li>Full disclosure</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t require any more time than your usual brushing so it will fit perfectly in your busy routine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan, I love this system, because it has given me a lot of power over the cleaning of my mouth, and that I really feel a seense of ownership.</li>
            <li>I received a full size sample of this as a member of bzzagent.  </li>
            <li>Full disclosure</li>
            <li>One full minute for each toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>A downside was that it is time consuming to use, if you follow the directions and brush for the full 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest, I got to try Crest Pro-Health HD for free!</li>
            <li>I found the two step process a bit cumbersome because of the no rinsing after brushing for a full minute.</li>
            <li>: This disciplines me to brush for a full two minutes.</li>
            <li>The good thing is that it didn&#x27;t contain enough SLS to cause a reaction to it!</li>
            <li>I have to plug Crest as I received it for free, but it is very much worth</li>
            <li>I will stick with my Colgate all in one whitening toothpaste but it was a good experience to get to try a different brand.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not such a good thing</li>
            <li>Thanks for letting me try this product for free, Crest!</li>
            <li>Full disclosure</li>
            <li>And my teeth feel SUPER clean as well.</li>
            <li>All in all a good product with definite results</li>
            <li>it forces you to take the full 2 minutes to brush your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Really works and affordable price (even better</li>
            <li>Not as good as the white strips.</li>
            <li>You have to brush with this for a full minute</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest for inviting me to try this product for free!</li>
            <li>My mouth felt super clean.  </li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better product for toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>else I just don&#x27;t feel like the toothpaste is good enough.  </li>
            <li>Tastes good, no gritty aftertaste.</li>
            <li>I will admit this toothpaste did such a good job cleaning and whitening my teeth</li>
            <li>I will absolutely go buy more when this runs out.  </li>
            <li>All in all a good product that I will likely purchase again.</li>
            <li>would like to say thanks to BZZZZ  and crest for allowing me test this product for free!</li>
            <li>After using for 4 days, my mouth is full of sores, had to buy anbesol.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel super clean and I can feel my gums getting Treatment also.</li>
            <li>&amp; I haven&#x27;t even been using the product a full week yet.</li>
            <li>Of course it will last longer that way and still does a good job.</li>
            <li>The only thing I dislike about Crest Pro Health® HD(tm) is that the toothpaste stage doesn&#x27;t foam up as good as others on the market.</li>
            <li>The Step 1 toothpaste has a sweet, minty flavor.</li>
            <li>This stuff is real, and better than advertised.</li>
            <li>Thanks to BzzAgent, I was able to try this 2-step whitening toothpaste by Crest (Crest Pro Health HD).</li>
            <li>Full disclosure:  </li>
            <li>Now step 2, the whiting/polishing gel is a cool product.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest, I am to try the Crest Pro-Health HD for free!</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest, I was able to try Crest Pro-Health HD two-step toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>My mouth feels super clean after I use it.  </li>
            <li>Full disclosure</li>
            <li>Love this produce and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>(that is if you are brushing your teeth for a full 2 minutes like you&#x27;re supposed to)  </li>
            <li>I loved the flavor and especially knowing that I was doing something proactive to improve the health of my teeth/mouth.</li>
            <li>I received a full sized sample of the Crest Pro-Health HD two-step system.  </li>
            <li>I feel confident that I will continue to use Crest Pro-Health HD, since it does the job and does it really well.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see much whitening , but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a BzzAgent and got a full size CrestPro Health HD to try and report on.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest and BzzAgent for allowing me to try this product for free!</li>
            <li>The polishing tube has somewhat of a metallic taste, but like I mentioned, my teeth felt super clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>The super clean feeling lasts all day too.</li>
            <li>Could all the hype I’d read about this Crest product really be true ??  </li>
            <li>Add step-2 to your brush and continue to brush all surfaces of your teeth a additional full minute.</li>
            <li>However my review is true and unbiased.</li>
            <li>However my review is true and unbiased.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m loving it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have always loved having white teeth.</li>
            <li>The taste is fresh--like baking soda, nothing too cloying or sweet.</li>
            <li>brushing alone helped some, but I still didn&#x27;t always feel like my mouth felt super clean.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t look necessarily whiter, but they feel good.</li>
            <li>Before I used this product, I really didn&#x27;t believe it would do what it claims - and more.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how much whitening gel to use.</li>
            <li>Overall, this was easier to use than strips and saved time with good results.</li>
            <li>According to my dentist my teeth are in good shape and they are marble white; however I wanted to try this product in order to make them whiter as advertise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest for giving me the opportunity to try this product for free!</li>
            <li>Super Clean, no plague, even after overnight, and</li>
            <li>It seems effective so far</li>
            <li>This rushing led to me to stick with the tried and true 1 step brushing process.  </li>
            <li>As far as the taste goes the step 1 paste was a nice minty flavor</li>
            <li>&gt; - Super clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Crest also uses real plastic specs...polyethylene in many of their toothpastes that get embedded in gums.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s where the toothpaste may be worth the money, my teeth are so smooth and stay that way all day.</li>
            <li>I would say that I have seen several shades improvement, which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Summary: Overall, I think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Summary: Overall, I think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>Good overall product.  </li>
            <li>I also feel that the 2 step process helps to force me to brush for a full 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>I loved that both the tubes had different color to avoid confusion (like the step 1 one had</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using the two-step system for about a week, I cannot say for sure that it has whitened my teeth, as I did not take a before photo or intensely study the color of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>and I think that my teeth feel super clean and have dramatically whitened.  </li>
            <li>Sweet tea and coffee are a must have, but they cause a lot of staining.</li>
            <li>That way you get the full whitening effect.</li>
            <li>So far I am thrilled with the purifying stage</li>
            <li>However my review is true and unbiased.</li>
            <li>I love the 2 step process and how it really made a difference in the way my mouth feels.  </li>
            <li>I do not Smoke, drink Coffee or tea, so m teeth are ussually in good shape, but sometimes need freshened up a bit on the white factor regardless.</li>
            <li>(I probably used to cut corners and not brush for the full 1-2 minutes a dentist recommends.)</li>
            <li>Minty, fresh, and smooth.</li>
            <li>Since my teeth are already white and in good condition, I probably would not purchase this product once I use this up.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest for letting me try this for free!</li>
            <li>My teeth were definitely cleaner, and looked good to me.</li>
            <li>So I just go the full 2mins for each step.</li>
            <li>item truly deserves full 5 stars and serves up to the expectations.</li>
            <li>The time requirements (a min for step 1 and then for step 2) could be a bit tricky as most people don&#x27;t really have a timer for their teeth brushing.</li>
            <li>After using the product for a couple of days the two step process was not bad at all</li>
            <li>It is not nearly as bad as the whitening strips or anything that I have received from the dentist, so I am not too worried about using it.</li>
            <li>Not bad, just noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>The taste of the toothpaste and the gel are not bad.</li>
            <li>but it is not a bad tasting toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>The 2 step process is not bad at all.</li>
            <li>The whitening gel has a peroxide flavor, but is not bad.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are not really bad stained</li>
            <li>But I found myself being very diligent to make sure I was brushing with each product for a full minute.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not bad though...</li>
            <li>The other thing that I want to brag about this toothpaste is the clean feeling that I have experienced all day, even around my permanent retainers and after meals.</li>
            <li>Leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean, not to mention my family and friends around me have noticed my brighter smile!</li>
            <li>, it’s a quick and easy process and whitens and brightens my smile and makes my mouth feel fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>I could totally tell a difference after the very first time I used this product, I honestly felt like I just walked out of the dentist office, my teeth were squeaky clean!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing - way easier to use than whitening trays and so so easy to incorporate into my daily brushing routine.  </li>
            <li>Easy way to get a whiter smile and a fresh feeling</li>
            <li>It lasts more than a month and a half, which is good for the money.</li>
            <li>This is a nice change from trays and strips for whitening and easy to work into your daily routine.</li>
            <li>it was eye catching and extremely easy to open.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t turn them super white which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>The product came in a nice and easy to open package.</li>
            <li>I had the opportunity to try Crest Pro-Health HD Daily as a free sample from Crest and it is unique and effective.</li>
            <li>my most recent dental exam was the first of many with zero cavities!</li>
            <li>is that the first tube has a flip top and the second one you use has a twist top!</li>
            <li>With crest pro-Heath HD I noticed a significant difference after the first 2 minute treatment !</li>
            <li>best part, no sensitivity like whiteness in the past!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m even consistently brushing twice a day (in the spirit of full disclosure, I didn&#x27;t always do)!</li>
            <li>My mouth also felt fresh afterwards which again was a HUGE win for me over other products.</li>
            <li>I quickly filled them in on Crest Pro-Health HD and  couple of them ran right out to get their own.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my teeth never feel smooth like they do right after a dental cleaning when my teeth are polished, until now.  </li>
            <li>they feel smooth and feel VERY clean after using this vs normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t want to have a clean and bright smile with white teeth?  </li>
            <li>Want some really clean teeth along with a bright white smile to match?</li>
            <li>The mint flavor in both pastes is sweet and mild and I found the 2 step process novel and</li>
            <li>The instructions were so simple and the best part is that it promises not only to clean the teeth and freshen breath</li>
            <li>The kit is really easy to use just brush with the first tube for 1 minute.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and fast results!</li>
            <li>I will say that this system is pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy and fast!</li>
            <li>One is a flip (the first) and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>So I was pretty excited when I had the opportunity to try it out for free from Crest.  </li>
            <li>Neither were as refreshing as a normal mint paste or gel, so I was excited to rinse after step 2.  </li>
            <li>quite surprisingly my teeth were actually whiter after the very first use.  </li>
            <li>After the very first brushing, my teeth felt like I had just left the dentists&#x27; office ( the good feel).</li>
            <li>I had no sensitivity during or after use, and the product should last for more than one month, so it is a good deal if you want better than average whitening, and you want to keep your gums healthy.  </li>
            <li>Although I initially received this product for free (thanks, BuzzAgent), I have since purchased this using my own money because I am so pleased with the results from using this product.</li>
            <li>(I compare my first time to getting my braces removed- so smooth and clean feeling</li>
            <li>I noticed from the first time I used it how smooth and clean my teeth felt.  </li>
            <li>Your teeth are smooth and clean and your teeth really look whiter!</li>
            <li>When I received the product, I was not very impressed with the flimsy packaging, but though hey it was free I best give it a try.</li>
            <li>My teeth are much whiter and feel very clean.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any sensitivity as I had with other whitening products.</li>
            <li>Step 1 is a sort of blue toothpaste to first clean off all of the plaque and bacteria in your mouth, and had a pleasant minty taste and texture.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced that with any other oral hygiene product and for someone who loves oral hygiene</li>
            <li>I was initially not very confident on the outcome but after trying it I was simply impressed.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the first step, the toothpaste seemed somehow better than regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>This 2 tube combination has greatly improved the whiteness of my teeth unlike any other product I have tried unsuccessfully.</li>
            <li>My smile is a bit brighter but not as significant as the packaging claims.</li>
            <li>From the first time using the easy two-step process, my mouth felt so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>While some other whitening toothpastes are too harsh/strong for me and irritate my gums/mouth, I am happy to say that this product did not.</li>
            <li>They looked pretty good and the whole experience was much easier than wearing whitening strips or going to the dentist.  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased they came out with this new product, and I can&#x27;t wait to see my smile in a week!  </li>
            <li>I love my new smile!</li>
            <li>I am more confident while smiling and love it, but there is a down side.</li>
            <li>I am a great person to test products as I am truthful and hard to impress.</li>
            <li>Maybe a shade whiter, but not significant enough for me to consider this a &amp;#34;whitening product.&amp;#34; Still, I love the clean feeling and the taste, so I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li>Love this new paste!</li>
            <li>But the results are certainly there!!</li>
            <li>My mouth feels fresh and clean when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li>teeth felt “fresh from the dentist” clean after two minutes, instead of 30 minutes in the dental hygienist chair.</li>
            <li>and my mouth doesn&#x27;t feel clean or minty fresh.</li>
            <li>It makes my mouth feel fresh and clean while it makes my teeth whiter.</li>
            <li>Leaves teeth feeling fresh and clean.</li>

            <li>if you just want clean teeth and gums and a &amp;#34;somewhat&amp;#34; whiter smile.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had problems with whitening products making my teeth super sensitive, but I have not noticed any sensitive teeth issues with this product which is great.  </li>
            <li>It made my mouth feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>although it keeps my mouth fresh n clean all day</li>
            <li>The 1st gel  cleans my teeth and gives me fresh breath and the clean feeling I like from a toothpaste.  </li>

            <li>but they feel clean and fresh all day.</li>
            <li>You know that fresh and clean feeling you get after the dentist?</li>
            <li>my brushing habit tends to be quick in the morning.</li>
            <li>I really believe Crest Pro-Health HD makes my smile better.</li>
            <li>what I like most about the whole process with this product is that it&#x27;s actually FUN to brush with one product for a minute, followed by another for a minute.</li>
            <li>nothing in my experience works that quickly.</li>
            <li>quickly overcame my skepticism after brushing.  </li>
            <li>Love the product and can already see an improvement in the coloring of my teeth, funny taste to get used to at first though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Crest Pro Health® HD for about a week now, thanks to a fantastic free sample I receive in the mail from Bzz Agent.  </li>
            <li>The two-step toothpaste is an inexpensive, efficient way to get your bright smile back.</li>
            <li>quickly overcame my skepticism after brushing.</li>
            <li>I almost felt like I used a mild sand paper to buff out my teeth</li>
            <li>This a quick alternative to whitening strips.  </li>
            <li>I recently switched to a sonicare electric toothbrush from a regular toothbrush and this toothpaste system seems to be perfect for it.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m doubly happy and we are both smiling a lot more lately.</li>
            <li>However, both of these concern quickly became a non-issue.  </li>
            <li>I got to try this out for free from Crest through BzzAgent, and so far I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li>This is a quick, 2-step process.  </li>
            <li>I had been wanting to do my annual Crest White Strips, but I was low on cash and hoped that HD would be just as awesome.</li>
            <li>I am a long-time Crest customer and am loyal to the brand.</li>
            <li>I was suprised at the quick results.</li>
            <li>I now use it 1 week a month just to help keep my teeth from getting super stained and I like it for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>I like my routine to be quick.</li>
            <li>But quickly goes away once</li>
            <li>However, using this product quickly changed my mind.  </li>
            <li>(Never thought I&#x27;d say that being a loyal Colgate user)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this is a great product, but would caution those with sensitive teeth since they might not be able to use and enjoy it as much as others.  </li>
            <li>i can only expect that with more prolonged use, more whitening will occur.  </li>
            <li>My smile is so bright and white from the Crest Pro-Health HD.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from the improved whiteness of my test, Crest Pro Health HD has made a tremendous difference in the way my teeth feel.</li>
            <li>You will notice a difference quickly with this Two Step Toothpaste.</li>
            <li>but I quickly got used to it once my mouth and teeth started to feel cleaner and look whiter.</li>
            <li>nothing in my experience works that quickly.</li>
            <li>This product works for whiting and it also made my mouth feel overall more healthy.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health DH Daily Two-Step Toothpaste to try for free, and then I am to give my honest opinion about the product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it over a week and really like that my smile seems brighter, but without any of the sensitivity associated with many whitening products.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s quickly smoothed away during Step 2.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, the Crest Pro-Health HD kit is more affordable than the whitening strips or a professional whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, you get decent value out of the kit since you would end up paying much more money by buying a separate toothpaste and whitening strips.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take me any more time than regular teeth brushing. :)</li>
            <li>I was not sure what to think or expect when I signed up to try this product through BzzAgent, but it was a pleasant surprise!  </li>
            <li>Luckily I use a Sonicare that counts off minutes</li>
            <li>I had some whiteness on my gums that went away quickly and the packaging does warn you about this.</li>
            <li>I always sing a song in my head for each minute of brushing and the time passes by quickly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have super yellowed teeth or anything</li>
            <li>I was lucky to receive this product to try and review for Crest Pro Health.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m super picky about chemicals I put into my mouth</li>
            <li>and I have seen a tremendous difference.</li>
            <li>so I am thrilled to have a complete smile of healthier, whiter teeth.</li>
            <li>However, it would have been nice to have received a tooth color chart to really know how much the whitening is progressing.</li>
            <li>and I noticed that the surface stains were gone rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>-I got over this quickly</li>
            <li>I would challenge them to try this product out as it left me feeling more confident that I did not have morning breath.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from the improved whiteness of my test, Crest Pro Health HD has made a tremendous difference in the way my teeth feel.</li>
            <li>Whitening is evident when used consistently, but I am not so sure about the &amp;#34;6x&amp;#34; claim.  </li>
            <li>But I quickly got used to that and didn&#x27;t find it bothersome.  </li>
            <li>Sure, sure I can open it before I get started and close it after I am all done, but that&#x27;s not how I operate and</li>
            <li>Adequate toothbrushing may prevent these stains which are not harmful or permanent and may be removed by your dentist.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a pretty interesting product in that it is the first time</li>
            <li>Crest was kind enough to furnish me a free sample to try and it is a rarity.</li>
            <li>The whiting formula works quickly also.</li>
            <li>As part of a promotion from Crest I was able to receive CREST PRO HEALTH® HD™ for free and all I can say is wow.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this two step tooth paste for anybody that is looking to get rid of some stains and actually have a healthy feeling smiles through most of the day.  </li>
            <li>I would brush my teeth straight after breakfast and most days depending on what I was eating or drink, i.e. not too much dairy, I had the smooth clean feeling until I got to dinner at 6-7 pm at night.  </li>
            <li>Here is a quick list of the pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>It is a metallic taste that doesn&#x27;t dissipate quickly.</li>
            <li>4 stars, because I don&#x27;t think the two tubes is super convenient for travel</li>
            <li>My spouse even noticed immediately and was impressed with the whitening power in such a short time!  </li>
            <li>Could not believe how quickly it whitened my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Quick results.</li>
            <li>quickly overcame my skepticism after brushing.</li>
            <li>Super easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I had to keep sneaking in a quick glance in the mirror to believe it.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great product and I highly recommend using it!</li>
            <li>Using Crest Pro Health HD daily removes the surface stains and keeps my smile bright.</li>
            <li>My teeth not only look better but they feel better.</li>
            <li>Best part is, not only does the feeling last all day, it also noticeably whitens your teeth as well!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t notice super noticeable results for whitening</li>
            <li>As the days went on, it only got better and better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Regarding the whitening claims, before I started using the product I had noticed some mild yellowing along the bottom row.  </li>
            <li>I felt that the product cleared that up fairly quickly, within a couple of days of use.  </li>
            <li>It is a quick 2 step system, rather than an overnight or 30 minute whitening strip.</li>
            <li>, how could they fix that so quickly?</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Crest Pro Health HD whitening toothpaste for free to use and review from Crest via Bzzagent, and have only presented my honest opinions on the product as a consumer..</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Crest Pro Health HD whitening toothpaste for free to use and review from Crest via Bzzagent, and have only presented my honest opinions on the product as a consumer.</li>
            <li>but I will definitely buy it on my own when my free sample runs out.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ll bet much brighter or not, but it was easy, works well, and that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky</li>
            <li>Also, because you brush one minute first with the ProHealth tube and then brush for one minute with the whitening/polishing gel, you are making sure that you&#x27;re brushing as much as your dentist recommends!</li>
            <li>I was quickly shown the difference:  </li>
            <li>So much easier and because of that I have been using this product regularly and getting great results.  </li>
            <li>I did receive this product free from the brand as part of a promotion, but I will definitely be repurchasing with my own money and recommending to everyone I know.</li>
            <li>Crest was nice enough to send me this for free.</li>
            <li>It feels really clean and fresh and my teeth were noticeably whiter and quickly too.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky to receive a promotional sample of this product.</li>
            <li>but now that I&#x27;m getting older and drinking more coffee, I can see some yellowing myself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super picky about how my toothpaste tastes, so I&#x27;ve always been a Colgate girl -</li>
            <li>The main thing, I think, is just to make sure you don&#x27;t rinse in between.</li>
            <li>I was quite surprised by this two step process, as it was very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It is not messy and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>All the steps are clearly written on both  tubes which is  very easy to understand.</li>
            <li>&gt; The instructions for use are clearly printed on each tube and are very easy to follow.</li>
            <li>I still give it 5 stars because of the clean feeling and overall healthy feeling of my mouth since using this product!</li>
            <li>I know that many others have high reviews of this product so perhaps I&#x27;m just the outlier</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone trying to better their smiles.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy it very much.  </li>
            <li>I really like the clean feeling, and it lasts ALL day, even after eating and drinking!</li>
            <li>Brushing with the first tube is pleasant enough.  </li>
            <li>Also, I have sensitive teeth and had been using a special toothpaste for sensitive teeth, so I was a bit worried about using this because I was concerned that my teeth would become more sensitive, but I&#x27;m happy to say that they didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>My husband had to try it right when we got it, and he also said he hasn&#x27;t felt his teeth feel so clean except</li>
            <li>, I could feel the clean difference right away.  </li>
            <li>The new toothpaste surely made my teeth feel clean and my mouth feel fresh for a longer time than usual.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the very first use, I noticed a very clean, fresh from the dentist feel throughout my whole mouth.  </li>
            <li>After the first use, I saw a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li>I saw results after the first use on day two there was a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference in the whiteness of my teeth, but I did feel like I had a much cleaner mouth after each brush!</li>
            <li>After the first time using Crest Pro Health® HD™, I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I found that my teeth sparkled from the very first use.</li>
            <li>Was excited because, &amp;#34;hey, free toothpaste!&amp;#34; but didn&#x27;t really have any expectations for it.</li>
            <li>I was/am very pleased with the total product - from the packaging to the tube to the product inside.</li>
            <li>I first tried this when I received a free product sample as part of the BzzAgent program and after three days of use</li>
            <li>White teeth is important to me but my enamel is more important.</li>
            <li>First, I would say that I received a trial of this product free from Crest as a buzzagent.</li>
            <li>In reality, I should probably be taking that long to brush my teeth normally, so maybe this is a good thing!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying this free thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li>This is the first whitening product I have ever used to.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>I am a Bzzagent and got this to try for free, thanks to Crest!  </li>
            <li>I received this toothpaste to try for free (thanks, Crest!)</li>
            <li>I tried this product for free - thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li>Gels work faster but are more intrusive to your normal brushing routine.</li>
            <li>but I have to say I noticed whiter teeth after the very first brushing.  </li>
            <li>I received my first box free from BzzAgents.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to get to try the Crest Pro Health HD system for free thanks to Crest.  </li>
            <li>It polished my teeth, and they were SO smooth after the first use.</li>
            <li>Happily, I liked this product and will probably use it more often, perhaps every other toothpaste purchase.  </li>
            <li>So for me to be able to get the same level of whitening to the crest strips in a much easier process is amazing.</li>
            <li>I have been using this toothpaste for FREE thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li>I was also glad that it did not cause tooth sensitivity, which normally whiters do for me.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say morning breath is nonexistent when I wake up, but it is definitely much better than normal.</li>
            <li>When I receive a Free Crest Pro-Health HD Kit  in the mail from Crest (thanks Crest!)</li>
            <li>The very first time I tried Crest Pro Health® HD</li>
            <li>Got it free to try thanks to crest and  bzzagent!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t require anything more than just brushing normally</li>
            <li>First off let me say that I did receive this product as a free sample from BzzAgent, but this is my opinion.  </li>
            <li>First of all, let me tell you that i received this product free to try from Crest.  </li>
            <li>From the very first brush, I felt like I had just been to the dentist.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very satisfied with my results.  </li>
            <li>The first night I tried after I received it for free from Crest</li>
            <li>As the other reviewers state - the wintergreen taste of tube one is nice and the gel taste in tube 2 is okay.</li>
            <li>From the first time I used this my teeth felt smooth</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I would say 6x, but its better than normal whitening</li>
            <li>I found after a few days that my top teeth were noticeably whiter than my bottom row but was able to correct this with more focuses brushing.</li>
            <li>I found after a few days that my top teeth were noticeably whiter than my bottom row but was able to correct this with more focuses brushing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying it free thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li>I have tried other whiteners before and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li>The toothpaste for step 1 is more abrasive than normal toothpaste and creates a cleaner feeling.</li>
            <li>And even though no one has complimented my white teeth I feel more confident in my smile and my teeth.</li>
            <li>I noticed after the first use that my teeth felt cleaner...very smooth.</li>
            <li>I am a BzzAgent and got the product for free -- thanks Crest and BzzAgent!  </li>
            <li>It will be interesting to monitor if there are any whiteness benefits to my permanently stained teeth, but if so, I will also have mixed feelings of happiness and worry about the product being too good to be true, without some sort of negative effect.</li>
            <li>I has visibly whiter teeth after the very first use.  </li>
            <li>First and foremost I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>I appreciate Smiley360 for the free sample and would most definitely try it again for free.</li>
            <li>#Bzzagent Tried it for free thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li>When I first got the product for free as part of a promotion to try it out</li>
            <li>Also, I got to try this product free thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li>From the very first brush, I felt like I had just been to the dentist.</li>
            <li>From the very first use my teeth felt cleaner like I had just walked out of the dentist office.</li>
            <li>bit.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I tried this for free thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li>I noticed this polished feeling after my very first use.  </li>
            <li>However, this step does really smooth out your teeth after the first step cleans it, which I suppose is the &amp;#34;polishing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>From the very first use on Crest Pro-Health HD, I noticed a difference in the look and feel of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>and I noticed a decrease in the bleeding of my gums and that was on the very first use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh, cool, and invigorating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is not unpleasant, although my husband did not care for the texture.  </li>
            <li>What was really cool is that I  recieved compliments on how  fresh my breath smelled.</li>
            <li>I guess its good for the packaging, but strange after you take it out of the package.</li>
            <li>I recently received a free full size sample of Crest Pro Health HD to try,  and although I wasn&#x27;t expecting to, I love the feeling of my clean teeth after the 2 step process of Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Hello confident white smile!!  </li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t think it was possible for my mouth to feel this clean just from brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t think it was possible for my mouth to feel this clean just from brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>but I think the fresh, clean results are worth it.  </li>
            <li>When I used as directed my teeth felt incredibly clean even hours later, which I liked a lot.</li>
            <li>The formula of Step 1 also does an amazing job making my teeth feel extra clean.  </li>
            <li>Using this amazing toothpaste has prolonged the after-the-dentist clean look to my teeth and has even brightened my test since that last polish by my hygienist!</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t think it was possible for my mouth to feel this clean just from brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Using this amazing toothpaste has prolonged the after-the-dentist clean look to my teeth and has even brightened my test since that last polish by my hygienist!</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this to those who are looking for an easy option to maintain a bright healthy white smile.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t think it was possible for my mouth to feel this clean just from brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>I really look forward to brushing my teeth because of how clean and smooth this makes my mouth feel.  </li>
            <li>The toothpaste definitely gets your teeth feeling nice and clean.</li>
            <li>It is quick, easy, and you get fast results.</li>
            <li>The first step is a pleasant taste, while the second is definitely a flouride taste - so it is good that the first step is there.  </li>
            <li>I received a free full product sample from Crest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for about a week, I certainly notice a whitening effect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Package is very nice and futuristic, the colors of the tubes are silver and blue respectively and advertise that I would feel a difference after a week usage and that my teeth would be whiter since the two processes brushing is intend to isolate ingredients for better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will gladly continue to take two minutes twice a day to have such clean teeth!</li>
            <li>Am pleasantly surprised at how smooth and clean my mouth feels throughout the day!  </li>
            <li>I also noticed fresh breath which is very important to me when I use a new toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Overall, the taste is good, not quite as minty as some other flavors, but still good.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I think this two part system is my favorite new Crest whitening system.</li>
            <li>Totally a new favorite and will buy again after I finish these pack is finished.</li>
            <li>The new approach to brushing makes the morning and evening routine a bit more</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure if this new toothpaste was the culprit or not.  </li>
            <li>I had already found the toothbrush of my dreams and was looking for a better toothpaste when as a Buzz Agent I had an opportunity to try the new Crest Pro-Health HD via a promotion from Crest.  </li>
            <li>I love trying new things.</li>
            <li>I have been brushing with this toothpaste for 7 weeks now and it really is my new healthy obsession.</li>
            <li>This new duo has become my favorite part of the day.</li>
            <li>I found my new favorite</li>
            <li>My teeth are as white as the snow outside, which is great given that my skin is already so pale, it&#x27;s really impressive if my teeth are whiter than my skin (according to my dentist uncle.  </li>
            <li>After just 4 weeks, the Crest Pro Heath HD toothpaste had lightened my smile very effectively, it was back to normal!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by this Pretty Amazing Stuff.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel great and cleaner than with my previous toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I realize this is because of the whitening agents, but while brushing it doesn&#x27;t taste great and has an odd drying feeling in my mouth.</li>
            <li>I have been using Crest Pro-Health HD for several weeks now thanks to BzzAgent, and I have had amazing results!  </li>
            <li>This system is really easy to follow and works very well.</li>
            <li>The best part is Crest Pro Health HD is much cheaper than the whitening strips I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li>The flavor isn&#x27;t as minty as many toothpastes, but it definitely leaves your mouth feeling clean, smooth, shiny, &amp; visibly whiter.</li>
            <li>It is so easy and makes my teeth feel really well-cleaned afterwards.</li>
            <li>this is my honest and true opinion and i will be purchasing this product regularly</li>
            <li>It does the job of a regular toothpaste in keeping your teeth fresh and clean but it also does an effective job in whitening it.</li>
            <li>I think the price for these two products is pretty fair, so I&#x27;d definitely consider using it as a part of my oral health longer-term.</li>
            <li>Within 2 uses I could see my teeth becoming more white.</li>
            <li>Overall I think it works pretty good.</li>
            <li>(I kept rinsing after the first step), but it is a really good product, overall.  </li>
            <li>I loved the simple and exact directions on the products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it is fast and easy.</li>
            <li>I saw pretty impressive results within a couple of weeks of using this (twice per day at least).</li>
            <li>While the toothpaste seemed to work really well, the taste was way too strong</li>
            <li>I am a big coffee drinker and this has helped me, so much so others have told me how nice my teeth are!</li>
            <li>This product is fast, easy, and does not hurt my teeth.  </li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t even phase me that there are two steps because they&#x27;re so easy to do.  </li>
            <li>I was among some of the lucky to receive this complimentary during a promotion.</li>
            <li>read the claims first- super clean mouth, reduction of morning breath, whiter teeth...</li>
            <li>Best of all, the whole procedure doesn&#x27;t take any longer than your usual brushing time.</li>
            <li>The first step scrubs your teeth super clean.  </li>
            <li>Step 2 is a bleaching gel and doesn&#x27;t taste very good, the strong flavor of step 1 helps mask the poor taste.  </li>
            <li>but I have actually switched from Sensodyne to Crest Pro-Health as I really was impressed with how clean and white the toothpaste made my teeth.</li>
            <li>Brush with the first stage for a minute, then spit (don&#x27;t rinse!)</li>
            <li>First, let me say Thank You Crest and BuzzAgent for letting me try this product!  </li>
            <li>My teeth look whiter and feel much cleaner!!  </li>
            <li>I recently received a sample of Crest Pro Health® HD™, compliments of Crest, and love the results after just 1 week of using it!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m quiet satisfied with it!</li>
            <li>I felt as if my mouth was more fresh when I awoke in the morning and that the fresh feeling lasted longer into the day than with my normal Colgate toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I received this recently from Bzz Agent and Crest for trial, and honestly I love it!</li>
            <li>After the first seven days I noticed significant whitenting on the surface of my teeth.</li>
            <li>Your first 2-minute brush could convert you too!</li>
            <li>Had no gum sensitivity issues at all and noticed results after the first use!  </li>
            <li>I also want white teeth to better my appearance!</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
            <li>/&gt;In general, the brushing with each step for two minutes twice daily seems to be an appropriate time for good results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now that is pretty exciting!</li>
            <li>so I just pause my brushing after the first step - spit and load the brush with Step 2 (remember - no rinsing after Step 1!) and finish the cycle.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel that the process of having to use two different toothpaste affected my morning routine by more than 30 seconds!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel this product whitens significantly the first time you use it or even after using it for awhile.  </li>
            <li>First you apply the purifying cleanser for one minute - do NOT rinse with water afterwards!</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, not perfect but pretty good.</li>
            <li>Thank You so much!!</li>
            <li>I saw a difference after the first use!  </li>
            <li>That wasn&#x27;t pleasent only because rinsing is my favorite part!  </li>
            <li>You literally get that fresh from the dentist feel after the very first use, and with each day that passes my teeth have gotten noticeably whiter and just feel healthier.  </li>
            <li>I first received this from Crest to try and I was hooked!</li>
            <li>I just kept forgetting to not rinse my mouth after the first step out of habit!  </li>
            <li>I have used other whitening products successfully.  </li>
            <li>so I knew which to grab first!</li>
            <li>I will never use another toothpaste willingly again!</li>
            <li>After the first use, I did not experience any irritation at all!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>When offered this Crest Pro-Health HD campaign I was eager to start it and excited to try it the first time,, 3 days ago.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely loooooove it!!  </li>
            <li>I personally would elect to continue using Crest Pro Health HD to see if over the long term I could get more improvement regarding whitening.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first received the Crest Pro-Health HD toothpaste, I was very excited, but also very skeptical.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In just 2 weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed how much whiter my teeth are (&amp; so have my coworkers!)!</li>
            <li>I like the original Crest ProHealth and was interested in getting whiter teeth without the aggravation  of using whitening strips or trays.</li>
            <li>I got this as part of a promotion from the brand and was pretty excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>Other than that I really liked it!</li>
            <li>I received the new Crest Pro Health 2 step whitening system  free from Bzz Agent to sample for free.  </li>
            <li>Overall,  I am happy with this new product.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is amazing because it not only leaves your mouth feeling very fresh and clean, but it also whitens your teeth really well.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this easy cleaning system to anybody that wants a brighter smile without a ton of effort.</li>
            <li>The packaging is the coolest part of this product and I love that the tubes are different allowing me to easily distinguish between the two steps.</li>
            <li>The kit contains two tubes of paste, and after some quick reading, I was thrilled to learn that it&#x27;d only take about a minute of brushing with both pastes.</li>
            <li>It was so simple and easy to use, it wasn&#x27;t any more work at all to use a 2 step process.  </li>
            <li>And my teeth are starting to look more whiter than before, The 2 step process is not time consuming and easy to follow, 2 minutes 2 times a day.</li>
            <li>and you will get a super fresh breath and whiter smile.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and does not take any more time than using your standard toothpaste,  </li>
            <li>I am able to complete the process quickly and see results.</li>
            <li>But I am satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;The two step process is easy and it works well enough that I can see whiter teeth when I look in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am trying this product free thanks to Crest, my daughter and myself have been using this and have seen tremendous results.</li>
            <li>, this felt more &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; and therefore less effective (but could again all be in my head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems to really get my teeth clean and leaves them feeling clean throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;m getting closer to a dentist&#x27;s office clean than I was with my original toothpaste, and think that this is keeping my teeth in better shape (aesthetically and actually) in between office visits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very surprised that Crest Pro Health HD did not have the powerful minty taste that most toothpastes leave afterward.</li>
            <li>I have been a Crest Vivid White and then 3D White toothpaste user for several years now as I&#x27;ve found it to be the best whitening toothpaste with a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li>I will use all of the Crest Pro Health HD system until it&#x27;s gone, but after that I will likely return to the single step Crest Pro Health Whitening paste that I like best.</li>
            <li>So, I tried a new Crest Pro Health product through BzzAgent, and if you are looking to have a super clean mouth, you should try it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Crest Pro Health® HD is a fantastic product that is so easy to use, takes practically no time at all, with such fantastic results.  </li>
            <li>with this clean feeling, I did not notice a difference in the first 2 or 3 days.</li>
            <li>Plus, my teeth FELT clean after the first use.  </li>
            <li>After the first day, my teeth felt clean, just like I had got a cleaning at the dentist.  </li>
            <li>and I both said after we used the system the first time was our teeth felt squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>The first step is to clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li>The gel didn&#x27;t have much of a taste to it, which was fine.</li>
            <li>It gives me the dentist clean feeling even after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean for the whole day!</li>
            <li>from the first time i used it, my mouth felt so clean and my teeth</li>
            <li>From first brush, my teeth felt clean and my mouth refreshed.</li>
            <li>I was so amazed how clean my teeth feel after using Crest Pro-Health HD, and its not difficult at all to use the two step process.  </li>
            <li>The two step process doesn&#x27;t really take any more time that how I would typically brush which is good.  </li>
            <li>I started off using the product twice a day (morning and night) and the biggest thing I noticed first how clean my teeth were feeling and</li>
            <li>The first step is basically like a toothpaste to cleanse your teeth and buff them clean.</li>
            <li>So clean that it you will have a 6X cleaner and whiter within the first week of use.</li>
            <li>After using Crest Pro Health® HD(tm) for the first time my mouth felt clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first try, my mouth felt as clean as a dentist&#x27;s visit.</li>
            <li>The first is a tradional toothpaste meant to clean the teeth.</li>
            <li>and  My teeth felt so clean after the first time using this system.</li>
            <li>The first is a tradional toothpaste meant to clean the teeth.</li>
            <li>The first is a tradional toothpaste meant to clean the teeth.</li>
            <li>After the first use, I noticed just how clean my mouth felt.</li>
            <li>With my regular toothpaste my teeth felt smoothly clean but with this system they felt more roughly clean if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>It gives you that just visited the dentist clean feeling after the first use.  </li>
            <li>First thing I noticed after using the product is that my teeth felt extremely clean.  </li>
            <li>The first step uses Stannous Fluoride to clean away plaque you use for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>THe first day my teeth felt squeeky clean,</li>
            <li>The first step makes your teeth feel squeaky clean and prepped.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this 2-step process, my teeth felt just as clean as the week before when I walked out of the dentist office for my 6-month cleaning.  </li>
            <li>The first toothpaste leaves your teeth feelithg so clean.  </li>
            <li>The first toothpaste is  to clean teeth, gums, add fluoride, reduces plaque and reduces gingivitis.  </li>
            <li>First you clean then you polish and whitten</li>
            <li>After completing this first step, my mouth felt so clean -</li>
            <li>My teeth were shiny and felt clean after the first brush and by day 2, I can notice the glossy look.</li>
            <li>As for whitening, I found it does work (a little), but the whitening effect on my teeth was that great over the 2 weeks</li>
            <li>Plus, this stuff is a little pricey, so I think this is a great way to get the product benefits but without having to buy it as often.</li>
            <li>Plus, this stuff is a little pricey, so I think this is a great way to get the product benefits but without having to buy it as often.</li>
            <li>drawback was that we experienced a little sensitivity after we started using it.</li>
            <li>One very important thing for me to utilize toothpaste is that it has to taste OK and not be too strong and this program was just like the other Crest products and tasted very well.  </li>
            <li>I usually use Colgate, but this is a great toothpaste and makes my mouth feel completely clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>My smile is whiter and my teeth feel so clean after brushing, which I noticed after the first time.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste itself is very thick but does an excellent job scrubbing your teeth.  </li>
            <li>This product also states that it will whiten teeth, and it does to a certain extent and would probably work better if I did not drink so much coffee which just restains</li>
            <li>Special thanks to Crest for hooking me up!</li>
            <li>The first time I used Crest PH Advanced toothpaste, I found it very gentle.</li>
            <li>First step reminded me of my regular toothpaste,  with a nice foam and clean fresh taste and feel.</li>
            <li>I have always been a fan of Crest brand toothpaste, so I was pretty confident that trying this new product would turn into a positive experience (and having the chance to try it free was a bonus), and I was correct.  </li>
            <li>a reasonable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t really have a taste; the formulation of this is so light that it feels like I&#x27;m brushing my teeth with no product</li>

            <li>Thanks to Crest and Bzzagent, I got to try this product for free.</li>
            <li>I got to try this product for free thanks to Crest</li>
            <li>The two-step process isn&#x27;t time consuming at all, takes almost the same amount of time to be honest.</li>
            <li>Worth the $12 I paid.</li>
            <li>I think my dentist will be pleasantly surprised:)</li>
            <li>but it does help with a better-looking smile.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>That being said however, the results are totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>it makes my teeth have that fresh--</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve experienced no sensitivity issues, especially with the whitening gel portion.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen some whitening so far, although I haven&#x27;t been using it the recommended twice a day, so I&#x27;m sure it could improve.  </li>
            <li>Note that Crest offers a pre-paid card in the amount of your purchase if you aren&#x27;t satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>Now this won&#x27;t give you the same whitening as having the procedure done at the dentist, but it&#x27;s a good, much cheaper alternative.  </li>
            <li>But, I’m a self-professed fresh breath junkie</li>
            <li>As part of the Crest Pro Health HD Bzzagent campaign I received a complimentary package of this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a full week at first</li>
            <li>My family and friends have noticed how white my teeth are (and I&#x27;m a 2-3 cups of coffee a day kind of gal).  </li>
            <li>I have a really nice electric toothbrush with a pulsing timer that let&#x27;s me know when each 30 second increment is up and</li>
            <li>Fresh taste.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li>I gave it a good go for the first week to see if it has results, but now I end up just using the first step and not the second.  </li>
            <li>I was asked to try the toothpaste and simply share my honest reaction.</li>
            <li>I noticed a whiter smile 3 days into using it.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel cleaner and my smile is brighter.</li>
            <li>My smile did get brighter even though I&#x27;m a coffee drinker.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is the easiest way to get a brighter, whiter smile without going to the dentist and spending hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li>My teeth always feel freshly polished</li>
            <li>must have if you are looking to brighten your smile</li>
            <li>When I first heard about Crest Pro Health HD, it sounded cool</li>
            <li>So far I am really pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I have tried a lot of whitening products and they either didnt work at all or made my teeth so sensitive I couldn&#x27;t eat or drink anything without suffering.</li>
            <li>Also, keep in mind I am still smoking, drinking coffee and wine, and this paste just keeps on helping to maintain the whitest smile</li>
            <li>I and I do notice a whiter smile.</li>
            <li>I have tried maby over the counter products to help whiten my smile and this one</li>
            <li>and I can already see a visibly whiter smile.  </li>
            <li>The colorful packaging claimed to make my teeth healthier and whiter in a week, so I decided to take up the challenge and see for myself if this was true.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This clear gel has more of a peppermint smell to it and after one minute of use you are suppose to rinse and spit it out.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>My teeth may feel cleaner , but I feel more self conscious with my breath because the toothpaste needs to be a bit stronger in the mint department for my preferences.  </li>
            <li>My teeth may feel cleaner , but I feel more self conscious with my breath because the toothpaste needs to be a bit stronger in the mint department for my preferences.  </li>
            <li>As far as whitening capabilities I have mostly crowns in the front of my mouth</li>
            <li>What I really like about it though is that you get whitening without having to do much more that you have done your whole life.</li>
            <li>Two steps means more on the bathroom counter (or to pack in a travel case), more time spent brushing one&#x27;s teeth</li>
            <li>Two steps means more on the bathroom counter (or to pack in a travel case), more time spent brushing one&#x27;s teeth</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>and my mouth still feels dentist fresh,</li>
            <li>And honestly, it does last through the day.</li>
            <li>I am loving the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste System!</li>
            <li>- my mouth feels fresh after I use this.</li>
            <li>I was trying desperately not to gag on all the stuff in my mouth.</li>
            <li>My teeth seem whiter and my fresh always feel fresher; however, it comes with two tubes - and we as a society have been trained to use one.</li>
            <li>Friends have commented on the whiter smile after two weeks of use.</li>
            <li>It does the job it is supposed to do....whiten your teeth and freshen your smile.</li>
            <li>It has been well worth it.</li>
            <li>However, after using the products for a couple of weeks I realized the results are worth the labor.</li>
            <li>My breath was minty-fresh, and I noticed a whiter, brighter smile within a week.  </li>
            <li>For 2 minutes a day, this is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>My smile is whiter and brighter and my mouth feels cleaner than ever before.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone looking to boost the whiteness of their smile without doing anything drastic.</li>
            <li>Who knew that you could have a smile in HD?</li>
            <li>This is a product worth recommending to others.</li>
            <li>I will most likely only continue using this toothpaste if the results are beyond good.</li>
            <li>The second step, however, kind of negates this super-fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two Step Toothpaste System from Crest as part of a promotional campaign to test the product and give my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>and my mouth felt fresh.</li>
            <li>#34;dentist-clean&amp;#34; to start a whitening program, but this product proves otherwise.  </li>
            <li>Step 2 left some kind of film feeling on my teeth</li>
            <li>In just one week, my teeth were one shade lighter, they felt cleaner, and my breath has never felt so fresh.  </li>
            <li>I received  Crest Pro Health HD as a complimentary trial from Crest by being a BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth giving a try.</li>
            <li>I wish I could say that I liked the Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System...</li>
            <li>Honestly, while using it, you feel like your entire mouth is being stripped of everything that has ever lived there.</li>
            <li>I felt throughout the day like my mouth was still fresh and had a lingering minty taste.</li>
            <li>I honestly felt every time I brushed</li>
            <li>BUT I do not drink coffee, smoke cigarettes, drink soda and RARELY drink tea</li>
            <li>I found that it made my gums even more sensitive</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li>The two tubes work separately yet together to create a dynamite smile.</li>
            <li>And the results are so worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Crest claims to give you a 6x healthier mouth and 6x brighter smile after using the system for one week.</li>
            <li>And my mouth still feels fresh when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li>In no time, Your teeth will look brighter, it will be cleaner and your breath will be fresh.  </li>
            <li>Its comparable to going to the dentist and having a fresh mouth after cleaning.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;ve been completely, pleasantly surprised by the effectiveness of this great</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a nice whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li>but my breath and mouth was definitely fresh;  just not minty.  </li>
            <li>The change has not been earth shattering, and I wasn’t expecting it to be, but I am pleased with the improvement I have seen in the color of the teeth so far.  </li>
            <li>The second tube is a polishing paste which kind of deflates the foam and polishes your teeth</li>
            <li>I find it kind of a hassle to have to use two different two pastes every time I brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Have used a lot of products to try to whiten my teeth without much success.</li>
            <li>am not crazy about the flavor.  </li>
            <li>I prefer a fresh minty flavor that I didn&#x27;t get with Crest.  </li>
            <li>He enjoys his whiter smile while still indulging in his morning and afternoon coffee addictions.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my smile.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I was very satisfied with my first experience of using the Crest Pro Health HD.  </li>
            <li>The value is well worth it.</li>
            <li>Prior to this great BzzCampaign of Crest Pro Health HD, our family purchased tooth paste that was normally sensitive and/or lacking the whitening aspect.</li>
            <li>Overall I liked it and didn’t mind the two steps.</li>
            <li>If you are thinking of purchasing go ahead because it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t want a fresh breath with whiter teeth.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the results.</li>
            <li>I imagine this is rare and</li>
            <li>This is so much better than other whitening toothpaste; it really makes my teeth whiter, cleaner and more polished!</li>
            <li>but my smile seems brighter.</li>
            <li>I think I will continue to hold off only using once a day, but the results thus far have been great.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro Health HD promises a brighter smile in 6 days.</li>
            <li>Another downside worth noting is that you need to switch out tooth paste 1/2 way through the routine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also another benefit that i think this product is good for sensitive teeth because I have sensitive teeth and have no problem using this product.  </li>
            <li>I have been trying to whiten my smile for what seems like forever.  </li>
            <li>I think it will help get my money&#x27;s worth by maintaining the whitening.</li>
            <li>The most important thing about the toothpaste though is that I definitely notice my teeth are whiter now.  </li>
            <li>The best part for me is really the polished feeling, and I look forward to my next dentist visit next month to see if they notice any difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly worth a try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly worth a try.</li>
            <li>thing is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I even notice that my smile seems brighter</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase this product on my own following this campaign through BzzAgent!</li>
            <li>You laugh, but I had college housemate who used to eat his toothpaste gel thinking it gave him fresher breath.</li>
            <li>However, it hasn&#x27;t made my teeth more sensitive at all</li>
            <li>After two weeks my wife started to notice a brighter smile.  </li>
            <li>If you are dedicated and prepared to put in some time to whiten your smile, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>All I can say is that a two-tube system is kinda fun, but it&#x27;s decidedly just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a week, I do have a whiter smile.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try if you are on the fence.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s nice to find a product that I can use daily to help combat</li>
            <li>The breath was fresh and the teeth whiter with just a day of using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>have been using this toothpaste for several weeks now and to be honest</li>
            <li>I would give it a go for a couple of more weeks and then will decide if I will switch or stay with my old toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I love the product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Crest claims to give you a 6x healthier mouth and 6x brighter smile after using the system for one week.</li>
            <li>my smile was/</li>
            <li>* Tastes nice (but no different from anything else, really)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums have never felt cleaner and this leaves my mouth feeling fresh all day.</li>
            <li>I do not like the ingredients as I would like to see more natural ingredients included.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You aren&#x27;t going to finish brushing with this product and feel kissably fresh.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;perfecting gel&amp;#34; reminded me of the kind of fluoride treatment you could formerly only receive at the dentist.</li>
            <li>However, I kept using it and within about 2 weeks I started to notice a whiter smile.</li>
            <li>I do not feel that it has helped with morning breath nor does it give me a fresh mint/clean taste after brushing.  </li>
            <li>I do not feel that it has helped with morning breath nor does it give me a fresh mint/clean taste after brushing.  </li>
            <li>It has a fresh peppermint taste and gives your gums a tingling feel.</li>
            <li>This also has a fresh mint taste.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s worth it for the results.</li>
            <li>It has not made my mouth sensitive (which whitening products do), and I love the flavor.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a whiter smile, although its not 6 shades whiter.  </li>
            <li>The paste made my breath fresh</li>
            <li>It was minty and fresh.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have the brightest n whitest smile ever, and I have tried almost all of whitening toothpaste and strips out there.</li>
            <li>So far, I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I liked that it just replaced my current toothpaste.</li>
            <li>My breath is fresh.  </li>
            <li>and i am loving how white my teeth look!</li>
            <li>Overall, effective, and I like the way it makes &#x27;my&#x27; mouth feel.  </li>
            <li>Provided a noticeably whiter smile after just 2 weeks of using twice a day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Needless to say my rinse after step 2 is WAY more thorough than my old brushing routine</li>
            <li>/&gt;Needless to say my rinse after step 2 is WAY more thorough than my old brushing routine was.</li>
            <li>But the two-step process isn&#x27;t fun when you are in a hurry.  </li>
            <li>I was given a sample of this product and figured I would give it an honest shot for a week and then go back to my trusty Arm &amp; Hammer routine.</li>
            <li>I feel that my teeth are whiter and my smile is healthier.</li>
            <li>Having white, beautiful teeth is important to me because I have a big smile that&#x27;s one of the first things people notice about me.</li>
            <li>The above opinion is my own.</li>
            <li>Well worth</li>
            <li>but it was totally worth it.</li>
            <li>but you have never felt so fresh.  </li>
            <li>This gel is mostly flavorless as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>I no longer smile with</li>
            <li>either so I was hoping for some improvement in my smile.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I say it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>I am someone always looking for a safe, healthy and fast way to keep my teeth white.  </li>
            <li>I was given this package complimentary to try and review online through Crest and BzzAgent.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My mouth feels fresh.</li>
            <li>I truly saw a whiter smile after a week of using this product.  </li>
            <li>but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for that fresh minty taste in your mouth after brushing your teeth, you won&#x27;t find it with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>This gel is mostly flavorless as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>a pricey product, but when considering what you get out of it, the price is totally worth it to me.  </li>
            <li>My mouth feels so fresh after using this product.</li>
            <li>The taste of the toothpaste is fresh and minty, not medicinal at all.</li>
            <li>Overall, I liked using it.</li>
            <li>Overall quite a nice product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>and I feel that I am noticing a whiter smile.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t use it when I&#x27;m in a rush, but it&#x27;s really a powerful tool for ultra-clean teeth.</li>
            <li>Reading the package and Crest&#x27;s claims who wouldn&#x27;t want to see if you did in fact have the tools in hand to get a smile that was 6X whiter and mouth that was 6X healthier than before.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this product from BzzAgent, and I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like this toothpaste, knowing that I had multiple steps to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li>I felt it was just one more step added to an already busy routine.</li>
            <li>I loved Crest Pro Heath HD toothpaste so much that I&#x27;m considering replacing my current toothpaste with it permanently!  </li>
            <li>It is always an exciting day when the BzzAgent box arrives in the mail.  </li>
            <li>but I find it&#x27;s worth the &amp;#34;trouble.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>.it was not harsh on my gums as most products, which contains whitening agents.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Well worth the effort.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your teeth whiter, your mouth healthier, and breath minty fresh.</li>
            <li>But it is definitely worth it in the end.  </li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>But I did miss the minty refreshing taste I get from my old toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Except honestly- the only change I&#x27;d make was switching toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>But the freshening aftertaste is worth the momentary inconvenience.</li>
            <li>This two part product is well worth the two part process.</li>
            <li>and I do notice a whiter smile, even my mom noticed and asked if I had been whitening my teeth.  </li>
            <li>This system is fun though, even my wife is trying it.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in two steps.</li>
            <li>The cleaning step, which is a minty fresh tooth paste that cleans your teeth, and then you brush again with the whitening gel.</li>
            <li>That almost gritty feeling that makes you feel like you are really giving your teeth a good scrubbing.  </li>
            <li>It was time to brighten my smile so the Crest Pro Health® HD™ Toothpaste came just in time.  </li>
            <li>If a product is only so-so, I will say so honestly and pass that info onto friends &amp; family.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m quite pleased with the toothpaste part so far.  </li>
            <li>It does indeed whiten and brighten my smile, yet it does not feel abrasive and leaves me with a fresh-from-the-dentist feeling every time I brush.</li>
            <li>but if you are looking for something that will leave your mouth fresh then this is not the toothpaste for you.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health was fresh tasting and even being two steps was not time consuming.</li>
            <li>This product is actually worth the money and the time.</li>
            <li>It was all worth it.&lt;br /&gt;The product comes in two bottles (1 is the purifying cleanser and 1 is the perfecting gel).</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my smile.</li>
            <li>And if I floss after my gums are more sensitive.  </li>
            <li>but it is simple and so, so effective.  </li>
            <li>It has a fresh taste but step one has a sticky-spongy texture.  </li>
            <li>it is worth the price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving the addition of the pro-health HG two step process and would definitely recommend you try for yourself.</li>
            <li>Most importantly the feeling of freshness even lasted after I ate and several hours later.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most importantly the feeling of freshness even lasted after I ate and several hours later.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall nice product.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product for free, but I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again when mine runs out.</li>
            <li>The flavors are minty and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Even though this is not a real negative but had these been in 1 product it would have worked better.</li>
            <li>and I can see a differents in my smile</li>
            <li>I feel that it made my teeth somewhat sensitive (as do many whitening products).</li>
            <li>My teeth have whitened noticably and I will definitely be buying more when my free sample runs out.</li>
            <li>I found this to be significantly better than the old whitestrips.  </li>
            <li>Would it even be worth it?</li>
            <li>It was also surprisingly nice that Crest Pro Heath HD did not bother my usually sensitive teeth the way most regular toothpastes do.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the hassle.  </li>
            <li>I have to admit I didn&#x27;t think a whitening toothpaste would make my teeth whiter, healthier and NOT make them more sensitive.  </li>
            <li>After just a week, I noticed a visibly whiter smile.  </li>
            <li>and I am loving the results.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of a traditional toothpaste</li>
            <li>and I noticed a sparkling smile and also a cleaner mouth.  </li>
            <li>So far I am in love.</li>
            <li>I expected it would be good</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>, I can honestly say I will be purchasing it in the future.</li>
            <li>1 is a sparkling and blue tinted gel that has a nice minty toothpaste taste.</li>
            <li>Step 2 seals and polishes, while keeping breath fresh.</li>
            <li>It whitens your teeth, freshen your breaths and leaves you with a sparkling smile.  </li>
            <li>The toothpaste tastes fresh and the whitening gel is tolerable.</li>
            <li>but take my money, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;The two-step part was nice in that it keeps me focused on the duration of my brushing and a proper rinsing procedure.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s well worth the extended time.</li>
            <li>I do notice that my breath also stays fresh longer.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel like they have a layer of slime on them and my breath is not as fresh as it was before after returning to the toothpaste I used before the HD!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The first step is a pop top tube that you brush with like normal, but you don&#x27;t rinse.</li>
            <li>&gt; - Whiter smile.</li>
            <li>/&gt; - While I was able to sample for free from Crest, I have seen it in my local shops and</li>
            <li>I like to smile and</li>
            <li>The one drawback is my breath doesn&#x27;t feel quite as fresh in the morning</li>
            <li>Is it worth the money and having to do the 2 step process?</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s certainly worth a try though.</li>
            <li>Did NOT make my teeth more sensitive</li>
            <li>In fact that is the only kind I get from the store.  </li>
            <li>The most important change for me is every time I&#x27;ve brushed my teeth</li>
            <li>I have been putting off writing this review in hopes to have something exciting to report.</li>
            <li>The end result is worth it though.</li>
            <li>but once you add the second paste it foams and bubbles up nicely.</li>
            <li>I will have to say that I would have never seen this item in the store and purchased it because I would feel like it wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li>My teeth appear whiter and it looks more natural.</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>That is until I posted a rare selfie on Instagram from an anniversary outing with my husband.  </li>
            <li>It does take 2 minute longer to brush my teeth twice, but the result is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Also, after brushing my mouth felt cleaner and fresh.</li>
            <li>I found this product to leave my mouth and breath exceptionally fresh, even for hours afterwards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that after using CPH HD most of my teeth (with the exception of some back molars) feel smooth and plaque-less all day.</li>
            <li>maybe about 2-3x, which I&#x27;d still consider a success (hence my 4 star rating).</li>
            <li>maybe about 2-3x, which I&#x27;d still consider a success (hence my 4 star rating).</li>
            <li>this honestly probably increased my total brush time by ~30 seconds twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a hint of fresh mint.</li>
            <li>However, I should state that I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth are mildly more sensitive.</li>
            <li>The system at the store cost 14.99, so it is an economical way to take care of your teeth and look whiter and fresher.</li>
            <li>After just brushing my teeth for a week with it, my teeth felt healthier and my smile looked brighter.  </li>
            <li>I received Crest Pro Health HD complimentary from BzzAgent for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it now for a couple of weeks and am satisfied, but its not meant to completely whiten your teeth</li>
            <li>I was able to try this system free from BzzAgent, but now I purchase it regularly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d go full bore for a week or two when you first buy this, though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d go full bore for a week or two when you first buy this, though.</li>
            <li>An unexpected benefit of the two tube system is that it makes the two minutes you&#x27;re supposed to brush your teeth go by a lot faster because you have more to do during that time.</li>
            <li>It gives that fresh out of the dentist feeling every time you brush</li>
            <li>The following are my own opinions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t leave my breath fresh</li>
            <li>I was apprehensive about the two step process of the Crest Pro Health® HD™, but after receiving a sample box and a couple of uses I&#x27;ve fallen into a steady and easy routine with it.</li>
            <li>It has a nice touch of mint, blue/green color and a consistency of a regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>It cleans my teeth really well, my mouth feels super clean after using.</li>
            <li>My teeth were whiter and my morning breath was under control, but it wasn&#x27;t worth the pain.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the consistency of the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I did notice my teeth were slightly more sensitive during the time I used this</li>
            <li>--- incredible results within the first few times of using --- really, truly whiter!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now (all whilst drinking coffee!) and continue to maintain a whiter smile.</li>
            <li>smile is brighter and my truth have never felt cleaner-</li>
            <li>think that at this 13.00 price point you get your money&#x27;s worth when it comes to the whitening.</li>
            <li>That may make the toothpaste worth it just on that</li>
            <li>You get used to it (ish) - but still worth mentioning.</li>
            <li>Yes, its another step in the brushing process, but the results make it worth it.</li>
            <li>This 2-step toothpaste is a great to add into my daily routine with no additional time considering my busy schedule.  </li>
            <li>I am not one to consider myself having sensitive teeth and/or gums, but I couldn&#x27;t use this as directed for more than 3 days.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste feels high quality and is not too strong but cleans thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to those looking to quickly whiten their teeth at a very reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>First, there has been a slight whitening to my teeth and they feel nice which I love.  </li>
            <li>First, I have to say I love how easy this is to use especially on a regular basis although you do have to get used to not rinsing between the two step process.  </li>
            <li>So fast, I was able to add this to my normal routine!</li>
            <li>Second, it leaves your teeth feeling very smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>When first opening the package of the new Crest Pro Health HD, it may seem like the process will be an overwhelming and daunting task.</li>
            <li>/&gt;From the very first use, I was pleasantly surprised at how clean my teeth felt!</li>
            <li>will definitely continue to use this product as long as I feel my mouth is staying and becoming more clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>It is fast and easy to use with visibly noticeable results just after the first use.  </li>
            <li>Yes, its that easy, and within the first cleaning you feel your mouth is much fresher and cleaner, then within days you can see that your teeth are getting</li>
            <li>I give this product points for very easy instructions and not a long time commitment to use.</li>
            <li>My teeth really feel very clean and are getting slightly more white.  </li>
            <li>a healthy white smile and fresh clean breath.</li>
            <li>My breath felt cool and fresh for several hours, which is very important to me.  </li>
            <li>After using the product my teeth are smooth and feel very clean, especially when used with my Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I love white teeth, fresh breath, and clean feeling mouths.</li>
            <li>I love to have white teeth and fresh breath, and this product does both!  </li>
            <li>I am so excited to finally have a pain free whitening product!</li>
            <li>is that my mouth feels so much fresher for a lot longer than I&#x27;ve ever experienced with other toothpastes.</li>
            <li>The actual whitening results are noticeable which is why overall it is a good product!</li>
            <li>Tube 1 is your normal toothpaste, but it has a very mild mint flavor.</li>
            <li>This whitening gel is sort of warm in the mouth and not the most pleasant feeling, but certainly not as awfully tedious and uncomfortable as whitening strips for 20+ minutes!  </li>
            <li>Actually its the most unique of all its competitors.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that we are able to whiten as we brush, eliminating the need to wear strips or use any other products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so really glad to find it here on Amazon, and with a coupon no less.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get your teeth that &amp;#34;glow in the dark&amp;#34; white, but if you want a natural-looking, clean, healthy-looking white, this 2-step system works great.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d recommend Crest Pro Health HD because while it may not make magic in your mouth, it does make it feel clean and fresh all day with an added polish.</li>
            <li>I received a free kit from BzzAgent and was so excited to try this, however I have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>At first, I did not like the 2 minute requirement, but quickly got used to it.  </li>
            <li>I also get to rinse at the end, so the lingering taste of step 2 is pretty mild.  </li>
            <li>I got used to it pretty quickly, using an electric toothpaste with built in timer made keeping track of the time easy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The two step process really works to get deep clean and then a nice polish.  </li>
            <li>The first step is a toothpaste that is mild and doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li>I certainly can attest to a clean feeling after the 2-step brushing.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to BzzAgent, I was able to try the New Crest Pro Health HD!  </li>
            <li>I received a free sample to try and have quickly gotten use to my new two step routine.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use, it&#x27;s not hard to brush one minute with each tube.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to that too much, as it is not a problem for me, but it claims to be six times more effective than conventional toothpaste for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves your mouth SO fresh and clean, and it really did whiten my teeth in one week.  </li>
            <li>Your teeth and gums will feel much slicker and smoother, and your tongue will have a clean, fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>What I noticed most about this two step toothpaste was how clean my teeth felt after only one use.</li>
            <li>Also, they love that same dentist clean feeling that got me hooked.  </li>
            <li>I was thinking Step 1 would be more of a classic toothpaste and 2 would be the whitening step, but I think you really do need to use both every time.  </li>
            <li>do believe that any toothpaste would work better if used for two minutes so that may factor into the extra clean feeling.</li>
            <li>It tastes good, my mouth felt clean, and I noticed whiter teeth after just a few uses.</li>
            <li>Third, I love how clean my teeth feel after I use this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed dramatic whitening changes, but do feel like my teeth look nice and bright after use.  </li>
            <li>I might continue using this product based on how clean my teeth feel but would like it better if there was only one step, or if it whitened better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also left my teeth feeling much more clean and shiny.  </li>
            <li>If want clean, healthy, white teeth</li>
            <li>Brushing my teeth twice was not my favorite idea, but my teeth definitely felt clean.</li>
            <li>My whole mouth , teeth and gums feel incredibily clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>My teeth haven&#x27;t felt this clean since my last dentist cleaning and I love that I get this feeling after brushing every morning &amp; evening.</li>
            <li>I feel like the soft bristle tooth brush just doesn&#x27;t get my teeth as smooth and clean as I would like.  </li>
            <li>My teeth were so clean, I was sure I&#x27;d just left the dentist office!</li>
            <li>I use it every morning and night and it leaves my teeth and mouth feeling like its fresh and clean and its really going to improve my mouth hygiene I feel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big arm and hammer baking soda fan and love the clean feeling I get with their toothpaste.</li>
            <li>But, keeping stains away and giving me that clean mouth feeling that befor now, only came from paying for a dental visit twice a year, more than offsets the price.</li>
            <li>The 2 step process really isn&#x27;t a big deal but make sure you brush for 1 minute with step 1 to clean, spit without rinsing, then brush for another minute with step 2 to polish, then rinse.</li>
            <li>It gives my mouth an unbelievably fresh and clean feeling that really lasts.</li>
            <li>I have been using this toothpaste for about a week and love the deep clean feel that it gives my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I have no sensitivity issues, it just feels like a coarse sandpaper to clean the teeth, then when the teeth are more exposed, brush a whitener on the teeth.</li>
            <li>Then I decided to try another toothpaste from a competitor and not only was able to see results but my teeth feel clean.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it whiten it leaves your teeth feeling clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>Another aspect that I liked about this kit in particular is that the whitener was not harsh in any way.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used long enough to see significant whitening, although I think some progress is being made !!!!  </li>
            <li>After using Crest PH HD, my teeth felt very clean, almost like having a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good product that does not make my sensitive teeth too sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I had no issues with this program and have nothing but good things to say about it.</li>
            <li>Admittedly, I &amp;#34;ugh&#x27;d&amp;#34; at the thought of adding another step to my routine, but my teeth and mouth felt cleaner after the very first use, and the whitening was clearly evident.  </li>
            <li>I have always found Crest products to be superior to other brands.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest Pro HD, I am not embarrassed to smile in pictures!</li>
            <li>I agree with other users that I brush longer which is probably a good thing.</li>
            <li>After switching back a couple days to crest paste toothpaste, my teeth felt grimy by the end of the day where the HD clean lasts!!  </li>
            <li>I had been previously using a whitening pen/UV light combo that works, but is so much more time consuming!</li>
            <li>To be fair, my teeth were already pretty white and clean as I just had a cleaning about a week prior to receiving this product to try for free from a Bzz campaign.</li>
            <li>I cannot see that my teeth are six times whiter as promised after one week (but I use a good electronic toothbrush that usually removes stains and plaque pretty well) - but my mouth feels clean and healthy without the hassle of whitening strips and normal time involvement as I always brush for two minutes.</li>
            <li>I was lucky to get this toothpaste to try for free from BzzAgent and Crest, but the retail price is pretty high for toothpaste.</li>
            <li>When I peeled back the top cover, the two tubes were situated in their special spot.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a struggle to find the right things I can use.  </li>
            <li>I noticed whitening results right away which</li>
            <li>It just wasn&#x27;t right for me.</li>
            <li>That feeling right when you leave your dentist after having your teeth cleaned.</li>
            <li>Right off the bat</li>
            <li>; your toothbrush with Step 2.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that my teeth looked whiter within a week.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I had a dentist appointment right before I tried this product, so I can&#x27;t speak to how it helped with plaque.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Using the step 2 gel, you can feel it working right away with the hydrogen peroxide in it.</li>
            <li>Two things I noticed right away with this method.</li>
            <li>I think Crest has the right idea with this product but advertising 6x whiter teeth seems like a bit of a stretch.  </li>
            <li>My husband notice a difference right away</li>
            <li>Who doesn’t want have whiter teeth, right?</li>
            <li>I saw improvements in about 4 or 5 days and my mouth felt cleaner right away.</li>
            <li>I dislike how you spit step 1 out and CAN NOT rinse but follow with step 2 right away .&lt;br</li>
            <li>right after visiting the dentist.</li>
            <li>That feeling right when you leave your dentist after having your teeth cleaned.  </li>
            <li>and when I did I never felt like I was doing it right</li>
            <li>THE WHITENING WAS JUST RIGHT.</li>
            <li>You just put it on your toothbrush right after using the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Who doesn’t want have whiter teeth, right?</li>
            <li>when I didn&#x27;t see results right away I hesitated to use again.</li>
            <li>I feel like I need to have a piece of gum right after brushing.</li>
            <li>and he&#x27;s right.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a week so far, but having that fresh clean feeling is well worth it!</li>
            <li>I received a free trial from crest for this new toothpaste and whitener to try!</li>
            <li>And, I have to say, that maintaining the &#x27;right from the dentist&#x27; clean teeth feeling has been much easier with the help of this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>But if you are spending the money to get a brand new bright white smile, I&#x27;d consider calling your dentist instead.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for new ways to lighten and brighten my teeth, and was thrilled to receive the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two Step Toothpaste free from Crest.  </li>
            <li>After two weeks of use, I am seeing positive results!</li>
            <li>I have also started carrying this in my bag because it is perfect for those sudden photo ops, such as a new identification badge at work, or after my morning coffee(s).  </li>
            <li>The effects improve over time, but it&#x27;s nice to get that initial boost right off the bat, so if you&#x27;re heading out for a date or something, this will give you some impact just the first time.</li>
            <li>but that is a small price to pay for a great smile.</li>
            <li>I have received more compliments on my beautiful white smile than I have in a long time, and I have even used professional level whitening kits from the dentist.  </li>
            <li>After using step one, I did not feel like I had that minty fresh breath; however, it did leave my teeth feeling clean, almost as clean as after a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>But in the long run, a healthier mouth is more important to me than whiter teeth, and so it gets four stars.</li>
            <li>I received Crest HD free from Crest as a BzzAgent, and was very unsure about it at first.  </li>
            <li>Would have rated higher except whitening effect not as good as expected.</li>
            <li>I used it for the full two minutes each time because I love the way it left my mouth feeling.</li>
            <li>but I feel my teeths clean whole day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and you will really have dental hygienist clean teeth.</li>
            <li>Happy to be white but not as refreshing as my previous paste.</li>
            <li>I would say that the polishing gel makes my whole mouth feel so clean.  </li>
            <li>my mouth really feels clean, almost like when you leave the dentist.  </li>
            <li>What I personally have been loving though, is that it makes it so much easier to brush my teeth for the recommended 2 minutes!  </li>
            <li>I have been actively looking for a good toothpaste for a while.</li>
            <li>I love tea and Cola which definitely diminishes a smile quickly.</li>
            <li>I brush routinely twice a day and find this product really helped with a cleaner mouth and amazingly clean teeth.  </li>
            <li>Crest Pro Health HD does offer a clean feeling, but I didn&#x27;t notice much whitening over 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>I think my teeth are looking pretty nice and white, too.  </li>
            <li>I actually do take the full 2 minutes (most times) and I even felt the 2 step thing grind on my nerves a bit.</li>
            <li>Step 1 - the purifying Cleanser, is way too intense of a clean.  </li>
            <li>very good:&lt;br /&gt;After the hour of discomfort has passed, my mouth feels clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>As mentioned the true test will come when I have my next appointment but for now I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>Step 1 of this product really did leave my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>, I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the whiteness of my teeth, but the clean feeling will keep me using this product.</li>
            <li>so I could get the whole mouth clean feeling</li>
            <li>and you will really have dental hygienist clean teeth.</li>
            <li>Step 1 is a cleansing step, its a more gritty type of taste to really scrub the teeth clean but the taste is not bad at all as you would tend to expect from a cleanser.</li>
            <li>I also really like how clean and polished my teeth and mouth feels after using this product.  </li>
            <li>My whole mouth just feels to clean and polished when I am done.  </li>
            <li>That being said, this really did make my teeth feel clean.  </li>
            <li>My mouth feels really fresh and clean after using this system and I really did notice a difference in the brightness of my smile after just the first use.</li>
            <li>What I really like about the process is how clean it leaves your mouth feeling.</li>
            <li>also really enjoyed the cool mint flavor, and found that it made my mouth feel cleaner than traditional toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health HD has a pleasant taste, just less so than I prefer.</li>
            <li>When you get done brushing with Step 2, your mouth is VERY minty because it is literally so clean.</li>
            <li>The first toothpaste is used to get rid of bacteria and plaque while the second one is a nice whitening polish.</li>
            <li>After many years of coffee and some less than intelligent years of smoking, my teeth are actually whiter.</li>
            <li>The first step makes them feel so nice and polished, and the second step has brought them to their brightest.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely amazed at how clean my teeth felt after using this system.</li>
            <li>, on the flip side, once you are done and rinse our your mouth, it really does feel clean and fresh.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like how clean my teeth feel after I brush - almost like the feeling you get when you leave the dentist&#x27;s office and</li>
            <li>I really felt like it got my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>Cleaning - when it comes to cleaning it does clean your teeth very well.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>My whole mouth feels clean after brushing with this.</li>
            <li>but wasn&#x27;t really feeling like my teeth were clean;</li>
            <li>I will keep using it for sure but be aware if you already have issues with sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>First, the first step leaves my mouth feelings like i just put a spoon full of cinnamon in my mouth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear gel that you put on top of the residual first step to polish and whiten.</li>
            <li>Although after receiving my free sample from the brand, I was pleased to discover that although it was a two-step process it does not take twice as long.</li>
            <li>I have tried many whitening gels/toothpastes/strips and all made my teeth ultra sensitive to pretty</li>
            <li>I used this product the first time and really liked how simple it is to use.  </li>
            <li>Plus I really like how clean my mouth felt afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Before I wrote this review, I wanted to be sure that I used it for a solid week in order to determine if the claims being made were true.</li>
            <li>Step 1 is supposed to clean your teeth really well.  </li>
            <li>His whitening results were even more dramatic than mine and he is now a very enthusiastic convert to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>His whitening results were even more dramatic than mine and he is now a very enthusiastic convert to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The directions are very clear and easy to understand.</li>
            <li>The two step process is very easy to use, and it does not add any additional time to my daily routine.  </li>
            <li>&gt; The system is very easy to use, and takes no longer than my regular routine.</li>
            <li>While brushing with the 2nd tube,  I noticed a very strong tingling mint flavor in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>The directions on the reverse of the package were very easy to follow and so simple.</li>
            <li>The step two gel was just the opposite: very easy to squeeze...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy and simple to use and look forward to the continued use of the product.</li>
            <li>At first I thought, really!, two steps!  </li>
            <li>It came in easy to understand packaging, both tubes of toothpaste are easy to squeeze and come out easy without having a mess when it is time to close the cap.</li>
            <li>I have definitely noticed my teeth becoming whiter as well!</li>
            <li>I admit at first I thought 2 minutes was a lot, but after the first brushing, I could feel a difference, and after 3 weeks, I can see a difference in the whiteness of my teeth!</li>
            <li>Step one makes me teeth feel very clean, a just back from the dentist clean.</li>
            <li>I receive a free sample via bzzz agent to try and had high hopes.</li>
            <li>One star off for the high levels of fluoride (I use fluoride free toothpaste),</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to people who wanted a multi-purpose, affordable way to whiten their teeth while at the same time having more effective cleaning.th each step for a minute, you really have to make a conscious effort to reach all surfaces of your teeth in both steps.</li>
            <li>This system offers that, but more importantly, it offers healthy teeth and gum benefits from a very trusted brand.</li>
            <li>This system offers that, but more importantly, it offers healthy teeth and gum benefits from a very trusted brand.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, that&#x27;s not the main thing I&#x27;m looking for and this toothpaste gets it right with the fresh, clean feeling</li>
            <li>The biggest difference seems to be at the gum where it seems to be able to clean better than my usual toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Also, this means I can have white teeth and enjoy my sweets (with my sweet tooth!)</li>
            <li>For someone who is conscious of clean teeth, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this product out!</li>
            <li>I normally use Crest 3D White and that toothpaste leaves a nice minty clean feeling in my mouth way longer than the HD did.  </li>
            <li>I was able to try this new product out thanks to Crest</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this new toothpaste.</li>
            <li>So far, I have really liked using the new Crest Pro Health HD.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seems like a very smart way to make</li>
            <li>So I think Crest really got it right with this set!</li>
            <li>Third, and perhaps most importantly, the toothpaste has given me two large canker sores in my mouth.</li>
            <li>really nothing special.</li>
            <li>As a Bzzagent I was sent a free sample by Crest and couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to use and how white my teeth looked after just four days of use.  </li>
            <li>With crest pro health it was easy to use and comfortable because it was like part of my regular mouth hygiene routine, you just brush with each.</li>
            <li>mouth feels clean after brushing, the polishing action of tube 2 makes my teeth feel just dentist clean.  </li>
            <li>Initially, I was reluctant to try a two step process, but I quickly realized it didn&#x27;t take me any more time than brushing my teeth</li>
            <li>I just love the feeling of super, deep cleaned teeth.  </li>
            <li>That paste was pleasantly minty, a bit thick, and had smooth consistency.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to get the chance to try out the Crest Pro Health® HD™ 2 step system for free!</li>
            <li>However, four hours later after I had eaten lunch I did a quick glance in the mirror to make sure I didn&#x27;t have any food stuck in my teeth.</li>
            <li>This is actually a lot more pleasant than other comparable products.</li>
            <li>I was excited when the Pro-health HD was released and I was lucky enough to recieve it for free to try and review as a BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li>I was not disappointed and in fact, was pleasantly surprised at how quickly I noticed a brighter and whiter smile.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth, so I can&#x27;t really use many of the whitening products on the market.</li>
            <li>My teeth looked whiter from day one but most of all my teeth and mouth felt fresh and clean all day long!</li>
            <li>You aren&#x27;t going to wax your car without really getting it clean first, right?</li>
            <li>, I noticed right from the first time brushing that the flavor was great, and it left my mouth feeling really clean for quite a long time afterward.</li>
            <li>The Crest HD peppermint toothpaste gel made my mouth incredibly fresh even while brushing, foamed very well so that I didn&#x27;t lose any in the sink, and made my teeth feel cleaner than at the dentist!</li>
            <li>My teeth always feel and look extremely clean and smooth and super white.  </li>
            <li>The polishing agent has made my teeth nice and white and I extremely in love with this product and would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li>This stuff is cheaper than the strips too, which is a bonus, and you can whiten during your normal toothbrushing routine which is important when every minute counts during the morning and evening crunch time.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much difference in the whitening itself, but the packaging said to use it for 30 days for the full effect.</li>
            <li>I liked how step 2 actually did help make my teeth more white as well.  </li>
            <li>My mouth felt noticeably cleaner with these two steps than with my usual tooth paste (Sensodyne).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Crest Pro Health for this paste month, I have experienced no increase in tooth sensitivity, but I also have not seen any increase in whiteness.</li>
            <li>This is a good alternate if you don&#x27;t enjoy white strips!</li>
            <li>And by the time I had been using it a full week, I started noticing that my teeth are, in fact, much whiter.</li>
            <li>Crest HD smile is exactly what</li>
            <li>Crest sent me this full-sized system to review for free as a member of Bzz Agent, but I love it so much that I visited the toothpaste aisle of my local Target</li>
            <li>was able to try Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste for free thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li>Additionally, it is generally cheaper than most of the whitening systems out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to try Crest Pro Health HD Daily two step toothpaste for free thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since the first use I could feel my mouth fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;After one week my teeth are whiter.</li>
            <li>I will say that I have used Crest whitening strips in the past and had great results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great product and is worth the extra $$ compared to regular toothpaste</li>
            <li>Yes, it works, but it doesn&#x27;t work any more effectively than my regular toothpaste, which costs about a third of what this system does.</li>
            <li>I do have to say that I am not crazy about the flavor of the first step of the process.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve had success with a whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li>My breath is pretty fresh after every use too.</li>
            <li>My smile is much brighter!</li>
            <li>The first step consists of a kind of a gritty (but gentle!)</li>
            <li>I have been a bit concerned about my teeth being whiter, and the second step toothpaste works great to leave you with a shiny white smile.  </li>
            <li>pros to this toothpaste system are that I noticed a whiter smile after the first use.</li>
            <li>I did switch back to my natural toothpaste as I&#x27;m trying to get rid of my fluoride consumption as much as possible, but use the Crest Pro health HD atleast 2 times a week as maintenance and it seems to be working brilliantly this way!</li>
            <li>So even though I only partially experienced its claims for teeth whitening, I felt it did improve my overall oral health, making it worth buying.ous about lingering morning breath).</li>
            <li>So even though I only partially experienced its claims for teeth whitening, I felt it did improve my overall oral health, making it worth buying.</li>
            <li>It makes my mouth feel like I have had a professional cleaning, and it is amazing to know I can get those results in a few minutes from the comfort of my own home.  </li>
            <li>product is worth trying if you are willing to use a two step dental care system.</li>
            <li>Knowing that the 2 formulas work together to create a healthy (step one), brighter (step 2) smile made the extra step worth it.</li>
            <li>how it makes my teeth feel, but I honestly was expecting my teeth to be whiter after using it for this long.  </li>
            <li>I recently had the opportunity to test and review this toothpaste system, thanks to Crest and BzzAgent, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, has simple and clear directions, is well labeled and the products are very easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li>I received a free set to test and review from Crest, and it seemed like the best opportunity as I had already thrown out my other, older whitening products without realising that natural toothpastes, baking soda and white vinegar aren&#x27;t the quickest methods in brightening your smile!</li>
            <li>It only takes two minutes and it is worth every second for the clean bright feeling</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think this is a nice product to use a few times a week or on special occasions for an quick and noticeable whitening effect.</li>
            <li>I am prone to sensitive teeth and have not had a major reaction to this product, which is good, but I am only using once a day just to be safe.  </li>
            <li>mouth feels fresh and clean which lasts for hours compared to my normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li>the first step really leaves your teeth feeling clean......</li>
            <li>I would absolutely use it just for the great clean feeling if it only did not make my teeth sensitive and have such a strong &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; burn.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about it and how easy it truly is to get fresher brighter teeth and mouth with this!</li>
            <li>Two simple steps that take around two minutes make the brushing routine easy!</li>
            <li>This is such an easy way to get a cleaner, healthier mouth, just brush your teeth twice a day!</li>
            <li>This is a good in between, and for the prize on Amazon it is worth picking up, just realize it is going to take a little time.</li>
            <li>only downside that I found was that this stuff is STRONG!  </li>
            <li>I was originally hesitant to try this product as I have switched to mainly Tom&#x27;s of Maine or Trader Joe&#x27;s brand toothpaste without Fluoride (upon recommendation of my dentist and endocrinologist).  </li>
            <li>I really like the intensity of the first cleaning step, it does kind of dry out my mouth but leaves a stron clean feeling as well.</li>
            <li>My teeth look a little whiter, but they feel clean and thats the most important part.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel healthy and strong, unlike all of the other whitening products and pastes that I have tried over the years.  </li>
            <li>I am so excited to see how much whiter my teeth can get, and I love that I have no sensitivity like when I use white strips.  </li>
            <li>I got to try out the new 2-step program for free through a promotion.</li>
            <li>I received my free bzzkit through Bzzagent of the new Crest HD pro health 2 step brushing system with two pastes.</li>

            <li>I really enjoy this new Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I received a free package of the new Crest ProHealth HD as a BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>love the clean no-plaque feeling that this toothpaste leaves me with all day long!</li>
            <li>They were certainly whiter!</li>
            <li>/&gt;That being said I would recommend this product for people who are looking to try something new, want the lickety clean  teeth, and could use a smile tune up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In addition, I also LOVE the taste that it&#x27;s not too strong and your teeth feel clean and soft ALL day long!  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone who would like whiter teeth and fresh breath in no time!</li>
            <li>My teeth not only feel clean they look really bright and white.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t tell you how many shades whiter my teeth are, but the results are ok, not fabulous</li>
            <li>/&gt;The whitener (Step 2) is great because of the obvious results I got---whiter teeth at last!</li>
            <li>Crest PH HD is a great product to use on a daily basis to not only strengthen your enamal but also to whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li>would say I get that &#x27;fresh from the dentist&#x27; feel from it much more that just regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, great product - just be careful if you have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>I drink a good amount of coffee everyday and after a couple weeks with this product, my employees were even noticing my smile whitening.  </li>
            <li>I do not think my breath got any more fresh with this toothpaste than with regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>This is a two-step process, and the two tubes are clearly labeled and are easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love having to use two different steps in the brushing process but for such great results it&#x27;s worth the extra step!</li>
            <li>Whitening paste works very well and you can quickly see a difference.</li>
            <li>kind of dry-</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to someone looking to whiten their teeth while achieving a healthy smile.</li>
            <li>It definitely gave me more confidence to smile all the time.</li>
            <li>It also tackles the job of giving all the teeth a good treatment vs just the front that strips typically do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a convenient, cheap, and effective way to whiten your teeth while doing an everyday task that we all (hopefully) do anyway.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say the only thing that looks pulled together is his cute smile and mine ;</li>
            <li>It is super fast to use.  </li>
            <li>me, my teeth look whiter and my mouth sure does feel fresh after I brush with Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at how easy this 2 step brushing system was.  </li>
            <li>May be too strong for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>general, I would recommend the product because immediately after the first use, I was amazed to notice that my teeth felt and looked smooth and polished like they do after a visit to my dentist!</li>
            <li>I guess I just expected to have these brilliant white teeth after using the product.  </li>
            <li>They need to be CLEAN, white, and strong.</li>
            <li>Well, because I noticed myself getting a mild headache after using it two times a day for two weeks straight.</li>
            <li>The directions were clearly written and easy to understand the two separate steps.</li>
            <li>For the size of the tubes you are getting and for the job that this set does, you are definitely getting more than your money&#x27;s worth with this product.  </li>
            <li>I really like this system far better than the yucky whitening strips.  </li>
            <li>2 minutes to a healthy, white smile.</li>
            <li>But so far, at least the toothpaste is awesome!!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth, so most whitening products hurt too much to use.  </li>
            <li>It is strong, but not harsh.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use tubes are clearly labeled step 1 and step 2 .</li>
            <li>It took me a couple of tries to get the directions correct &#x3D;) , but after that it was smooth sailing.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are whiter, smoother, and my breath is more fresh since starting this product.  </li>
            <li>Initially I wasn&#x27;t so sure the process was worth it.  </li>
            <li>It was intense, like that feeling you get from that super powered stuff you get at the dentist or one of those breath strips.</li>
            <li>The package was simple and straight to the point which I liked.</li>
            <li>.) packing -&lt;br /&gt;It contains two pieces with clear and easy to understand instructions.</li>
            <li>I went into this not expecting a lot from this product and a few days into it, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Normally, I am not a huge fan of Crest products, but this one was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>I have a new addiction and it is Crest Pro Health HD!!!  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to have fresh breath, clean teeth and a brighter smile.  </li>
            <li>The very first time I used this product my teeth felt so much cleaner.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve ever left the dentist wondering why your teeth can&#x27;t feel that clean every day, I would strongly consider giving this toothpaste a try, because somehow it manages to do exactly</li>
            <li>I saw results within the first few uses, and simple to use with great outcomes!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the white strips and these are more effective and not nearly as time consuming.  </li>
            <li>I was interested to see exactly how a two step toothpaste works and how it fit into my normal brushing routine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had to use white strips in the past, and I&#x27;ve been drinking more coffee now with baby #2, so I&#x27;m happy to say this has kept all the staining to a minimum.</li>
            <li>First of all I love that it has the everyday toothpaste that cleans and keeps mouth healthy.  </li>
            <li>I would normally be turned off by the two step process, but the results are totally worth it!</li>
            <li>i got this product as a free sample, thanks to Crest , and now i am going to make this part of my normal routine!</li>
            <li>Two things that automatically stuck out to me after the first night were that I had no sensitivity like I do with most whitening products and my teeth still felt fresh when I woke up the next morning.</li>
            <li>I liked my hard bristle tooth brush, because my teeth were always very clean &amp;</li>
            <li>So I was super excited to try the new Crest Pro Health HD that I was hearing so much about.</li>
            <li>Despite this issue, if you are willing to go for a very thorough rinse and deal with a mild film thereafter which does fade.  </li>
            <li>While consuming more water is not a bad thing, having a dry mouth is.</li>
            <li>I am happy that it makes me slow down and do a good job brushing my teeth with the two step process.</li>
            <li>The first time you apply a toothpaste and brush for one minute this is super fluoride treated and cleans your teeth very well.  </li>
            <li>I got to try out this cool new 2 Step Toothpaste system!</li>
            <li>The appearance is 5 star, a very modern and up to date flare.</li>
            <li>With not having to worry about my breath and yellow teeth is an very important thing to me and by having the opportunity to try Crest Prohealth HD,</li>
            <li>I also like it because it is very gentle on my gums.</li>
            <li>Very very affordable.</li>
            <li>Like whiter teeth isn&#x27;t enough, my mouth also feels cleaner and my teeth feel very smooth.</li>
            <li>I brush twice a day, and floss daily (Dentists love me), but my teeth have never felt better, or looked better since I started the Crest Pro Health HD routine a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like that my daily brushing can help provide great results for a healthier and whiter smile.</li>
            <li>It, of course, is very straight forward.  </li>
            <li>It does what it says it will do and at a very reasonable cost.  </li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t as gritty and were very smooth.</li>
            <li>but it really was no big deal, though your mouth feels kind of funny and dries out with the first step.  </li>
            <li>tubes stand upright and steady on the bathroom vanity, with not only good sized and easy to read labeling but with an obvious difference between the two containers so likelihood of mixing up the steps is</li>
            <li>although I was willing to try this, I certainly wouldn&#x27;t be repurchasing if it wasn&#x27;t superior to the other products I use.  </li>
            <li>Totally fresh breath, very clean when I run my tongue over my teeth, some improvement on whitening, simple to use.</li>
            <li>I have been a fan of Crest 3D White toothpaste for a quite a while, so I was excited to try a free sample of Crest Pro-Health HD toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>My sensitive teeth were just fine.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel amazingly clean and the process took no longer than normal tooth brushing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The most noticeable difference after brushing that I can tell (vs other toothpaste) is the smooth, polished feel.</li>
            <li>ended up really liking this toothpaste, my main concern of tooth sensitivity was not an issue and my mouth has felt clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I have been using Crest Pro Health toothpastes for several years, so I was excited to get a free sample of Crest Pro Health HD from Crest (as part of a BzzAgent campaign) and try it out.</li>
            <li>The increased sensitivity of my teeth which weren&#x27;t that sensitive before offset the benefits significantly, to the point where I had to debate if it was worth using the product.</li>
            <li>Your teeth are super clean and super white.  </li>
            <li>The first step left my mouth feeling very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I do spend a little longer brushing my teeth than I used to, but that is probably good for getting out any food particles and plaque anyway.</li>
            <li>I do think my teeth look a little whiter which is good</li>
            <li>I was excited to be selected to receive a free set of this from Crest through BzzAgent because I had seen it in the store and advertised and was interested in if it would actually work.</li>
            <li>My teeth looked much whiter after the first use!</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I won&#x27;t likely use it every brushing, I will likely cycle between normal tooth paste and Crest Pro Health HD in the future to keep my teeth feeling wonderful and my smile nice and white.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this toothpaste for all those fortunate enough not to have sensitivity issues as it made my teeth very clean, healthy and white.</li>
            <li>and I was excited to try this new product.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try out this new product.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this new toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to add something new to my routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was excited to try the new Crest Pro Health HD kit</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this new product.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try the new Crest HD product.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive and test the new Crest Pro Health HD system from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try out this new product.</li>
            <li>Product is pleasant-tasting and left my teeth feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>Running my tongue over my teeth, they feel so smooth and clean and looking in the mirror - SO WHITE!  </li>
            <li>The product left my teeth feeling clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I felt fine at first, but after repeated use, my teeth and gums did start to feel quite sensitive.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste left my tooth feeling extremely clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>definitely makes your teeth feel clean and smooth</li>
            <li>and I feel like those actually are easier to use and keep teeth more visibly white, so I&#x27;m not convinced that this is a better system, but for someone who wants the convenience of just brushing teeth rather than using strips, this could work really well.that this is a better system, but for someone who wants the convenience of just brushing teeth rather than using strips, this could work really well.</li>
            <li>After using this for a month, I can definitely tell my teeth and gums feel  clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>It left my mouth clean and my teeth feeling fresh-from-the-dentist smooth.</li>
            <li>Secondly i do notice that the smooth clean feeling of my teeth begins to fade about 1/2 way through the day.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>My teeth were clean, white and smooth.</li>
            <li>I did not see any improvement in the whiting in my teeth and my teeth never really felt all that clean no matter how many times I tried.</li>
            <li>Once open, the process was super easy.</li>
            <li>Instructions are simple and easy to follow - two quick steps but</li>
            <li>It was super easy to incorporate into my daily routine.</li>
            <li>As soon as I figured this out though, I&#x27;ve been able to adjust by brushing more lightly and carefully - I actually pay attention to what I&#x27;m doing while I&#x27;m brushing my teeth now instead of doing it automatically while thinking of a thousand other things.</li>
            <li>After receiving this product as a sample for free from Crest, I was excited to see if it really was worth buying in the future.  </li>
            <li>Reading the instructions (which are very clearly stated), I first felt that the two step routine would be cumbersome, but it immediately gave me the feeling that the product truly addresses both of the aspects most important to me for daily dental care – a healthy mouth and white teeth.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are smooth, and clean, and seem to be whiter than normal, although nobody mentioned anything to me directly or seemed to notice.  </li>
            <li>Also how does Crest expect for someone to really use 2 toothpastes, when most people barely even use one!</li>
            <li>Toothpaste is very high quality and leaves your mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>so I was pretty excited to try out the new Crest Pro-Health HD.</li>
            <li>I have been a Crest user my entire life and was looking forward to trying this new product with the added bonus of better mouth health and whiter teeth!</li>
            <li>The two-step process is super easy and it isn&#x27;t any more time consuming than my regular daily routine.</li>
            <li>It is normal toothpaste with refreshing flavor that actually left my teeth feeling pretty clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to brush a little more gently, because I really love Crest</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of whitening strips, painting-on whiteners, or having to use a special light.  </li>
            <li>It also makes your breathe very fresh and the clean feeling last all day.</li>
            <li>After using Crest HD for just a couple of days, I noticed my mouth felt very fresh and clean, cleaner than just brushing with regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I do have sensitive teeth so any product that whitens my teeth leaves me with a huge headache the day after.</li>
            <li>The two steps are simple and they do make a HUGE difference in how my teeth look and how my mouth feels!  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest for providing me a free sample, it gave me a chance to try something I normally wouldn&#x27;t buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since starting to use the Crest Pro Health HD I have noticed a HUGE change in the sensitivity of my gums!</li>
            <li>The cost comparison to a professional whitening is huge.</li>
            <li>Cant wait to see how much more white they become.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Invisalign for the last year which creates stains on my teeth faster than usual, so this toothpaste has been awesome at preventing that.</li>
            <li>But I cannot stress enough how healthy your mouth will feel.</li>
            <li>but I did notice my teeth were whiter after the first day.</li>
            <li>Despite the higher price I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The first part is a regular toothpaste it seems except with more scrubbing power.</li>
            <li>The 2-step process of Crest Pro-Health HD is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>It kind of felt like I loaded my mouth with Orajel (minus the numbness factor).</li>
            <li>First off, let me say I was pretty skeptical about a product that wanted me to brush once and then brush again, but I&#x27;m very happy that I had the opportunity to try this sample from Bzzagent.</li>
            <li>The first step reminds me a lot of Pepsodent.  </li>
            <li>There are two steps, you first brush with the toothpaste and then the polishing paste.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Crest!</li>
            <li>Of course, I didn&#x27;t notice anything different in color immediately but at the end of a week, I did notice the tea stains mostly gone from my teeth.</li>
            <li>Thanks Crest!</li>
            <li>Though, come to think of, &amp;#34;six shades&amp;#34; is a pretty subjective metric, perhaps by design?</li>
            <li>I have used Crest Pro Health HD for the last week (free courtesy of Crest!)</li>
            <li>It just makes logical sense to me.</li>
            <li>So far, I enjoy it.</li>
            <li>The second stage is where it gets interesting.</li>
            <li>First you brush with the purifying cleanser.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are so much whiter now!  </li>
            <li>and I’m willing to try anything touted as “the biggest breakthrough in toothpaste since fluoride” if it will give me a whiter</li>
            <li>The first week I did not notice a change in the color of my teeth and was beginning to think the product was not working for me.  </li>
            <li>my teeth were so much whiter than when I started!  </li>
            <li>First off the toothpaste worked.</li>
            <li>and I felt like I had visited the dentist after the first brush.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite things about this toothpaste, that I echo others in, is that after brushing I feel like I literally just left the dentist chair</li>
            <li>So many times after step one I started rinsing my mouth and not just spitting before starting step 2.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Crest!</li>
            <li>In general I am pleased with the product and thanks</li>
            <li>Immediately after brushing for the first time, my teeth felt noticeably smoother and cleaner.</li>
            <li>The polish does have a better taste, though it doesn&#x27;t seem to still make me feel like I just brushed my teeth.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t like the products because after using since last so many days now my gums have started giving me burning sensation</li>
            <li>At first I thought Step 1 was too &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I used this toothpaste exactly as directed.</li>
            <li>Really pleased and will definitely continue to purchase!  </li>
            <li>It adds in gentle whitening and sparkle to my smile.</li>
            <li>In addition to that, my teeth because noticeably whiter over the course of the first week.</li>
            <li>It may seem intimidating at first</li>
            <li>See result within first time using.</li>
            <li>Much better than using white strips!</li>
            <li>I could tell a difference from the first use:</li>
            <li>I was amazed after the first time I used this 2 step system for cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I love that Crest Pro - Health HD Daily does not make my teeth hurt or my gums sore</li>
            <li>My wife, who never comments on such things, even noticed and said how much better (whiter, brighter, cleaner)</li>
            <li>Overall, I love the product.</li>
            <li>First you brush with the paste for a minute, spit but not rinse, and then use the gel for one minute and then rinse.</li>
            <li>The first tube of paste was pretty minty.</li>
            <li>first step (brushing for 1 minute with gray tube) feels like a tooth/gum exfoliation treatment.</li>
            <li>At first thought the two steps would be a pain</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes after the first time i used it.</li>
            <li>They also looked whiter after the first use.</li>
            <li>First, the system:  there are 2 tubes.  </li>
            <li>And then you put the second paste on your toothbrush, and brush for one more minute with this one.  </li>
            <li>but it is better than using white strips or a whitening gel kit.  </li>
            <li>I could notice a difference the first time I used Crest Pro Health HD.</li>
            <li>First, it is a PAIN to travel with.</li>
            <li>first I just didn&#x27;t like this.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I felt that my teeth were cleaner that ever.</li>
            <li>My teeth are more noticeably white.</li>
            <li>combines exactly what I am looking for in a</li>
            <li>The first tube is used for one minute and cleans plaque from the teeth.</li>
            <li>Better than regular tooth</li>
            <li>Each steps makes me feel more involved in dental care than just standing around brushing for 2 minutes as I&#x27;ve done for decades and what is traditionally recommended.</li>
            <li>first time I used it I followed the instructions to bruch with one toothpaste for a minute and then use the whitening gel for another minute.</li>
            <li>so I can be sure that the results are lasting and that I indeed see results.</li>
            <li>I gave it a try as my smile is much brighter.</li>
            <li>am recommending this product to anyone looking for healthy and white teeth without sensitivity.</li>
            <li>The first step cleans away plaque and the polish...</li>
            <li>This left my teeth plaque free all day!</li>
            <li>Make sure you only spit after this first step without rinsing because you need to move on to step two.</li>
            <li>After the first use my teeth felt smoother and cleaner.</li>
            <li>So, first off, did Crest Pro Health HD make my teeth whiter?  </li>
            <li>4 minutes of tooth brushing is pretty</li>
            <li>DO appear, but I wasn&#x27;t alarmed at all since I&#x27;m well aware of how hydrogen peroxide operates.  </li>
            <li>My teenage daughters have also used it and love it.</li>
            <li>I was&#x27;t sure how to write this review, because it&#x27;s a highly personal thing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now, and I am enjoying it overall.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve always wanted that movie star white but haven&#x27;t been able to attain it.</li>
            <li>Confident that as I continue to use this system they will only get whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the way my entire mouth tastes and feels after I brush.</li>
            <li>Much more effect than white strips, trays, rinses, etc.</li>
            <li>i consistently forget to not wash out my mouth after the first tube, so it ends up defeating the purpose</li>
            <li>It is not terrible but it just doesn&#x27;t have that same texture as&amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The Crest Pro-Health HD toothpaste works really well!</li>
            <li>I saw some lightening after the first time using it!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>and he was amazed with the first brush to.  </li>
            <li>Buying this when it first came out was just an impulse buy</li>
            <li>First, (the silver Step 1 tube) you brush for one minute with a fluoride-based gel.</li>
            <li>From the first brush I am now hooked.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe the difference in my teeth from the time of my first review until now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Colgate Total for a long time and happy with it.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference with the first use.</li>
            <li>I could see and feel a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>first night I followed the instructions exactly.  </li>
            <li>You first brush with step 1 then spit then</li>
            <li>This stuff does exactly what you&#x27;d want it.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like using two different tubes to brush.</li>
            <li>First you use the cleanser to brush your teeth for one minute, followed by another minute with the perfecting gel.</li>
            <li>The second application of gel, tastes just okay, but it whitens your teeth.  </li>
            <li>first comment my husband</li>
            <li>Although this is a two-step process, it does not take any more time than regular brushing, and within a week, the difference is being noticed.</li>
            <li>The results are MUCH more gradual than white strips but that&#x27;s ok for me since this is supposed to become part of your daily routine.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more, especially now that my husband is hooked too!</li>
            <li>I received the Crest Pro Health® HD™ Daily 2-Step System free from BzzAgent and Crest (thank you!).</li>
            <li>I truly believe I have a whiter smile thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>BUT after a visit to my dentist, I was ecstatic that for the first time EVER</li>
            <li>It definitely promotes brushing your teeth more and longer however I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now, twice a day, and have not noticed any changes in whiteness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;d asked me during my first two weeks of use if I would recommend it</li>
            <li>Although it is humiliating to admit, my teeth have really paid the price!</li>
            <li>Overall my mouth felt cleaner and my teeth were whiter, there was a noticeable difference for sure.</li>
            <li>So I first tried step one.  </li>
            <li>The first step is cleaning your teeth with this system.</li>
            <li>Cleaner and whiter teeth for an overall healthy mouth.</li>
            <li>Thanks for sending this to me Crest!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see how healthy and white my teeth (and gums)</li>
            <li>I did have a bit of discomfort with Step 2 at first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting married this September and will continue to use this product</li>
            <li>I felt it the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>I do believe my mouth feels cleaner and smoother...even more than my Colgate total.</li>
            <li>The first bottle cleans your teeth with a grainy textured material.</li>
            <li>I noticed the feeling of cleaner teeth after the first brushing.  </li>
            <li>and I find that when I use this consistently, it does aggravate my sensitivities.  </li>
            <li>And, while I have always used Crest and been satisfied with their products, I was not a big fan of the whitening strips.</li>
            <li>i really love this product and definitely recommend it!  </li>
            <li>Since I started using it, I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on how white my teeth are.</li>
            <li>I felt like this product worked exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>I was sent this exact kit by Crest through BzzAgent to review.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m sure the product still worked in whitening, it&#x27;s more of a maintenance thing after that since you won&#x27;t see such a big difference anymore</li>
            <li>compared to the first time.</li>
            <li>I am IN LOVE with this tooth paste and will never go back.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample from Crest, and have been surprised at how well Crest Pro-Health HD works.  </li>
            <li>From the first time I used it, I immediately felt a difference.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really describe the taste; it&#x27;s not at all minty but is sort of fresh.  </li>
            <li>There were many places on my gums (I&#x27;m embarrassed to say) where it bubbled up white as peroxide does on an infected wound.  </li>
            <li>The first is that there is no minty taste which I am used to with toothpaste</li>
            <li>The first step came in a tube with a flip off cap.  </li>
            <li>The first step came in a tube with a flip off cap.  </li>
            <li>I am not sorry I tried this product.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste is different than most in that it comes in two tubes.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not that noticeable in my opinion, and I used it exactly as prescribed.</li>
            <li>The first step is to brush with the cleaning toothpaste, which tastes just like crest toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The second step is to brush again with the whitening toothpaste, which also tastes a bit like crest toothpaste, and a bit more jelly</li>
            <li>First time I used this two step process</li>
            <li>The first step is a purifying cleanser aka anti cavity fluoride toothpaste, that after you brush for one min, you spit but do NOT rinse.</li>
            <li>First impressions:  </li>
            <li>After just one use it felt like I just got out of the dentist and the just brushed feeling stuck with me most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Today is day 4 for me of using this product and I am really liking it!</li>
            <li>The brushing experience was exactly what you would expect.</li>
            <li>Many people have also mentioned that your teeth feel as if you just left the dentist.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>It goes away once you are able to rinse after the second phase</li>
            <li>They all do an okay job at tackling my surface stains, but I&#x27;ve never gotten results as white as those pictured on the packages before.  </li>
            <li>The first is a purifying cleanser that “helps strip away plaque.”</li>
            <li>I went for my first appointment for a crown and told the dentist and his assistant that I was going to try this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>but I could feel a difference from the first use.</li>
            <li>I first tried the Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste about a month ago.  </li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend Crest Pro Health HD to all my friends, family, coworkers and even strangers in the toothpaste aisle at the store!</li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to get to try it for free thanks to Crest and Bzzagent.com.  </li>
            <li>Yet, I went to the hygienist and tried this that same night and was pleased I had no issues.</li>
            <li>I must sayI love having white teeth.</li>
            <li>Sure you have to use two different products</li>
            <li>I felt a cleaner, healthier mouth immediately with the first use.</li>
            <li>It is nothing more than simply brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li>After the first day, I could tell my teeth were whiter.  </li>
            <li>It feels like with this system the first toothpaste helps coat your teeth to prevent the sensitivity.</li>
            <li>First you use step 1 to brush your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I think the first step gets the plaque off of your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of whitening toothpastes and strips -they worked ok, but the brightness always was temporary, never lasting the promised months of whiteness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This makes me pay more attention to my brushing time, so I think I actually brush longer when I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely better than regular whitening toothpastes!</li>
            <li>but I found I was willing to perform the two steps.</li>
            <li>First, it does work.</li>
            <li>My mouth felt cleaner after the first use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll post the first two photos so you can see the difference.  </li>
            <li>We will use this again for sure and it can only get better after another week based on what we saw after only one week.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a 2 step process, the first tube they say is what brushes away plaque and cleans your teeth.</li>
            <li>first tube is your &amp;#34;plaque stripping&amp;#34; paste...</li>
            <li>first brush your teeth with  step one  </li>
            <li>Used exactly as recommended for three weeks.</li>
            <li>(I really wish I took before pictures!)</li>
            <li>My wife made a comment on the first day itself that my teeth are brighter and whiter.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and definitely prefer it to whiten my teeth over whitening strips.</li>
            <li>But I was satisfied with this product overall.</li>
            <li>Thanks crest and Bzzagent for the freebie!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first two-step product I have tried.  </li>
            <li>First you brush and &amp;#34;exfoliate&amp;#34; your teeth then don&#x27;t rinse and use the whitening toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Crest for letting me try this out!</li>
            <li>After the first use I felt and saw a difference</li>
            <li>and I have really been liking it!  </li>
            <li>But it worked really well!</li>
            <li>I never saw much of a difference with just toothpaste, but I could feel and see a difference with this!</li>
            <li>When I first received this product, I was hesitant as this was a two step process.  </li>
            <li>The first part of the Crest Pro-Health HD Toothpaste kit is a cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Began using this the first day I received it.  </li>
            <li>2 weeks later, I&#x27;m completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>(although you can also pick it up at your local Walgreen’s, or Wal-mart store, too) just to make sure I can get my hands on it when I run out.  </li>
            <li>first I was unsure about adding another step to my morning brushing routine.</li>
            <li>I did have a tad bit of sensitivity in the first week, but that went away week 2.</li>
            <li>It is a feeling like when you first leave the dentist&#x27;s office after having a thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li>but you get use to it after the first week.  </li>
            <li>It took about a month to notice my brighter smile, but you will notice your teeth feeling smoother much sooner.  </li>
            <li>You just spit (but don&#x27;t rinse) after using the first product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes</li>
            <li>When I compare this to whitening systems, the costs seem much better and I will definitely keep using it for that reason.</li>
            <li>Overall my mouth feels cleaner, healthier and better.  </li>
            <li>but a consistent level of whiteness that matched where I started.</li>
            <li>So all I needed to do was add two more minutes to my current routine (one minute per morning &amp; evening brushing).</li>
            <li>… I went three better and gave it TEN days and… Nuthin.&#x27;</li>
            <li>I love the flavor of this toothpaste, especially the first step.  </li>
            <li>Felt like I could tell a difference with the first week, no sensitivity issues like whitening products can sometimes cause.</li>
            <li>First brush with tube 1 for 60 seconds, spit, brush with tube 2 for 60 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First thing after the birth I had to cancel my dentist appointment :</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take any extra time to brush, just one more step in the process.  </li>
            <li>While I must admit, the Step 1 paste isn&#x27;t my personal favorite for flavor</li>
            <li>I love it and would definitely recommend it</li>
            <li>I will say that when I first started using this kit my gums did hurt after I was finished brushing them.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li>Works exactly as mentioned.</li>
            <li>I could tell a difference from the first use:</li>
            <li>Thanks Crest for the pretty smile.</li>
            <li>My husband will more than likely be switching to this brand since you can&#x27;t beat the feeling of just having your mouth cleaned by dentist every time you brush with it!</li>
            <li>I felt sensitivity after my first use, but none at all since then, and I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks.</li>
            <li>There is a definite difference, but I was hoping for more.</li>
            <li>I am an avid coffee drinker</li>
            <li>but I was willing to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I LOVE crest products and have used the 3D tooth paste and white strips for years.  </li>
            <li>opened the first tube which is step</li>
            <li>However, that is where the similarity ended because after the first minute ended</li>
            <li>Only criticism is that it seemed to have more of Step 2 than Step 1 product.</li>
            <li>I noticed that my teeth were whiter after the first use.</li>
            <li>did give it more of a trial, just in case my initial reactions were incorrect, but nothing changed.  </li>
            <li>I have to admit, I have healthy and white teeth, and always have.  </li>
            <li>One thing that takes some getting used to is that you are not supposed to spit after using the first step.  </li>
            <li>And, while I have always used Crest and been satisfied with their products, I was not a big fan of the whitening strips.</li>
            <li>Only time will tell how much more whitening will take place</li>
            <li>The first step paste tastes like the diet gum from the 80’s with a hint of candy cigarettes.  </li>
            <li>The first step with flouride that strips away plaque feels like going to the dentist.</li>
            <li>First, there are two separate bottles.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see a noticeable difference on the first use or on the mid-point either.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s safe to say Crest has won me back.</li>
            <li>From the first use of this two-step system, I saw a noticeable difference in my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I have always been a fan of Crest whitening strips and have received many compliments on my &amp;#34;glowing white teeth&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>While it is slightly more work to use Step 2 than to just brush with one toothpaste, it only adds about 15 seconds to the process which is not too strenuous.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First off.  </li>
            <li>AS an avid smoker</li>
            <li>i was pretty interested in trying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Received this free to test through Bzzagent &amp; have used for a month so far.</li>
            <li>Not 100% sure that this is related to the toothpaste</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s more of a symbol that it&#x27;s actually working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First, my mouth and teeth have never felt cleaner than they do after brushing with this product.</li>
            <li>I used this system for exactly one month.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received the toothpaste complimentary thanks to Crest</li>
            <li>Continuous use really is needed to keep up the brightness, but it&#x27;s well worth the time and effort.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a 2 step process first step</li>
            <li>As background, I am avid about flossing every day and brushing as well.  </li>
            <li>This is the first product that does what it advertises.  </li>
            <li>My dad is a dentist, so I am pretty picky with my toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I did not notice a difference after my first use in regards to whiter teeth, but after a week or so, my teeth did appear whiter.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel like they have been professionally cleaned and stay glassy smooth through the day.</li>
            <li>I love the taste of the deep cleaning toothpaste though!</li>
            <li>The first time using a whitening product and did not find any improvement in the color of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this system for about two weeks now and my teeth really are whiter!</li>
            <li>It was a refreshing mint flavor and the paste was not gritty at all.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty much the smile that I always wanted.</li>
            <li>I did experience some sensitivity in the first week but haven&#x27;t had any problems since.  </li>
            <li>First time it&#x27;s happened without increased sensitivity.</li>
            <li>At first I thought doing two brushings would be inconvienient, but at all.</li>
            <li>The first step is about 2 min of brushing and the tube is 1 minute of brushing.  </li>
            <li>I used it the first day</li>
            <li>My husband has also tried it and noticed a difference after the first try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first tube contains a paste that is recognizable as a Crest paste.  </li>
            <li>Since this was my first try with this combo</li>
            <li>This is the first time I tried Crest Pro-Health tooth paste.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt much cleaner after just 1 use!</li>
            <li>Step 1 has a flip top which is simple to use.  </li>
            <li>Step 2 however has an oval twist top which is a bit cumbersome since this is being done in the middle of the brushing.  </li>
            <li>: so I brush, rinse, fluoride, waterpick, multiple dental cleaning just to stay on top of it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to try a two step process, twice a day, and stick to it.  </li>
            <li>teeth looked whiter in the first week.&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>You brush with step one first, then you brush with the step two paste.</li>
            <li>This product adds a step, since you brush first with step 1, then with step 2, one minute each.</li>
            <li>All I had to do was brush with the first step for one minute.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it was at night.  </li>
            <li>I have the products that I use and love, so I don&#x27;t usually branch out, but I received this Crest ProHealth HD product as a BzzzAgent, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>My mouth felt noticeably cleaner after the first use and felt cleaner overnight.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I saw immediate results after the first brushing when using this.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Crest!</li>
            <li>I followed the exact process for seven days.</li>
            <li>The first step is brushing for one minute with the purifying cleanser which I found to have a refreshing flavor, then, without rinsing, the second step is brushing for an additional minute with the perfecting gel which, although not as “tasty” as the first step, I did not find objectionable at all.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product in hopes that the whitening process continues and because I love the healthy mouth feeling that it leaves (although I am not exactly sure how to assess if its use results in a “6x healthier mouth” as the packaging claims).</li>
            <li>From the first use I felt a difference it gave</li>
            <li>I also see a difference my teeth looked whiter from the first use.</li>
            <li>The taste for the first step was okay, the second step tasted like peroxide.</li>
            <li>Thanks Crest!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it at first.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t care for the taste of step 2, wasn&#x27;t minty</li>
            <li>First, you apply Step 1, a purifying cleanser, and brush for one minute.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely sold on this product!</li>
            <li>promotion from the brand, and that is why I wasn&#x27;t worried about the price at first.</li>
            <li>The second step was the most troublesome with this issue and would just sit in one spot, requiring some fancy maneuvering to get it around.  </li>
            <li>I also had issues with the toothpaste peeling the top layer of skin from the inside of my cheeks and lips after each use- gross!</li>
            <li>I immediately saw a difference in my teeth after the first use.</li>
            <li>At first I was worried the kit comes with 2 separate tubes of toothpaste.</li>
            <li>First you purifying cleanser for one minute then without rinsing you add the polishing gel  and brush your teeth for an additional minute before rinsing.</li>
            <li>Its not terribly distracting, but definitely a place for improvement.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Crest!</li>
            <li>I received this toothpaste from BzzAgent and Crest for review and my first thoughts before trying it was &amp;#34;oh another toothpaste&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>kit itself consists of 2 steps which is definitely more work than using a regular toothpaste</li>
            <li>I am really interested in finding whitening toothpaste that works.</li>
            <li>Overall, I was expecting more</li>
            <li>But after using this product, I started noticing a change after the first couple of times using it.  </li>
            <li>I noticed whitening the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I recived this profuct as a promotional item, so I was glad to find out it sells for about $12 at a local retailer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You first brush for 1 minute with tube 1 - the cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I would highly reccommend!!</li>
            <li>the first time I used Crest HD, I felt like I just came from my dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>I particularly love the second step of the system.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Crest!</li>
            <li>I can only imagine how well the system works with one of the more high-tech brushes (sonic) applying the pastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so we could make sure that we were following the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>First impressions, I didn&#x27;t care for the flavor of either tube.</li>
            <li>I was glad to go back to a one tube sensitivity Crest</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in the color of my teeth after the first use, and it has only gotten better from there.  </li>
            <li>I received a free sample of Crest Pro Health HD from Crest through BzzAgent and I am loving the results.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of a traditional toothpaste, this is 2-part product which will replace brushing &amp; using white strips.</li>
            <li>First, you brush for 1 minute with the step 1 purifying cleanser, then spit that out, and brush for an additional minute with the step 2 purifying gel.</li>
            <li>The gel makes your teeth whiter the first use.</li>
            <li>They are whiter, but overall I think that crest whitestrips do a better job whitening.</li>
            <li>You brush your teeth with this first for 1 minute, and spit but do not rinse with water.  </li>
            <li>You brush with this second step for 1 minute, spit (but don&#x27;t rinse), and brush for 1 minute more.  </li>
            <li>After I had been using the Crest Pro Health HD for a couple weeks, my mom came into town and one of the first things she said to me was to ask if I had had my teeth whitened.  </li>
            <li>At first I was hesitant to try a 2-step system for a toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The step 1 fluoride is exactly what I need - removes plaque and reduces gingivitis.</li>
            <li>I personally just like a stronger, more pungent flavor.</li>
            <li>any case, I will say that I was really glad I got this opportunity because my teeth definitely look whiter.</li>
            <li>Answer that, and I&#x27;ll be a willing customer to give it</li>
            <li>Until then, use your favorite toothpaste, and try the next Crest product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always felt like they might have been preventing my teeth from yellowing more than they were actually whitening my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I use my regular 1 step toothpaste when I&#x27;m in a hurry and use this one at night when I have a bit more time.</li>
            <li>Thanks CREST!</li>
            <li>After the first time, I immediately noticed a difference in the color and appearance of my teeth.</li>
            <li>I really noticed a difference in my teeth in just 2 days even though they guarantee results in 6!</li>
            <li>My friends have definitely noticed me smiling more, and even though my teeth were already pretty white, I feel better knowing that the most recent coffee and tea stains have been cleared.</li>
            <li>I have been using crest whitening products for over a year now and crest hd really gets the job done!</li>
            <li>Will most definitely be purchasing this product again!</li>
            <li>I do want to advise using an electric toothbrush since it does breakdown plaque and superficial stains faster and better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>it really doesn&#x27;t take up any additional time at all!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s for real!</li>
            <li>I noticed after the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>Overall I think this toothpaste is ok.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please note on the image I did use natural light for both shots.</li>
            <li>The only negatives to this product is the extra time and effort it will add to your morning/evening routine and the fact that the second toothpaste does not have the best flavor.</li>
            <li>Only step 1 is flip top while step 2 is a twist off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I truly believe that using Crest Pro Health HD really improved my dental hygiene too (and yes, just after a week!).</li>
            <li>I truly believe that using Crest Pro Health HD really improved my dental hygiene too (and yes, just after a week!).</li>
            <li>I saw results in the first three days.</li>
            <li>I told them I use the Crest Pro-Health, much cheaper than professional whitening and for me worked much better with absolute no pain.</li>
            <li>However, after my first week I began to tell a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li>I am an avid coffee drinker</li>
            <li>so I am glad to get rid of that yellow tint.  </li>
            <li>I have to literally take my phone to time myself, two minutes total, to make sure I do one minute for each step.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely buy this again! :)</li>
            <li>The consistency of the first tube is more like regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I first began using the products I did experience some sensitivity to my gums.  </li>
            <li>am a pretty faithful Crest consumer.  </li>
            <li>Another issue that I had when using this was the instructions that tell you not to rinse after the first product is used.  </li>
            <li>I wasn’t sure if my teeth actually looked whiter until I went to the dentist about a week in to using Crest HD and</li>
            <li>first you brush with a mint flavored paste and then brush again with a gel that polishes the teeth.</li>
            <li>The Polishing treatment is more satisfyingly gritty compared to the HD Perfecting Gel that is paired with this Purifying Cleanser.</li>
            <li>I see a much whiter and brighter smile in my mirror in just days.</li>
            <li>&amp; I can&#x27;t believe how much it has helped whiten my teeth!</li>
            <li>Well, the Crest Pro-Health HD toothpaste &amp; whitening gel combo gave me that exact feeling too.</li>
            <li>Well, the Crest Pro-Health HD toothpaste &amp; whitening gel combo gave me that exact feeling too.</li>
            <li>I even stopped using sensodyne, which was my go to toothpaste, whenever I ate ice-cream or  drink something hot.</li>
            <li>I tried it and from the first brushing itself I knew that product works well.</li>
            <li>Step one is supposed to strip away plaque and that&#x27;s exactly what I felt it did.</li>
            <li>overall I&#x27;m satisfied with the product</li>
            <li>and my teeth are so much whiter!</li>
            <li>I love the way my teeth feel immediately after brushing and four the next 10ish hours.  </li>
            <li>I really love crest pro health HD daily !</li>
            <li>I received my package yesterday and couldn&#x27;t wait to try my first cleaning.  </li>
            <li>My first application was at night</li>
            <li>First, (the silver Step 1 tube) you brush for one minute with a fluoride-based gel.  </li>
            <li>it happens even when we brush our teeth consistently.</li>
            <li>You will feel a difference the first time you use it.  </li>
            <li>By the end of the first week, my teeth were noticeably whiter, even as a tea and coffee drinker.</li>
            <li>But I still think the toothpaste works better for cleaning teeth than regular toothpaste and would recommend it for that.  </li>
            <li>I love Crest pro-health Hd daily two step toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed, however, if my teeth are whiter, so I might give the product more time to see if I can notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;One last note, which may be nitpicky.</li>
            <li>but it takes longer than that for me to make sure that all of my teeth have been adequately brushed</li>
            <li>I figured a 2-step process would be time consuming or more work than it actually was.</li>
            <li>My first concern was (A)</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what advantages there were over stannous fluoride, but according to Crests website it differs from sodium fluoride in that it not only helps with cavity protection but also protects against plaque, gingivitis and tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li>My only criticism is that step 2, the tube should have been a flip top like step 1.</li>
            <li>You use the first tube -- toothpaste -- for one minute.</li>
            <li>And I swear they were shinier and maybe a tad whiter after the first use.</li>
            <li>hopefully more white as I keep using it!</li>
            <li>I received crest pro-health Hd tooth paste through bzzagent thanks to Crest !</li>
            <li>At first I thought it would be a pain to use a two step system</li>
            <li>What I like most about it is your teeth feel like you have just left the dentist after each brush.</li>
            <li>I thought I would give this a try first.  </li>
            <li>At best, I was skeptical that the system would do all it promised.</li>
            <li>The two step process is fun, and makes me feel super efficient in getting that deep clean feeling.</li>
            <li>At first I felt like the 2 pastes were going to be a pain, but I feel like I can tell which part</li>
            <li>After the first use, I could tell a difference.</li>
            <li>The first part, paste #1, is like having an scrub on your teeth.</li>
            <li>I use this with my Sonicare tooth brush and it works pretty well</li>
            <li>In the first step, you brush with the toothpaste for a minute.  </li>
            <li>All I can say was I didn&#x27;t believe the hype until after the first brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier than whitening strips!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any immediate difference in the whiteness of my teeth after the first use.</li>
            <li>Whiter teeth after first use.</li>
            <li>I am an avid coffee and tea drinker</li>
            <li>First, the instructions to brush using each tube for one minute means I&#x27;m spending two minutes at a time on my teeth twice a day, rather than the one  minute that I too hastily have been doing.</li>
            <li>I thought I was imagining it when I noticed it at the end of the first day</li>
            <li>The second part was more of a whiting gel but made my teeth feel cleaner and whiter after I was done.</li>
            <li>I received my Crest Pro Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Since the Crest white strips have to be on your teeth for ~30 minutes, I wasn&#x27;t sure this would work considering you rinse after about 2-3 minutes</li>
            <li>It works and it is MUCH easier than the whitening strips and mouth wash!</li>
            <li>I saw the first day I tried it.</li>
            <li>fact it feels better after doing the two steps, mouth feels fresher and gives the protection to your teeth that regular toothpaste gives you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the first use of Crest Pro Health HD, I could detect no difference on my &amp;#34;senior&amp;#34; teeth.</li>
            <li>I recently was able to try this product through BZZ AGent.  </li>
            <li>first step is to brush your teeth with the step one product then just spit it out ...</li>
            <li>The second paste is more like a gel.  </li>
            <li>By isolating toothpaste ingredients,I felt the difference first time I used.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t use it for the full 2 minutes, I just brush my teeth until satisfied, and my teeth are brighter and it has helped me keep my pink gums.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was a skeptic at first</li>
            <li>and I am sure that the extra brushing will pay off at my bi-annual trip to the dentist.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for over a month</li>
            <li>After the first use my mouth felt noticeably cleaner and the freshness lasted longer.</li>
            <li>At first I did not see any whitening effect</li>
            <li>Pretty comparable in terms of results though.</li>
            <li>First one tastes like mint toothpaste</li>
            <li>The first is considered a purifying cleanser designed to strip away plaque.  </li>
            <li>At first I was like ugh</li>
            <li>instead you add the second step which immediately makes your mouth feel better.  </li>
            <li>One one hand it works really well!</li>
            <li>The toothpaste (step 1) tastes exactly like their Pro Health toothpaste.</li>
            <li>my teeth are not only super-slick, but my gums are noticeably better too.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>To use, you first brush with the &#x27;paste&#x27; for 1 minute, then add the whitening &#x27;gel&#x27; and brush for another minute.</li>
            <li>First, having to use 2 separate tubes of &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; during a morning and evening routine is a bit cumbersome.  </li>
            <li>I seen results in the first week.</li>
            <li>I do think that those with straighter teeth will likely have better results than I have had.</li>
            <li>Then the second tube, is a screw top which is a pain in the butt.</li>
            <li>But, like I said, it&#x27;s probably a better option for people who regularly whiten.</li>
            <li>&gt; - Didn&#x27;t see results as white as promised but still better than average&lt;br</li>
            <li>They could look more white, so I wouldn&#x27;t use this as just a whitener, but the shine is noticeable.</li>
            <li>followed the directions exactly- brushing in two steps with a minute each.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t take much longer!</li>
            <li>From the first time I used it my teeth</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and will be sticking with this toothpaste from now on!!  </li>
            <li>I got many comments on my white teeth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more likely to use it that way.  </li>
            <li>At first i thought it would be a pain</li>
            <li>Better than strips that only touch the front surfaces.</li>
            <li>I noticed results after the first time I used it on my tea-stained teeth.</li>
            <li>and I will be purchasing more in the future!</li>
            <li>then you brush again with the whitening gel at first</li>
            <li>My teeth are generally whiter, which is good since I drink coffee and soda regularly.  </li>
            <li>and I love how white my teeth are looking.</li>
            <li>Having just had a baby this past year, I wasn&#x27;t doing the best I could to take care of my teeth, then I got the opportunity to sample the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free and loooove it!</li>
            <li>BUT, my breath stayed so fresh for the whole day AND the whitening step didn&#x27;t sting my gums like others have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not notice a difference after my first use in regards to whiter teeth, but after a week or so, my teeth did appear whiter.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed that the whitening portion left marks on my gums where there was damage, and as time passed by, these spots improved and many disappeared.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend Crest Pro Health® HD™ to anyone looking to whiten their smile and get a healthier mouth.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to thoroughly verify this, but I do know that I don&#x27;t have any cavities or issues at present.</li>
            <li>The results are real and I am a believer!</li>
            <li>At first I was thinking why brush my teeth twice.  </li>
            <li>But I was open minded and tried the product and was so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it would be too time consuming with my hectic life</li>
            <li>You’ll feel the difference from the first use and have a 6x healthier mouth and 6x whiter teeth in one</li>
            <li>first step involves a &amp;#34;not-too-abrasive cleaner.&amp;#34; (I&#x27;ve tried a lot worse.)&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Cleans well, lightened well, the only thing I did not like about it is I wish it had more flavor (mint).  </li>
            <li>Overall, it was ok but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty ambivalent about.  </li>
            <li>Let me first talk about the packaging because it what we see first.</li>
            <li>I had to use the step one first .Step 1</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have that with my first month of using Crest Pro Health HD.</li>
            <li>I tried it out, and within the first 2 days I dramatically saw the difference.  </li>
            <li>now that I&#x27;ve actually been using Pro Health HD, I&#x27;m really glad I signed up.</li>
            <li>For the first couple of weeks trying this product, I used it exclusively.</li>
            <li>For the first couple of weeks trying this product, I used it exclusively.</li>
            <li>My fresh breath lasts longer and my mouth feels much cleaner.</li>
            <li>The first step cleans my mouth well</li>
            <li>After the first use, I did notice some results.  </li>
            <li>My teeth did appear to be whiter but not six times whiter since it was the first use.  </li>
            <li>It works exactly as it says it will.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too harsh, and it tastes pretty good too.</li>
            <li>Using 2 separate pastes/gels seemed like it may be a hassle at first, but once I tried the product, I was hooked.</li>
            <li>brands because this really made a difference!  </li>
            <li>The dreaded &amp;#34;hydrogen peroxide&amp;#34; feel/taste of white strips and whitening mouthwash is avoided while getting way better</li>
            <li>They may cause temporary sensitivity, but the results are immediate and you, most likely, won&#x27;t have bleeding gums.</li>
            <li>but when you rush in the morning you don&#x27;t want to guess which one you have to use first.</li>
            <li>Since my gums are healthy and white already, I didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li>much more so than my regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>So quickly more white that the rest of the family wanted to use the product I have bought some for all of them to use.  </li>
            <li>After three days of use, I noticed that my teeth were more sensitive than normal.  </li>
            <li>but they bother my gums so I was interested to try this.</li>
            <li>When I first saw the package I thought that there was no way that I would like it, the package can make the two step process look like it’s going to be cumbersome and time consuming.  </li>
            <li>The first time I put this in my mouth, I immediately wanted to spit it out.</li>
            <li>I drink a lot of coffee, especially during the colder months, and I was glad to see some of the superficial coffee stains were removed.  </li>
            <li>The first is that the two step process takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s something to be aware of.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product I was amazed.</li>
            <li>I (and my fianc&amp;eacute;) have noticed a difference in</li>
            <li>The first three days I used it in the morning and in the evening.</li>
            <li>I brush with the first step until my toothbrush stops after a minute, and then I add the gel and brush for another minute.</li>
            <li>So far it has done a good job of making my teeth feel clean, and my teeth are slightly brighter.</li>
            <li>I loved the product and noticed a difference in how my teeth felt and looked within a few days.</li>
            <li>I would easily give this 5 stars, if the taste of Step-2 was a little more pleasing.</li>
            <li>My teeth was a nice shiny shade of white and not dull beige,  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised that my teeth were noticeably whiter/lighter and felt as clean as when I just come from the dentist.</li>
            <li>I actually got my Crest Pro Health HD free through a BzzAgent Campaign, but I&#x27;m seriously thinking this is my family&#x27;s new toothpaste regimen! :D</li>
            <li>It not only made my mouth feel clean, but made my smile whiter!</li>
            <li>My teeth feel dentist clean after this product, but I don&#x27;t know if that is due to me spending more time brushing or what.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been a &amp;#34;Crest Kid&amp;#34; my whole life but had never really strayed beyond just their typical toothpastes as I&#x27;ve always been happy with them - mostly the whitening and baking soda &amp; peroxide.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for only a couple of weeks, but so far it leaves my mouth feeling super fresh and healthy with no adverse affects.</li>
            <li>I was kind of put of at first  by the 2 step brushing process of Crest Pro Health HD,  however I got over it quite quickly after using a few times.  </li>
            <li>What a pleasant surprise - the first step is a minty winter green flavor with a very minute amount of grit in it.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest for the free sample and for getting me hooked on a new toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Crest sent me their new product ( Crest Pro HealthÂ® HDâ„¢) to try out and to give my honest feed back.</li>
            <li>Thanks Crest for letting me try your new product free.</li>
            <li>The second step polishes your teeth, and leaves them feeling super clean and smooth, almost like you just had a professional teeth cleaning!</li>
            <li>2- a Hydrogen Peroxide Whitening Gel- is a clear substance with a very fresh smell.</li>
            <li>Since you apply the second step fairly quickly the two step process does not seem as involved as it might sound.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was lucky enough to receive this product for free from Crest.  </li>
            <li>but they definitely gleam with a shiny sparkle and feel super smooth and polished though out the day.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to try this paste out for free..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s usually a fresh minty taste after you brush your teeth but with this toothpaste it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s more of a dry mouth feeling.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to sample this product for free via BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to get to try this for free through bzzagent.</li>
            <li>And after using this toothpaste for a few days I found that I easily adjusted to the taste and didn&#x27;t notice it any more.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to get a free sample to try out</li>
            <li>It was easy to use, fast and steps were clearly marked.  </li>
            <li>Finally, I like my mouth to feel minty fresh and this product doesn&#x27;t have a strong taste.  </li>
            <li>First, true to Crest Pro Health reputation, the toothpaste cleans better than any other on the market.</li>
            <li>So, when I was given the opportunity to try this product I was very excited but apprehensive at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The step 2 in this system was nice and gentle, so I would use it a few times a week for about 5 minutes and probably see significantly whiter teeth in about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth spending a few extra bucks on a good toothpaste system!</li>
            <li>The minty taste left my mouth feeling fresh and clean (not as minty as mouthwash, but a fresh taste) and my teeth were noticeably shinier and whiter after the first use.</li>
            <li>Right off the bat, I noticed my teeth really sparkled after the two-step process of cleaning then polishing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right amount and size so that you don&#x27;t have that sandy feeling when you&#x27;re ready for Step 2&#x27;s</li>
            <li>My mouth feels more clean and that feeling stays with me throughout most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;The only down side</li>
            <li>In addition to silky smooth, white teeth, I feel  like my whole mouth feels clean.</li>
            <li>The whitening gel is typical of most gels of its type--but used in combination with the toothpaste it worked quickly to brighten and whiten my smile.</li>
            <li>After using this product daily, my mouth is bright, my gums are pink and do not bleed and my teeth feel squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>The other thing I liked was that after the first day I already noticed that my teeth were whiter.  </li>
            <li>I received product free as a BZZ Agent #sponsored, I&#x27;ve tried products for healthy teeth and whitening separately and have not stuck with any of them mainly because they didn&#x27;t work as expected.</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist strongly advised me to stop using the whitening gel due to the fine grit which with prolonged use could damage the enamel on my teeth.</li>
            <li>I have used the teeth whitening strips, but have never been able to use it for a full week due to my teeth sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>If Crest is trying to differentiate the two tubes so as to not get confused in the dark, it would make more sense to me to switch them and have the twist top for step 1 and the more manageable flip top for step 2.  </li>
            <li>Because the taste of Step One was pleasant, I did not feel rushed or anxious to get to Step</li>
            <li>Because the taste of Step One was pleasant, I did not feel rushed or anxious to get to Step</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying this product free from Crest but plan to purchase this again in the future due to all the benefits I have experienced so far!</li>
            <li>I think the biggest difference came from me being very careful to time myself when brushing my teeth to make sure I was spending a full 60 seconds on each step...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to see it down to $9.99, that would make it more accessible for a broader range of people.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t experience any sensitivity issues, which was a pleasant surprise compared to other whitening products I&#x27;ve tried, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t live up the the claims of a six times improvement.</li>
            <li>either way, it is more of a hassle, and I&#x27;d personally rather just use the old whitening strips so that I was setting aside special time for teeth whitening.</li>
            <li>Was a little put off at first by having to spend a bit more time brushing my teeth with a 2-step process, but it was really fast and easy</li>
            <li>, it just allows you to attack your teeth to achieve true freshness and that ultimate clean feeling.</li>
            <li>It is a quick and easy 2 minute process and the freshness lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Positive first</li>
            <li>I have used this product for about three weeks now and have found that my teeth not only feel very clean but have gotten noticeably whiter as well.</li>
            <li>It left my mouth feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>I definitely feel like my teeth were very clean after using this product.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are not really yellow anyway, but they are certainly brighter and have a better hue after using this product for a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s two steps, which I feel is fairly cumbersome for something as simple as brushing your teeth and the first step contains Stannous Fluoride which can actually stain your teeth versus whitening them.</li>
            <li>also liked that this product did not cause the sensitivity issues I have had with other whitening products.</li>
            <li>The 2 step process is unique, and I did have whiter teeth after about a week, but then they got fairly sensitive</li>
            <li>I am so excited to see my dentist again who was recommending for professional whitening.</li>
            <li>I also liked that it had a whitening component that was not as time consuming as other products.</li>
            <li>I wish the taste was bit more refreshing if this is to take the place of normal everyday brushing.  </li>
            <li>It was nice when other people noticed it even my clients at work noticed</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using now for about two weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed a significant improvement as far as whitening goes.</li>
            <li>Thanks Crest HD for my new smile!</li>
            <li>The flavor is a mild mint and the gel has minimal flavor but the end result is a very clean brush.</li>
            <li>, this product is fantastic, when you Finish brushing with it your mouth and teeth feel just as clean and smooth as when you get a professional cleaning, after a minute you must spit but not rinse, because you must apply the second product now and brush for an additional minute, this is the whitener, but it is more difficult to apply because it tends to fall of the  brush, the flavor of booth products is pleasant and as I said before your teeth feel amazing, I haven&#x27;t seen a radical change in the color of my teeth, but my husband has, maybe my teeth can only get this white!</li>
            <li>The best part about this is that your teeth are whitened without experiencing any of the tooth sensitivity that people typically report after using other whitening products.</li>
            <li>We are super excited to take pictures on our cruise not being embarrassed by the yellow that used to linger on our teeth!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this new product from Crest through BzzAgent, because, honestly, I haven&#x27;t enjoyed the last few Crest toothpastes that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Also, I would love it if they made they product more minty and somehow made the fresh breath last longer like other toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I love the toothpaste, it will be a bit pricey when I go back for more, but because I am not a huge fan of flossing it is totally worth it!  </li>
            <li>When Bzz Agent a word of mouth marketing company asked if I wanted to try a new Crest product I quickly agreed.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to use this two-step system, but for the most part it&#x27;s not a major inconvenience.</li>
            <li>but I definitely think it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
            <li>Recently I noticed my teeth were not as bright or white anymore.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to see that my teeth did, infact look whiter,  and they felt amazing after the deep cleansing toothpaste.</li>
            <li>My teeth, gums and mouth felt so clean after using the product but my gums had become sore and sensitive and even burned somewhat.  </li>
            <li>I was also pleasantly surprised by how clean my mouth felt.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean and polished after the instructed one minute brushing, almost like leaving the dentist&#x27;s office after a professional brushing/polishing.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how clean this product made my teeth and mouth feel.  </li>
            <li>This is simply the easiest way to get a white smile that is truly clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>After just a couple days I immediately noticed a difference in the clean feeling compared to my old toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Another reviewer wrote that this system gives you a &amp;#34;dentist clean feeling&amp;#34; and I completely agree.</li>
            <li>Liking the clean feeling so far and freshness after using it in the morning and evening.</li>
            <li>and I was honestly really surprised at how clean my teeth felt after I used the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised how clean my teeth were using this tooth paste.</li>
            <li>every day I&#x27;m surprised how clean my teeth feel.  </li>
            <li>but I prefer the super minty toothpaste that makes me feel extra clean and</li>
            <li>Step one does not seem to foam very well to distribute through your entire mouth, it seems like you have to use more product to spread out to cover all your teeth.</li>
            <li>thing I like the most about this toothpaste is the feeling that it leaves your mouth with - it really does feel like you just left the dentist - every day!  </li>
            <li>The sparkly blue paste (step 1) removes plaque and makes your teeth feel super clean.</li>
            <li>So thanks for sending me the sample Crest, you more than likely have a customer for life.</li>
            <li>My mouth felt incredibly fresh and my teeth felt smooth and actually looked glossier!</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I have slightly sensitive gums/teeth, and they did seem more sensitive as the week went on using Crest</li>
            <li>and it really didn&#x27;t take much more time that regular brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- i definitely have noticed a difference, but to really make sure</li>
            <li>Step 2 is actually what makes my mouth feel super clean.</li>
            <li>Thanks Crest for coming out not only with my favorite toothpaste (Crest with Scope),</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find that it takes much more time than regular brushing, but it really does make my teeth feel polished.</li>
            <li>I will say my only issue is I really wish step 2 was a flip top cap like 1.</li>
            <li>I am a heavy coffee drinker so maintaining my teeth healthy and white is important and a good toothpaste is necessary.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t hurt or feel harsh at all.</li>
            <li>The 2nd gel -- the whitening gel -- definitely gives my teeth superior whitening and sparkle.  </li>
            <li>This is something that many folks who use whitening products report, but this seems to be fairly gentle on the teeth overall while still providing some whitening.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I have used many whitening toothpastes in the paste and find that they don&#x27;t whiten so much as prevent further yellowing.</li>

            <li>I have used many whitening toothpastes in the paste and find that they don&#x27;t whiten so much as prevent further yellowing.</li>
            <li>I actually let it sit for an additional 30 seconds after brushing because I love the self cleaning feeling that is actually intense.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I would change is the instructions don&#x27;t specify how much whitening agent to use for step 2 and it takes up more space in the bathroom to store since there are 2 tubes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I loved the results so much after a few days</li>
            <li>Overall, I would say that this product is an innovative whitening alternative but that it may be too much of a hassle for some people.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would say that this product is an innovative whitening alternative but that it may be too much of a hassle for some people.</li>
            <li>After just a few days of using this product, I found that yes, this kit whitens as good as about 2-3 whitestrips, and yes, my mouth felt much cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I am heavy tea and coffee drinker, so I really needed good whitening product.</li>
            <li>Even the next morning when I woke up, I still had that super clean feeling that makes you run your tongue over your teeth?  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really speak to the efficacy of the whitening aspect, however, overall, I enjoyed the product.</li>
            <li>This two-step process also makes you aware of how long you brush your teeth so 2 minutes in the morning and 2 minutes at night makes your teeth and mouth feel refreshingly brighter and healthier.</li>
            <li>In complete transparency, I am trying this product for free thanks to Crest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used Crest as a kid and quite frankly as soon as I was old enough to choose my own toothpaste I abandoned it for sexier dental care</li>
            <li>My teeth definitely felt super clean</li>
            <li>I have had dental work done on one of my top front teeth and that one didn&#x27;t whiten as much as the others, but overall I can see a difference.</li>
            <li>I can enjoy my drinks AND have a white smile.</li>
            <li>Second, my teeth instantly felt cleaner, they got a good scrubbing and polishing.</li>
            <li>Personally, I thought of the pain as a good sign that the whitening part was actually working!  </li>
            <li>Personally, I thought of the pain as a good sign that the whitening part was actually working!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a drastic enough improvement in the whiteness of my teeth to tell people they HAVE to try this product, or that it is worth the money (although I got it free from the company as a BzzAgent).</li>
            <li>In just a couple of quick steps, my teeth feel squeaky clean and white.  </li>
            <li>While the two step process didn&#x27;t take much longer than regular brushing, I just wasn&#x27;t sure I was seeing the results in the mirror.  </li>
            <li>The paste left my mouth almost burning from the intense mint, but it was refreshing.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt smooth through the entire day and really fresh as well.  </li>
            <li>Good teeth do not run in my family, and I struggle with teeth that are not as white as I would like and the occasional bout of halitosis.</li>
            <li>It is pretty much pure hydrodgen peroxide which is used to whiten teeth.  </li>
            <li>And even though my sample was free the price that the product is listed at is VERY reasonable compared to the other products that offer similar results with considerably more hassle!  </li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants super clean, just out of the dentist, feeling teeth with the bonus natural whitening.</li>
            <li>I am not sure whether it whitened any more than other whiteners, since it seems like most toothpaste nowadays does that, but my teeth felt clean and smooth, and my wife likes how I taste, so a winner in my book.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh smell of the toothpaste, and it did some work the first week, then it just like other toothpastes....</li>
            <li>know there are other whitening products out there, but I thought this was especially easy because it&#x27;s easily incorporated into my usual brushing routine.</li>
            <li>Brushing my teeth can seem like a pain, despite being a very important health routine, and I was even more skeptical about my free sample of Crest Pro Health® HD™when I saw it was a two step process.</li>
            <li>If you looking for a method to enhance your brushing habit that I highly recommend this - it&#x27;s definitely worth a shot.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using this product if you want whiter teeth and a healthier smile.</li>
            <li>But for the cost, I would think it&#x27;s worth it but don&#x27;t put your hope too high..</li>
            <li>The process is very easy to brush with the first and then switch to the other tube for the whitener.  </li>
            <li>No, especially as I&#x27;ve already seen some whitening results from it and my teeth feel really clean!</li>
            <li>White teeth and a clean mouth feeling!</li>
            <li>It has been two weeks, and I am not sure that my teeth are whiter, but I do love the clean, fresh feeling I have after every use.</li>
            <li>It definitely leaves a clean, just from the dentist office feel and my teeth are whiter and brighter!</li>
            <li>I could instantly feel that my teeth felt polished, my breath was fresher and my mouth felt clean!</li>
            <li>I am excited to see if continued use will lighten my teeth a little more.</li>
            <li>I would probably use this before a special occasion, but definitely not as my everyday toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Only available on amazon and at CVS right now</li>
            <li>Step two: at first, I was thinking, this is going to get old really quick.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest and BzzAgent for allowing me this opportunity to document my experience with this product and help share my comments with others who are trying to reach the same ultimate goal of a healthy, clean and fresh mouth.  </li>
            <li>The first couple of days my gums were also sensitive, but that resolved fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>This system has two steps, the first is a toothpaste (that I wish tasted better and didn&#x27;t leave my mouth feeling so dry)</li>
            <li>It tastes slightly sweet and more or less like the gel in Crest Whitestrips.</li>
            <li>What I really love about this product is that it is 2 easy steps and takes no more time than just brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li>After the first use, it was easy to remember only to &amp;#34;spit&amp;#34; and not rinse between part 1 and part 2.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The first step is a purifying cleanser and the second step is a perfecting gel that polishes and whitens, easy to use and add into my beauty routine.</li>
            <li>The texture is a bit gooey in a positive way though so u can finish brushing your teeth without adding additional toothpaste.</li>
            <li>- I am no way compensated for my review, positive or negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I expect results and a positive user experience.</li>
            <li>Positive Aspects:&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received one as well from Crest, but in no way was I asked to write a positive review.</li>
            <li>The clean feeling (similar to the sensation of getting your braces off for the first time) lasted practically all day!  </li>
            <li>The clean feeling (similar to the sensation of getting your braces off for the first time) lasted practically all day!</li>
            <li>The clean feeling (similar to the sensation of getting your braces off for the first time) lasted practically all day!</li>
            <li>But, even more important that that, this toothpaste really did whiten my teeth in just a few days.</li>
            <li>I got this toothpaste for free but I will definitely purchase it in the future because I love it.</li>
            <li>At first I was using it twice a day, and I think it was a bit too much for my gums.</li>
            <li>At first, it felt like there was a film on my teeth after you use Step 1, and I found the taste of Step 2 to be very minty (almost too minty).  </li>
            <li>My first thought was it would take too much time</li>
            <li>When I first saw this product I was hesitant to try it and didn&#x27;t expect much.  </li>
            <li>but with HD I really saw that my teeth were whiter within the first week.</li>
            <li>The first one is the actual cleaner -- it&#x27;s minty and tastes like normal toothpaste -- not quite as minty as the Crest Scope, but it still is refreshing.  </li>
            <li>First of all, the taste of the paste and gel leave much to be desired.  </li>
            <li>First, the paste tastes really chalky in your mouth when you&#x27;re brushing.</li>
            <li>Step 1 is a refreshing paste with tiny microbeads, that leaves a fresh minty taste and helps to fight plaque from forming step 2 is a clear gel.</li>
            <li>On the first day, I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in the whiteness of my teeth</li>
            <li>At first it seems like too much to add to your routine.  </li>
            <li>Step 1 of the process is no different than any other toothpaste and tastes great.  </li>
            <li>This agent didn&#x27;t foam as much as the first.</li>
            <li>You really do notice a difference within the first use.</li>
            <li>My husband and I couldn&#x27;t believe how much whiter our teeth were after using it the first time.</li>
            <li>I can absolutely tell you that your teeth will feel cleaner after your first use.  </li>
            <li>as I was pretty much fed up with strips, gel&#x27;s and so on.....  </li>
            <li>It really promotes brushing teeth longer than 30 seconds which in my opinion  is much needed!</li>
            <li>The first day my teeth were so much whiter.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed that after the first couple days I really saw an improvement.</li>
            <li>but the first toothpaste is very foamy and minty</li>
            <li>I know this toothpaste cost more (about 4x what I was paying for the other Crest toothpaste), but it might just be worth it if it saves me time in the dentist chair and not having to use whitening strips anymore.  </li>
            <li>After first use I realized that it did not add much time to my routine.</li>
            <li>Upon first use my teeth felt much cleaner, and are now noticeably whiter.</li>
            <li>price, again I believe there are other toothpastes out there that work better for me, but for ~13.00 maybe this one will work for you and it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>After the first couple of uses my teeth really started to feel cleaner and look whiter.</li>
            <li>I did notice that my mouth felt more fresh in comparison to other toothpastes I have used.</li>
            <li>I did notice that my mouth felt more fresh in comparison to other toothpastes I have used.</li>
            <li>have tried lots of whitening products and had pretty much given up, but this one really works and is not expensive at all.</li>
            <li>What really blew me away is that my teeth were noticeably whiter in the first week.  </li>
            <li>Crest Pro Health HD successfully made them at least two shades</li>
            <li>The first step has a very grimy texture and makes my mouth feel like cotton.</li>
            <li>At first I really didn&#x27;t think it would make a difference considering I&#x27;m a coffee drinker</li>
            <li>I really started to notice results after the first week of use.  </li>
            <li>After the first use, I noticed a much cleaner and smoother feel to my teeth and</li>
            <li>I realized from the first day on that my teeth appeared much cleaner.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>but I followed the two step process, and already I can see how much whiter my teeth are, thanks to Step two!</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t even have to watch the clock to make sure I am brushing as long as I need too -</li>
            <li>The usage is pretty straight forward-</li>
            <li>so much so that I over squeezed the first time and it fell into the sink.</li>
            <li>every time I use this, although I do wonder how safe this is to use long term.</li>
            <li>It really wasn&#x27;t a big deal to add another step into my morning routine (one more minute of brushing really hasn&#x27;t ruined my day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I could get the fresh breath that I get from my normal toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>With this whitening system I had no sensitivity problems at all and see just as good results if not better than when I used the strips.</li>
            <li>I loved this toothpaste/whitener system because my teeth not only look whiter, but they really do feel healthier, and I&#x27;ve only been using it 3 days!  </li>
            <li>I was even more surprised to see a noticeable whitening in my smile after only 7 days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So many times I rush through brushing and this really made me aware of how long I should be doing it for.  </li>
            <li>I love that neither toothpaste has a weird taste and my breath smells nice and fresh after using them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve waited until the full 6 days were complete before posting anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had fresh breath longer than with just brushing with normal tooth paste.</li>
            <li>I have used other whitening products before and they all require you to put aside a good amount of time to use them, and they leave your teeth feeling so sensitive.</li>
            <li>The results were good but not striking.</li>
            <li>Not that different than my normal routine, I frequently have to add more paste to my brush to get a really clean mouth feel anyway.  </li>
            <li>I use this system twice daily, I love using the first tube (purifying cleanser) because it leaves your teeth feeling refreshed and extra clean</li>
            <li>I definitely do think the first step gives a better clean than a regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>then a brighter smile (considering my teeth are not horribly dull).  </li>
            <li>Although it did not &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34; as much as my conventional toothpaste, it had a similar pleasant fresh taste.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel nice and clean from the minute I brush until late at night after dinner.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;d like to clean up during your daily toothbrushing routine, it might be worth a try.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;d like to clean up during your daily toothbrushing routine, it might be worth a try.  </li>
            <li>The best part is that my teeth are noticeably less dingy and less beige.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, the clean feeling I have after I brush with Crest Pro-Health HD is worth the extra cost compared to &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpaste.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel fresh from the dentist clean and are several shades whiter.  </li>
            <li>like the fresh and clean feeling but have mixed reviews about the whitening.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I would suggest this product to anyone wanting a clean fresh mouth and whiter teeth.</li>
            <li>After using the product, my teeth definitely feel fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>The taste was fresh and left my mouth feeling clean; however, I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in tooth whiteness.</li>
            <li>My teeth were left feeing clean and my mouth fresh.</li>
            <li>After following the direction accordingly my teeth feel clean and my breath feels fresh.</li>
            <li>You will then be left with a clean, fresh mouth for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a fresh clean feeling after brushing their teeth.</li>
            <li>It leaves your teeth feeling clean and your breath so fresh that you don&#x27;t want to eat or drink anything after you&#x27;ve brushed!</li>
            <li>Not only does this toothpaste leave my teeth feeling clean and fresh</li>
            <li>But taking an extra 60 seconds twice a day is nothing compared to how clean and fresh my mouth feels.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to try the new toothpaste for the past three weeks and have been more than pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Previously, I used Colgate Total and was pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>The flavor was a little more astringent, but not bad.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try the new toothpaste as I have tooth sensitivity and had before this toothpaste found a toothpaste that worked really well with my sensitive teeth, made my mouth feel clean and gave me fresh breath.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I would have purchased it on my own, since adding more steps to my daily routine wasn&#x27;t something I was originally interested in doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my teeth do yellow and require standard whitening, but although this is MUCH more convenient than things like the Crest White Strips I&#x27;ve used before, I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend it because it didn&#x27;t seem effective.</li>
            <li>The second tube is more of the polishing finisher; kind of adds that last minute touch of white and clean!!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>This is definitely more than just regular toothpaste and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this 2 step system and am incredibly pleased to have discovered it and incorporated it into my daily health care.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and am sure this is going to be my regular \\&quot;toothpaste\\&quot; from now on.</li>
            <li>You use the first part, brush normally, then spit (don&#x27;t rinse!).</li>
            <li>It has a little bit of a grittiness to it that I honestly love!</li>
            <li>With Crest Pro-Health HD 2-step toothpaste system, Crest ushers in new era of toothpaste for a healthier mouth and whiter smile.</li>
            <li>My smile truly is like new.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone looking for a new way to enhance their smile.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive a free trial of this new toothpaste through BzzAgent</li>
            <li>I have not noticed a huge difference in the whiteness of my teeth, but my teeth were pretty white already.  </li>
            <li>Like I said, after 6 days, I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference, but my teeth are already pretty white.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Dislikes: My teeth were pretty white to start with, so I haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference.</li>
            <li>You simply brush for a minute with step 1 and then spit, put step 2 on the toothbrush and brush for another minute, its that easy.</li>
            <li>I suffer from super sensitive teeth when I try to whiten them</li>
            <li>That proved easy enough</li>
            <li>I would venture to say that perhaps my teeth lightened a shade but it may also be simply because I kept staring at them and took more notice than normal.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and make a daily part of your lifestyle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently trying this product free thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and only takes 4 minutes if you use it 2 times a day.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak on the health aspect as I historically have had very healthy teeth from regular brushing, flossing, and cleanings.</li>
            <li>The two step system is easy to use and provides lasting effects.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as easy as regular teeth brushing yet MAKES</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just easy to do while your brushing you are cleaning your teeth and whiten them at the same time.</li>
            <li>Easy, 2 step process that definitely results in whiter, brighter teeth.</li>
            <li>Tube 1 easily flips open for minute 1.  </li>
            <li>They also made my teeth super sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a dentist, and I have always been a very loyal Colgate total user.</li>
            <li>but it was easy and the two minutes actually flew by.</li>
            <li>I am a believer in this teeth-whitening system because it&#x27;s easy to use - replacing my regular toothpaste with Crest Pro Health HD</li>
            <li>If you buy white strips and toothpaste you will add time and money to your routine so why not just get this easy kits that in three minutes you can be done?</li>
            <li>Brush with step one for one minute, then brush with step two for an additional minute, easy enough.  </li>
            <li>What I like about Crest Pro Health® HD™ is that it is an easy two step system that only takes two minutes (vs. some of the whitening strips that you have to leave on for 30 minutes).</li>
            <li>once you resist your initial instinct to rinse after Step 1) and was easy to integrate into my already two-times-a-day brushing .</li>
            <li>The system is a two step process which is easy enough to use.  </li>
            <li>I received it free from Crest via Bzz Agent to try and review and this might be the first time I actually continue using the product after my sample is used up.</li>
            <li>The 2 steps are easy to follow and results are obvious.</li>
            <li>My only criticism would be that I wish both of the tooth pastes could be combined into one easy step.</li>
            <li>What it did do was make my gums super sensitive</li>
            <li>The two step toothpaste is easy to use and to me doesn&#x27;t take extra time.</li>
            <li>Make sure to rinse well or peroxide will make your mouth dry.  </li>
            <li>The application is easy, essentially brushing your teeth twice with the two step process.</li>
            <li>I am a believer in this teeth-whitening system because it&#x27;s easy to use - replacing my regular toothpaste with Crest Pro Health HD</li>
            <li>The first step/tube has a slightly gritty texture and a light mint taste.  </li>
            <li>I find my mouth to be extremely dry at this point and would love a drink, but have resisted to allow the paste to work as it is intended.  </li>
            <li>This is such an easy product to use, brush for 1 minute with step 1, then brush for 1 minute with step 2.</li>
            <li>(they were less than thrilled...).  </li>
            <li>Step 1 is a flip cap that is easy to open.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t make your teeth super sensitive like whitening strips or trays do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This 2 step process is easy and once you get use to it it becomes 2nd nature.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple, easy, and it works.</li>
            <li>Some surface stains were less noticeable which is nice surprise.</li>
            <li>It easily peeled back !</li>
            <li>However, after using Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste for about one week now, I can say that it does not add any time to my routine and has been an easy switch to make.</li>
            <li>I am super conscious about morning breath and after using this system, I feel like that&#x27;s no longer an issue--</li>
            <li>but my teeth were pretty white and stain free before I started.  </li>
            <li>This 2 step daily toothpaste leaves a fresh clean straight from the dentist feeling after using it.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the products, I noticed that my teeth felt gritty after step one, and then smooth again after step two.</li>
            <li>It was nice and had a slight minty flavor.</li>
            <li>so it is easy enough to brush my teeth for the required 1 minute</li>
            <li>so the timing is easy for me, however I can see some people struggle with timing of the different minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>one is an easy flip open tube that can be done with one hand and</li>
            <li>I was REALLY happy that it didn&#x27;t make my teeth painfully sensitive like whitening strips have done in the past.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give all 5 stars is because of how easy it is to forget that it&#x27;s a two step process.</li>
            <li>My results with this kit were MUCH better than the strips and took only 1 week of just brushing my teeth like I normally do.  </li>
            <li>I liked just Step One alone and would buy that for half the price</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is simple to use, just two things to use as you would normal toothpaste</li>
            <li>I also feel like my teeth possibly feel smoother, but I would credit that more to brushing longer when using two steps than I normally did with one toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Works, doesn&#x27;t hurt, and is easy and pleasurable to use daily.</li>
            <li>I can easily see the difference when I use the system vs regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Step 1 is a flip cap that is easy to open.</li>
            <li>Brushing 1 minute with each of the 2 toothpastes is easy enough.</li>
            <li>Upon receiving this product, I noticed the easy instructions to following that are printed on the box and on each of the two tubes.  </li>
            <li>I plan to continue to use this system as it not only seems to work well, but it is easy.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and only takes 2 minutes, twice a day.  </li>
            <li>It kind of irritated/burned my mouth the first few days, but that did go away.</li>
            <li>After a week of use, I have noticed some improvement in whiteness, but not a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li>The initial taste may seem strong, it did to me, but after a couple brushings, it was no longer noticeable.</li>
            <li>My teeth got second chance to be strong and shine again.</li>
            <li>Only reason why I gave it 4 vs 5 stars is that the mint is almost too strong, but not a showstopper.</li>
            <li>As I could only use it for 4 days before the sensation got too strong, I did not see a noticeable difference in teeth whitening.</li>
            <li>They even felt super clean ALL DAY  LONG.</li>
            <li>Not a bad thing necessarily, but worth noting.</li>
            <li>and it is an opaque white gel that has a strong mint flavor.</li>
            <li>A little free toothpaste.&amp;#34; However I will be buying and strongly recommending this stuff.</li>
            <li>I do like the Crest line because it is a minty flavor that is more subtle than some other brands that I have found to be overly strong that they kind of burn my tongue and a bit</li>
            <li>There is no other toothpaste on the market that leaves your teeth feeling sparkly clean every time you brush your teeth like this.</li>
            <li>It is certainly dentist quality</li>
            <li>certainly would not go out of my way to recommend the Crest Pro-Health HD kit.</li>
            <li>so made certain to follow the directions given.</li>
            <li>The results compound over time when it comes to the whitening but stop when you hit a certain point.</li>
            <li>Also certain lipsticks make them look yellower at times.</li>
            <li>This is purely my opinion on the matter, as I have no official answers to relay.&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say they were 2X whiter, but certainly whiter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I certainly felt that</li>
            <li>and I did not notice a large difference in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li>but I would certainly pay for it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 20 days of use, the feel of my teeth and mouth is certainly cleaner.</li>
            <li>So, purely reviewing this product on it&#x27;s principal claim of whitening teeth,I have to give it a 1 star  rating.</li>
            <li>It certainly saves time as well.</li>
            <li>Well, they certainly are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had noticeably whiter teeth, and my mouth certainly FELT healthier 2)</li>
            <li>One of the things that I did have a question about was the large difference in tube size for Step1 and Step 2.</li>
            <li>One of the things that I did have a question about was the large difference in tube size for Step1 and Step 2.</li>
            <li>It certainly met me expectations on that.</li>
            <li>I received this as part of a promotional product review, but I can certainly see buying this once I&#x27;m out of the promotional amount to keep up with the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another perk to this system is that is forces me to actually brush for a full 2 minutes -- as opposed to just a quick brush -- it makes me more conscious of using the 1st tube for about a minute, and then the second part.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy to move from one to the other - with no rinsing in between brushings.&lt;br</li>
            <li>a  positive side note : as a brand-new mom to a two-month-old let&#x27;s be real</li>
            <li>The first step, which reminds me of the gritty toothpaste the dentist uses to polish at a cleaning, is pretty normal and feels fine.</li>
            <li>&quot; My breath was fine (as confirmed by my wife) and seemed fine throughout the day, but I got less of a feel after I brushed my teeth of like breathing in a minty cloud.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>I did note that the tooth paste is more of a gel in terms of density, so be careful when first opening and using so you do not squeeze too much of the product out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read reviews saying that the two steps take too long or that it&#x27;s too much, but I haven&#x27;t really minded the two steps since, and have actually really enjoyed having them separated.</li>
            <li>The two steps surprisingly took about the same time as normal brushing, so that wasn&#x27;t a big deal either, like I had anticipated.</li>
            <li>First of all i love slick and cool looking packaging.</li>
            <li>It left quite a nice shine, and while it didn&#x27;t make my teeth spectacularly white on the first try, it did make my teeth look polished.</li>
            <li>I tried the product exactly as directed on the box, one minute for the first product and one minute for the second and after a week I had mouth full of sore gums.</li>
            <li>The texture, especially Step 2, is different than normal toothpaste, but in a good way.  </li>
            <li>The first tube is most like a toothpaste, and the second tube is a clear gel.  </li>
            <li>my teeth stay pretty white on their own with regular brushing.</li>
            <li>I gave it a try for a few weeks and love the results!  </li>
            <li>Love the new Crest HD Daily Two-Step toothpaste!</li>
            <li>With this new system, I’m more mindful of cleaning each tooth during the cleaning phases and polishing during the last phase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>are regular Crest users and are pleased with what we&#x27;ve seen from this new product.  </li>
            <li>I love trying new products and white teeth</li>
            <li>The set does live up to what it promises on every account- a brighter smile, fresher breath etc, but the taste really gets to me.</li>
            <li>I noticed a slight improvement in whitening instantly, but after using the toothpaste twice a day for a week I noticed a great improvement.</li>
            <li>Tastes great &amp; I notice a difference, slightly whiter teeth after a couple weeks use twice daily</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy , fast, and priced very low!</li>
            <li>Overall it was easy to use, it saves whitening time and it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much longer than my previous brushing regime, and it&#x27;s nice to have a reminder to brush for a longer amount of time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really feel like the mint is strong enough to freshen my breath.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical to try at first, because of the 2 step process and because so many products claim to offer amazing results that don&#x27;t really deliver...</li>
            <li>I really like the way the Crest Pro-Health makes my teeth feel cleaner for much longer than my regular toothpaste, and a huge benefit is that my teeth are much whiter!  </li>
            <li>Thanks to the folks at BzzAgent, I&#x27;ve been able to try the new Crest Pro-Health HD for the last 6 weeks or so!  </li>
            <li>It took me a few days to get used to the two-step process, but I think I actually spend more time brushing my teeth as I am more aware of how much time I spend on each step.  </li>
            <li>While my teeth did not become significantly whiter (I am an avid coffee drinker, so my teeth are not as white as they could be),  I noticed an improvement in color.  </li>
            <li>The first phase freshens your breath more than any other paste I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really see a whiter smile, better breath, cleaner mouth feel when using this as opposed to the stuff I previously used.</li>
            <li>my teeth are so white with just using this &amp; no white strips - LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>This is my review first my first brush...and WOW!  </li>
            <li>My mouth definitely felt fresh and clean after brushing which was much better than some other toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Definitely read the fine print.  </li>
            <li>I have done a few teeth whitening regimens and this one was by far the most easy and convenient.  </li>
            <li>The toothpaste feels like regular Crest toothpaste and tastes fine.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t believe the hype at first about it whiten your teeth in 6 days but rest assured if that&#x27;s the main reason</li>
            <li>Second, it is quick!  </li>
            <li>the taste and mouth feel (particularly of the first step)</li>
            <li>And step two is foamy and tastes pretty decent too.  </li>
            <li>And step two is foamy and tastes pretty decent too.  </li>
            <li>However, if it actually gives good results than I the slight inconvenience is worth it.</li>
            <li>So overall I think the set is worth a shot because it&#x27;s simple to use, but I didn&#x27;t personally notice anything special about it to make it worth spending more than you would for just a toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I very highly recommend this product to anyone looking to change up their routine.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to try the new Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step toothpaste as apart of the BzzAgent.com campaign.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive tooth right now</li>
            <li>It is important to me to keep my teeth as healthy as possible and I can live with the flavor if that is what Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste will do for me.</li>
            <li>Overall, this product left my mouth feeling clean and my teeth feeling ultra polished and clean!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Following the instructions, brushing with the purifying cleanser first - the taste is good, very similar to other Crest Pro Health® toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>The flavor of the part 1 of the toothpaste i liked, but the flavor of the part 2 was a little off-putting.</li>
            <li>If an 11 year old wants it and says it works what does that tell you?!?!??</li>
            <li>It left my teeth feeling clean and they did look whiter even after the first use.  </li>
            <li>that is it two steps, the first step gets your teeth clean and the second step is just for whitening.  </li>
            <li>The crest pro-health leaves my teeth with a fresh clean feeling all day long.  </li>
            <li>It leaves you with that after the dentist feeling where you feel the clean teeth more than usual.  </li>
            <li>The first tube feels gritty in my mouth, like it is scraping my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>After my first use, I felt like I could actually feel the clean.</li>
            <li>After using in the first time, my teeth felt as clean as if I had just left the dentist!</li>
            <li>My teeth felt clean and refreshed and beautifully white after the first use.  </li>
            <li>The first step gets your teeth extra clean.  </li>
            <li>My teeth felt sparkling clean after both of these steps, but I was in the bathroom for about 10 minutes when all was said and done :) I think the price is slightly high for a toothpaste, especially if you just buy a standard one with baking soda.</li>
            <li>Either way, you get positive results and the clean feeling is a really positive bonus - enough to deal with 2 steps in the end.</li>
            <li>At first, brushing my teeth with 2 steps seemed high maintenance.</li>
            <li>The products were nice tasting too..not too much and not too little.</li>
            <li>You brush your teeth for one minute using the toothpaste, which is a little bit &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34; like so that it kind of polishes your teeth and gets them ready for the whitening gel.</li>
            <li>Within the first few days of using it, I noticed a huge improvement in how clean my teeth felt.  </li>
            <li>The two step process took a little more time, but the rewards were well worth it.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t imagine going back to that ordinary clean after having my mouth feel this good.  </li>
            <li>Just brush like you normally would in your daily routine and get dentist-office clean!</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for anyone that wants an easy way to whiten your smile without jumping through the hoops other products want you to do.</li>
            <li>Normally, whenever using a type of &amp;#34;whitening product&amp;#34; my teeth and gums get very sensitive and bother me, not this time!!!</li>
            <li>I like the new Crest ProHealth HD, because I feel like it has caused my teeth to get extra clean, become smoother, and helped me have a shiny smile.</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I have been using this paste and I will say that from a whitening perspective, we can definitely see a huge difference in his teeth-</li>
            <li>As a bzz agent I recently received this as a free trial thanks to Crest.  </li>
            <li>After using the second tube, my teeth felt smooth, much like leaving from my six month dental</li>
            <li>Human nature also wants to continue getting free things.  </li>
            <li>I recently received this product for free thanks to Crest</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t personally noticed a huge difference in whiteness</li>
            <li>Got the opportunity to try this for free with BzzAgent and felt free to offer my feedback- good or bad.  </li>
            <li>I received this whitening system for free thanks to crest for testing purposes only.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a _huge_ difference, but there was definitely some whitening going on.</li>
            <li>(Now I&#x27;m wishing I had taken photos as evidence but don&#x27;t really feel comfortable getting that up close and personal with my phone.)</li>
            <li>I got this product free as a buzzagent and was concerned that it really wouldn&#x27;t perform as advertised but it definitely does.  </li>
            <li>I am really self conscious about my smile.</li>
            <li>I drink coffee everyday so this is a great way for me to feel like my teeth can still be white despite the coffee.  </li>
            <li>Not only am I so happy with my results after just a few weeks of uses...</li>
            <li>As far as that HD whitening smile, I didn&#x27;t notice much difference.</li>
            <li>and I can tell a huge difference from using regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Crest HD Pro-Health Daily 2 step System for free thanks to BzzzAgent but all opinions 100% mine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Crest HD Pro-Health Daily 2 step System for free thanks to Crest but all opinions 100% mine.</li>
            <li>, i didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in terms of how white my teeth were, but i did notice that my teeth feel like i just came from the dentist!</li>
            <li>They want you to spend so much money on a product that doesn&#x27;t do what it says it should.  </li>
            <li>I really like this two step toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s get one thing straight: it&#x27;s not a whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve been using it for weeks, two weeks straight and then 3x /week night and day WITH A WHITENING TOOTHPASTE</li>
            <li>and I really doubt it&#x27;s six shades.  </li>
            <li>They feel very slippery</li>
            <li>I can really tell a difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li>Even though they couldn&#x27;t have been whitened with one brushing, they sparkled so much that they looked whiter.</li>
            <li>I have just started to use this product, so I am still indecisive as to how well it really works.</li>
            <li>This product is an absolute life changer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to show it off in high definition!</li>
            <li>I really works.  </li>
            <li>I was very intrigued about the concept and the claims written on the package.</li>
            <li>really done.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>or it is not doing much to whiten my teeth, so the whitening claim is still up for debate for me.  </li>
            <li>Although it claims 6x whitening, I can&#x27;t really comment on that</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done some looking around and this system seems to be a minimum of $12 on one website that I found, and up to as much as $38 on another.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried whitening toothpastes many times and they never really give noticeable results.  </li>
            <li>my teeth feel so much cleaner and are noticeably whiter.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants whiter teeth without paying the cost of the dentist office procedure.</li>
            <li>I received the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste System as a free promotion from BzzAgent, in return for my unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I really like this system</li>
            <li>I was so surprised when I caught a reflection of my smile in the mirror-</li>
            <li>I really like the way this toothpaste made my mouth and teeth feel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are two things I really like about this product: the way it makes my teeth feel and how it whitened my teeth.  </li>
            <li>After a week, I noticed that my teeth are much whiter and shinier.  </li>
            <li>I just couldn&#x27;t fit the second step into my routine.  </li>
            <li>Makes the process go much faster for me.</li>
            <li>There really is a difference between this product and others.</li>
            <li>The kit has the toothpaste and a perfecting gel in it, the perfecting gel sounded promising.</li>
            <li>It also does whiten teeth although not as much as six shades.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much whitening, but I didn&#x27;t take a before and after picture to really compare.</li>
            <li>You must do a two step process which really isn&#x27;t that time consuming (1 minute cleaning with each tube).</li>
            <li>so I was hesitant to use much.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have as much staining as perhaps others</li>
            <li>Although the routine takes some time to get used to, it is much easier than using my whitening trays from the dentist.</li>
            <li>It is important to following the directions and do not rinse after step one.</li>
            <li>After using step 2, you can finally rinse and enjoy the results.</li>
            <li>that even if they work there is too much of a hassle.</li>
            <li>I had the opportunity to test Crest Pro-Healthy HD Daily two-Step Toothpaste for free and jumped at the chance.  </li>
            <li>Since I have more crowns than natural teeth - I don&#x27;t get much of the whitening effect from this toothpaste (obviously), however!</li>
            <li>I was given Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Tw0-Step Toothpaste to try for free from Crest.  </li>
            <li>they are much closer than they were before I began using this.  </li>
            <li>makes this really work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health HD has really worked well for me.  </li>
            <li>It was gentle on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>and I can tell you that this really works.  </li>
            <li>I have also tried the Crest Pro Health toothpaste and didn&#x27;t find that it cleaned my teeth very well.</li>
            <li>In step 1 which is the cleaning part, it really does what it says.</li>
            <li>and it has really helped with stains(coffee, tea etc.)</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m very concerned that it&#x27;s ingredient list includes hydrogen  peroxide</li>
            <li>but I really do think it is working.</li>
            <li>I like it so much</li>
            <li>do like the freshness this product gives, but after a week I didn&#x27;t really notice any whitening benefits.</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy this product, though I was provided a free sample to review.</li>
            <li>I had heard about whitening products, but thought they were either too pricey or took too much time to use.  </li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t let that fool you, this product really works.</li>
            <li>My teeth are noticeably whiter, so much so that my wife has even commented.</li>
            <li>I tried it even though the thought of having so much fluoride was a bit intimidating since I know that there are health concerns in the alternative health field</li>
            <li>I tried this product for two weeks straight hoping for a decrease in sensitivity.</li>
            <li>you are looking for an over the counter whitener and can purchase it for a reasonable price</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest</li>
            <li>I will have to wait to see how much the whiteness is improved.</li>
            <li>but I can really see a change in my teeth.  </li>
            <li>He also noticed that his teeth are much whiter.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>all honesty, this toothpaste pushed me to brush for the two whole minutes one is supposed to brush.</li>
            <li>oh my, it really feels like you just got out of the dentist&#x27;s chair after a cleaning.  </li>
            <li>did it for five days, every night before I went to bed and by the fifth day, my gums really hurt.</li>
            <li>so I am very in touch with how my mouth and teeth feel.  </li>
            <li>did receive this product free as part of a Bzz Agent campaign, but I will be adding it to my regular grocery list when it is depleted.</li>
            <li>I would definetly recommend this product to anyone who wants a cleaner feeling that lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this too</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>My teeth are whiter and I feel it is much safer.  </li>
            <li>Not so much.</li>
            <li>After that, though, I started having sensitivity along my gum line that was a bit too much for me to just ignore.  </li>
            <li>To that, the taste didn&#x27;t bother me that much, but I could see where some might.  </li>
            <li>t bother me that much, but I could see where some might.  </li>
            <li>but my mouth looks and feels so much</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re ready to spit it out and move on to step 2.</li>
            <li>As for the whitening, I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference yet.  </li>
            <li>I just really like this two step system.</li>
            <li>I have been using the two step system for about 2 months now, thanks to Crest and BzzzAgent.</li>
            <li>From a design standpoint, that really bothers me.</li>
            <li>for the negatives, well, I really don&#x27;t think my teeth are 6 times whiter.  </li>
            <li>It cleans well, but would I really want to pay over $10 whenever I need toothpaste?  </li>
            <li>It cleans well, but would I really want to pay over $10 whenever I need toothpaste?  </li>
            <li>I am really liking the way that the Crest HD 2 step system is making my mouth feel.</li>
            <li>The combo of the steps works really well to whiten and brighten my teeth.</li>
            <li>It is definitely no worse than what i was using in terms of effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I do like the concept of the two step process, so each part can be formulated to really focus on either the cleaning aspect or the polishing/whitening aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was sent this toothpaste to try as part of a BzzAgent campaign, and as much as I really wanted to like it, it hurt my teeth.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the results.</li>
            <li>My husband tried it too and he really likes it.</li>
            <li>I find it much easier to convince myself to brush one minute with step 1 and one minute with step 2.</li>
            <li>I have been using Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste for about 2 1/2 weeks now, and I am really liking it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was interested to try it when it said that it’s formulated for deep cleaning and advanced whitening that goes beyond your normal toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Worked very well</li>
            <li>Take note, this step has a much thinner gel</li>
            <li>so don’t squeeze the tube much at all unless you want to be covered in tooth paste.  </li>
            <li>I got a package of Crest Pro-Health Daily Two-Step Toothpaste from Crest for free to try it out.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Bzzagent.com</li>
            <li>It is extremely gentle and an asset to anyone&#x27;s brushing routine.</li>
            <li>I may just be too much to overcome.</li>
            <li>It really does leave you with a &amp;#34;fresh from the dentist&amp;#34; feel.</li>
            <li>My first couple of brushings, I was expecting more action, but I started out using smaller amounts than I might normally.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t necessarily enjoy having TWO steps to complete with each brushing, but it&#x27;s definitely been worth it for the results.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>A one-step process would be much easier.</li>
            <li>and I really like this system.</li>
            <li>Overall, I enjoy using Crest Pro Health® HD, would buy it and use it again, and would recommend Crest Pro Health® HD to my friends and family.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually very painless.</li>
            <li>, I thought I should really make an effort to use it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>At times, I thought my teeth were whiter, but then looking at pictures from before I started using the product, I didn&#x27;t really see a difference.  </li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t think it freshened my breath, however my husband had no complaints.</li>
            <li>I have used the whitening strips before, I basically need to stand in front of the sink the whole time to prevent dripping.</li>
            <li>Thank you, Crest (and BuzzAgent) for the free sample - will definitely be buying this!</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>We can put a man on the moon, but I need to brush my teeth with 2 different pastes to get a healthy smile and white teeth?</li>
            <li>I really like about this</li>
            <li>Luck for me I got to try it through a free promotion, but will be using this on the regular moving forward.</li>
            <li>It left my teeth feeling incredibly smooth, like after going to the dentist.</li>
            <li>I notice that my teeth feel much cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that my husband&#x27;s teeth are much whiter after using this product too.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really feel a difference with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The stuff that really cleans the teeth.</li>
            <li>So you really aren&#x27;t going to get whitening from any toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I tried the product out for 2 weeks straight...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really know how well this compares.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product by Crest!</li>
            <li>I am very picky when it comes to toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased to say that the two step Crest Pro Health HD is simple, effective,and delivers fresh breath that last for days, whiter teeth without sensitivity or grayling my teeth.</li>
            <li>I have always been self conscious about my smile.  </li>
            <li>It is also much easier to use than I imagined.</li>
            <li>applying Step Two to the brush, I learned to use caution when squeezing from the tube because the substance comes out from the tube much quicker and easier than with Step One.</li>
            <li>I absolutely feel like my mouth is healthier with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I absolutely feel like my mouth is healthier with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The first step removes plaque and has the flavor of a normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t think there was much of a difference in the whiteness of my teeth, but I took a pic and compared it to a pic I took 6 weeks ago.</li>
            <li>I can really see the difference, no issues with sensitivity and no tale-tell sign of whiting along on the edges of my teeth.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I have to start by saying that I was not expecting much out of this product.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel much cleaner, and I&#x27;ll probably continue to buy this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll see a difference in whiteness after just one use but really start noticing the difference after about 10 days of brushing 2X day.</li>
            <li>This product works really well.  </li>
            <li>The second tube or step two polishes my teeth and leaves them feeling smooth and squeaky</li>
            <li>This toothpaste works really well for me and my husband.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect to like this as much as I do.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It appears that this product is OK at whitening your teeth some, and perfect for maintaining already white teeth, at the expensive just one extra minute each time you brush.</li>
            <li>; Really??</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Anything to whiten my teeth at such a cheap price (compared to going to dentist) is always good!&lt;br</li>
            <li>What I really like about this product is that it gets ALL of your teeth.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste free from Crest and Bzzagent for testing purposes.  </li>
            <li>I got Crest Pro Health HD free to try from BzzAgent, but I have already gone out and purchased another one and have made it a part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li>did not experience any sensitivity and my mouth felt very clean.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>With the polish, I can really taste the peroxide even after rinsing</li>
            <li>The results were better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>A noticeable change in my teeth much whiter and brighter</li>
            <li>I received the Pro-Health HD Daily kit for free through BzzAgent to try.</li>
            <li>Absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li>However, this system by Crest really does the job it promises to do.</li>
            <li>is that it really dries out your mouth while you are using it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t add that much time to your brushing routine, but it is something you have to get used to.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel cleaner and they look much whiter.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels so much cleaner and fresher after I use this</li>
            <li>but after a couple weeks, I really noticed the difference.  </li>
            <li>This gel does not taste very chemically to me.</li>
            <li>He felt the product really cleaned the plaque from his teeth.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way my mouth feels after step 1.  </li>
            <li>and I will definitely continue to use this after my free sample is all used up.</li>
            <li>The gel also comes out fast</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t spend much longer brushing than I used to.  </li>
            <li>I received Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free as a promo from Bzz Agent.  </li>
            <li>so this is a much cheaper option.  </li>
            <li>I know I really should be brushing longer</li>
            <li>I recently received a free trial of Crest Pro-Health HD two step toothpaste from BzzAgent on behalf of Crest.</li>
            <li>It works really well.  </li>
            <li>You really should give it a try</li>
            <li>Thanks to BzzAgent</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive teeth and have never had success with whitening strips or the trays that you leave in you mouth for 30 minutes at a time because they always hurt my teeth.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much for &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>teeth but the real stuff -</li>
            <li>This gel produces no foam, it&#x27;s just gently spread over your teeth.</li>
            <li>(besides the possibility of leaving white spots) would be that I experienced increased sensitivity in my teeth after the 2nd or 3rd time using it.</li>
            <li>(besides the possibility of leaving white spots) would be that I experienced increased sensitivity in my teeth after the 2nd or 3rd time using it.</li>
            <li>I have not seen much of a change in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I also find this system much quicker and easier and just as effective.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>I actually really like it.  </li>
            <li>but Crest HD really does.  </li>
            <li>have no clue if it makes all that much of a difference</li>
            <li>Alone the brush works really well, combine it with this toothpaste and it works wonders.</li>
            <li>No matter how much I brush my teeth, I still wind up with plaque and calcium build-up on and around my teeth.</li>
            <li>(though much cheaper that whitening strips).</li>
            <li>I also did not think I saw much difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li>Too much hassel for the results.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really see a difference after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it doesn&#x27;t work jack much, despicable now</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Thanks to BzzAgent and Crest</li>
            <li>I really wish i took a before picture.  </li>
            <li>me that silky smooth run your tongue over your teeth feeling after brushing my teeth with a regular toothbrush not even my sonic brush</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice much color change to my teeth.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>In just two minutes, I have a much cleaner mouth and teeth that feel polished, and the added bonus of a hint of whitening.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give up on the product because it really provided my teeth protection.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really see any difference</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two Step Toothpaste System from Crest and have tried it and</li>
            <li>do wish that there was a way they could have had one packaging, much like a two part epoxy that you squeeze the plunger separately to expel the paste.</li>
            <li>This system really does work.</li>
            <li>I received Crest Pro-Health HD Daily for free because I am a BzzAgent and have the opportunity to review some products.  </li>
            <li>I am happy to report that over my time using this product I have not experienced any increased tooth sensitivity.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There was one warning on the label that I found ironic.</li>
            <li>Part 2 is the polishing gel that really helps to whiten the teeth.</li>
            <li>Under five minutes per day to make teeth whiter and brighter seems reasonable to me.</li>
            <li>Not to mention how much whiter my teeth are after using the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>You use it much like a toothpaste although of course it doesn&#x27;t foam.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve really noticed much of a difference in my teeth.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when I first used the products is that neither of them have a harsh taste like many toothpastes have.</li>
            <li>I drink so much coffee</li>
            <li>that tells me that it really is removing any plaque buildup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am doing a trial of Chest Pro-Health HD thanks to Crest and bzzagent.  </li>
            <li>I had the opportunity to try Crest ProHealth HD free recently...</li>
            <li>Since you can&#x27;t rinse after step one, it would make it easier since you tend to only have one hand free when brushing.</li>
            <li>Although I am not a coffee drinker, I do enjoy drinking tea, and I could always use extra whitening power.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Crest Pro-Health HD for about three weeks thanks to a promotion from Crest.  </li>
            <li>and they really don&#x27;t work, but crest pro hd really works.</li>
            <li>applying Step Two to the brush, I learned to use caution when squeezing from the tube because the substance comes out from the tube much quicker and easier than with Step One.</li>
            <li>I absolutely feel like my mouth is healthier with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I absolutely feel like my mouth is healthier with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I tried the CrestPro Health HD Toothpaste from bzzagent.com and was surprised how fresh my mouth felt.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had much of a sensitivity to it either.</li>
            <li>I really felt like it was powering through the plaque, as well as remaining bits and pieces of dinner</li>
            <li>Plus, my gums and teeth are looking and feeling much healthier.</li>
            <li>Plus, my gums and teeth are looking and feeling much healthier.</li>
            <li>, I tried this product thanks to Crest.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser really feels like it&#x27;s getting work done</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the week was up, I took an &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; picture, and I could really notice a difference in my teeth&#x27;s whiteness.</li>
            <li>All in all, I really do think this product is working</li>
            <li>So while this is more expensive than regular toothpaste or even whitening toothpaste, it does last for quite a while and has excellent results.</li>
            <li>I am trying out the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste as part of a free trial from Crest.</li>
            <li>Stage two is very tasty.  </li>
            <li>I give it 3 out of 5 starts because I feel like the toothpaste really wanted to whiten my teeth</li>
            <li>That said, I do really like this product.  </li>
            <li>My mouth feels so much cleaner</li>
            <li>and my breath feels much fresher and stays that way for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li>really start to develop.</li>
            <li>The second tube or step two polishes my teeth and leaves them feeling smooth and squeaky</li>
            <li>Step 2 is where the Pro Health HD really differentiates itself, though.</li>
            <li>however, it really works well.  </li>
            <li>Of all of the teeth whitening products I&#x27;ve used, this is absolutely the easiest.</li>
            <li>However, the real kicker for me is the taste of the product.  </li>
            <li>However, the real kicker for me is the taste of the product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to @crest and bzzagent</li>
            <li>You can tell it is really cleansing.</li>
            <li>I really like how my teeth look whiter, but the taste is not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I saw results within the two week trail period which was promising.</li>
            <li>and I feel like my whole mouth became brighter.</li>
            <li>The dual toothpaste - one that is a purifying cleaner and another for buffing and whitening - really gets the job done well.  </li>
            <li>I gave it four out of five stars because I don&#x27;t think it really helped with morning breath and the freshness</li>
            <li>Crest was generous enough to give me the Crest Pro Health HD kit to try for free through a Bzz Agent campaign.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t really a product for me.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels healthier and looks much whiter than when I started using this over a week ago.</li>
            <li>My teeth really did look whiter after just one week.</li>
            <li>I found that it cleaned my teeth very well</li>
            <li>But thanks to BzzAgent when I got the invite for Crest HD campaign , I thought &#x27;what the heck</li>
            <li>and I will say that my teeth feel much cleaner</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really exited to see what my teeth look after a week.  </li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t like the taste of &amp;#34;Step 2&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Not too much excitement or change.  </li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t take any longer and you can really feel the difference from a one step brushing.</li>
            <li>Received it as a sample from thanks to Crest and Bzzagent.</li>
            <li>There has been no negative impact on the cap, something I&#x27;ve always been a bit nervous about damaging, and the rest of the teeth have lightened up a bit, but not startlingly</li>
            <li>I really like this set.</li>
            <li>I really recommend getting this</li>
            <li>I received the Pro-Health HD daily system free from Crest</li>
            <li>I would highly recommended this product to friends &amp; family!</li>
            <li>and it really makes my mouth feel cleaner and</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>they work really well.  </li>
            <li>To start I really like the abrasiveness of the step 1 toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It really feels like you just went to the dentist.</li>
            <li>This two step process really works and you can see and feel the difference between the two.  </li>
            <li>really want to give this product 5 stars, but I can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Since that is the primary use of the toothpaste I will probably not purchase it and just stick with the regular Crest that I use since I also like the way that it makes my teeth feel.</li>
            <li>I received the Crest Pro-Health Daily Two-Step Toothpaste for free as part of being a Bzz Agent.  </li>
            <li>The Crest Pro Health HD really does whiten and get your teeth cleaner within one week.</li>
            <li>I was really geeked that I got to try this product for</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t think it would really work.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in the whitening of my teethe yet, but I have noticed it in my husbands teeth.  </li>
            <li>and over all I really like it.</li>
            <li>Plus it works FAST.</li>
            <li>Really works.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more after these tubes are empty.</li>
            <li>While I did receive the the product free as a promotion from Crest, I would definitely recommend this product and purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of toothpastes, I don&#x27;t really have a go to brand</li>
            <li>After using the product for a couple weeks, I don&#x27;t really see any difference in the whiteness.</li>
            <li>Overall, I do enjoy the Crest Pro-Health HD.</li>
            <li>and  I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I was already using a whitening toothpaste (Arm&amp;Hammer Advanced White), so this could be why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I am not in a rush while getting ready, I don&#x27;t mind using the two step system</li>
            <li>step 1 works really really well.</li>
            <li>I got to try this for free through BzzAgent and Crest, but definitely plan to continue to purchase it for myself.</li>
            <li>My whole mouth feels healthier.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the taste and texture of both pastes, I&#x27;m big on texture!</li>
            <li>My mom asked me about the product and wants to try it.</li>
            <li>I really like this system.</li>
            <li>and it really bothers her.</li>
            <li>After the first day I could tell my teeth were cleaner than normal.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t take any longer and you can really feel the difference from a one step.</li>
            <li>My teeth are much whiter than they have ever been.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t whiten as fast as the strips or trays do.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that I really do like it.  </li>
            <li>I really does make teeth whiter</li>
            <li>so if that&#x27;s important to you, and you&#x27;re dedicated, and use it all the time, you WILL see a big difference!!</li>
            <li>Crest Pro Health HD worked so fast</li>
            <li>I had used whitening toothpastes before without much difference</li>
            <li>and I really did not want to keep brushing for two minutes</li>
            <li>I was really wanting to like this product, truly I was.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste really works.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>I really suggest you go out and try it.  </li>
            <li>My teeth felt smooth (similar to the feeling you get from a dental cleaning).</li>
            <li>After trying this product for free from Crest through BzzAgent, I would definitely buy this product again!</li>
            <li>I  got to try Crest Pro- Health HD Daily for free, this was part of a promotion from the brand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>must say that this toothpaste is absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>She is very diligent about brushing for 2 minutes, so the Crest Pro Health HD is the reason for a non-slimy mouth.</li>
            <li>Had a check up today and my dentist was very pleased, as I have had gum and plaque issues in the past.</li>
            <li>Received the Crest Pro-Healthy HD daily two-step as a promo from Crest for free.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really just 1.  </li>
            <li>Too much time?  </li>
            <li>has really worked for me.</li>
            <li>Everyone notices my smile and people ask me if I had my teeth professionally whitened.</li>
            <li>feels grainy so it really feels like I&#x27;m cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I trust Crest Products, I received a package of Crest Pro Health® HD™ Daily Two-Step Toothpaste to try for FREE from Crest and BzzAgent.com.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise I really like using Crest Pro Health HD Toothpaste.</li>
            <li>views are real though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I drink coffee and tea, eat red meat and enjoy saucy foods</li>
            <li>I really like the feeling the toothpaste</li>
            <li>leaves.best way to whiten your teeth if you really desire that.  </li>
            <li>I really like the feeling the toothpaste leaves.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Really ??</li>
            <li>I was glad I carefully read them before using the product as you don&#x27;t rinse between using the tubes.</li>
            <li>the whole hygiene routine will take about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>That much burned by tongue and gums.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are so much brighter and whiter since using Crest Pro-Heath and getting compliments.</li>
            <li>The idea behind it is great</li>
            <li>BUT the texture of these two gels really dries out my mouth</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much in the whitening aspect, but hope to over time.  </li>
            <li>I thought that this dual system would take up too much time</li>
            <li>very refreshed!&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth look and feel so much</li>
            <li>My husband also wants to try it out.</li>
            <li>It was much whiter</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The whole day after you brush makes you feel like you just got your teeth cleaned.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li>and I can definitely tell a difference in how smooth and polished my teeth are after a week of using this product.  </li>
            <li>As a working mom with my three youngest being 8, 3 and 18 months, my mornings are very hectic</li>
            <li>Who wants to fiddle with whitening strips and trays, when life could be so much simpler.  </li>
            <li>Who wants to fiddle with whitening strips and trays, when life could be so much simpler.  </li>
            <li>so I can see how much whiter my teeth can get.</li>
            <li>This one though, I really like.</li>
            <li>so I trusted the brand, but I really didn&#x27;t expect to see results</li>
            <li>(Yes, I don&#x27;t get out much)</li>
            <li>12-14 hours which is really a plus.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>Noticed results fast.</li>
            <li>- Purifying Cleanser (light blue paste) cleans and removes plaque.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- Works very well with electric brushes with timers</li>
            <li>The second thing I really enjoy is that you brush with Step 1 for 1 minute and then Step 2 for 1 minute also.</li>
            <li>It breaks up the monotony of brushing for 2 straight minutes with one toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>What I found out by using this product is that it really didn&#x27;t take much time.  </li>
            <li>I really like the taste</li>
            <li>I was just getting ready to try a whitening kit I purchased online from a dentist.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much simpler and faster than the gel bleach.  </li>
            <li>I received Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste as a free sample to try.</li>
            <li>First you use the purifying cleanser, which basically tastes like normal toothpaste, after one minute of brushing you spit but DONT rinse, and then you start brushing with the perfecting Gel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a free sample and started using this about 2 weeks ago and instantly noticed that my teeth felt cleaner.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really have much to compare, but I&#x27;m happier with how my teeth look.</li>
            <li>and my teeth were really stained.</li>
            <li>I found I really like this system.  </li>
            <li>After using my free Crest Pro Health HD as part of a promotion for a week, I have mixed feelings.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much whitening</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much from Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Process when I received it from Crest to try for free.</li>
            <li>I received the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste for free from BzzAgent to try and review.</li>
            <li>Thanks to bzzagent.com</li>
            <li>I was curious to see how brushing for two minutes with two different pastes could be more effective than brushing for two minutes with my regular paste, but I was amazed by the difference!</li>
            <li>My teeth feel like they have just been polished, and after 1 week, they look so much brighter!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I did this treatment, but it&#x27;s for real.</li>
            <li>You can spit but do not rinse, I had to stop myself with the rinse part and go straight to part two.</li>
            <li>It is VERY VEERY hydrogen peroxide tasting.  </li>
            <li>but I will continue to use to see if the claims are real.</li>
            <li>So I was very nervous that it would stain my teeth.</li>
            <li>My whole mouth just felt cleaner, fresher.  </li>
            <li>I tried the crest strips, thinking that wouldn&#x27;t be so much hassle than whitening trays.</li>
            <li>No sweets since I don&#x27;t like sugar that much.</li>
            <li>really didn&#x27;t see any changes on the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li>The only reason that I did not give 5 stars is because of the cost, (though I got mine as a free trial, the price would discourage me from purchasing.)</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve put up with the taste though because I really like the results.</li>
            <li>Step 1 really grinds away the guck and plaque without damaging the enamel.</li>
            <li>but once I saw it in the store; I realized it is very pricey.  </li>
            <li>Who wants to brush their teeth twice in one cleaning while switching products?</li>
            <li>I was very dissappointed.</li>
            <li>I recently tried out the Crest Pro Health HD system for free through Crest for the purpose of my review.  </li>
            <li>is it seems to really work.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest</li>
            <li>Very noticeable change in color...</li>
            <li>My teeth are so much whiter now.</li>
            <li>My mouth has never felt fresher, my teeth are only this shiny and smooth after a dental cleaning...</li>
            <li>But I also didn&#x27;t notice any whitening effects, which defeats the whole purpose.</li>
            <li>and I felt like it really got my teeth cleaned.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend giving this system a try!</li>
            <li>I then immediately brush with the second tube for 1 minute which contains a translucent colorless smooth gel with the consistency of hair conditioner.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, it is very cumbersome to use if you use a electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I receive  Crest Pro Health HD for free from Crest to evaluate and have used it for two weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed any change in how white my teeth are.</li>
            <li>so i can&#x27;t really comment on if my mouth is 6x healthier, but I am hoping that it is.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in the whitening, which was what I was really looking for.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li>I like the fact it will be much cheaper than the dentist office whitening.</li>
            <li>I see a very silght difference in my teeth color.</li>
            <li>I have been using the system now for about 2 weeks and my teeth look much brighter</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I can also say that the whole thing is a bit of a process.</li>
            <li>Also, step 2 really tastes just like your brushing with gel hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this product whitens teeth very well.</li>
            <li>I got a free sample of this from #BzzAgent and tried it for 3 weeks brushing twice a day following packaged instructions.  </li>
            <li>Thanks crest for letting me try it</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference with that</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>my much everything I ate.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy the 2 different pastes.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to sample Crest Pro-health HD Daily for free thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li>I used it twice a day for two weeks straight.</li>
            <li>The two step process really cleans your teeth</li>
            <li>That aspect of the product really does work.</li>
            <li>I gave it four out of five stars because I don&#x27;t think it really helped with morning breath and the freshness</li>
            <li>the results where real.  </li>
            <li>But the primary advantage I feel of this is the the extra plaque removal and gingivitis protection.  </li>
            <li>I received the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste to try for free compliments of Crest (and my being a Bzz agent).  </li>
            <li>I really like the taste of this product.</li>
            <li>But in reality, it really wasn&#x27;t that much of a hassle.</li>
            <li>The perfecting gel used in step 2 doesn&#x27;t really seem to have a flavor to it (unless it&#x27;s masked by the mint of step 1 which isn&#x27;t rinsed out before you use step 2).</li>
            <li>I am really liking the results.</li>
            <li>However, I haven&#x27;t really seen a difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li>I got this product called Crest Pro-health HD Daily Two Step Toothpaste to try it for free through a Marketing Company.</li>
            <li>and it is very runny</li>
            <li>and it is very runny</li>
            <li>But the effort seems to be working and looks to be worth it so far.  </li>
            <li>I really like that the whitening gel is hydrogen peroxide based.</li>
            <li>but my mouth feels much cleaner and healthier after using it.</li>
            <li>I really noticed that this product eliminates plaque build-up.  </li>
            <li>retail cost for this product is around $13.00, which seems a bit much for toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very benign in my view</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very picky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did overall make my mouth feel and look healthier and my teeth felt smooth and polished.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to keep using it to see how much whiter my teeth get.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as much work as wearing the strips and waiting around for those to work then removing them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend​ this system to anyone who cares about their teeth health and looking for some pearly whites in the process!</li>
            <li>In the morning rush when I need to get out of the door FAST?</li>
            <li>I actually received this product for FREE through BzzAgent.com as part of a promotion.</li>
            <li>Maybe I hadn&#x27;t drank as much coffee that day?</li>
            <li>My teeth were absolutely whiter and my gums looked a lot healthier.</li>
            <li>Truthfully, I noticed minimal difference after using it for three weeks ...</li>
            <li>and I can really tell a difference.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t overpowering like a lot of really minty toothpastes and didn&#x27;t burn.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed that my teeth were  much brighter in about four days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m really picky about my toothpaste - taste, feel, flavor in my mouth after brushing, etc.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t very fond of the Wintergreen but has grown on me a bit.  </li>
            <li>although, only if it is on sale or I have a coupon available.  </li>
            <li>The retail price is just too much for toothpaste.</li>
            <li>There is really something to this two step deal.  </li>
            <li>I really wish it had been one step.  </li>
            <li>I really do recommend this toothpaste if you can get your hands on it.</li>
            <li>My teeth were much whiter.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see it making much difference.</li>
            <li>I started doing both steps without even really having to think about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, I did not fall in love with this product as I expected.  </li>
            <li>The whole process of using two toothpastes really did not work for me.  </li>
            <li>I would say 6x whiter is no joke it really worked for me</li>
            <li>Thanks, Crest and BzzAgent for giving me the opportunity to try and review this product.</li>
            <li>Again we didn&#x27;t experience it much</li>
            <li>While I received the toothpaste for free as I mentioned above, the toothpaste is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li>Plus, it is so much easier than trays, strips, or brush on whitening products.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t eat or drink anything for an hour because it heightened my sensitivity so much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really need to spit in between the two steps like the directions</li>
            <li>When I saw the opportunity to try this out thanks to BzzAgent, I couldn&#x27;t wait.</li>
            <li>I liked that this also allowed me to have white teeth without having to use white strips which often times</li>
            <li>I saw some reviews where people complained about the way it felt in their mouth or tasted, but I really felt like it did a good job cleaning and didn&#x27;t have any issues with the texture or taste.</li>
            <li>I pretty much replaced my normal toothpaste with this</li>
            <li>I would most likely continue to use the product alternating between this and a sensitive tooth paste.</li>
            <li>The second  step toothpaste is the hydrogen peroxide toothpaste which is more of a clear gel.  </li>
            <li>A full minute with whitening gel isn;t going to happen, I barely make 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>and then you add the 2nd step (the clear gel) and continue brushing for 1 more minute.</li>
            <li>and then you add the 2nd step (the clear gel) and continue brushing for 1 more minute.</li>
            <li>It does definitely make your teeth whiter, however I have noticed my teeth/gums are a bit more sensitive since using it.</li>
            <li>As I have gotten older my teeth have become super sensitive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it now for 4 weeks total and my teeth are still looking nice and white!</li>
            <li>saw whitening improvement after about a week, and my hypersensitive teeth have not become any more sensitive, even after a month of using this product daily.</li>
            <li>I was using crest complete extra whitening +scope for more than a year now, n</li>
            <li>I got a free sample of Crest ProHealth 3D, and I am surprised how much I like it so far.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste provides the effective whitening agents without the harsh side effects on my mouth.</li>
            <li>I liked the packaging of the product, especially that each tube was colored differently</li>
            <li>But, after using it for a few weeks now, I can honestly say that my skepticism has been set aside.  </li>
            <li>But this particular product is sooooo easy to use and my teeth felt like I just left the dentist.  </li>
            <li>I love it so far for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>nice thing is it only takes two minutes for the entire &amp;#34;system&amp;#34; of cleaning and whitening your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have replaced my current toothpaste with the Crest Pro Health HD set for several weeks now, and I must say the step one toothpaste is quite nice.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would purchase with my own money but only on sale or with a coupon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on this for several weeks and so far i have seen notable brightness in my teeth.</li>
            <li>I liked it far better than the 3D Vivid White toothpastes and other whitening products I&#x27;ve used over the years.  </li>
            <li>My mouth feels so fresh after brushing and still feels fresh the next morning.  </li>
            <li>that it is something I can use daily and my teeth are not even more sensitive like with some whitening methods.</li>
            <li>I also feel like it is a good toothpaste for sensitive teeth; it isn&#x27;t harsh at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The taste is good and I like the foaminess of step one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downsides: My gums might be sensitive, but I feel like the product is a bit harsh.</li>
            <li>so while willing to try a new kind, I was also a little reluctant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Normally, I don&#x27;t pay this much for toothpaste, so if it wasn&#x27;t going to work for me, I wouldn&#x27;t want to plunk down that kind of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product as it helps the teeth with fluoride, gums with anti gingivitis, and your smile with the quick white teeth/</li>
            <li>At first, I noticed actually more irritation and bleeding to my gums - but quickly learned it was because I was brushing too hard with it.</li>
            <li>It works better than any other at home whitening paste I have tried and I will certainly be continuing to use it.</li>
            <li>My teeth look amazing, and I still have half tubes of each step!  </li>
            <li>I have been using Crest products for a long time but this product is really a new innovative way of cleaning and whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>This product though is WOW!!!  </li>
            <li>I want to see if is worth taking the extra time for the two steps brushing and the price, as of right now I will give the product a three....to be continue</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m left with a very fresh, minty mouth afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Using this toothpaste daily leaves a very fresh taste in the mouth.</li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey but at the same time last longer and worth the extra for a better clean mouth.</li>
            <li>What I found was a system that was surprisingly easy to use, just brush your teeth as normal, then follow up with the gel for another minute, simple as that.</li>
            <li>The flavor is pretty mild on step 1 and definitely freshens on step 2.  </li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t care for adding an extra step during my brushing routine but, because this program requires it for the desired results, I quickly became accustomed to it.</li>
            <li>Today, I wore a bold color of lipstick and for the first time in years I wasn&#x27;t self-conscious about it because it didn&#x27;t make my teeth look yellow.</li>
            <li>and I was very excited to try Crest Pro Health HD and was curious to know if this tag-team option would work for me.</li>
            <li>was really nervous about this whole 2 step process, but I actually love it, and you can&#x27;t just do one step or the other.</li>
            <li>And as I&#x27;ve kept using Crest Pro Health HD, my teeth have continued to look as good, if not better!</li>
            <li>/&gt;#Sponsored #GotItFree #BzzAgentinued to look as good, if not better!</li>
            <li>I was initially unsure about the 2-step process but it&#x27;s super easy and really doesn&#x27;t take that much extra time.</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t tell anyone that I was using something new</li>
            <li>When I first heard Crest was coming out with something new and revolutionary</li>
            <li>I am always willing to try new things to get my teeth whiter.  </li>
            <li>From the first time I used the new toothpaste, me teeth had never felt cleaner.</li>
            <li>BUT... the new Crest HD 2-step definitely gave me a new healthy habit.</li>
            <li>After being an avid Crest toothpaste user since my childhood, and hearing there was a new 2-part system for cleaning your teeth that would make them whiter and healthier, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>At first I thought this was just my mouth getting used to a new toothpaste, but after a month or so of using it, my mouth still tends to feel cleaner than it did before using this.</li>
            <li>This feels more seamless and more subtle.</li>
            <li>it is easy to figure how long we had been brushing.</li>
            <li>It made my mouth feel clean, made my teeth f eel fresh and white and did not leave my teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li>Some of the reviews mentioned the additional brushing step, but I did not mind the extra minute spent keeping my teeth and mouth healthy and clean.</li>
            <li>The two part system is much easier than whitening strips and works better and faster than any other whitening toothpaste that I have tried.</li>
            <li>My teeth have definitely been staying nice and white, and it really doesn&#x27;t take me much longer to brush my teeth using this over my normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The flavor on this toothpaste isn&#x27;t as sweet as other Crest toothpastes, but now that I&#x27;m used to it, those taste TOO sweet.  </li>
            <li>It consisted of a two step process that was super easy and no different than the daily process of brushing your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely picky about my teeth, and would not recommend a product that didn&#x27;t leave my teeth feeling super clean.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are significantly whiter, the filling matches my natural teeth, and they never became sensitive.</li>
            <li>Full disclosure: I am a member of BzzAgent, a social marketing company.</li>
            <li>By the end of the first week, I saw a very marked difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The whole point of using this kind of product is to start seeing results, but unfortunately if not used on a daily basis I do not think whiter teeth are to be expected.</li>
            <li>The front of the package said I’d experience a healthier mouth; reducing gingivitis 6 times more than regular toothpaste and much whiter teeth; 6 times more than ordinary toothpaste.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The whole point of using this kind of product is to start seeing results, but unfortunately if not used on a daily basis I do not think whiter teeth are to be expected.</li>
            <li>The first two days were torture, as my gums were very sensitive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much like regular toothpaste, leaving my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel really clean, but I do not see any whitening action so far.</li>
            <li>After a week of use I haven&#x27;t noticed any real whitening of my teeth, but they do feel really clean - even the back of my front, lower teeth which are the plaque catches in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Overall I really like how clean my teeth feel after using this.</li>
            <li>Finishing off with a much needed rinse, this product left my teeth feeling literally squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>I really like how clean my mouth feels for HOURS after using this product, especially if I use it at night!</li>
            <li>It leaves my teeth feeling dentist clean, and the feeling lasts so much longer than regular toothpaste!</li>
            <li>So much so that I sometimes drop the flossing from my routine on certain nights when I am normally a floss</li>
            <li>The two steps, although a different way to brush, are very easy -- just a minute for each -- especially if have an electric toothbrush which already has timer.  </li>
            <li>Step 1 is pretty much like normal toothpaste and is very nice and minty tasting, but does leave my mouth feeling a little dry.</li>
            <li>and you will instantly have a brighter smile!</li>
            <li>2 minutes of brushing my teeth has whitened better than any other toothpaste I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Much better than using strips or other whitening products.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product if you are looking for a brighter and whiter smile!</li>
            <li>The directions were simple and straightforward.</li>
            <li>Overall I am pretty satisfied with the product, and would recommend it to anyone who wanted a toothpaste that actually whitens!!</li>
            <li>For me other whitening methods work much better.</li>
            <li>As a Bzz Agent, I was excited to try the toothpaste as I have been using Crest Whitestrips for several years.  </li>
            <li>It was a bit different at first with two steps, but it turns out that they are worth it as the product preformed very well.</li>
            <li>It is easier than strips or other forms of whitening methods and more cost efficient.  </li>
            <li>and I definitely was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited about using this product but after the fourth use I noticed some yellow-brownish stains on a couple of teeth.  </li>
            <li>spit, and then rinsed my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed this regimen for 1 week, and really liked the results I achieved with so little effort and variation from my normal routine.  </li>
            <li>The smell and taste were fresh but not overpowering and the two-step process really didn&#x27;t take any more time than my usual brushing routine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a regular Crest customer, so when the company asked me to try and review Crest Pro Health HD, I was so excited.</li>
            <li>I can definitely notice a whiter and brighter smile!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on the fence about whether or not I&#x27;ll continue using it regularly or just as a spot-use here and there, but it is definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li>I do agree with other reviewer that I wish the step 2 tube will be better if the lid is flip instead of screw.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a whiter smile!</li>
            <li>All I have to do is brush my teeth like a normally do with one additional step and my teeth will be whiter!  </li>
            <li>I have used other over the counter whitening systems with much better results.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to receive the Crest Pro-Health Daily Two-Step Toothpaste from Bzz Agent to try and review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using it a few days I noticed I had developed a healthy brushing routine (brushing the full 2 minutes), and I was looking forward to brushing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten him many other teeth whiteners</li>
            <li>I was floored after only 3 times I saw and significant change in color</li>
            <li>Most of this is due to the 2 minutes required to brush for the Crest Pro-Health HD Toothpaste kit to work.  </li>
            <li>like I normally do and wait to be blinded by my pearlies in just one week!</li>
            <li>but I will say that it doesn&#x27;t hurt to use (which I find many other whitening products do) and</li>
            <li>/&gt;After two weeks of use, I definitely see an improvement in the whiteness of my smile!</li>
            <li>Best of all, there&#x27;s no sensitivity like I experience with other extreme whitening products - no white spots on gums, no tooth pain, etc.  </li>
            <li>When I initially received this package from BzzAgent, I was excited to try it out because I&#x27;d never tried a two step system before.</li>
            <li>This would not be a big deal if I found that it significantly whitened my teeth</li>
            <li>At first I was hesitant of having to do a two step process, but it only takes two minutes and is not any more time consuming than a regular one step process.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this toothpaste to see if I could help eliminate some of the yellowing and maybe brighten my teeth overall.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product, but will try to stick to every other day to avoid any more sores.</li>
            <li>I was thinking - this looks like more work and will probably make my teeth hurt like of the other products out there on the market.  </li>
            <li>Due to the cost of the product I would like see if there is another product which would give me get better teeth whitening results.</li>
            <li>but I did not see any significant changes in the whiteness of my teeth after several weeks.</li>
            <li>I also enjoyed the sharp mint taste.</li>
            <li>so you can store the tubes back in the original case if you choose.</li>
            <li>My teeth actually still feel fresh at the end of the day!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to keep using it and see how white they get!</li>
            <li>Nevertheless I&#x27;m going to continue to use it - it&#x27;s supposed to have many other benefits.  </li>
            <li>Sodium fluoride is the ingredient found in most other toothpastes.</li>
            <li>&amp; Details:&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to write a report after the first day; therefore I waited more than a week in order to write my comments to see if in fact there are any changes.&lt;br /&gt;During 8 days I ate different types of foods that included: Meat (read &amp; white), vegetables, fruits, grains, dairy &amp; coffee.</li>
            <li>the other one, the whitening gel comes in a screw top cap.</li>
            <li>I agree with what many others are saying about the &amp;#34;fresh from the dentist feeling.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve noticed this feeling lasts all through the day and even after eating, which isn&#x27;t something I could say about any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
            <li>When I finish the routine my teeth feel cleaner than they do with most other toothpastes and I can see the whitening occurring over continual use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think it would be a big deal, but when I actually tried to watch the clock to be sure I used each tube for a minute</li>
            <li>After I use it, my teeth feel cleaner for many hours longer than other brands of toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I did.&lt;br /&gt;I am a Crest Pro-Health HD convert, see my white smile!</li>
            <li>This product is definitely one worth trying!</li>
            <li>The first step of the paste tastes like a regular mint toothpaste and the second step is more of a peroxide taste- keep it off of your tongue and on your teeth</li>
            <li>After almost two weeks there was a significant difference and by brushing essentially twice each time, I brush longer and my gums seem healthier too!</li>
            <li>The two-step process is really not a big deal to me and SO worth it!  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t speak to the whitening power of this toothpaste system, which it make work much better than other toothpastes out there.</li>
            <li>I was excited to open it and start this trial.</li>
            <li>a bit different to get used to but &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; is it worth it!  </li>
            <li>Overall, though, I think that for the price and the fact that I don&#x27;t really need to whiten my teeth on a daily basis, I will continue to use the original Crest Pro Health that I was using before I tried their new HD product, but I really appreciate being given this to try out for free from BzzAgent and Crest.</li>
            <li>I certainly would buy it again and highly recommend it to others in giving it a try.</li>
            <li>I am a BZZ agent and thanks to Crest, I was lucky enough to be one who got the entire Crest HD system for free.</li>
            <li>teeth do feel very clean and look as white as they did previously if not a bit whiter.</li>
            <li>the withening toothpaste its pretty nice flavor... not to hard on</li>
            <li>I am very selective about the toothpastes and other oral products I purchase so, although I was willing to try this, I certainly wouldn&#x27;t be repurchasing if it wasn&#x27;t superior to the other products I use.</li>
            <li>mouth feels fresh and clean much longer than with any other toothpaste I have used before.  </li>
            <li>I drink a lot of tea and have some stains on my teeth from it, but thanks to this new product, those stains are gone!  </li>
            <li>The second tube cuts the wintergreen taste almost immediately, so that helped, and the fresh feeling it left lingered after finally being able to rinse!</li>
            <li>It whitens so much faster than other toothpastes and leaves your mouth feeling very clean.  </li>
            <li>It actually felt post dental cleaning but not sore clean.</li>
            <li>It actually keeps your mouth clean</li>
            <li>But Crest Pro Health HD is the first toothpaste I have used that actually made a difference in the brightness of my smile.  </li>
            <li>Step 1  left my teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>This dual system makes for an extra clean teeth brushing experience.</li>
            <li>I also forgot to brush my teeth 1 morning before work and my mouth and teeth stayed looking and feeling extremely clean all day until I brushed that night!  </li>
            <li>You mouth does indeed feel clean once you&#x27;ve used the product, but I get the same clean feething when using Theives essential oils</li>
            <li>but I would prefer to go back to my normal chemical free cleanse.</li>
            <li>, I noticed both extra clean teeth</li>
            <li>Despite it&#x27;s significantly higher cost, I will be purchasing it in the future, as it is worth the investment.</li>
            <li>My teeth actually felt cleaner - you know, that feeling you get when you leave the dentist, where your teeth are squeaky clean?</li>
            <li>But I did like the extra clean</li>
            <li>The clean feeling seems to last longer with this toothpaste than with others and I feel like my teeth do look whiter, although no one has commented on it yet.</li>
            <li>my teeth feel as clean as if I just brushed them or just came from the dentist office.  </li>
            <li>, my teeth felt really clean and people always ask what I do to keep my teeth white.</li>
            <li>The second step tastes a smidge salty, but makes your teeth feel really clean (like after going to the hygenist) -</li>
            <li>It left my mouth feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>, how clean my teeth feel afterwards, and the overall feel.  </li>
            <li>My teeth felt clean like I&#x27;d just left the dentist office.</li>
            <li>-- it&#x27;s definitely a dentist clean feeling.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt really clean when I was done, like just coming back from the dentist.</li>
            <li>It makes my teeth feel really clean and definitely whitens them.  </li>
            <li>It makes them feel extra clean and polished.</li>
            <li>White strips would definitely give better results if your only goal is whiter teeth, however if you just want a healthier-looking smile and fresh breath</li>
            <li>and you entire mouth feels clean all day.</li>
            <li>With the paste and gel I feel like I am getting my entire mouth clean.</li>
            <li>I do like how clean my teeth felt, but I can&#x27;t say I saw any big difference in whitening.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of the paste the dentist uses to clean your teeth and your mouth feels very similar to that after step 1.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced similar problems in the past with whitening strips, so I would say that if you&#x27;ve also had problems with whitening products that this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li>and once I was finished, my teeth/mouth had that &#x27;just left the dentist&#x27; clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>but it did feel extra clean.</li>
            <li>Especially the fresh feeling you get after the first use.</li>
            <li>only thing that kept me from giving this the full 5 stars is that I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference with whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, like with most whitening strips, the first few times I used it</li>
            <li>In fact, as I&#x27;m writing this, it&#x27;s been 9 hours and 2 meals since I brushed this morning, and my teeth still feel clean.  </li>
            <li>like the flavor of both and definitely leaves my mouth (and teeth) feeling clean and refreshed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it makes my teeth  feel clean and does help whiten even after only a couple of uses.</li>
            <li>My teeth definitely felt squeaky clean, the way they do when you leave the dental office after a cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>The second step, the Perfecting gel, had the whitening power that felt clean on my gums.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re interested as my teeth were whiter after only a week of using.</li>
            <li>By the third day my teeth felt as clean as when I get done at the dentist office.</li>
            <li>It was easy brushing with both, only adds a minute to brushing and if it actually whitens it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>The next morning my mouth still felt clean.  </li>
            <li>Not only does this product clean my teeth like that of a dentist cleaning</li>
            <li>When I used my regular toothpaste my mouth didn&#x27;t feel clean at all</li>
            <li>At first I thought of it as a free product I would use with not much intention of buying b/c</li>
            <li>all this said, if you are looking for extra clean feeling mouth, this is your product.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m unsure if it would give the same clean feeling that I receive with my sonicare.</li>
            <li>I keep using it and definitely see my teeth getting whiter while leaving them sparkling clean.</li>
            <li>the Sonicare diamond clean system to help improve my chances of being in and out as quickly as possible.</li>
            <li>and I feel like I am getting my mouth extra clean from the double-brushing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in how clean my teeth feel, a reduction in gross morning breath, and whiter teeth.</li>
            <li>mouth did feel clean, but I did not like the aftertaste or the sensation left by the bleaching agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Step one is a simple 1 minute brush to clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li>However, I feel Crest Pro Health HD had a bigger impact on the clean feeling than additional brushing</li>
            <li>The one thing I immediately noticed was that my teeth didn&#x27;t have the same clean feeling.</li>
            <li>For anyone looking for a simple system to clean and whiten your teeth, I would recommend this.  </li>
            <li>The first step is a fresh tasting white paste that foams up a bit.  </li>
            <li>the same clean you feel after leaving the dentist office.</li>
            <li>Simple process and made my teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li>and I woke with a clean feeling mouth the next morning.  </li>
            <li>This left my mouth feeling incredibly clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean for the entire day.</li>
            <li>My teeth as clean as if I just got back from the dentist.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean and look whiter after only a week of using the product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 2 weeks now and it has made my mouth feel clean and have eliminated my need for white strips 1-2 per week.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to use my regular toothpaste after using this one to get that clean minty feeling.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean and do look white.</li>
            <li>Step one gets rid of plaque, tartar and gives me that &#x27;clean enough to sweep my tongue over my teeth&#x27; kinda feeling!</li>
            <li>Step 1 a traditional toothpaste to clean your teeth to be used for one minute.</li>
            <li>it did its duty keeping my entire mouth clean.</li>
            <li>You really do not spend any more time doing this then you would normally to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li>My mouth did feel clean, but I did not like the aftertaste or the sensation left by the bleaching agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so not only do I have clean teeth, they&#x27;re whiter.</li>
            <li>My mouth/teeth feel extra clean after using it.</li>
            <li>The purifying cleanser step definitely gave my mouth a squeaky clean feel that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I could feel the difference in my teeth on how clean and white they were.</li>
            <li>After using the toothpaste for about a week, I was very pleasently surprised with the noticeable difference in my tooth color, much whiter!</li>
            <li>2 Steps, 1 minute each step - white and clean, polished feeling teeth.</li>
            <li>Anything you missed in step one is annihilated, and the peroxide reacts with the baking soda to deep clean and polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anything you missed in step one is annihilated, and the peroxide reacts with the baking soda to deep clean and polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth didn&#x27;t feel as clean as they do with my regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I ended up using both this system and my regular toothpaste to ensure my teeth were totally clean</li>
            <li>That clean feeling lasts the entire day.</li>
            <li>one left my teeth squeaky clean, and step two caused some sensitivity.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this toothpaste to anyone who is serious about taking good care of their teeth.</li>
            <li>but this is subtle which I loved.  </li>
            <li>I was a skeptic at first since this was a two step system thinking it was going to take more time than I wanted to add to my routing but realized it actually didn&#x27;t take much time at all to not only protect your teeth the way you normally wood with toothpaste but to also whiten with the gel.  </li>
            <li>First, you brush with what is basically a &amp;#34;cleanser,&amp;#34; and then without rinsing, you brush with a &amp;#34;whitener.&amp;#34; I am not a huge fan of the Crest &amp;#34;flavor.&amp;#34; This product has an okay flavor....</li>
            <li>I am not a huge mint person, it actually makes me stomach churn when I smell it, so it&#x27;s nice for a toothpaste to have a change in taste and flavor!</li>
            <li>Overall I am pretty satisfied with the product, and would recommend it to anyone who wanted a toothpaste that actually does a decent job whitening.</li>
            <li>Overall I am pretty satisfied with the product, and would recommend it to anyone who wanted a toothpaste that actually does a decent job whitening.</li>
            <li>Overall I am pretty satisfied with the product, and would recommend it to anyone who wanted a toothpaste that actually does a decent job whitening.</li>
            <li>In addition to the clean feeling I get from Step 1 and the polished feeling I get from Step 2 (which pretty much lasts throughout the day), I&#x27;ve noticed that my breath is indeed fresher (especially in the morning - I am no longer self conscious about lingering morning breath).</li>
            <li>But it is also a moderate to mild flavor that certainly wasn&#x27;t a deal</li>
            <li>Initially my gums were very sensitive after using it however since I lightened up on the pressure when brushing it&#x27;s been fine.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this system to anyone who wants clean white teeth.</li>
            <li>This is such a simple and easy way to whiten and brush your teeth at once!</li>
            <li>It did not leave me breath like ninja kickin&#x27; clean and fresh like other crest toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a long-term Crest user and enjoy the Crest Pro-Health brand, but truthfully, I could not see the point of buying what was probably just a more expensive product in the brand to do the same thing.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it and hope it helps you as much it has helped me.</li>
            <li>The first step gets my teeth clean, and the second step (the whitening) is far easier and quicker than either strips or trays.</li>
            <li>I got the new Crest Pro Health HD daily two-step system free from Bzzagent as a part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li>and I do feel that the second gel tub adds a special layer of protection</li>
            <li>This is the most effective whitening toothpaste that I&#x27;ve tried before, and in just a little over a week, my teeth are a few shades lighter.</li>
            <li>I found that I spent more time brushing my teeth due to the two steps, which is not a bad thing!</li>
            <li>It left a kind of dry chalky feeling in your mouth.</li>
            <li>It does give an odd sensation while using the product that I was not used to, but overall the product is good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not great, but I don&#x27;t really expect toothpaste or teeth whiteners to have a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li>While not cheap per se compared to plain toothpaste this is definitely superb and well worth the extra cost for cleaner brighter smiles.</li>
            <li>By the time I went back to get the other half of my mouth cleaned, the hygienist was really impressed with &amp;#</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming &amp;#34;medicine-y/peroxide&amp;#34; taste, but it also isn&#x27;t as refreshing as other toothpastes I typically use.  </li>
            <li>I saw a commercial for Crest Pro Health HD Toothpaste recently and was super excited when I received the product as part of a promotion to try and then review it.  </li>
            <li>Considering other whitening products require much more than 1-2 minutes to complete, it is pretty ingenious of Crest to just sneak it into a slightly longer brushing</li>
            <li>The whitening gel is pretty potent (most are) and for those of us with hard enamel and sensitive gums, twice a day really isn&#x27;t possible, aminly because they want you to brush a full minute with each tube, 2 minutes total.</li>
            <li>The step 1 cleanser leaves a great refreshing taste and eliminates bad breath completely.</li>
            <li>The tubes are clearly labeled so there is no concern about mixing up which tube goes first and two minutes is the recommended brushing time.</li>
            <li>Also Step 2 had a strange taste to it that I didn&#x27;t enjoy.</li>
            <li>I was also initially worried about the two step process required with this toothpaste and wether or not that would fit into my morning routine as a busy working mom!  </li>
            <li>It is clearly labeled on the tube so there is no need to need to remember which tube to use first.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The primary innovation of this toothpaste seems to be that, as it has two steps, it causes me to brush for twice as long as I otherwise would.</li>
            <li>,  now the meh:&lt;br /&gt;I experienced some tooth sensitivity to hot and cold the first week of use&lt;</li>
            <li>But my gums can get pretty sensitive.</li>
            <li>The product did not make my teeth sensitive nad did not have a funny taste.</li>
            <li>Sometimes a full two minutes of teeth brushing is not possible!</li>
            <li>It is not a miracle cure, but it is better than your average whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The second tube lists full ingredients of Water, Glycerin, Hydrogen Peroxide, Carbomer, Disodium Pryophosphate, Flavor, Sucralose, Sodium Hydroxide.  </li>
            <li>So I took a full day off and used my regular toothpaste and the sensitivity went away.</li>
            <li>The first step cleans your teeth and removes old plaque.</li>
            <li>However, after using it for the first time yesterday, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I would have done the same if I had paid full price for it.  </li>
            <li>I say on and off because I have pretty sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>i first received it, i was surprised on having two tubes, i couldn&#x27;t understand, why this couldn&#x27;t be one tube.</li>
            <li>The second step toothpaste doesn&#x27;t really have any flavor to it at all, and therefore you don&#x27;t really get that fresh minty feeling when you are all finished with the brushing process.  </li>
            <li>These teeth have to last me my whole life and to keep them healthy and white is what matters to me, and this is stuff is the bomb.  </li>
            <li>Before trying the Crest Pro Health HD; my teeth were quite yellow to the point I didn&#x27;t really like to smile that much.</li>
            <li>I normally wouldn&#x27;t spend this much on toothpaste</li>
            <li>I like how it gets me to actually brush my teeth for a full two minutes since I am paying attention to the two steps</li>
            <li>you get a full money back guarantee if you do not like it.</li>
            <li>The reason I didn&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars is that if I brushed for 2 minutes using ANY toothpaste, my teeth would be cleaner, my breath fresher.  </li>
            <li>I am definite going to continue using this system, as I finally found a way to whiten my smile and keep my mouth comfortable.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, the taste and texture completely turned me off.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Crest Pro Health® HD™ for one full week, twice a day, following the instructions.</li>
            <li>There is a big baking soda after taste that I feel is left if you don&#x27;t do a good job rinsing your mouth, however, I do think it helps with my overall mouth freshness.</li>
            <li>enamel but pretty good overall i would recommend it for people with small stains in the teth otherwise</li>
            <li>The bubbly second step kept me brushing for the full 2 minutes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried any sort of professional or at-home whitening kits or toothpastes before, so this was my first go around with any sort of product.</li>
            <li>They were sensitive at first, but now I don&#x27;t even notice any sensitivity at all.</li>
            <li>My mouth doesn&#x27;t have as much of that morningy &#x27;funk&#x27; each morning as it normally does.  </li>
            <li>I think it feels like it really cleans my teeth and has a normal mint flavor.</li>
            <li>My teeth also feel cleaner, which may have to do with actually brushing my teeth for the full recommended two minutes.  </li>
            <li>One tip that&#x27;s worked for me is using my electric toothbrush which beeps after each 30 second interval to ensure I go a full minute with each step.</li>
            <li>I like the two steps also because it helps me to brush for the full two minutes, since it&#x27;s only one minute per tube.</li>
            <li>I did notice that it made my teeth sensitive the first couple of days, but it eventually passed.</li>
            <li>It actually keeps me brushing for the full two minutes</li>
            <li>Simply place step-1 on tooth brush and brush all surfaces of your teeth for 1 full minute.</li>
            <li>I brushed for the full minute and spit.</li>
            <li>WOW I was literally blown away after the first brushing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The second tube lists full ingredients of Water, Glycerin, Hydrogen Peroxide, Carbomer, Disodium Pryophosphate, Flavor, Sucralose, Sodium Hydroxide.</li>
            <li>you use the tube marked 1 like a regular toothpaste (though this one contains Stannous fluoride which is better against plaque) and brush for 2 minutes, spit it out and without rinsing your mouth or the brush, apply the tube marked 2 on the brush which is the whitening gel and brush for another minute.</li>
            <li>Step 2 doesn&#x27;t look or taste or feel much like normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li>That way you get the full whitening effect.are complementary, not the same product twice.</li>
            <li>The first tube of paste is clearly marked Step 1.</li>
            <li>I recently received a full size PR Sample of this product.  </li>
            <li>The first paste feels like a mini professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week, and so far, I&#x27;m really liking the product!</li>
            <li>The sensitivity was gone the second day, although I noticed that I couldn&#x27;t rinse my mouth out with cool water without my tongue feeling like it was on fire.</li>
            <li>Overall not bad, just not my preference.</li>
            <li>noticed that the 1st step product did feel grittier than toothpaste I am used to, but it was not bad, just different.</li>
            <li>overall, not a product I&#x27;m going to go out and purchase myself but not a bad score from BzzAgent.eling.  </li>
            <li>overall, not a product I&#x27;m going to go out and purchase myself but not a bad score from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, just different.</li>
            <li>Love that the toothpastes are strong enough to make a difference but not too strong that I feel that weird tingling sensation on them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall Crest Pro Health® HD™ is a very good toothpaste system that gets done what it says it will do, as long as you don&#x27;t mind a slight bit of extra effort going through the two steps.</li>
            <li>To be honest that happens a little here too, but overall I was very pleased by how this toothpaste turned out even despite a few drawbacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No more licking all the grit from the toothpaste off for hours, just clean, smooth, whiter teeth.</li>
            <li>I felt like it cut down on the plaque and whitened my teeth even more.  </li>
            <li>The packaging could have slimmed down a bit, but it still wasn&#x27;t overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are 2 steps, first you brush for one minute with the toothpaste which has a nice subtle flavor.</li>
            <li>I assumed it would be the same ingredients, but more concentrated, which would mean a more severe reaction.</li>
            <li>the second one is a little more unique taste......</li>
            <li>The only drawback that I can see so far is the fact that this kit involves two steps but its worth the extra time for the clean that you get from it!  </li>
            <li>I received a brand new full size Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste set last week thanks to Crest</li>
            <li>2-step toothpaste system requires more effort than simply applying White Strips, but I feel like the extra time and effort is worth it because not only does your teeth get whiter with each use, your mouth is also left feeling clean and fresh, which I appreciate!</li>
            <li>It seems like the &amp;#34;whiter teeth&amp;#34; claims on toothpastes and strips are just a little out of hand, and there&#x27;s no way to tell which one is good enough for you.</li>
            <li>I think I have found my new tooth paste!</li>
            <li>We have found our new toothpaste!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always preferred Crest products, and now this will be my new toothpaste of choice!</li>
            <li>until today I spotted a brand new display of this product and snagged one!</li>
            <li>Ta da - New Product!</li>
            <li>This is my new toothpaste!</li>
            <li>I have been using the Crest Pro Health HD system religiously for about 6 weeks and honestly, I can&#x27;t say that I really see any noticeable difference over using my regular Crest products (Generally a Crest Pro-Health w/Senstivity user).  </li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t like the second step very much.</li>
            <li>Also, I have pretty sensitive teeth after having braces 2x in my life, one in Jr. High, and another time in college (because I don&#x27;t follow directions and wear my retainers), but this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>By far I would recommend this two step process that is looking for a long lasting healthy smile.  </li>
            <li>Although step 2 had a little bit of a funky taste initially, I was pleased with how clean my teeth felt after using these 2 products.</li>
            <li>The process doesn&#x27;t really take any more time than normal brushing, you just have to do 2 different processes, one right after the other.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a whiter and cleaner smile that last for a long time!!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>I feel like a whole new person with this</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest and BzzAgent, I have been using the new Crest Pro Health® HD whitening system for about 4 weeks now.</li>
            <li>At the very get go would like to mention that after using the new Crest Pro Heath toothpaste duo, my  teeth do feel whiter and fresher.</li>
            <li>They look whiter and feel healthier thanks to Crest&#x27;s new 2 step system.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve started using this new Crest HD 2 step product I&#x27;ve been very impressed/happy.</li>
            <li>For only a total of 4 minutes of time per day, it makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li>Yes, I would tend to say that step one cleans better than a typical Crest product.</li>
            <li>However, it does seem to be performing just as well or better than anything I previously tried.</li>
            <li>I do think the HD has slightly whitened my teeth and probably could do so more with longer use</li>
            <li>Over the last 3 or so weeks, I&#x27;ve tried to go back to twice per day, but it still seems to irritate my gums so I will stick with once per day to get that fresh from the dentist clean feeling and keep my teeth a bit whiter than without.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully this product truly is doing what it feels like it&#x27;s doing and eliminating more plaque than my previous paste.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I still like the product and would consider using it again in the future since it gives me a fresh and clean feeling and is not gritty or lingering in my mouth all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as dramatic as whitening strips, but it definitely the most effective whitening I&#x27;ve ever seen from a tooth paste.</li>
            <li>I did have previous concerns about the long-term effect on my teeth as well, but they&#x27;ve been greatly alleviated after some online reading.  </li>
            <li>I typically use my custom trays and 20% hydrogen peroxide gel for whitening; I haven&#x27;t found anything to whiten better than they do.  </li>
            <li>I drink black tea most of the day, so my teeth do have some staining on them.  </li>
            <li>because I am not a heavy coffee or tea drinker, so I don&#x27;t really notice staining on my teeth too much.  </li>
            <li>It does not whiten as well as it claims but it does do a decent job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a busy Mom with 1 on the way and before I received the Crest Pro-Health HD free in the mail from Crest, my gums were bleeding daily.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste due gave my mouth the same feeling, but with a better taste and easier cleaning regimen!  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased two more sets for my personal &amp;#34;stockpile.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>as a child I never had super white teeth and no one in my family</li>
            <li>Therefore I know this product will whiten teeth because of its main ingredient for step 2.</li>
            <li>My mouth definitely felt fresher after a week and my teeth physically felt smoother and more polished.</li>
            <li>TOTALLY harmless, and disappears quickly--</li>
            <li>for the main feature, the whitening..  </li>
            <li>Nobody commented on my teeth looking exceptionally white as many people do when I use the Crest White Strips. :</li>
            <li>Finally a product that really makes a diffence in your smile.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll have to admit, many of my teeth brushing sessions prior to using this product did not last the recommended 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Step 1 is a fairly mild flavor, I assume to not offend different tastes.  </li>
            <li>the questions of does this actually work, I have to say most definitely.  </li>
            <li>It also subconsciously makes me brush longer instead of quickly getting through the brushing process to speed up my morning routine.</li>
            <li>I think its a decent toothpaste</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m older, my teeth are older...</li>
            <li>Most people don&#x27;t even take the necessary 2 minutes you&#x27;re supposed to spend on your teeth, so adding an extra step is a real-life deterrent.</li>
            <li>Most recently, I was using Crest 3D but stopped after my dental hygienist commented on the plastic beads in gums at my last appointment.  </li>
            <li>will most likely use step 1 twice daily, and use step 2 just once, to assure my gums are not overly irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>will most likely use step 1 twice daily, and use step 2 just once, to assure my gums are not overly irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only con is that I don&#x27;t find the toothpaste as refreshing as my regular product.  </li>
            <li>The main difference for me is how my teeth feel.</li>
            <li>I though the product was decent for what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There were a couple of things I was not crazy about which were pretty minor.  </li>
            <li>I started noticing a difference in the brightness of my teeth within a couple days and it only got better over the following weeks.</li>
            <li>There are just too many mornings where I don&#x27;t have that extra minute to brush, essentially, twice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an older person with some tooth discoloration that I thought I would just have to life</li>
            <li>It only takes a fraction of the time as white strips and you still get much better results.</li>
            <li>Yes, I would love white teeth, because everyone knows that their teeth could use a bit of whitening, especially mine.</li>
            <li>Although the two step process isn&#x27;t as convenient, it is worth it; especially since this is much easier than putting a tray of gel on your teeth or even using whitening strips.  </li>
            <li>Although the two step process isn&#x27;t as convenient, it is worth it; especially since this is much easier than putting a tray of gel on your teeth or even using whitening strips.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is this toothpaste does seem to make my gums bleed more than regular toothpaste, but I&#x27;ve also read that that means it&#x27;s working on healing them</li>
            <li>It may be that I need to continue this process for a few more weeks to see the real benefit.  </li>
            <li>The total length of brushing doesn&#x27;t change, you just take a quick spit halfway and add the step 2 gel to your brush and continue brushing for another minute.  </li>
            <li>Its mild enough like sensodyne.</li>
            <li>After the initial cleaning of toothpaste you can tell the grime is off of your teeth and to further top that off with a polisher and whitener</li>
            <li>But this particular product didn&#x27;t knock my socks off.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased two more sets for my personal &amp;#34;stockpile.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive this product on behalf of Crest and  Bzzagent.</li>
            <li>It is a decent cost for what you get.</li>
            <li>But luckily step 2 was only seconds</li>
            <li>Overall, I have enjoyed the product and would definitely consider purchasing again.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at best prior to trying this product.</li>
            <li>so I was sceptical that Crest HD would be any different, however after receiving a free sample of Crest for being a bzzagent I gave it a try and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend that people try it for themselves, especially if they have problems with keeping their teeth healthy.</li>
            <li>The second step leaves more of a \\&quot;just back from the dentist\\&quot; feel rather than</li>
            <li>I personally don’t mind the 2-step process because this ensures I’m giving my teeth adequate brushing time.</li>
            <li>It is very simple and I thought it would take more time than regular brushing</li>
            <li>The 2nd tube contains a clear smooth gel that  polishes and whitens the teeth.</li>
            <li>The texture or the first paste is a bit funny, but gets fully dissolved by the second paste.</li>
            <li>Based on my experience with just the toothpaste, I am definitely more likely to purchase a Crest toothpaste product in the future.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use the product as instructed since the process is simple and quick and my teeth do feel cleaner after use.  </li>
            <li>I definitely would recommend trying Crest Pro-health 2 step for a healthy alternative  to regular toothpaste</li>
            <li>In the week before my dentist visit, I definitely noticed the product gave my teeth more polish, similar to how they looked after a dentist visit - not 100% of the polish of a dentist cleaning, but maybe 50%.  </li>
            <li>I think this toothpaste works, although my teeth are not heavily stained and I’m not a coffee or tea drinker nor do I smoke, I did notice improvement in the light discoloration I do have after just a short period of time.</li>
            <li>So I was hesitant about step 2, since it contains peroxide as a main ingredient.</li>
            <li>The whitening/polishing gel is potent and can irritate your gums and (temporarily) turn them white if left on for too long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did stick it out, however I had to cut back to using this product only once a day until my mouth was able to adjust.  </li>
            <li>I did stick it out, however I had to cut back to using this product only once a day until my mouth was able to adjust.  </li>
            <li>In addition, I found this product on the shelf at a local store and it costs more than the price of 2 toothpaste tubes, so it is not low cost but is cheaper than a whitening procedure at the dentist.</li>
            <li>Although my husband already thinks I have super white teeth to begin with.</li>
            <li>As far as the taste of the toothpaste, it&#x27;s not as minty fresh as Crest Complete Scope.</li>
            <li>2 more months until my next regular dental check-in</li>
            <li>will definitely continue to use Crest Pro-Health HD until the containers are empty, but I haven’t decided yet if I will purchase it on my own afterward.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive Crest Pro Health® HD complementary via bzzagent.</li>
            <li>I recently received a sample of crest pro healthy HD daily two step toothpaste to try.  </li>
            <li>My main concern was that my patients might not want to do the two step process</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and I&#x27;m definitely thinking about replacing my current toothpaste for it.</li>
            <li>I started using this only at night and after 3 days, the pain subsided to a mild discomfort.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to try Crest Pro-health HD through BuzzAgent!!!</li>
            <li>The taste of this toothpaste is, like most whitening pastes, not great; the second step in particular tastes very strongly of peroxide.  </li>
            <li>I have to admit that I was a little hesitant at first, since it has 2 steps, but it is super easy and not a big deal at all.  </li>
            <li>The taste was a little strong at first</li>
            <li>Years ago, I had tried the whitening strips and my teeth became very sensitive after using that, so I am much happier with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The single tooth seems plaque free.</li>
            <li>Definitely a must try that I highly recommend and will continue to use for a long time - a true two in one product!!  </li>
            <li>The toothpaste left my teeth feeling extra clean and while I didn&#x27;t notice a whitening difference right away</li>
            <li>The best part for me was that in the past when I used whiteners my teeth became sensitive to cold very easily and after just a couple of uses of the product.  </li>
            <li>As a once a day, HUGE cup of hot tea drinker, as I inch towards 50, I have noticed that the tea stains are starting to remain on my once white teeth!</li>
            <li>So you finish the first step, and your toothbrush (and maybe your had) is wet, and now you need to hands to hold the 2nd tube and twist the top off.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the second step as much as the first because it doesn&#x27;t taste as much and looks like glue.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t really noticed too much of a difference in the feeling and look of my teeth after using Crest Pro Health® HD™, but prior to this I was already using a higher end toothpaste with whitening.</li>
            <li>From the very first use I could tell that this tooth whitening paste was different from all of the rest I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I found that it really helped me with sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li>Crest Pro Health® HD has made a VERY visible difference on the whiteness of my teeth and I am so surprised!</li>
            <li>After the very first use I could see the stains diminishing, n after only 3 uses</li>
            <li>From the very first use, it makes your teeth feel just like you left the dentist office after a cleaning.</li>
            <li>It takes just two minutes just like my routine which is great because I&#x27;m usually on the go most mornings and tired at night.</li>
            <li>The price is higher than regular toothpaste, however that would be expected given that this is more than just a toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Because of the products I always use, I really did not notice much in the way of whiter teeth from this product, but my teeth are pretty white as it is.  </li>
            <li>They are super clean and they last that way all day long, seriously.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Given the cost of this treatment, certainly more than half of what you&#x27;re paying for is the gel, which as far as I can tell, is not sold alone - and is better than any other whitening treatment I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a young baby and a super busy life, adding an extra step to my daily routine is not always easy.</li>
            <li>The only down fall is that I don&#x27;t really love the taste, it feels not as fresh as I like and has a bit of a chalky effect.  </li>
            <li>Its pretty mild - not really much flavor.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it give my mouth that fresh feeling for hours after brushing, it also whitens better than any other toothpaste product I&#x27;ve tried, in my opinion!</li>
            <li>This is so much more easy to do and to use than the whitening strips or other whitening systems because you don&#x27;t have to wait half an hour or longer to see the results.</li>

            <li>I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li>I will have to decide if these qualities outweigh the high cost, which in my opinion is the biggest downside to Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had high hopes, but the results have been so-</li>
            <li>Since the product claims teeth will be 6x whiter after 1 week, I will give it a few more days to see if I see more dramatic results.&lt;br /&gt;- 2 step system easy to use:</li>

            <li>Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that my mouth feels fresh and clean, and my teeth seem a little whiter.  </li>
            <li>It definitely has left my mouth feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>I feel like my teeth stay clean all day long.</li>
            <li>That clean feeling lasted for a long time as well (throughout the day and into the evening) .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe, but when I run tongue over them they feel really smooth and clean, almost like</li>
            <li>Step 1 looks like that familiar blue gel, and it is kinda minty, but Step 2 is a clear, goopy gel that tastes like peroxide.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean all day long.  </li>
            <li>but the feel clean all day long and even in the morning.  </li>
            <li>And my teeth felt clean all day long.  </li>
            <li>The clean feel lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>My teeth haven&#x27;t felt this clean in a long time.</li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt so clean for so long with an at home product.  </li>
            <li>I was also pleasantly surprised that the price was lower than many other whitening products out there.</li>
            <li>I spend a decent amount (7-8.00) on toothpaste normally and do not see the results that I saw in a DAY with Crest Pro-Health HD.</li>
            <li>We are completely and utterly floored with how fresh this product leaves our mouth!  </li>
            <li>Unlike many other teeth whitened, the crest HD system does not leave your teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li>Bye bye old regular toothpaste, hello crest pro-health HD and hello to a healthier, cleaner, whiter smile!</li>
            <li>Produces a very smooth slick finish and it just feels like your teeth are much cleaner than ever.</li>
            <li>I have used this for six days and so far, I haven&#x27;t noticed a sensitivity issue!!</li>
            <li>I prefer  my toothpastes to have a little more flavor and a little more foam.</li>
            <li>The two step process takes a little more time but my teeth feel cleaner after brushing.  </li>
            <li>is.&lt;br /&gt;My gums seem to be a little better as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unlike most toothpastes it requires a little effort to use.</li>
            <li>That said, this is a little bit of magic in two tubes.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste actually works as advertised in the first application!</li>
            <li>After opening the package, I was immediately overwhelmed by the minty scent and was therefore a little worried about whether or not I would be able to use the toothpaste as I&#x27;m not a fan of overly minty toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I wished the gel was a little bit more minty -</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant since it was a toothpaste and most toothpaste promote to whiten your teeth</li>
            <li>adds the little boost to make all your mouth super-clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>and ---- WOW !!</li>
            <li>(it felt a little cheap), but it&#x27;s not about the packaging - it&#x27;s about the product!</li>
            <li>the price is a bit steep, i saw it on sale at a drugstore for $13 which is a little more</li>
            <li>I wish the taste was a little bit better</li>
            <li>Especially since my teeth were much noticeably whiter!!  </li>
            <li>The taste takes a little getting used to but it is not horrible.</li>
            <li>I wish it tasted a little better.</li>
            <li>I have never enjoyed brushing my teeth, but after this toothpaste my teeth actually feel like I just left the dentist - in a good way!</li>
            <li>The results are noticeable within just a few days, but the clean fresh feeling is immediate.</li>
            <li>My gums no longer feel sensitive and my entire mouth feels clean.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised about the lack of sensitivity, but I was blown away by how clean my teeth actually felt hours after brushing.</li>
            <li>was really surprised as to just how clean my teeth felt and how white they had gotten after even one brushing!</li>
            <li>i really enjoy this product and feel that it gives me a deep, down, complete clean- more than my other toothpaste products.</li>
            <li>Usually it takes weeks to get a beautiful white smile from whitestrips and other whitening toothpastes, but with Crest Pro Health HD I noticed a difference immediately.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser (first step) is also not my favorite, I found the feel of it in my mouth and the aftertaste to be very strange, almost dry and chalky.</li>
            <li>This paste has been very easy as I&#x27;ve just substituted it for my normal past when brushing.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a little more sensitivity in the area around my crown, but I think that is normal with any teeth-whitening product.</li>
            <li>two step system is sooooo easy to follow, and due to no wait time in between, it makes brushing your teeth</li>
            <li>It was really hard to find a toothpaste that I really liked.  </li>
            <li>I feel that the product is not as &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; or strong compared to other brands, but i still get that &amp;#34;just cleaned&amp;#34; feeling everytime i use it.</li>
            <li>And you can only do so much without professional whitening, but this does live up to its claims and works adequately.</li>
            <li>One of the things I was not a fan of was how dry the first tooth paste made my mouth feel, but after using the second that feeling goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I wish that they used the same style cap for each tube to help simplify the routine but don’t let the packaging deter you from missing out on this amazing new product!!</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest who gave me Crest Pro Health HD for Free to try a little over a week ago I am a much happier man.  </li>
            <li>I know this costs a little more than regular toothpaste, but it is worth is.  </li>
            <li>The only reason this product didn&#x27;t get 5 stars was because it made our gums super sensitive!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other Crest whitening products before with a mild sensitivity, but my results from the Pro-Health HD were pretty severe.  </li>
            <li>The extra step takes a little more time than normal, but after you see the results it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>, I feel extra clean after 2 min , doesn&#x27;t feel like its that clean with other toothpaste .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, it took very little time to get adjusted to using two different tubes of toothpaste instead of one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gentle enough product for sensitive teeth, provides a good clean feeling, and is as simple as switching up your toothpaste - none of those extra strips or mouth pieces to fool with.s as simple as switching up your toothpaste - none of those extra strips or mouth pieces to fool with.</li>
            <li>saw a difference within the first 2 days itself of using this set twice a day as usual and in a week&#x27;s time I had the whitest teeth I&#x27;ve ever had, including a fresh breath and overall clean feeling in my mouth!</li>
            <li>It is simple and easy to use and the extra bit of time that it takes to complete the entire process is totally worth it for the results!  </li>
            <li>the clean feeling lasted a very long time.</li>
            <li>I must admit that I am really bad at flossing, but my hygienist commented that I had the best gums he’d seen that week.</li>

            <li>when 2 minutes are complete so this toothpaste really complements what I was doing to start with.</li>
            <li>was happy that I never experienced any tooth sensitivity!</li>
            <li>I think the second step does a great job at whitening already after only a few uses.</li>
            <li>Are my teeth bright white after a month, absolutely not, but Crest Pro Health HD definitely has them whiter than they were before.</li>
            <li>As I applied the first step to my brush, I observed that the thickness of the paste made it susceptible to clogging of the tube and general messiness.</li>
            <li>Lastly, I really like the fact that Crest offers a 60- day satisfaction guarantee with this product.</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks of using this system, my teeth are no longer sensitive, are SO shiny, and much whiter.  </li>
            <li>More of a medicinal taste, which is kind of unfortunate since it&#x27;s the last taste you have in your mouth as Step 2.  </li>
            <li>Happy to prove them wrong.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised and really like the way my mouth feels after using the two-step product.</li>
            <li>And I was surprised at how much cleaner my teeth feel after using it.</li>
            <li>As far as the whitening goes, I have not noticed much difference.</li>
            <li>I have never used a toothpaste that did so much all at once, and it even made my teeth look shinier and whiter, without making my gums feel sensitive.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much from it, but was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>but if it works, the system is much cheaper and convenient than using whitening strips or getting your teeth professionally</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have overly sensitive teeth, however, this toothpaste really did a number on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the product, step 2 left an after taste, but maybe I just used too much.</li>
            <li>However, Crest Pro-Health HD two-product system encourages me to brush longer than I  normally would.</li>
            <li>Similar to how it feels after you&#x27;ve just used a powerful mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>Immediately upon first use I felt my teeth were much cleaner than with my normal generic brand.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m someone who really carefully considers what chemicals I expose myself and my family to and as such, I want to really look more closely into the dangers (if there are any) of stannous fluoride, before I would continue using Crest HD.  </li>
            <li>I brushed with the “purifying cleanser,” a gentle plaque-blaster, first.</li>
            <li>The Aquafresh actually didn&#x27;t feel fresh at all and even after using it a while, my teeth looked no whiter.</li>
            <li>It left my mouth feeling fresh, even until I woke in the morning.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels dentist fresh after every brush and stays that way longer than with my regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>normally does.  </li>
            <li>The First one cleaned well while the second one really freshened up and felt like it whitened.</li>
            <li>I would prefer if the step 1 toothpaste could be used last, to leave the fresh taste in my mouth</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this product to k people my white smile, this product is a</li>
            <li>After one week of using this product, not only have I noticed a whiter smile, but my family has as well.</li>
            <li>It feels normal having two separate tubes instead of one tube to use to brush my teeth with.</li>
            <li>The mint isn&#x27;t over powering, but you definitely feel fresh.  </li>
            <li>me the biggest value is in giving me a night white smile without the headache.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much the same thing in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I say it&#x27;s worth a try--and you can see the pictures of my results below.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I say it&#x27;s worth a try--and you can see the pictures of my results below.  </li>
            <li>Although it takes a couple of times to get used to using two different toothpastes, it was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I also supplement with Crest white strips every 6 months or so to keep my smile at its brightest.</li>
            <li>Using these two simple tools will help advance and whiten your smile beyond belief.</li>
            <li>Next you apply the (perfecting gel) and it helps to whiten and brighten your smile.</li>
            <li>After this supply of the toothpaste runs out, I&#x27;ll probably return to regular paste for awhile, but as soon as I need a whiter smile, Crest Pro-Health HD will be my choice.</li>
            <li>and I feel they were whiter than normal.  </li>
            <li>My wife likes it even more than I do and commented on it after just a few days of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Probably worth 5 stars, but since the whiteness didn&#x27;t necessarily help me, I deducted a star.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a way to brighten your smile and improve the overall health of your mouth, this is the way to go!</li>
            <li>You normally brush your teeth twice per day, so this is not a inconvenience at all.</li>
            <li>Which normal toothpaste covers.</li>
            <li>Be sure to follow the directions and only leave it on as long as noted.</li>
            <li>For only 2 minutes in the morning and at night I&#x27;m getting a healthier brighter smile.</li>
            <li>Just adds one step - the whitening gel after your normal brushing.</li>
            <li>that you would normally.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with the results of this after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li>and I really feel like it cleaned my teeth better than my usual</li>
            <li>I was surprised that I noticed a marked improvement in the first week.  </li>
            <li>The process takes no longer than normal tooth brushing.</li>
            <li>The substance looks a lot like a normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li>than usual, I applied the whitening gel without rinsing, and I can honestly say I am thrilled with the results after only a few days.</li>
            <li>It is definitely a product worth purchasing.  </li>
            <li>I used the first step, white tube, made sure not to rinse and then finally finished with the second step.  </li>
            <li>If that sounds like an extra step, it is, but it is well worth the minute effort.  </li>
            <li>I would absolutely use this, but realistically, I now know I won&#x27;t be diligent enough to use both steps consistently to get the benefits.</li>
            <li>I recieved the toothpaste as a part of a promotion from crest, but I plan on making this my normal routine.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s that the second gel doesn&#x27;t leave a minty fresh taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the time it takes to do that extra step.</li>
            <li>However, since using this product, I have definitely noticed a whiter smile.</li>
            <li>Yes, 2 minutes of brushing, twice daily, can be daunting, but it&#x27;s totally worth the time.</li>
            <li>Pretty much the same.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t use crest but since I was sent this to try by Crest and Buzzagent</li>
            <li>I can say with out a doubt that my smile has whitened in the last couple of weeks</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not a big deal and SO worth the results.</li>
            <li>the product is worth the extra effort.</li>
            <li>The first paste really cleans and the second gel whitens.</li>
            <li>I am a heavy tea and coffee drinker so it may take a bit more time to see any change.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I brushed for too long or something, because I am sure that it could be prevented.</li>
            <li>Not only did I notice my breath felt fresh and</li>
            <li>Believe it or not, this two step toothpaste really is worth the extra effort and cost.</li>
            <li>I normally use Crest Whitestrips once a year</li>
            <li>It is more like an overall week long cleaning of your teeth.  </li>
            <li>, just brush like normal but twice.  </li>
            <li>and I can already see a difference not only in the color of my teeth, but also how fresh my mouth feels for extended periods of time.  </li>
            <li>I am used to having a fresh, minty mouth after brushing my teeth, but Step 2 seems to eliminate the initial burst of freshness that Step 1 leaves.  </li>
            <li>The substance looks a lot like a normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li>After years of one-squeeze-brush-and-go, using a two part system is different but well worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only takes a dab of each for a fresh and white smile.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought the two step process was extra work brushing (who wants to brush twice?)</li>
            <li>Within a few days of use the top of the step one tube came apart, releasing toothpaste and causing the tube to be unsealed.</li>
            <li>Not only is my smile whiter</li>
            <li>The first step, the Purifying cleanser, really clung to my teeth and had just a touch of grit that left my teeth with a polished feel.</li>
            <li>Long story short, you&#x27;re not adding any more time to your morning</li>
            <li>I never thought that a toothpaste product would be able to make the change that I have seen in just a few weeks of using it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m normally a fan of Crest products.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are already pretty white, so I didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference in terms of whiteness after using this product.</li>
            <li>Next I used the perfecting gel, I could notice a whiter smile after just one use.  </li>
            <li>I found that it actually diminished the fresh breath that I just got from brushing with the cleanser toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>So I pretty much gave up on having white teeth,</li>
            <li>In a brief 4 days of use I already see progress and a brighter smile.</li>
            <li>My smile begins with white teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure whether my gum health has improved since starting application, but they feel good</li>
            <li>I use an electric toothbrush and have found that it takes no longer than normal to use Crest HD.  </li>
            <li>Not only did I notice it&#x27;s powerful whitening effects</li>
            <li>The Step 1 tastes and feels just like a normal fluoride toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I am always looking to improve the shade of my smile and have tried various whitening products.</li>
            <li>I do not mind have to do 2 steps because I am so pleased with the results even after just a few times using this product.</li>
            <li>In only 2 minutes 2 times a day your mouth is cleaner, teeth whiter, and has fresh breath.  </li>
            <li>My wife can tell a total difference in the shade of my smile.</li>
            <li>and after a week my teeth looked pretty much the same.</li>
            <li>But for how white it makes my teeth, its worth switching over.</li>
            <li>to use and takes no longer than your normal teeth brushing routine</li>
            <li>For the price, and what I was able to attain using this for just a few weeks, I won&#x27;t try another whitening toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I totally think it&#x27;s worth the money and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>The only read success I had with whitening was with the whitening strips.</li>
            <li>like I normally like.  </li>
            <li>Use the first step then use the second step, couldn&#x27;t really be much easier.</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s worth the price tag too because I could actually use it.</li>
            <li>Considering the price of this product and the extra step involved when brushing your teeth, I do not feel this product is worth it.</li>
            <li>The only read success I had with whitening was with the whitening strips.</li>
            <li>First off I&#x27;ve never had much luck with tooth whitening products such as gels or strips</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t add any time to my normal brushing routine.</li>
            <li>There is a different taste to get used too, but I feel having a fresher feeling in my mouth when all is said and done is worth it.</li>
            <li>Second, I want a toothpaste that leaves a fresh feel and taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li>It was actually quite fun</li>
            <li>I just use  this when I would normally brush.</li>
            <li>I thought a paste that I would normally brush and whitening my teeth was the way to go.</li>
            <li>I only wish I had taken a before and after pic of my smile.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is part of my normal brushing routine</li>
            <li>This product does just what it says it will do -- whiter teeth and a fresh breath unlike what you experience from regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Overall not a bad product as far as a whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed how sparkly they looked after a few uses too.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to get an ultra white smile, as promised on the box.  </li>
            <li>WHITE - IT TAKES YEARS OFF MY SMILE</li>
            <li>Step 2 had a more harsh taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Step 2 had a more harsh taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Just brush as you normally would.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to have a cleaner mouth/teeth and brighter smile.</li>
            <li>I am giving it 3 stars because I do think it can be useful in removing day to day stains if you are a regular coffee or tea drinker.  </li>
            <li>As opposed to my regular toothpaste, I felt the Crest Pro Health® HD didn&#x27;t give me as much of \\&quot;fresh in the mouth</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the extra effort.  </li>
            <li>He noticed a big difference in my smile and so have my friends and family</li>
            <li>Thank you to Crest for brightening up my smile on a daily basis!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing the 2-step routine twice a day for the past week, and my teeth look and feel as good as they did after my last dentist cleaning.  </li>
            <li>My smile is whiter after only a week</li>
            <li>I will say that it does indeed look like it is getting my teeth whiter than normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m looking to see how it is going in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait for my hygienist to see my smile next week!</li>
            <li>After a few days of getting used to the process and getting my gums used to getting a healthy scrub, my teeth began to whiten</li>
            <li>Then you brush with it and rinse like normal.</li>
            <li>, my smile is whiter and I am getting complements that I look YOUNGER !!!</li>
            <li>My mouth felt fresh for several hours.</li>
            <li>I also like using this product after a few weeks for just a couple days to make my teeth feel and look better.</li>
            <li>, the only thing I have tried to brighten my smile is a whitening toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I think I would buy this product every six months as a way to refresh my smile but probably not as my daily go to...for both time and dollars.</li>
            <li>Because the exciting part was how this could make your teeth 6x whiter, I diligently used this every time I brushed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After brushing with step 1 toothpaste , I felt a fuzzy feeling in my teeth that normally we get after eating spinach</li>
            <li>but I did notice a whiter appearance on a few teeth more than others</li>
            <li>than I normally would.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a daily coffee drinker, but every morning, I get a fresh white smile.</li>
            <li>so brushing for 2 minutes is no longer than I&#x27;d normally brush and is recommended.  </li>
            <li>After having used this for a few weeks, my teeth do look better</li>
            <li>I have to use a different toothpaste to get that minty fresh scent.</li>
            <li>You use it has your normal toothpaste routine.  </li>
            <li>Not a smooth feel, so it seems like you&#x27;re getting a better cling to yout teeth.</li>
            <li>After that, just show off your progressively whiter smile daily.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for the past couple weeks (courtesy of free samples supplied by Crest) without a lot of success on the whitening side.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another good product from Crest, but not great.</li>
            <li>I did not realize how helpful a good toothpaste is until I tired this one.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s how I brush my teeth, but it seemed like the first tube foamed more than regular toothpaste, so I had it running down the toothbrush onto my hand.</li>
            <li>one - for me, it seems akin to every other minty toothpaste out there - same refreshing taste, same clean feeling after.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re looking for a new toothpaste, I highly recommend giving this a try.</li>
            <li>Whether its simple everyday activities, meeting new employees, or greeting vendors or Executives, your smile &amp; teeth are your most prized possession.</li>
            <li>I was confused at first, then quickly realized that my teeth were super clean and had that tiny gap between the front bottom teeth.</li>
            <li>was lucky enough to try this free as a Bzzagent, and I will definitely continue to purchase it in the future!</li>
            <li>I want to see if is worth taking the extra time for the two steps brushing and the price, as of right now I will give the product a three....to be continuereport and giving my final conclusion.</li>
            <li>It is difficult to remember not to rinse after step one, but otherwise a very easy way to brighten a smile!</li>
            <li>I had tried other regular whiteners and while I&#x27;m sure they do ok, they simply don&#x27;t seem to make a big impact on the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li>I thought the taste was fine compared to some other whiteners I&#x27;ve tried and</li>
            <li>both have used this new toothpaste for several weeks and agree that our mouths feel fresh and tingly after we brush.</li>
            <li>Got to try this product for free thanks to Crest, and I have to say it does make my teeth feel smoother and cleaner, and I noticed a slight whitening effect as well.</li>
            <li>I pick myself up off the couch, drag myself upstairs and just want to quickly brush my teeth before falling fast asleep.  </li>
            <li>The things that appealed to me about this product included the quick action whitening (with noticeable effects within a week), the emphasis on gingivitis reduction, and the relative ease of use.  </li>
            <li>I figured it sounded easy enough and since it requires brushing, it wasn&#x27;t anything extra</li>
            <li>The directions were simple enough, and easy to time because I have a Sonicare toothbrush that beeps every 30 seconds</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even safe for sensitive teeth and will not interfere with previous dental work, unlike some products.</li>
            <li>Crest ProHealth HD was really easy to use - brush with regular toothpaste and then brush with a second tube of whitening</li>
            <li>With the Crest Pro Health® HD easy to use 2 step system, my teeth are whiter than the more expensive systems out there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and minty and a slightly aqua or blue color like some mint gel toothpastes are.  </li>
            <li>This program is easy and simple and actually works.</li>
            <li>This routine seemed easy enough since I already use 2 minutes of brushing as my standard.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and only take a total of 2 mins, just twice a day</li>
            <li>and I guess that it warms up in our dry mouth and becomes further more</li>
            <li>and I guess that it warms up in our dry mouth and becomes further more</li>
            <li>After only a few uses, I saw a HUGE difference in the appearance of my teeth and the brightness of my smile!</li>
            <li>If for no other reason than the clean feeling you are left with after using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I limited my use to only once and made sure to rinse thoroughly after, the irritation went away.  </li>
            <li>Brush 1 minute with 1st tube labeled &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; and right after, without rinsing, brush 1 minute with 2nd tube labeled &amp;#34;2&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I can think is that my husband was right that it stripped my teeth during those two weeks of use.</li>
            <li>I began using Crest Pro Health HD right after my last teeth cleaning at my dentist</li>
            <li>Picture on Right is before and picture on left is after one week of use.  </li>
            <li>I realize that there are a million products on the market right now that promise to whiten your teeth, and if you are like me you have not found anything that actually works!  </li>
            <li>I began using Crest Pro Health HD right after my last teeth cleaning at my dentist</li>
            <li>The 2nd time I used it was right before bed.</li>
            <li>I imagine every person will be different, maybe this product just wasn&#x27;t right for me.  </li>
            <li>She stopped using it right away, and scheduled her dental cleaning for next week.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.drugs.com</li>
            <li>Score a big plus for that feature right away and the package did not deform or rip apart</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t want white teeth right???</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, and that&#x27;s from the mouth of the husband of a professional dental hygienist!</li>
            <li>I liked the end result, but on a busy morning, it took a little bit too much time and effort to use two different products to get the job done.</li>
            <li>It has helped keep my clear brackets clean and my bands and such clear and not dingy and yellowish.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a dramatic change, but enough where I was left impressed.  </li>
            <li>I could see the difference the first few days, and was really excited.  </li>
            <li>The first is it takes about a minute or 2 longer than your normal brushing with having 2 pastes and also the first step leaves your mouth very dry.</li>
            <li>The combination of the two has a very strong taste, not very pleasant.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical at first having to do a two part system, but I was very impressed by the cleanliness I felt afterwards.</li>
            <li>My teeth normally get very sensitive with whitening products, but I haven&#x27;t had any sensitivity with using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Seems simple enough - use the fluoride toothpaste for anti-cavity and anti-gingivitis, and then use the whitening gel to whiten your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except that the last thing I need in the morning is one more step to get ready.  </li>
            <li>The routine is bit different because you brush your teeth 2 different times for 1 minute with 2 different toothpastes, but in the end it really doesn&#x27;t take any more time.  </li>
            <li>My husband had a good bit of tartar build up on his teeth, and improvement was obvious after only the third or fourth day of using the product.  </li>
            <li>there&#x27;s no waiting with gross gunk in my mouth that makes me gag.i have noticed my teeth look much better after only a few weeks and are definatly whiter.i recieved this free to try(with smiley360) and will definatly purchase again</li>
            <li>The 2 step process seemed a bit time consuming, (having 2 little ones, I&#x27;m lucky to get a quick brush in twice a day!), but it really didn&#x27;t take too long!</li>
            <li>I work in a very large office setting and attend several meetings throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>It tastes fine without tasting good or bad.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it will be just fine, but I learned it wasn&#x27;t for me since I&#x27;d prefer to keep my brushing routine the same.</li>
            <li>When I brushed with step 2, I knew exactly what the main ingredient was...</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive teeth, so the white strips/tray systems don’t work very well for me.  </li>
            <li>I received this as a free sample and,  due to the price,  </li>
            <li>In no way has receiving it free influenced my thoughts other than the product being something I would buy again.</li>
            <li>cheap compared to some other whiting toothpastes.</li>
            <li>The whole process only takes a couple minutes which isn&#x27;t much beyond what I normally do.  </li>
            <li>I will say that those with sensitive teeth/gums may nto like using this as the first step is very drying and gave me cotton mouth while the second step is peroxide based and can tingle or sting your gums if you are sensative.</li>
            <li>It does make your mouth feel a little sensitive, as do most whitening products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The first night I felt a little thrown by the lack of true mint flavor and swirled a bit of mouthwash after I was done brushing.</li>
            <li>It did make my gums a little sensitive but that seems to be getting better as I have continued to use it.</li>
            <li>I got to try this product out for free from Crest-Using two toothpastes is definitely weird at first, but after getting used to the two steps, I can say I am a huge fan of this new toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The hydrogen peroxide content is high because after the first two times I had white spots on my gums.</li>
            <li>However this is a whitening product and as such being cosmetic I would expect it to be a bit on the higher side, but not as high as Crest&#x27;s competitors pricing.</li>
            <li>I had pretty high expectations, and hoped I had a solution for whiter teeth that wouldn&#x27;t require those gross strips.  </li>
            <li>Gets kind of annoying to have to switch using different tubes of toothpaste, no major whitening noted, Step 2 doesn&#x27;t taste great and it may irritate your gum line w/ the peroxide, I ran out of Step 1 in exactly 30 days and still had plenty of Step 2</li>
            <li>So as a Bzz agent, when the opportunity arose for me to try Crest&#x27;s new Pro Heath HD 2 step toothpaste program, I jumped at it</li>
            <li>Being two steps, this is something new that I&#x27;d never considered before.  </li>
            <li>The new product Crest HD is a two step process of whitening your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the new Crest Pro Health HD for about a week now</li>
            <li>I tried the new crest HD system as part of a bzzcampaign.  </li>
            <li>new routine going forward.</li>
            <li>you have when you get out of the dentist office with your newly polished pearly whites...</li>
            <li>Crest has always been a leader in toothpaste and mouth care, and this new addition is an example why.</li>
            <li>I think I have found my new toothpaste system.</li>
            <li>Got to try this new toothpaste dou through BzzAgent</li>
            <li>It is my new go to toothpaste of choice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Crest has out done themselves with this new process.</li>
            <li>However, this new toothpaste and whitening gel combo did not cause any irritation.  </li>
            <li>We started with a day 1 photo and after another week, a new one.  </li>
            <li>I was invited to try the new crest HD toothpaste kid.</li>
            <li>I received a package of this thru Crest to try out and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this new Crest Pro Health HD system for a week and took pictures along the way to track if it truly whitened my teeth.</li>
            <li>This is totally my new #HealthyObsession for the day.</li>
            <li>Planing to make this my new staple toothpaste</li>
            <li>from BzzAgent was the new Crest Pro Health HD system.  </li>
            <li>I asked my fianc&amp;eacute; this morning how he was liking the new toothpaste</li>
            <li>and I was stoked to try out a new toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know how beneficial using this new two step toothpaste could be compared to what I had been using.  </li>
            <li>applaud Crest for indulging somebody&#x27;s new idea.  </li>
            <li>Plus my new whiter teeth have gotten noticed by friends and family.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new go to toothpaste.</li>
            <li>In this box was the new Crest Pro Health HD.  </li>
            <li>But I can tell that they are whiter since I started using the new tooth paste.  </li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s nothing new I need to remember.</li>
            <li>For the record, he doesn&#x27;t even notice when I get a new haircut</li>
            <li>I like Crest products, but this didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I am two days into my new routine with Crest Pro Health HD</li>
            <li>received a sample from Bzz Agent, and now Crest Pro-Health HD is my new go to toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I am always up for trying new products and ones that will whiten my teeth.  </li>
            <li>However I can feel no plaque with this new toothpaste.</li>
            <li>However it does live up to whitening and cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li>I received the new Crest Pro Health toothpaste from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>I am a new mom and feel like my teeth yellowed after baby.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a toothpaste that will make your teeth feel brand new</li>
            <li>I have found my new toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I like the feeling of newly cleaned teeth, and I think this toothpaste delivers that.</li>
            <li>I like this new toothpaste.</li>
            <li>applaud Crest for indulging somebody&#x27;s new idea.</li>
            <li>I have a new dental routine and for now</li>
            <li>I am always looking for something new to try</li>
            <li>They sent me the new Crest Pro-Health HD two-step toothpaste system to try.</li>
            <li>As a dental hygienist I&#x27;m always looking for new products that I can recommend to my patients to help them have a healthier mouth.</li>
            <li>Tried this new toothpaste through a sampling program with BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li>Even better - it really wasn&#x27;t hard to adjust my routine to include both steps.</li>
            <li>And other reviewers have said that it left their mouths feeling dentist visit fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>I think my teeth have whitened a little over the last 30 days, so I&#x27;m keeping it going for the next 6 months, and see how much improvement I see in my smile, and over all mouth healthy.</li>
            <li>so my teeth usually don&#x27;t remain bright and shiny too long after a visit to the dentist.  </li>
            <li>I got this product for free thanks to Crest and after a few weeks of testing it out all I have are words of praise.</li>
            <li>so my teeth usually don&#x27;t remain bright and shiny too long after a visit to the dentist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a nursing mom and have to get up several times in the night to feed the baby, so not to have that gross taste in my mouth during those night feedings was a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, I am sure that the price may be less than the white strips and all, but it is still a bit too much for someone used to spending about $5 on a tube of toothpaste, and this is four times the amount for two tubes.  </li>
            <li>I never really felt like I had that clean mouth feel or freshness.</li>
            <li>I continued with using Crest Pro Health HD for a second week but really did not pay much attention to the color of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Crest HD solves both problems, and the toothpaste is the most thorough and flavorful paste I&#x27;ve tried in a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is important to remember not to rinse prior to the second toothpaste step.</li>
            <li>Would have been much easier to put the flip cap on the 2nd tube as well, which is much easier to do with one hand.</li>
            <li>I was sent a free trial of Crest Pro-Health HD through BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;After using the toothpaste for a few weeks now, I really like the 2 part system.&lt;br /&gt;Logically</li>
            <li>We recently picked up a free sample of the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two Step Toothpaste from our BZZagent status.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I tend to use products that use natural ingredients, and will probably revert back to a toothpaste that uses less man-made chemicals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times so far, so if it seems to make a difference, it might be worth it.</li>
            <li>The first step is like a normal frothy toothpaste and the second step is a whitening gel used as a toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I had a 6x whiter smile, but there is no question my smile was/is a few shades whiter.</li>
            <li>I recently recieved a free trial product of Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two Step Toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Strips take too much time and don&#x27;t cover the entire mouth, and toothpaste really doesn&#x27;t work that well for me.</li>
            <li>And most whitening toothpastes don&#x27;t really whiten that much (at least not the ones that I have tried).</li>
            <li>far as the part two of the kit, although my teeth don&#x27;t feel exceptionally white, I will say I have noticed an increase in brightness in my smile.</li>
            <li>Please note that I received Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste from Crest via BzzAgent for free, and I am posting this review only after using this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I had a 6x whiter smile, but there is no question my smile was/is a few shades whiter.</li>
            <li>I recently received the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste from #bzzagent as a free trial.  </li>
            <li>I was sent a free trial of the Crest 3D white daily cleansing and whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li>First, you brush with the white normal toothpaste, then you spit without rinsing and brush again with the gel step.</li>
            <li>I got this product for free through Bzz Agent and I finally found a toothpaste that actually whitens.  </li>
            <li>With this product, I was able to use it twice daily (morning and night) and experience absolutely no sensitivity.</li>
            <li>If I could I&#x27;d probably give it a 4.5 stars instead of a 5 overall, but I had a good experience with this toothpaste and do recommend that you at least give it a try.think</li>
            <li>If I could I&#x27;d probably give it a 4.5 stars instead of a 5 overall, but I had a good experience with this toothpaste and do recommend that you at least give it a try.</li>
            <li>After using Crest Pro Health HD for several weeks now, I do feel like my mouth is healthier, but since my teeth weren&#x27;t really in need of whitening before, I can&#x27;t really attest to its whitening abilities.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly abrasive, not overly strong flavored and cleans well.  </li>
            <li>Based on the results of the 21 year old&#x27;s experience, I can highly recommend this new product.</li>
            <li>Most likely fro the first step grit.&lt;br /&gt;I was going to continue a few more days, until I was warned by a dental hygienist that the active ingredient in step 2 could actually stain my teeth!  </li>
            <li>But I like how convenient and simple it is to able to just use these in lieu of your normal toothpaste everyday and how quick it is (only two minutes, one minute for brushing each step).</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive teeth and normally use toothpaste specialized for this, since I hadn&#x27;t used a different type of toothpaste for a long time I was willing to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I was very  surprised by this product</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth and have used gels from dentist offices before, and those have always brought out my sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>I found Step Two to taste very much like the same substance used with the Crest whitening strips.</li>
            <li>became very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I found Step Two to taste very much like the same substance used with the Crest whitening strips.</li>
            <li>I can see why they call this &amp;#34;HD&amp;#34;, because this offers a high resolution experience.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth and the preservatives always hurt my teeth.</li>
            <li>Step 1 was very much like regular tooth paste.</li>
            <li>I could not forget the fact, my teeth are very sensitive.</li>
            <li>two minutes actually goes by very fast-</li>
            <li>This could be also why my teeth felt very sensitive after using.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive teeth, and this product does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li>it is VERY reasonably priced compared to similar kits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that I can actually whiten my teeth without using strips or extra steps outside of my normal routine.</li>
            <li>I have a high tolerence for pain, but my teeth are sensitive.</li>
            <li>downside to this system is the cost, it is more than I would typically spend on toothpaste, but were I to replace some alternative whitening solution (such as strips), then I can see spending a little more to replace it.</li>
            <li>The first step removed plaque, and buildup on your teeth and then the second step applies a sealer to prevent new buildup.  </li>
            <li>The second bottle was definitely a polish that could make someone feel they are taking positive steps right away.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have generally sensitive teeth, but there are some spots that are responding a little more sensitively than I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Working this into my general morning routine was easy, truthfully minimal change from what I did before.  </li>
            <li>I am the first to admit that I am willing to try anything and even extra money to get my teeth white and Crest&#x27;s new Pro Health HD</li>
            <li>After brushing, my mouth feels very fresh and remains that way right up until my next meal, which is something I couldn&#x27;t say about previous products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>so you certainly feel like it&#x27;s more serious than that single-stage toothpaste the proletariate uses.</li>
            <li>The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I feel like my teeth can be very sensitive when I first started using it.</li>
            <li>Despite the daily brushing of my teeth, the smile reflected back at me from my mirror was something I was less than pleased with.  </li>
            <li>When you have very little time for yourself due to work, kids and other obligations, this is a great way to pamper yourself!</li>
            <li>The product is good tasting, makes my mouth feel fresh, and I think has had a subtle but slightly noticeable whitening effect on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>With that being said, this is one of the most expensive and yet worth every penny toothpastes you&#x27;ll ever use!</li>
            <li>You will get a more naturally white look from this alone, but if you want pearly whites, use the other whitening products also.</li>
            <li>It is a 2-step process that starts with you first cleaning your teeth with the toothpaste (step 1) and then, without rinsing your mouth, you brush on the second substance, which is the whitening step.</li>
            <li>I recieved this product to test and at first I was hesitant of the 2 step process, thinking I don&#x27;t want to add any extra steps to my routine but after seeing and feeling the almost immediate results, I don&#x27;t mind a bit.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone that&#x27;s willing to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Crest would need to significantly reduce the price for me to continue using this on a regular basis, as it is a daily 2-step system.  </li>
            <li>I have to admit that at first it was an adjustment to use two different products when brushing my teeth; it took some getting used to.  </li>
            <li>Being an avid coffee drinker, I&#x27;ve always had &amp;#34;not so white teeth&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have that super fake mint taste, just a clean fresh taste.</li>
            <li>I definitely saw results after the first three weeks of using this product.</li>
            <li>I only have so much time in the morning and at night!  </li>
            <li>I have been using the 3D white toothpastes for years, this is on another whole level!</li>
            <li>The first  is that it actually works.</li>
            <li>Oh and by the way, no more morning breath :)</li>
            <li>After my first use I definitely noticed a difference and after consecutive uses I was hooked.</li>
            <li>After the first use I could notice a difference, I felt like I had just left the dentist</li>
            <li>Thee first is that if it is a two part system shouldn&#x27;t both parts be the same amount?</li>
            <li>I doubted at first that it would whiten my teeth, and while they are not pearly white</li>
            <li>so my teeth were pretty white to start with.  </li>
            <li>The first step is a deep cleaning toothpaste that I would buy on</li>
            <li>I had to make sure not to go past the 1min.</li>
            <li>(it felt like the toothpaste was removing more &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; than usual), and a cleaner sensation in my mouth afterward.  </li>
            <li>Upon first use, my teeth felt immediatly cleaner than they do when I brush with traditional flavor.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more is that this second paste actually has a similar, if not identical taste that tooth whitening strips/paste have, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also really busy and rarely have time to complete a cycle of Crest White Strips.</li>
            <li>Not sure if I would pay for more.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend trying it out and thanks for letting my try this product out Crest!</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been using it for weeks now and his teeth are looking white for the first time in his life.</li>
            <li>more white than any other whitening paste.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a simple process, used the paste first and then follow-up with the gel, without rinsing in between.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Really it doesn&#x27;t take any more time than my usual brushing</li>
            <li>Using it two times a day doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive!  </li>
            <li>There is a slight after taste that lasts for an hour or so but after that it&#x27;s fine and you no longer notice the taste.</li>
            <li>I have always been apprehensive about any sort of whitening program, fearing that I would either be stripping away important layers off my teeth, or that my teeth would end up glowing in the dark like Ross.</li>
            <li>It is a really simple two step system: first you brush your teeth with the step 1 toothpaste followed by step 2 by adding the whitening gel to your toothbrush and brush for about one minute.</li>
            <li>Normally those types of toothpastes will make my teeth sensitive.  </li>
            <li>In the past many whitening treatments that I hace used irritate my guns, however this gel did not cause any irritation.</li>
            <li>Personally I thought it performed pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem at first thought, until you are in the middle of brushing.  </li>
            <li>From the first time I used this 2-step process, I noticed a big difference!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to use it past a couple uses because of the pain, so</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first toothpaste is a cleanser that deep cleans, strips away plaque and helps reverse gingivitis while fighting cavities.</li>
            <li>I have used a few different kind of teeth whitening products before, this one by far is the easiest one to use.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s a pretty big bonus.</li>
            <li>However, when I did consistently use it, I noticed several people (including my dental hygienist!)</li>
            <li>I actually find I don&#x27;t rinse as much after finishing with the whitener like I do with regular toothpaste, my teeth/mouth feel fresh.  </li>
            <li>With just two minutes of brushing, youâ€™ll actually feel the difference from the first use.</li>
            <li>Also I&#x27;m not sure why Step 1 has more in the tube</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately the second I put the first step in my mouth, I knew it was over.  </li>
            <li>You brush for one minute with the first step and then one minute with the next step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is pretty simple though it took some getting used to.</li>
            <li>I received it as a promotion and was able to try it for the past month.</li>
            <li>At first it did take some time to get used to, but after a couple of weeks it felt like second nature.  </li>
            <li>This time, however, since using Crest Pro Health HD, my teeth look as though they have been whitened professionally at the dentist&#x27;s office!</li>
            <li>Many people have commented on the brightness and whiteness of my teeth over the past month</li>
            <li>First you brush for a minute with the purifying cleanser and, without rinsing, follow that with the second step which is the perfecting gel.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Crest claims you may see, but my teeth were pretty white to start with;  I did see a noticeable change</li>
            <li>After brushing your teeth with the first paste for one minute, you spit it out (DO NOT RINSE per instruction) and brush with the second toothpaste.</li>
            <li>First, my initial use of Crest HD was provided by</li>
            <li>and I think its OK because I am already lazy to brush my teeth</li>
            <li>The toothpaste is a two-step process where you use the first paste for one minute then switch to the second paste for an additional minute.</li>
            <li>Exactly two weeks later, I went for my permanent crown and they said they could see a difference.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m willing to put up with the taste to have such a difference in my teeth.</li>
            <li>The first bottle cleans your teeth like the grainy stuff at the dentist and then the second bottle freshens and whitens!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using Crest Pro Health HD for the past week, and I love the results.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The two step process seemed like it might be a hassle at first, but it&#x27;s actually simple</li>
            <li>While the first step leaves your mouth feeling gritty</li>
            <li>Brush for one minute with the first step, another minute with the second.  </li>
            <li>first night that I brushed, I could feel a difference in the feeling of my teeth.</li>
            <li>I can definitely notice the difference in whitening from this toothpaste, even more so than other whitening toothpastes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much a basic toothpaste and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>and WOW!</li>
            <li>so they were looking pretty white before I started with this product.  </li>
            <li>At first it was a bit of a pain brushing with 2 different toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>Step 1 is the normal toothpaste looking product, while step 2 is a clear gel, which was unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The first tube is a toothpaste, and the second is a whitener.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a bit pricey for my usual toothpaste but even though I use a whitening toothpaste, this is much better.</li>
            <li>As for the whitening I noticed with in a few days that my teeth were becoming whiter</li>
            <li>promised, after a week, my teeth looked considerably whiter and shinier!</li>
            <li>By the end of the first week could already tell were white and shiny.</li>
            <li>I used it religiously for the first 2 weeks twice a day.</li>
            <li>first time I used the Crest Pro Health HD I actually thought I saw a difference in the whiteness of my teeth, but I could not tell if I was just seeing what I was led to believe.  </li>
            <li>I was both weary and excited to try this product as I have tried other teeth whitening products and strips before.</li>
            <li>first thing you should know about this product is that it does NOT taste like your regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>This time, however, since using Crest Pro Health HD, my teeth look as though they have been whitened professionally at the dentist&#x27;s office!</li>
            <li>Many people have commented on the brightness and whiteness of my teeth over the past month</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know that I saw 6X the whitening in the first two weeks of me using this product, but I definitely noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>The directions state to brush with the first step for one minute and then spit out the toothpaste without rinsing with water before using the second step.  </li>
            <li>(My husband stopped using the second step after his first time brushing with it because of its taste.)  </li>
            <li>Pricier than what I would usually pay for toothpaste, but as a replacement for toothpaste + a whitening product, definitely more affordable.  </li>
            <li>Its a two step process which you brush with  very gritty tooth paste first,</li>
            <li>(I would post pictures but they look exactly the same).</li>
            <li>(my teeth are already pretty white)</li>
            <li>I received the Crest HD toothpaste system yesterday from BzzAgent as part of a promotion for the brand, and brushed with Crest HD for the first time this morning</li>
            <li>FINALLY ONE THAT REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The two tubes seemed intimidating at first - wondered if I would actually use it...</li>
            <li>The promised whitening effects are also noticeable even after a short period of use, as my teeth definitely look better than they did even a short time ago.  </li>
            <li>My husband went in for a second kiss the first morning I used it.</li>
            <li>I find that 1 minute for the first step is not enough time</li>
            <li>At first I was thinking that this is going to be one thing to add to my daily routine, but after trying I&#x27;m hooked.  </li>
            <li>I will say that Step 1 was a bit bubbly, and was not at all like the toothpaste I&#x27;m used to using, but once I got past that, I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using this product.  </li>
            <li>one minute for the first paste which cleans plaque away, and one minute for the second step which whitens teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>Even the first time you use it, your teeth get noticeably whiter, but by the end of one week, my teeth are really white</li>
            <li>First- each step takes only a minute each to use-and combines together</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used a teeth whitener that actually worked.</li>
            <li>After the first week, my teeth were several shades whiter.</li>
            <li>I went back to using the paste regularly and sure enough, the numbness came back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about having two steps, but really it&#x27;s no more effort than what I was doing before.  </li>
            <li>Not too the level of the white strips, but more than any other toothpaste I have used.</li>
            <li>To get them whitened is a pretty big chore.</li>
            <li>This is a two step process the first step you brush your teeth and spit but don&#x27;t rinse and the second part is the polish.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy that this is no longer than regular brushing since I have 2 young children who don&#x27;t give me much personal time.</li>
            <li>My teeth are pretty white to begin with.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve noticed it both personally and in my patients with these products, including this one with the first step</li>
            <li>Not too the level of the white strips, but more than any other toothpaste I have used.</li>
            <li>The first part of brushing is the toothpaste and the second is the whitening.</li>
            <li>The first step is actually cleansing your teeth.</li>
            <li>I think that using two products helps me brush more thoroughly than I usually do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as stunning of a difference as I saw with some other people&#x27;s reviews, but I definitely noticed whiter teeth after using the Crest Pro Health® HD™ for 30 days.</li>
            <li>I found that my teeth were not as sensitive as they were using a normal tartar control, whiteneing toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The only thing that would make me rate this higher is if it could be combined into one product to use.</li>
            <li>Definitely noticed that my teeth were cleaner and felt fresher after the first use.  </li>
            <li>I tried Vivid and was so-so about it, but</li>
            <li>Now, I use my sensitive toothpaste in the morning and Crest Pro Health HD at night, and I&#x27;m no longer having sensitivity issues!</li>
            <li>I was completely surprised!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Just had to get used ti figuring out the exact middle on the Sonicare two minute toothbrush cycle.</li>
            <li>1 minute for the first step and 1 minute for the second step.</li>
            <li>It is a simple, convenient process and I literally exclaimed &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; after the first use of this system.</li>
            <li>I use a small dot and that is better.  </li>
            <li>I also am not a fan of the sticky texture of the first step (like the flouride treatment you get at the dentist, or the taste of the second step).</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure it was going to work because I have tried other brands strips and tooth paste that gave me no results but after 6 days I noticed a big difference!</li>
            <li>The first step looks and tastes just like the regular Pro-Health toothpaste and the 2nd step is a clear gel similar to a whitening gel, with a light hydrogen peroxide/baking soda taste.  </li>
            <li>and it is a pain to have to monitor the time for one minute with the first toothpaste and then stop it and use the second tube of whitening gel on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a two-step process (obviously) but not a difficult one.</li>
            <li>You brush with the first tube for 1 minute, then, without rinsing, you use the second product for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>but in all fairness my teeth are pretty white to begin with.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty simple:  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I had enough time to try this toothpaste out for a couple weeks first.</li>
            <li>From the first time I used it I noticed a big difference.</li>
            <li>I only brush my teeth in the morning, so this 2-step system feels very lengthy!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth, so I wish there was a way to whiten that didn&#x27;t hurt this!  </li>
            <li>On the first day using the product I mentioned to my brothers and sister since they don&#x27;t see me daily and after a week I wanted to know if they had noticed any changes which they didn&#x27;t confirming what I had</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I use it instead of my regular toothpaste because it comes with a toothpaste as the first step.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I had some tooth pain when I started using this and after a week it&#x27;s completely gone!</li>
            <li>love to read reviews and usually do before buying anything.</li>
            <li>I have used white strips before and other whitening products that have done a better job.</li>
            <li>The first step looks and goes on like a super-thick regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just not sure two tubes is better than one.  </li>
            <li>have attached a picture of my teeth after the first brushing and after the last brushing...</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with this product due to the whitening.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>First let me say I am one for WHITE teeth.</li>
            <li>It seemed like it might be a pain at first because there are two different tubes you have to use</li>
            <li>First it only takes 2 minutes, 1 minute to cleanse the teeth with the paste, then another minute to polish them with the gel.</li>
            <li>It fits in pretty easily to a regular brushing routine.</li>
            <li>first you brush with what seems like just a regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>My breath was extremely fresh and my mouth felt much cleaner than with any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>You use the first tube for a minute, spit and then brush with the second tube for a minute, spit, brush and rinse.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and will be using this product from now on!</li>
            <li>First you spend 1 min brushing with what seems to be a traditional toothpaste</li>
            <li>I normally use and continue to like Crest Complete with Scope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You are supposed to use the first gel, spit it out but not rinse, then apply the second gel.</li>
            <li>My teeth are pretty white to begin with</li>
            <li>The 2 step process doesn&#x27;t take anymore time than my usual routine and is honestly refreshing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be interested to see if my dentist &amp; hygienist notice the difference at my next appointment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first step is a gritty toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>We both like the flavor of the first paste but don&#x27;t care for the flavor of the second.</li>
            <li>I actually notice my teeth getting whiter after the first use.  </li>
            <li>feelings were exactly the same as mine.  </li>
            <li>My teeth were already pretty white so after a couple weeks of use</li>
            <li>/&gt;The two step process does take a bit of getting used to, as does the gritty feel of the first step of the process.</li>
            <li>and I wonder if that is really necessary for the product to work or if it was something the marketing folks at crest thought would command a higher price when sold.  </li>
            <li>you get your teeth whitened?&amp;#34; Granted, my teeth have always been pretty white</li>
            <li>However, I was very pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>I often forgot the second tube or spit and rinsed after the first tube out of habit.  </li>
            <li>I eventually threw out the second tube and just used the first one.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed using this toothpaste, as it had a different texture than other ones I have used.</li>
            <li>I am obsessed with a good white smile</li>
            <li>When I first received this kit I was a little nervous as I have super sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>My only gripes are that the whitening gel left white spots on my gums right after brushing with it, but those faded relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li>The product requires that you first brush with the paste to clean your teeth then spit NOT rinse, next open the second tube of whitening gel and polish and brush to whiten and polish your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I prefer strong mint flavors so this was something that took a little getting used to for me.</li>
            <li>My teeth were SQUEAKY clean, i brushed my finger against them and they actually squeaked.</li>
            <li>Step one, you brush your teeth with cleanser that is very similar to regular toothpaste for one minute to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>I like that it has two toothpastes you use back to back to help clean my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Crest Pro Health® HD™ leaves your mouth feeling extra clean and your teeth looking polished and white.</li>
            <li>I thought teeth could only feel this clean when leaving the dentist, but after using this toothpaste, I feel as if I just left my dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>, this left a gritty feeling my teeth never felt truly clean.  </li>
            <li>and I can whiten and clean in the same step as brushing me teeth daily.  </li>
            <li>After several weeks use, I can say it does leave you with a clean mouth feeling, but as for the whitening effect, it falls short.  </li>
            <li>In fact I feel like I need to brush with regular toothpaste afterwards to get that clean feeling for my tongue and back of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean when using this product, but I have not noticed any difference in how white they are after 2 weeks of using it religiously.  </li>
            <li>It’s similar to that ‘dentist clean’ feeling on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>I will say that my teeth have never felt so clean, other than a dentist&#x27;s cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also, unlike other tooth pastes, I don&#x27;t get the crisps clean minty taste because it leaves a hydrogen peroxide foamy taste.</li>
            <li>It gets my teeth just as clean as the other Crest Pro-Health I was using before.</li>
            <li>I like that foamy bubbly feeling from my toothpaste that makes you feel like it&#x27;s getting your teeth really clean, and some of the other whitening toothpastes don&#x27;t do that.  </li>
            <li>I like that foamy bubbly feeling from my toothpaste that makes you feel like it&#x27;s getting your teeth really clean, and some of the other whitening toothpastes don&#x27;t do that.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean every time I brush but no more clean than my regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>My teeth look noticeably whiter (even after one day), and my mouth FEELS clean for way longer than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I have never felt my teeth this clean from my other toothpastes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cons are dry mouth when it&#x27;s first used, cost, and so far my teeth haven&#x27;t gotten much whiter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too bad that I can&#x27;t use it every day because I really do like how it works and how super clean and smooth it makes my teeth.  </li>
            <li>With that being said, I have noticed many positives and very few negatives.  </li>
            <li>Her only feedback was that she found Step One to be more dry or gritty than her toothpaste.a 6x whiter smile, but there is no question my smile was/is a few shades whiter.</li>
            <li>I love the hybrid nature of it, how it is like a cross between conventional toothpaste and whitening trays.</li>
            <li>The first step has a convenient flip top, but I have to open the gel before I start, otherwise I have to put my toothbrush down to open it.</li>
            <li>I was a bit concerned that my sensitive teeth would have a problem switching to a new toothpaste (I have used Sensodyne for over 10 years)</li>
            <li>my mouth felt incredibly clean and fresh, and morning breath is a thing of the past!  </li>
            <li>Eventually, I found myself with a long weekend morning with nothing pressing right after I woke up</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;A cleaning at the Dentist and using this for a month and a half should have your teeth extremely healthy, enough that you can live without it for a year.</li>
            <li>I recommend that everyone who wants a brighter smile for less money, try this new system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to be selected by Crest to try the new Cresh Pro-Health Daily Two Step Toothpaste Process.  </li>
            <li>It leaves you with a very clean feeling due to what I can only think to describe as the &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; in the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>After using it for less than a week you could see a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of is the texture of the step 2 gel; after using the step 1 paste the step 2 gel is a strange consistency</li>
            <li>Since this is a two step process, brushing will take twice as long as before, but I didn&#x27;t really notice this too much.</li>
            <li>I had the opportunity to try this for free, and was hopeful but not sure but would make much difference.</li>
            <li>The second tube, that you use immediately after brushing with the first, contains a clear whitening gel.  </li>
            <li>Since this is a two step process, brushing will take twice as long as before, but I didn&#x27;t really notice this too much.</li>
            <li>I got a free sample to try a week and a half before my wedding, and while my fiance did a whitening gel, I stuck with the Crest Pro Health HD.</li>
            <li>She put a tiny bit of the first paste on a plate (sometimes for fun she mixed in a tiny bit of the flavored crest BE toothpaste, then she dipped her brush in...and using a soft bristled brush, began with the gums and brushed with NOT too much pressure, in a gentle arc.</li>
            <li>I am loving the results already after only a few days!</li>
            <li>After brushing, my teeth felt markedly cleaner and sleeker than with my regular toothpaste after just the first use.</li>
            <li>If you want true whitening you should see your dentist for bleach trays or use white strips like crest white</li>
            <li>It actually helped me ensure that I brushed for the full two minutes!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a loyal Aquafresh user, but when BuzzAgent gave me the change to try this out as part of a promotional campaign, I was curious.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely not your average toothpaste...and the results are phenomenal!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I have noticed that they feel a bit more sensitive than usual.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately the results were average at best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how effective it is since it&#x27;s only on your teeth for a minute, then you rinse it off.  </li>
            <li>The second step has a sweet taste to it and you can feel it working instantly.  </li>
            <li>For the first time in nearly 30 years, I actually look forward to brushing my teeth with this stuff!</li>
            <li>I have tried different whitening strips and whitening toothpastes in the past and have not been completely thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li>two Gel there was a bit of an aftertaste that went away shortly thereafter, not nearly as bad a generic toothpaste.</li>
            <li>After the first week and certainly after the 2nd week I could definitely see a difference in the color of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>My teeth aren&#x27;t ever very sensitive, so I can&#x27;t speak to how it feels on sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I would suggest using a very soft brush if you have a sensitive mouth.</li>
            <li>My husband and I have very sensitive teeth and every time we used a whitening toothpaste our teeth became painfully sensitive.</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive teeth and was worried that using a &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; gel would make my teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums are usually very sensitive to whitening products, but Crest Pro Health HD did not make my teeth hurt or overly sensitive.</li>
            <li>The two steps take some getting used to, especially since you are not supposed to rinse between them, but it takes no longer to brush than normal toothpaste and is now very normal.</li>
            <li>I have tried whitening strips in the past and due to my sensitive teeth I have never been able to get the full effect of the whitening.</li>
            <li>If i do use mouthwash its hard to even keep it in my mouth that long because of how minty my mouth is left after brushing (lol).</li>
            <li>It has actually been a positive experience with it.  </li>
            <li>Now let&#x27;s get on to the not so positive part of this product and for me there is only two:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another positive note is that I didn&#x27;t experience any of the possible side-effects mentioned on the packaging.  </li>
            <li>My husband as well as several of my friends are now using Crest Pro-Health after seeing my positive results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many whitening products in the past - bleach trays from the dentist, white strips, etc. - and always thought it was too much of a hassle.</li>
            <li>the really cool part, too, is that when i awoke the next morning  my teeth still felt smooth , not the least bit fuzzy like how they can feel sometimes.  </li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this product from Crest and have been using it consistently for four weeks (missing an occasional morning in the rush to get out of the house).</li>
            <li>I have accidentally started with step 2 at least 5 times, because the colored tubes make more sense to me to use the blue one first</li>
            <li>After the first time I used it, my teeth had that smooth feeling you have after going to the dentist, and after a few uses I noticed a definite improvement in color.</li>
            <li>(and I&#x27;m a busy working mom of two young kids!)  </li>
            <li>Since using Pro-Health HD I have not had ANY bleeding with flossing and my sensitive tooth is no longer sensitive!</li>
            <li>My mouth is far from sensitive however I&#x27;ve found myself stopping the entire process and spitting out before the first minute is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use, gives good results quickly and is less expensive than some other whitening alternatives.  </li>
            <li>Our entire family absolutely LOVES this new product from CREST.  </li>
            <li>I am a sucker for all things new and improved, and more often than not I end up just being a sucker.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Our entire family absolutely LOVES this new product from CREST.</li>
            <li>The gel is a little strange texturally at the beginning but not bad and got used to it quickly.  </li>
            <li>And I did think my side teeth were more noticeably less yellow</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a two step process that is quite easy to use and takes no more time than normal brushing.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>less build-up, more white.  </li>
            <li>, the second step has an odd state but not horrible at all.</li>
            <li>Having to use two tubes is a bit of a hassle, the second tube doesn&#x27;t have a flip top which might have eased the annoyance slightly.</li>
            <li>The 2nd step does have more of a peroxide slightly salty taste, otherwise, this wasn&#x27;t an issue.  </li>
            <li>she&#x27;s going to verify what I already feel - less plaque buildup and healthy, white teeth!</li>
            <li>I can see quick results in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>only downfalls  would point out is that the second step tastes like hydrogen peroxide, but goes away quickly if you use mouthwash after.</li>
            <li>Its simple and quick to use, and only involves two steps.</li>
            <li>might think to use half the amount of toothpaste on each step, equaling a full amount you might normally.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it is a decent product for a decent price; however, I think I will stick to my whitening trays in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;i was lucky today and grabbed the last 2 boxes at my local drug store.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, considering it takes only 2 minutes total, I quickly got over my hesitancy.</li>
            <li>Whitens my teeth pretty quick, though I&#x27;m not sure I have seen six shades whiter yet.</li>
            <li>You get two tubes, the first one functions much like regular toothpaste the second is a clear gel that uses hydrogen peroxide and baking soda to whiten.  </li>
            <li>It forced me to brush longer than I normally would, left my mouth fresh and tarter free and my teeth were whiter in about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>The other MAJOR reason I like the product and will purchase it in the future is that I LOVE the way it made my teeth feel.</li>
            <li>No waiting around with something in your mouth for hours and no mess!</li>
            <li>The only real con I noticed was that the toothpaste made the corners of my mouth a little sore, dry and cracked, kind of like any type of whitening can do.</li>
            <li>The biggest positive to this product is the near instant and thus gratifying whiting.  </li>
            <li>Her only feedback was that she found Step One to be more dry or gritty than her toothpaste.</li>
            <li>This is so much easier than those strips I used to use that you had to wear for 5 minutes that left your teeth sensitive and slimy!</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I saw the price, (I received a complimentary package from BzzAgent), because it was much higher than I expected, but after doing some research, it seems like that&#x27;s pretty average for a whitening system.  </li>
            <li>Now I can wear my favorite bold shades of lipstick without feeling like my teeth will look dull or not white enough.  </li>
            <li>I never thought that I&#x27;d switch from the Crest  3D White toothpaste and accompanying Crest Brilliance polish that I&#x27;ve been using for the past year, but I did and am very pleased, as was my dentist who feels that this new approach is the wave of the future.  </li>
            <li>the second bottle of whitener and polish is a large twist off cap.  </li>
            <li>But I assure you, all my teeth got whiter - unlike the strips that only hit certain</li>
            <li>Since everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different, that warning may have to be there in case it applies to a certain segment of the population.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The combo works well, and the results certainly justify the extra minute of effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For now I will stick with Regular Crest 3D tooth paste but look forward to new Crest products!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have thought they&#x27;d be able to get it down to just one step, but apparently not.</li>
            <li>I am a little concerned that it may be wearing away my tooth enamel and plan to look into it, just because they now feel so smooth.  </li>
            <li>I think for someone looking for a little bit of brightening would enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of Crest Pro Health HD as part of a promotion from Crest little over a week ago</li>
            <li>After using it for a little over 2 weeks, my teeth and mouth feel and look fabulous.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think it&#x27;s worth a shot, especially if you don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth &amp; can finish the tubes!</li>
            <li>And the taste of Crest Pro Health® HD™ is far superior than any other toothpastes that I had used in the past.</li>
            <li>Flavor wise this toothpaste is very weak.</li>
            <li>Flavor wise this toothpaste is very weak.</li>
            <li>The big difference for me is how clean my teeth feel ALL DAY long, even after eating.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the 2 step process, while adding a little bit of time, made a huge difference in how my teeth felt.  </li>
            <li>It turns out it does make your teeth a little bit more white.  </li>
            <li>We were both simply amazed at how white our teeth were after the first use!</li>
            <li>I do have dental work on my top front teeth, but not on the bottom and those teeth always looked a little darker, especially since I&#x27;m a coffee and tea drinker.</li>
            <li>Not sure that the extra clean feeling was worth the 2-step brushing process.</li>
            <li>I could instantly feel how clean my teeth felt all day and barely any plaque was present by the time I got home from work.</li>
            <li>It does a little.. but the white strips work a 1000x&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li>The kit seemed far more serious than my normal tube of toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also not in love with the fact that you can&#x27;t rinse your mouth between pastes, that&#x27;s hard for me.</li>
            <li>The downside is, due to the product size, the product goes quickly.  </li>
            <li>The first few times you use it don&#x27;t be surprised if you find yourself feeling your teeth with your tongue several times a day just to marvel at how clean they feel.</li>
            <li>and I find it a little more trouble than it&#x27;s worth to have to use each tube for 1 minute twice a day.  </li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of the Crest Pro Health products already, and this didn&#x27;t let me down!</li>
            <li>The interesting part of the process is my lips and mouth do not feel dry after brushing as they sometimes do with other toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The same concept applies to Crest Pro-Health HD, if you put a little extra effort into taking care of your teeth, you&#x27;ll really appreciate the outcome even more.</li>
            <li>As someone who regularly uses White Strips for whitening my teeth, I was excited to try the new Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step toothpaste as apart of the BzzAgent.com</li>
            <li>The clean feeling is very long lasting as well.</li>
            <li>The flavor of the toothpaste tastes great as well, without having an artificial flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 2 step system is really convenient - there are no messy trays or gross tasting strips to let sit on your teeth.</li>
            <li>The fresh feeling when you are done brunching is great because I hate having the after taste of food lingering after I brush.</li>
            <li>The clear gel (step 2) brightens and polishes your teeth.</li>
            <li>I clearly don&#x27;t leave another time before work.</li>
            <li>This tube is a gel, clear, and it&#x27;s the whitener/polisher.  </li>
            <li>I typically use Crest Pro Health toothpaste, because I like how clean it makes my mouth feel.  </li>
            <li>Step 2 is a clear gel with peroxide to whiten the teeth.</li>
            <li>but I can clearly see the results.</li>
            <li>Step Two is the whitener, which is a clear substance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;re done with that you&#x27;ll use the perfecting gel which clearly is peroxide based as you can feel it bubbling in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>As far as it making your teeth 6 times whiter,  I have not seen that much difference in the shade of white that my teeth are.  </li>
            <li>It is a clear jell with from what I can tell no flavor.</li>
            <li>My gums became very irritated from the constant brushing, they were sensitive and would bleed.</li>
            <li>Step Two is the whitener, which is a clear substance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>DO NOT rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2 is the polish which is a clear gel.</li>
            <li>2: again tube clearly labeled 2. put that on your non rinsed tooth brush and continuing brushing for an additional minute.</li>
            <li>I had a dental appointment about half way through using this product and my hygenist comentted on how clean my teeth were looking.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t rinse, then you apply the clear tooth polisher again you brush for another minute.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear from the product packaging that this is intended to be a results driven product...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear, somewhat runny or watery gel.  </li>
            <li>The instructions clearly state that you must brush with the toothpaste for 1 minute, spit but not rinse, then</li>
            <li>one tip I would give is that because you are only brushing with each step for a minute, you really have to make a conscious effort to reach all surfaces of your teeth in both steps.</li>
            <li>A clear gel like stuff</li>
            <li>- Perfecting Gel (clear gel) removes the stains and whitens the teeth.  </li>
            <li>step looks like a clear gel.</li>
            <li>As far as the whitening process goes, It took me until the 2nd week to really notice a difference.</li>
            <li>but it is in clear color</li>
            <li>but it is in clear color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely clear, and less-viscous than toothpaste, and sort of absorbs into the bristles of your tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Then after a minute, I added tube 2, which is the clear gel</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried out different whitening products before; whitening strips and mouthwash make my teeth hurt and end up being sensitive for days, and whitening toothpaste doesn&#x27;t really seem to do anything.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t mind a two-step process; it kind of makes me want to brush my teeth for two minutes without getting bored.  </li>
            <li>, so I have stayed clear from them for awhile.</li>
            <li>I did have to switch to a sensitive tooth brush instead of soft as the product does tend to cause tender gums</li>
            <li>My teeth are just as white as before I used this product (a month straight).</li>
            <li>As a person with sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>And to be clear, I do not have sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>I do have sensitive teeth and gums though.  </li>
            <li>After the second week I really started to notice results.  </li>
            <li>Oddly enough, I&#x27;m looking forward to finishing this product off and seeing what it can really do over the course of a month or so....</li>
            <li>At first it seemed a bit strange to have to brush my teeth twice</li>
            <li>I would give the product 4 starts for now, just because I have not seen any whitening action on my teeth after a week.</li>
            <li>but then you move on to the second paste, like a gel, really, and the dryness goes away.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s too early to tell if my teeth are whiter, but they do feel cleaner</li>
            <li>I have always had a problem using whiting stuff because it hurts my gums or makes my teeth sensitive.  </li>
            <li>This product only takes two minutes, covers the whole mouth, and does not hurt at all.</li>
            <li>I really like the neutral taste of the second step, so</li>
            <li>all it works however the packaging needs work and old habits have to be broken.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Second, because it&#x27;s a timed two-step system, it really encourages me to be mindful about my brushing time, which I admit, I sometimes slack off on.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I was concerned that it would enhance my already sensitive teeth&#x27;s sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>Crest Pro Health HD completely blew it, and all others, away.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and had been using Sensodyne for years before this, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with increased sensitivity since switching.</li>
            <li>This helped with my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel professionally cleaned.</li>
            <li>So far this product has lived up to the description/advantages printed on both box and tube.</li>
            <li>teeth are sensitive in spots</li>
            <li>and she made a statement that surprised me.  </li>
            <li>I had nearly given up on my teeth being white(r).</li>
            <li>Crest Pro Health® HD is a 2-step toothpaste system, each taking 1 minute to complete.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First, I could actually note the difference that my teeth were much whiter than they had been before.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro Health HD has been a breeze so far.</li>
            <li>you know that this product is the real deal made from the same stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, by the 7 or 8-day mark, there was a difference in the shade of my teeth (not astounding, but noticeable for sure), and now that I&#x27;ve been using this for close to a month, my teeth are even whiter still.</li>
            <li>so I i have a natural discoloration, something that I am embarrassed about.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have time for the whitening strips and they make my teeth sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I was worried about sensitivity, because I have sensitive teeth, but it has not bothered me at all.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth, and while this isn&#x27;t a toothpaste FOR sensitive teeth, it didn&#x27;t aggravate or bother my teeth or gums at all.</li>
            <li>I also like the polishing gel, since it hasn&#x27;t made my teeth sensitive, but I do feel like they look whiter.</li>
            <li>If you have issues with morning breath (don&#x27;t we all?), want whiter teeth, or have sensitive teeth and need a whitener that won&#x27;t cause pain, give Crest Pro Health HD a try.</li>
            <li>The gel used in Step 2 reminded me of the old gel fluoride treatments that dentists used to give after a cleaning.  </li>
            <li>For years, I paid for professional teeth whitening with my dentist.  </li>
            <li>I took a 3 day break and started again, and so far no pain.</li>
            <li>I use this two step kit every morning along with my Crest whitening toothpaste at night, and I could feel a whole lot of different in the cleanliness of my teeth!!!!</li>
            <li>It does not make my teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li>I may be allergic or otherwise sensitive to something in this product.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth or a sensitive mouth, you might want to avoid this one.</li>
            <li>Wow I have been a crest fan for years</li>
            <li>As a busy mom of two, I don&#x27;t have time to deal with that stuff.</li>
            <li>It did not make my teeth sensitive</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>but because you are applying the toothpaste and whitening solution directly to the teeth you don&#x27;t have to worry about that happening.</li>
            <li>The 2 step process is really simple, 1 minute for each item, 2x a day and the whitening effect is really noticeable.</li>
            <li>This product is much easier to use than whitening strips and you can just replace your current toothpaste with it.</li>
            <li>It also protects my sensitive teeth with the added</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s much faster than having to wear noticeable white strips for 30 minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>2-step process is extremely simple and does not take too much additional time out of my daily morning routine (when crunch time really matters).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: I have now completely used my Crest Pro-Health HD Two-Step Toothpaste System.</li>
            <li>Perhaps my teeth are just too far gone...  </li>
            <li>The directions do say to use this toothpaste twice per day, but as I have sensitive teeth, I have been doing once a day, just in case.</li>
            <li>My husband has been using it as well, and he has noticed a considerable difference in his teeth, so</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised at the results.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised when I immediately saw results.</li>
            <li>and it works well on those teeth as well as my natural</li>
            <li>It is a bit wintergreeny - which is my least favorite flavor.</li>
            <li>routine!&lt;br /&gt;While the step 1 paste is a bit thicker and grittier than traditional toothpaste, I&#x27;ve felt that my mouth is much cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I really really like this Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>so I have been using it for nearly a month.</li>
            <li>As part of a free trial pack, I received the Crest Pro Health HD pack a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>Makes you brush longer since you have two parts to complete which alone will get your teeth cleaner.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>My mouth felt gummy and soft.</li>
            <li>routine!have just become a part of my natural routine.</li>
            <li>I felt like I just had a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li>than have the dentist do a professional whitening job and works</li>
            <li>It drys my mouth out completely and leaves a chemically taste.</li>
            <li>Whitening toothpastes don&#x27;t really whiten the internal part of your tooth.</li>
            <li>But if you do not have sensitive gums or gum recession, then I recommend trying this.  </li>
            <li>After nearly a week of use, my years of abuse (tea) appear to be disappearing.  </li>
            <li>At that point they are still sensitive, but it starts to subside.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My gums are generally sensitive, and this issue may not happen to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>my testing is complete, I plan to continue to use this product, providing my gum sensitivity</li>
            <li>my testing is complete, I plan to continue to use this product, providing my gum sensitivity</li>
            <li>This surprised me a bit because I brush longer than two minutes.</li>
            <li>Even though it is a 2-step process it really takes no longer than using regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>like i just got a professional cleaning from my dentist.  </li>
            <li>The real test was waking up the next morning to see how my mouth felt and smelled.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive gums and this toothpaste did not irriateate my gums.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for anyone with sensitive gums looking for a whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li>So far based on my experience</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a busy, working parent; there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d have time for that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>It is fantastic, but for everyday people, it&#x27;s a bit pricey.</li>
            <li>There is that old saying, &amp;#34;The</li>
            <li>it went away completely with Step 1.</li>
            <li>No waste here!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has also made my teeth a bit sensitive.</li>
            <li>I get canker sores on occasion and while using this toothpaste I have had much fewer which is definitely a pro for me.</li>
            <li>Wow, did I just get my teeth professionally cleaned??  </li>
            <li>It is actually not that much work and</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any whitening yet, but it is early yet.</li>
            <li>I am rarely surprised by products.</li>
            <li>I found that my gums were sensitive to the ingredients</li>
            <li>If some have sensitive teeth, I can see where this might be an issue.</li>
            <li>and I noticed there was considerably lest scraping involved.  </li>
            <li>If you get any on your chin, if you have sensitive skin, you&#x27;ll see some redness.</li>
            <li>However, my mouth feels much cleaner after using this product rather than regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I really like using Crest Pro-Health HD Daily.</li>
            <li>I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 as I have had my teeth professionally whitened at the dentist.  </li>
            <li>When I first received this product, I thought the two steps were going to be a pain or take too long</li>
            <li>I wish they made this in a sensitive formula.</li>
            <li>but  for the results I have been getting so far</li>
            <li>I have never had results like these unless I was using strips that made my sensitive teeth hurt.</li>
            <li>My teeth are sensitive, and I have had issues with whiting products before.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health two step far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>Plus, I&#x27;ve been trained by dentists to realize that OTC whitening products will only help me so much.</li>
            <li>but he said this by far is the easiest.  </li>
            <li>have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth, but this product hasn&#x27;t bothered my teeth nor my gums at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have noticed some whitening effects but it is early days yet .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit, I was not sure what to expect when I first got the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste from Crest to try for free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier than the whitening strips, since  it doesn&#x27;t require you to do what you aren&#x27;t already doing by brushing your teeth daily.</li>
            <li>not for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I am not going to my old paste now.  </li>
            <li>However, I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I do appreciate that it also did not leave my teeth sensitive the way whitening strips do.  </li>
            <li>So far I have seen some difference in my teeth and gum lines.</li>
            <li>Even my 11 year old son keeps taking it upstairs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a busy mom and at the thought of a two step process I was like</li>
            <li>Even my 12 year old who does not sugarcoat anything noticed and commented on my teeth now that&#x27;s saying something</li>
            <li>My teeth are too sensitive for whitening products like Whitestrips, but I have no adverse reaction to this system, so I will stick with it and see if with time it will have some whitening effects.</li>
            <li>Got compliments too, which was unexpected.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised how well this product works.</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive at all.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that my teeth sensitivity did not worsen.</li>
            <li>I received this toothpaste as part of a BzzAgent campaign and have been using it for nearly a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After week 3, my teeth look like they were professionally whitened.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Previously I had been using a toothpaste specifically for sensitive teeth, so I was concerned going into this trial about an increase in sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that the Crest Pro Health HD whitening system that BzzAgent sent me did make a difference in the brightness and whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li>After a couple of days, the routine sticks and becomes natural.</li>
            <li>I did not see professional strength whitening</li>
            <li>I am highly sensitive to Sodium Lauryl Sulfate.</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>i coudnt even keep them for a minute because i developed shooting pain in my teeth.</li>
            <li>I compare it to the feeling of just leaving the dentist office from having a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>teeth are sensitive in spots</li>
            <li>The two step-process does take some getting used to, but once I got a hang of it, I realized it was much faster than brushing with regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>My teeth have felt much cleaner and healthier the last couple of days</li>
            <li>I even had to verify the results with my wife, and she was surprised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received several compliments on how much whiter my teeth are now.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t see much progress even though I brushed my teeth twice a day.</li>
            <li>I was sent a sample by Bzzagent in order to complete this review.  </li>
            <li>This surprised me a bit because I brush longer than two minutes.</li>
            <li>After three weeks, my teeth still feel weirdly sensitive after every use.</li>
            <li>I was nervous that I would feel that 2 tubes of toothpaste would be too time consuming, but it didn&#x27;t take up as much time as I thought it would initially.</li>
            <li>And since the whole process only takes 2 minutes it&#x27;s tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That evening, I gave it a go, using a soft manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This product does almost completely eliminate morning-breath.  </li>
            <li>I really like how all of my teeth, including the backside, are white and not just the front ones as when using a whitening strip.  </li>
            <li>My teeth sometimes feel a tad bit sensitive after using both</li>
            <li>Like I said, I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now, but I am nowhere near done with the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it about two weeks now, and although it hasn&#x27;t made much difference in the darkest stains on my teeth, it does seem to have improved the overall look of my teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome</li>
            <li>It only takes 2 minutes to complete the process, so it doesn&#x27;t take any longer than brushing your teeth with normal, ineffective toothpaste; I actually prefer the two step method because it breaks up the monotony or brushing your teeth for 2 consistent minutes.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to BzzAgent and Crest for the promo trial of this great product!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always skeptical of products that seem so simple but make big claims.</li>
            <li>Second, I did not see much of a whitening effect in the 1 week the label promised.</li>
            <li>Be sure to follow the directions and use at least 2x a day.</li>
            <li>it made them a bit sensitive</li>
            <li>There are no messy strips or trays and no tooth sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>I also cannot afford to get my teeth professionally whitened.</li>
            <li>It looks like I have been using professional whitening products.  </li>
            <li>I received the toothpaste yesterday and have so far used it twice yesterday and once today.</li>
            <li>AllI have to say is WOW.</li>
            <li>My husband is trying it too, and he has sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a week so far</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>To my surprise the Crest HD system has so far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>I feel like my teeth and breath are so much cleaner than using regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I plan to keep using daily to see how much whiter my teeth might get.</li>
            <li>The process is really quite simple.</li>
            <li>I am an early user</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re expecting miracles and celebrity-white teeth, consult a dentist for professional whitening products.</li>
            <li>my sensitive gums twice.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive</li>
            <li>Plus loses a star for the taste not my favorite but Definetly doable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with my old</li>
            <li>my teeth will become sensitive.</li>
            <li>I used once a day and then used a toothpaste for sensitive teeth at night to counteract the sensitivity caused by the Crest Pro Heath HD system.  </li>
            <li>rinse mouth until teeth are completely brushed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could tell a difference early on, and I have had several people compliment me on my white smile.</li>
            <li>that reason, I&#x27;ve drastically cut back on how much I&#x27;m using it.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that I was surprised with how well it works.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s been a week</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t overly whiten your teeth to the point that they no longer look real, but it gives it a naturally white look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Prior to my trying out this product, I really didn&#x27;t have any stains on my teeth</li>
            <li>My teeth feel much cleaner using this system then regular paste.</li>
            <li>this product was not a waste</li>
            <li>Really, two weeks after my dental cleaning and my teeth still look like I just left the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I was was surprised in the difference.  </li>
            <li>And as far as I am concerned, I see no change in the color of my</li>
            <li>I was surprised with the results.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth, so used this in conjunction with my sensodyn.  </li>
            <li>This has been the simplest way to get whiter cleaner teeth so far.</li>
            <li>Do I have sensitive teeth?</li>
            <li>So I would say that this product is not recommended if you have sensitive teeth, so it is not a product for me!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>With today&#x27;s busy world, the thought of brushing my teeth and taking 2 steps to do this was not something I was looking forward to doing.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t completely sold on the idea of using two products to brush my teeth when I received samples of this line from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>It feels like a professional job.</li>
            <li>I told my 10 year old daughter about it.</li>
            <li>Crest spent more time with the technical requirements of the bleaching paste than they did the use of the entire system.  </li>
            <li>Dentists always said that I&#x27;d have to get my teeth professionally bleached (of course they did)</li>
            <li>I made sure to do everything as normally as possible - same toothbrush, same place, same time.</li>
            <li>I really wonder if I am the only one who has done this!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The pros by far outweigh the cons.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro Health HD comes with two tubes that are marked Step 1 and Step 2.  </li>
            <li>I also take exception to the amount of packaging that this toothpaste entails (I feel very wasteful) and I&#x27;m leery of stannous fluoride, which may actually stain the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You rinse after this step is complete.  </li>
            <li>I tend to be sensitive to whitening toothpastes, and my teeth didn&#x27;t tingle when using this step.</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised by this one considering the claims.  </li>
            <li>I am 40 yrs old with no cavities (knock on wood)</li>
            <li>And even though, stopping in the middle to reapply toothpaste is a bother, I really like the results.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels alive after using this paste.  </li>
            <li>I gave it the 4 stars only because  I really did not notice any whiten of my teeth after a month of use.</li>
            <li>The whole experience left my mouth feeling like it does after leaving the dentist office.</li>
            <li>My friends have all asked if I got them done professionally.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as convenience, yes, it is a two step process.</li>
            <li>Hey I&#x27;m old and I drink coffee ALL DAY</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth, and I notice no increased sensitivity.</li>
            <li>Plus, after just a week, my four year old daughter is commenting on my teeth being &amp;#34;shiny!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Crest Pro Health HD comes with two tubes for a complete 2 step process.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used strips, whitening products, whitening pastes, professional whitening and nothing</li>
            <li>After about two days and tenderness disappeared completely.  </li>
            <li>I am very fond of their toothpastes and this one is no different.  </li>
            <li>like I&#x27;m actually brushing more carefully since I have to use the two different products.  </li>
            <li>It totally knocks out that morning coffee-breath and leaves my teeth and mouth ready for the day.  </li>
            <li>The sensitivity had become completely unbearable and I had to discontinue its use.</li>
            <li>I do, however, absolutely recommend the Crest Pro Health® toothpaste only as a stand alone product.  </li>
            <li>I do, however, absolutely recommend the Crest Pro Health® toothpaste only as a stand alone product.  </li>
            <li>-- I felt like I&#x27;d just had a professional dental cleaning.</li>
            <li>-- I felt like I&#x27;d just had a professional dental cleaning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to brushing my teeth for the complete 2 minutes (I have an electric toothbrush)</li>
            <li>I brushed longer and could really feel the effects of the two formulas working together to get rid of plaque.</li>
            <li>I would also like to see this made in a sensitive teeth formula and then all of my concerns would be covered.  </li>
            <li>My 16 yr old daughter has braces for 2 years  now causing stains on her teeth .</li>
            <li>Then complete Step 2 for 1 minute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within 5 days</li>
            <li>/&gt;As of this writing, however, my teeth are still far from tv-commercial brilliance.  </li>
            <li>THEM SEEM NATURALLY</li>
            <li>I think the second step doesn&#x27;t really taste like anything but its a gel which has improved the whiteness of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will post again after I&#x27;ve had a week to see how much whiter my teeth actually get.</li>
            <li>I even have sensitive gums and this did not irritate me in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to BzzAgent and Crest</li>
            <li>and this is by far the easiest system to use.  </li>
            <li>After a week it seems completely natural.</li>
            <li>These last six days have been a real change for me.  </li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t for me so far.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is step 2 tasted very &amp;#34;medication like&amp;#34; to me...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take any longer to brush, but it leaves my teeth feeling so much cleaner than regular toothpaste!</li>
            <li>In my opinion it is the closest feeling of having a professional cleaning service at your dentist office.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised and completely distracted throughout the remainder of the afternoon</li>
            <li>I received everything I needed from the dentist to professionally whiten my teeth at home</li>
            <li>I expect that this toothpaste will extend the results of professional whitening.</li>
            <li>After using both of these, my teeth feel like they have had a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been a fan of whitening strips because I have sensitive teeth and gums and,</li>
            <li>Your teeth are cleaner, whiter and you don&#x27;t have to shell out so much money for white strips!</li>
            <li>for those of you who also have periodontal disease, using this treatment according to instructions (and flossing) is likely to  be very therapeutic for your gums as well.</li>
            <li>for those of you who also have periodontal disease, using this treatment according to instructions (and flossing) is likely to  be very therapeutic for your gums as well.</li>
            <li>now I do notice a considerable difference.</li>
            <li>this routine you complete</li>
            <li>After using it my gums have been sensitive.</li>
            <li>I decided to try having my adult child try the Crest Pro Health HD.  </li>
            <li>But dang were my teeth sensitive as a result.  </li>
            <li>The Crest Pro Health HD products initially seem to work very well.  </li>
            <li>my teeth definitely felt much cleaner for longer.</li>
            <li>I am a professional blogger over at [...]</li>
            <li>Didn’t like the sensitive feeling</li>
            <li>The second step left my teeth smooth like I &amp;#34;just back from the dentist&amp;#34; feel rather than a &amp;#34;just</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth you should be a bit cautious.  </li>
            <li>It also made my teeth a bit mor sensitive after a couple of uses.  </li>
            <li>like I just had a professional cleaning at the dentist.</li>
            <li>Each step asks that you brush for 1 minute with each gel, step 1 for 1 minute, directly followed by step 2 for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>I feel you should use the paste, rinse and then complete the routine with the gel.  </li>
            <li>I like the flavor of the paste, and the 2nd step gel doesn&#x27;t really have a flavor at all.</li>
            <li>and like the results I&#x27;ve seen so far, so I&#x27;m going to stick with it for a while.</li>
            <li>Do I have sensitive teeth?</li>
            <li>So I would say that this product is not recommended if you have sensitive teeth, so it is not a product for me!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised-</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised again-</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was a bit surprised at the look and feel of the packaging when it arrived</li>
            <li>I said, my teeth didn&#x27;t need a whole lot of whitening to begin with, but I have noticed that they look a bit brighter since starting this regimen.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums tend to be particularly sensitive to whitening products, so I probably won&#x27;t use it again for at least another 6-12 months to keep sensitivity at bay, but I have been quite pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a busy mom</li>
            <li>This product did not make my teeth feel sensitive.</li>
            <li>I noticed a marked difference in just one week</li>
            <li>On the off days, I use a non-fluoride natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li>or it&#x27;s just stubborn stains near my gums.  </li>
            <li>(Whitening strips do make my teeth terribly sensitive</li>
            <li>even the dentist was surprised that no cavities nor gum disease was appearing.</li>
            <li>Overall this product worked very well</li>
            <li>After receiving a free sample, I&#x27;ve been trying Crest Pro Health HD for a few weeks</li>
            <li>Overall I would highly highly recommended this product!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Sometimes, &amp;#34;two minutes&amp;#34; is probably more like 30 seconds when it&#x27;s late at night, and I&#x27;m a sleep</li>
            <li>and I felt plaque build up much quicker on my teeth throughout the day when using regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>and I felt plaque build up much quicker on my teeth throughout the day when using regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>However, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>but so far I have not noticed a change in my teeth so far in using this product.</li>
            <li>I like that 2 ingredients are marked Step 1 and 2</li>
            <li>I really like the idea of keeping it simple by just brushing your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Crest for finally making a product that works!</li>
            <li>I had been using my old toothpaste for years and never even wanted to try another one.</li>
            <li>It almost felt like I hadn&#x27;t rinsed my mouth completely.  </li>
            <li>I think the combination of left over paste residue and the improved taste of the whitening product has really helped.  </li>
            <li>You can feel the particles in action.</li>
            <li>By the third day, (I really wanted to stick with this...</li>
            <li>and my teeth have not been sensitive after using this 2 step process that takes about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>that 2 ingredients are marked Step 1 and Step 2.</li>
            <li>I did not notice a big change in \\&quot;morning breath\\&quot; but that is also not something I really think about.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was very conscientious about following the instructions faithfully.  </li>
            <li>As a busy mom of 3 young kids, I consider it an achievement to wash my face, brush my teeth, and floss on some nights.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I&#x27;m reaching for my old toothpaste.</li>
            <li>/addition I could ask for would be one that includes the possibility of having sensitive teeth protection as well.</li>
            <li>I have always switched back-and-forth when choosing toothpaste each day between some days using my whitening toothpaste and some days using my husbands sensitive toothpaste.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to worry about sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>As far as the whitening, I did take before and after photos and did notice some lightening of the teeth.</li>
            <li>If you get your teeth cleaned professionally and want to keep them cleaned then use this product otherwise</li>
            <li>I recently had the opportunity to try This product thanks to Smiley360.</li>
            <li>I recently received the opportunity to try this product thanks to BzzAgent &amp; Crest.</li>
            <li>You can see my teeth are still somewhat dingy in the tell tale corners and crevices, but overall much brighter and whiter looking.</li>
            <li>FYI it does make your teeth sensitive</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>After every brush I feel like I just left the dentist and only after one week I could already see a whiter smile.</li>
            <li>While results are likely to vary, the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step system is worth trying.  </li>
            <li>The next day I saw a big difference in my smile.</li>
            <li>so it was worth a shot but after using I don&#x27;t see a reason to spent that type of money for toothpaste baking soda</li>
            <li>My teen son, we&#x27;ll let just say morning breath is a lot more tolerable and not an issue after a few days of continued use.</li>
            <li>However, if I only use it a few times a week, I&#x27;m okay.  </li>
            <li>Only four stars because I feel that the fresh breath feeling fades faster than regular toothpaste</li>
            <li>1 tastes fresh and is similar to a regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It gives you a feeling of deep cleansing, being refreshed and a sparkling white smile.</li>
            <li>I am happier to smile wide now.  </li>
            <li>Even when taking picture, I would usually smile with my mouth closed.</li>
            <li>The extra step is only a minute &amp; for the result, well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a few friends ask how I keep my teeth so white, and I gladly recommend Crest Pro-Health HD.</li>
            <li>I am going to be purchasing this again before my vacation in a few months to make sure my teeth are as white as they can be!</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical about this product being able to produce the results promised, I did notice a difference in the brightness of my smile.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t had the patience for white strips which I tried briefly without much success.</li>
            <li>The only downside to this product is the extra time and effort that is required for the two steps, but I do think it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>so suffice it to say that I&#x27;ve tried more than a few different toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>After using the Crest Pro Health HD system for a few weeks, I can safely say that my teeth and mouth do feel cleaner than regular toothpaste and for longer.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the extra money or the extra step that is required.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a lot of different brands and types of toothpastes over the last few years and tried to keep as good care of my teeth as possible.</li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s just enough to leave my mouth feeling fresh and just brushed after I finish brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This system works much more slowly</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical about the claims of &amp;#34;whiter teeth in just one week.&amp;#34; Surprisingly, this product lives up to the hype.</li>
            <li>If budget is an issue (or this product is as expensive as the boxed packaging suggests), it might be a good alternative.</li>
            <li>flavor is good and isnt too minty and the gel isnt like some gels where they have a weird after taste.</li>
            <li>After the first step my mouth would feel a little dry but once finishing the second step I was able to rinse and refresh things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would have occasional bleeding with flossing and one tooth in particular that felt very sensitive when I flossed it.</li>
            <li>I did not get the squeaky clean and smooth feeling like other Crest toothpaste I used in the past.</li>
            <li>I would not normally purchase this product as I&#x27;m very particular about my dental hygene and following a pretty strick cleaning process.</li>
            <li>For the past several weeks, I have been trying the new crest Pro Health HD toothpaste thanks to crest for sending me a free sample of this product.</li>
            <li>However upon further inspection, the fine print states &amp;#34;than other leading brands&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>My teeth are noticeably whiter (like I used a bleaching tray but without the weird spots) and they feel super clean!  </li>
            <li>only complaint would be the flavor - it is a strong wintergreen sort of flavor, which might be perfect for some but as someone who prefers a natural peppermint oil taste, seems very fake to me.</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical at first (as I am with most new products I try).</li>
            <li>I noticed a cleaner feeling right away and a definite whiter smile in a few days.</li>
            <li>While I only noticed a slight difference in the whiteness of my teeth, my mouth felt healthier and this toothpaste had a great taste that lasted longer than usual.  </li>
            <li>have only been using 1 time a day (at night) and I have experienced no tooth sensitivity in the past week and a half.</li>
            <li>The instructions say to use the whitening gel right after the toothpaste, so if you don&#x27;t ration out the whitening gel correctly you&#x27;ll be left with extra toothpaste once you run out of whitening gel.</li>
            <li>Also, I have very sensitive and have never been able to use whiting strips or other products without stopping due to the pain.  </li>
            <li>As for the second step, I like it a little less because its taste is not as pleasant.</li>
            <li>With that potential con eliminated from the picture, I can only say positive things about this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>My teeth have definitely become whiter and the stains are becoming less noticeable.</li>
            <li>How lucky was I to get this opportunity with Crest after such a long year, I had to take advantage.  </li>
            <li>It has a small flavor of the typical whitening gels, but the flavor is also good.</li>
            <li>I was very nervous at first to try Crest Pro Health HD because previously I had used the Pro Health mouth rinse and it stained my teeth.</li>
            <li>I had some mild staining from the braces that I had as a teen long ago.  </li>
            <li>There are a lot of reasons to love this product, but the immediate gratification of no more morning breath is forefront in my mind!  </li>
            <li>- it is more medicinal/typical of other whitening products I have used, such as Crest White Strips -</li>
            <li>Something that simple to do that provides similar results to other products out there that involve much more time</li>
            <li>I have been hesitant about in office treatments and whitening strips because I feared it would not respond well to whitening (and potentially just stand out more), but this product gives me hope for further improvement because it has already brought it shades closer to the whiteness of my other teeth.</li>
            <li>It took a little getting used to a two-step process, but it was so worth it!</li>
            <li>This is certainly a good way to go about making your smile whiter and look cleaner compared to other expensive</li>
            <li>It is more expensive than regular toothpaste, but definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>It had a lot of foam which I personally like and will be replacing my normal Sensodyne with this product!</li>
            <li>(I have 3 young kids, so I sometimes feel lucky to manage the basics of personal hygiene), and the whole slight fizzing issue...  </li>
            <li>(I have 3 young kids, so I sometimes feel lucky to manage the basics of personal hygiene), and the whole slight fizzing issue...  </li>
            <li>and I was able to see difference in my teeth from Yellow to a very light yellow (but not super white like few others has posted).</li>
            <li>If you are looking for perceptible whiteness and your teeth are not very stained, this is probably not the right product.</li>
            <li>I used it right away, and put it in the center of the bathroom counter and encouraged my husband to try it too.</li>
            <li>I noticed some slight whitening the first few weeks but nothing very significant.  </li>
            <li>The whole process only takes two minutes total, and you don&#x27;t need to use very much of each product when compared to regular toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I had the chance to sample Crest Pro Health HD for free, I figured it would be about the same as all of the other whitening products out there.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my teeth, but I did notice that my mouth was extremely dry.</li>
            <li>is that it feels pretty dry, but after rinsing with water and mouthwash it goes</li>
            <li>I am a 39 year old mom with braces due to and accident and tend to hide my smile.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I usually share 1 tube of toothpaste in the master bathroom, and I feel like this would be gone very quickly if two people used it.  </li>
            <li>After step 1, it left my mouth feeling kind of dry and slightly sandy or grimy.</li>
            <li>I suppose for people who regularly use whitening products, it is probably easier and faster than whitening strips or other treatments that are available.</li>
            <li>The paste in step 1 leaves your mouth feeling dry but not uncomfortable.</li>

            <li>The two step process may be a little off-putting at first, and I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that it&#x27;s easy to forget not to rinse my mouth after step 1 when I am tired and getting ready for bed on autopilot, but the product works.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste that you use in step one has a very familiar feel to it, however the second step polish is different and took some getting used to due to the feel of the gel sitting on your teeth.</li>
            <li>Now I consider my teeth to be a pretty average white/off-white (however you consider it), so I didn&#x27;t need a major whitening, but I feel like I didn&#x27;t really see any whitening at all.  </li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t like the taste of traditional anti-sensitivity toothpastes, but more on taste of this toothpaste in a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>All in all, this product is inconvenient to use, and wasn&#x27;t very effective.</li>
            <li>so I have sampled a wide variety of toothpastes and I can honestly say this is the only toothpaste I have used that holds up to promises of long lasting freshness.</li>
            <li>I used to have very sensitive teeth and typically used sensitive toothpaste, but this works much better than Sensodyne or any other sensitive toothpaste I have used.</li>
            <li>but I did feel that my teeth were a little whiter and felt clean.</li>
            <li>teeth feel &amp;#34;fresh from the dentist&amp;#34; clean and a little whiter.</li>
            <li>It is a blue gel that I found was most similar to conventional toothpaste that I was used to.  </li>
            <li>It made my mouth super dry although this doesn&#x27;t last long&lt;</li>
            <li>I think that the whitening part of it might be slightly too strong for my mouth for regular use.  </li>
            <li>The first paste in the set didnt really provide the minty clean feeling that I expect from a toothpaste, and the second paste that you use is more like the peroxide toothpastes on the market, and left a bad aftertaste.  </li>
            <li>Squeeze a lot of toothpaste, also feel of the brush is not very good, after brushing the first branch and teeth feel very strange very afflictive, the second also need many squeeze enough, but have not seen the so-called whitening effect.</li>
            <li>The first step cleans your teeth, and you can really feel that every little piece of plaque is gone.</li>
            <li>The second tube, that you use immediately after brushing with the first, contains a clear gel meant to do the actual whitening.</li>
            <li>The second tube, that you use immediately after brushing with the first, contains a clear gel meant to do the actual whitening.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health Daily Two-Step Toothpaste has shown great results for me over the past few months.</li>
            <li>At first I was skeptical - will this be better than all of the other whitening toothpastes out there, and will my mouth really feel much cleaner?  </li>
            <li>No mess and no lengthy process.</li>
            <li>Also I find it difficult to take the cap off of step 2 and screw it back on while I have a mouth full of toothpaste, the cap could be a bit easier if it was a flip top or something.&lt;br</li>
            <li>To avoid confusion of which bottle to use first, not only were the tubes in different colors, but they are marked as &amp;#34;STEP 1&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;STEP 2&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention the fact that the second step of the process tastes kind of gross and not refreshing like toothpaste should be.</li>
            <li>I have to say there are a few unique things about it</li>
            <li>There were no strips or mouth guards to wear and there was absolutely no mess.</li>
            <li>packaging of the Crest Pro Health HD seemed to be environmentally friendly with green recycled cardboard packaging.</li>
            <li>Just be aware that you may have unwanted side effects, such as white spots on your gums and sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>My teeth were already pretty white because of regular professional whitening treatments</li>
            <li>There were no strips to use and not mess.  </li>
            <li>I understand that having 2 steps is how the magic works, but after a long day, the last thing I have mental energy for is toothpaste.</li>
            <li>You use each tube for only 1 minute each so it really wasn&#x27;t any different than my normal routine.  </li>
            <li>and it really isn&#x27;t any more difficult than a normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The two step process takes a little bit longer than my normal routine, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I definitely had my doubts about how effective a whitening toothpaste could be, having tried other similar products in the past without much success.</li>
            <li>The flavor is pleasant, the process is simple and it&#x27;s really a matter of just switching out from regular toothpaste with no need for teeth guards or anything complicated.</li>
            <li>The taste wasn&#x27;t to bad and the whitening effects were pretty good.  </li>
            <li>The benefits of the two part system are that I definitely have a clean white smile and less sensitivity than I did using the 3D white product, however, I have not seen it reduce or eliminate my morning breath.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels clean, and my teeth do appear to be a bit whiter after a few weeks use.  </li>
            <li>It makes your teeth feel clean and whiter after a few uses.</li>
            <li>Most whitening toothpastes just keep your teeth from getting less white, while this stuff actually makes my teeth sparkling</li>
            <li>In the beginning, I was skeptical, as I had used whitening strips before that had left me less than impressed.  </li>
            <li>While I do think that the added clean feeling to my teeth and a subtle whitening effect may be worth it, it would be the one block towards regularly purchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that the added clean feeling to my teeth and a subtle whitening effect may be worth it, it would be the one block towards regularly purchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has that sort of gritty toothpaste texture, but in a refreshingly decent tasting way.</li>
            <li>My teeth seem to be slightly (not a lot) whiter</li>
            <li>I also have experienced pain in my gums, as if I had just taken a long flight (anyone travel and know that uncomfortable feeling?).</li>
            <li>Almost a gritty feeling to the first paste that you use prior to using the whitening gel.</li>
            <li>The first step is actually cleaning your teeth and preparing them for the 2nd step, which is the Whitening.  </li>
            <li>It was weird at first not being able to rinse after using the toothpaste but before using the polisher....</li>
            <li>First tube feels like regular toothpaste then without rinsing your brush or mouth switch to the second tube for the whitening and brush with that for a minute.  </li>
            <li>I actually enjoying using this two-step process because it feels like I&#x27;m making a difference with my teeth based on the small amount of extra effort that I&#x27;m putting in to brushing.</li>
            <li>I have pretty white teeth to start with, but I do drink diet soda and red wine.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first because I wasn&#x27;t sure about using a two step brushing process.</li>
            <li>I explained that you brush one minute with the first, spit but don&#x27;t rinse, then brush a second minute with the second step.</li>
            <li>The 2 step process is not any more cumbersome than the usual two minutes of time it takes to brush your teeth daily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The first I used as a traditional paste and brushed with it for one minute.</li>
            <li>The first step does have a different feel and taste but the second step takes that all away.</li>
            <li>My teeth are a bit whiter (pretty stained from coffee and medications over the last 50+ years), but I&#x27;m only using it once a day, not the prescribed 2x per day.</li>
            <li>After the first week of regular brushing, twice a day, a lot of people started noticing how white my teeth</li>
            <li>You have to use the first step for one minute and then spit but don&#x27;t rinse and then use the second for the next minute.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I would recommend this product on a regular basis but I think to have even whiter teeth another product could be used first.  </li>
            <li>toothpaste definitely works, my teeth feel cleaner and whiter after only the first week of use.  </li>
            <li>The first is the regular paste and the second is whitening paste.</li>
            <li>first use, your mouth definitely feels different.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny and is lasting a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny and is lasting a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed this past week that my teeth are starting to shine more and the stains are diminishing.</li>
            <li>I have used different whiting products in the past, but was not as pleased as I had hoped I would be.</li>
            <li>This paste has a similar taste and even the same result after a first use, but none of those side effects.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t drink coffee or smoke, I have some moderate yellowing particularly on my canine teeth.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to use it for all that long and had to discontinue use after a few days becAuse of increased sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>I felt different from the first brush and within 2 weeks i could notice the longer lasting freshness, cleanliness was noticeable.</li>
            <li>It leaves my breathe fresh for a really long time and my teeth have definitely gotten whiter.</li>
            <li>I could barely taste the peroxide, so I had to wonder if it would actually whiten my teeth much.</li>
            <li>I used a toothpaste where the main ingredient was baking soda, prior to this.</li>
            <li>I am able to achieve that &#x27;just left the dentist&#x27; feeling everyday!</li>
            <li>Step 2 is a thin gel (not thick &amp; pasty like most gel toothpastes) that leaves the bristles squeaking over my teeth by the end of the minute you spend on Step 2.</li>
            <li>The first use I was unsure on the texture and sensations of step 1 because it left my mouth feeling different.  </li>
            <li>This is the first whitening product that actually turned my gums white.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using the product now for the past 8 days, I can say that my teeth are definitely whiter than they were (and would probably be even better if I didn&#x27;t drink coffee everyday).&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I could tell a big difference between this and regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I agree It is a little more expensive than regular toothpaste with whitener, but the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>The first paste leaves my mouth feeling very dry</li>
            <li>The first time you try Crest Pro Health® HD™ and that is that it leaves my mouth feeling very dry and that you want to grab a glass of water</li>
            <li>it is a remarkable option to the other pastes out there that have left icky grit in my mouth or even gave me sores on my tongue.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(My teeth are not extremely discolored and naturally towards the whiter end of the chart.)&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li>I was also a little put off by the prospect of using two separate products, each for a full minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and also because the step two perfecting gel tastes a little too sweet for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first I thought the two step-process was going to be hard get used to, but after a few days, it was very easy.  </li>
            <li>Compared to other brands it&#x27;s right on target.</li>
            <li>While I did notice whiter teeth without having to use the white strips (a huge plus), I found myself straying away from cold items and sweeter items as well because my teeth were suddenly much more sensitive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this product has multiple benefits: it from a brand that I trust, it&#x27;s a high quality/dental quality toothpaste, and it provides the added benefit of whitening your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Crest has set the bar high enough where others can&#x27;t compete.</li>
            <li>I would definitely purchase again and highly recommend this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and will be adding it to my regular purchase list.</li>
            <li>I also think the cost is a bit high and think that will keep me and others from purchasing it or using this regularly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s helping with whitening my teeth really, but the clean feeling is enough to keep me using it.</li>
            <li>I was not in the market for a new toothpaste at all, but I&#x27;m am completely and totally sold.  </li>
            <li>I always thought tooth whitening would make my teeth extra sensitive, so I never did it, but this doesn&#x27;t bother my teeth at all!!</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and only took a few minutes.</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for is the strong after taste it left in my mouth, but I talked with other people who used Crest Pro Health HD and they didn&#x27;t have this problem so it could just be me.</li>
            <li>however, I traveled for a couple days and used whatever I had in a TSA-friendly little tube, and when I came home and went back to the HD, all was fine.  </li>
            <li>just a few days, my teeth had less of a dingy yellow tone, and really have a nice natural white glow to them.</li>
            <li>and I have mixed feelings but definitely will give it a positive review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For a short, 2 minute process this is simple and has positive effects.</li>
            <li>started seeing results in whiter teeth after just a few days use, and a week in my teeth feel very clean all day long.  </li>
            <li>Your teeth feel great after, and neither of the pastes/gels are unpleasant tasting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not unbearably unpleasant, but I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>This can&#x27;t be a bad thing as brushing longer is probably better for you, but not so great if you&#x27;re running late.</li>
            <li>I did not notice a huge difference from what I usually feel when I am done brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this product because I generally use whitening products a few times per year to brighten and whiten my teeth.  </li>
            <li>You also don&#x27;t have to mess with brushing product on like nail polish or holding a blue light to your teeth</li>
            <li>Generally a smoother feel after I complete the process</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually a Mentadent girl, but I was given a package of Crest Pro-Health HD for free from Crest to try, so I went for it.</li>
            <li>you know, that slick, smooth feeling you get when you run your tongue over your teeth.</li>
            <li>I am usually someone who just buys whatever toothpaste is on sale, but when I received and offer to try a free sample of this one, my wife convinced me to try it.  </li>
            <li>so I couldn&#x27;t do the whole system anymore, not nearly the whitening I was hoping for</li>
            <li>But those are pricey and don&#x27;t fit in my usually routine.</li>
            <li>But those are pricey and don&#x27;t fit in my usually routine.</li>
            <li>This Crest Pro-health HD really provide supreior cleansing experience which deserve my purchasing it a long way from China</li>
            <li>I have been using the Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste for the past week as part of the bzz campaign, where Crest provided a free product for me to use.  </li>
            <li>but really, it&#x27;s two minutes (that isn&#x27;t that long)</li>
            <li>I am a mother of three young children and I barely have time to brush my teeth twice a day</li>
            <li>I am not sure what price point this product will be because I was given this free to review</li>
            <li>I know that makes me sound incredibly lazy, but it is the truth.</li>
            <li>I used it for about 10 days and saw pretty minimal whitening.</li>
            <li>Step 1 (the cleanser) feels different from the normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I normally scrub my tongue at the end of the two minutes, but the whitening gel (obviously) isn&#x27;t meant for the tongue.  </li>
            <li>When I first received my package, I was curious.  </li>
            <li>A very simple substitution for your normal brushing routine, and you&#x27;re on your way to a whiter brighter future.dentist cleaning)</li>
            <li>I ended up using my normal toothpaste I use on a daily basis and then also step 2.  </li>
            <li>When adding the second step, the gel, it begins to feel a bit normal again.  </li>
            <li>being that the process is a 2 part brushing system, i was worried it might be kind of a pain, but it&#x27;s not at all - the hardest part about using this system is remembering not to wet the toothbrush before starting or inbetween steps 1 and 2 - after a few days, it wasn&#x27;t an issue at all.  </li>
            <li>One, it gets me to brush my teeth for the 2 minutes, like the dentist recommends and secondly, my teeth did not feel the whitening aspect which normally hurts my teeth.</li>
            <li>first I thought it would be a hassle of incorporate a two step process for brushing my teeth, but it&#x27;s really not that</li>
            <li>The cleaning paste is applied and you simple brush your teeth as normal for a minute.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Compared to my normal toothpaste I&#x27;m not noticing a big difference</li>
            <li>I only use Crest Pro Health HD once a day, at night, and I stick to my normal toothpaste routine in the morning because it did cause some sensitivity with my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I normally use the Colgate Optic White toothpaste but got this via BzzAgent (Thank you!)</li>
            <li>In fact, I noticed while on vacation and using just normal toothpaste that I didn&#x27;t feel that my teeth were as white as they had been.</li>
            <li>Especially as a major coffee drinker, I wasn&#x27;t expecting to see the same result, but I have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>This though, is just 2 tubes of toothpaste that you apply to all of your teeth the same way you would normally brush your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I normally use the Kirkland (Costco) version of Crest Pro-health and brush and floss twice daily</li>
            <li>Smaller size than normal toothpaste tube</li>
            <li>I am glad that I got this product for free because I would have otherwise been annoyed at the waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 2 steps take no longer than my normal brushing routine, but definitely feels like I gave my mouth a minty power-wash.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally have an issue with sensitivity but this tooth paste definitely gave me issues.  </li>
            <li>To my surprise it didn’t take any longer that normal brushing took, just it had an extra step in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to make for the other benefits this product offers.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smile big enough for anyone to see any further than that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Could I get the same result just brushing my teeth twice with normal toothpaste?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received a full size kit in the mail a few weeks ago and immediately began using the products.  </li>
            <li>Overall though, I did feel like my teeth were clean after using the product, but I&#x27;m not sure the extra cost is justified by the limited additional benefits.</li>
            <li>I started to notice a change right away and over the time I&#x27;ve used it thus far (about a week and a half)</li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of the \\&quot;feel,\\&quot; the first step does feel a bit drying to the mouth, but the taste is a subtle mint not unlike many other toothpastes.</li>
            <li>The step two tastes a little funky, but I quickly got over that.</li>
            <li>This two part system is a little more inconvenient than normal toothpaste, but probably better than whitening trays.  </li>
            <li>two part system is a little more inconvenient than normal toothpaste, but probably better than whitening trays.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not rough on teeth or anything, just a little more gritty than your regular toothpaste might be, again just in a way that preps your teeth for the whitening gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The tubes are labeled with a large 1 and 2, and are different colors - one silver and one blue-</li>
            <li>I have a couple of sensitive teeth, so have recently tried sensitive tooth toothpaste to see if it helps and have had some luck with a couple of different brands, but never had any that also help with whitening or that give enough multiple benefits to be worth it.</li>
            <li>a thumbs up!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It is so easy to use and hardly changes your brushing routine.</li>
            <li>I suppose I should have been a little more careful</li>
            <li>The first step is a thick paste, and you can tell there is more involved with it than your typical gel paste.  </li>
            <li>The first toothpaste has a similar texture as any other and leaves a smooth, fresh feeling behind.  </li>
            <li>It is a little thick, but the flavor is good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I am (perhaps more than slightly) neurotic about using new products on/in my body, I did a little bit of research before trying this out.  </li>
            <li>This is an expensive product, but compared to facial care, it&#x27;s even more important for the long term.  </li>
            <li>I felt like the system was pretty abrasive on my teeth, so I switched back to my regular toothpaste for a few days, and the sensitivity cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;I would use this for a &#x27;refresher&#x27; for my smile, but</li>
            <li>Secondly, and this one is kind of random, as mentioned, you follow the first step immediately with the second step with no rinsing in between.  </li>
            <li>After the second use, on the first day, I had to rinse with warm water, because my teeth were sensitive to cold.</li>
            <li>I would however say that if you&#x27;re looking for a product to try, this one is significantly easier and less time consuming to use than white strips!rips!</li>
            <li>This part is hard to write anything about, because taste is one of the most personal things out there.  </li>
            <li>This part is hard to write anything about, because taste is one of the most personal things out there.  </li>
            <li>The first thing anyone will notice is that the Crest Pro Health HD is actually two tubes, one which has the cleaning paste (which is basically like normal toothpaste) and the other which is a polishing paste.</li>
            <li>but it takes as long as I would normally brush!  </li>
            <li>My gums got a little sensitive during the first few days of use, but it quickly went away, and it is was not nearly as bad as my gums typically hurt with whitening products.</li>
            <li>I only give this four stars, though, because as a new mom</li>
            <li>I think we have a new regular toothpaste!</li>
            <li>Believe it or not Crest Pro Health HD actually whitens my teeth with their new two step whitening process.</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase this product as my new, regular use toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then BzzAgent sent me a new product - Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste System.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am fairly critical when it comes to new products.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the only new thing that&#x27;s happening to my teeth</li>
            <li>I started to notice a difference after just 4 days, and after a week my teeth were definitely a new pearlier white.</li>
            <li>But overall the product is my new go to toothpaste and whitener.</li>
            <li>Every time I try a new whitening product, I forget to use it because it takes extra steps and time.  </li>
            <li>I had my doubts because I have tried a lot of different at home whitening products and nothing compares to the new crest pro health kit.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 3 weeks daily with my new Phillips a Electric diamond toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This will definitely be our family&#x27;s new go-to toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Now, two weeks later, I feel that I have found my new</li>
            <li>It is like getting them back to brand new when all the plaque is stripped away.</li>
            <li>As a BzzAgent I get to try new products occasionally as part of a promotion for the brand, and this was one of the products that was sent to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying the new Crest Pro-Health HD toothpaste and am starting to notice a difference.</li>
            <li>only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 out of 5 stars is because the whitening aspect of this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t live up to the 6X as advertised.</li>
            <li>I received the new Crest Pro- Health HD Daily Two Step Toothpaste through a BzzAgent campaign.  </li>
            <li>My husband had some big stains on his front teeth for years and after 2 weeks you could hardly notice them and now after 4 weeks they are pretty much gone!!</li>
            <li>It really does not take very long to do each day, literally four minutes per day, two minutes each time.</li>
            <li>I was at first a little bit skeptical to switch and try something new because I thought how much better can this new Crest HD really be compared to the regular toothpaste?  </li>
            <li>They either only focus on whitening and your teeth don&#x27;t feel so clean or they are so harsh that they leave your teeth so sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if my teeth are so much cleaner because of the long brush time, or the product, but I like how clean it makes my teeth feel.  </li>
            <li>First I was slightly worried about using a two step process as I&#x27;ve been brushing my teeth the same way for 30 years, after the first couple of times it has become my only toothpaste, to the point where my wife is now using it also</li>
            <li>I am very conscience of how white my teeth are since I drink a lot of coffee and sometimes red wine both of which cause my teeth to be stained.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it to get whiter teeth that get slightly darkened from coffee.</li>
            <li>I drink coffee daily and had a few light stains.  </li>
            <li>Once you use Crest Pro Health HD, you only really need it once then you can continue using regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Not super fresh, but no morning breath...which is cray cray.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I still like to use a whitening toothpaste for maintenance when I&#x27;m not actively whitening my teeth with the dentist&#x27;s system and</li>
            <li>I have to say that I would never have thought any toothpaste product out there would be that different than the others (at least among the national, reputable brands).</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think it would be much different because I see him every day but seeing the difference after one week - oh yes, big difference.  </li>
            <li>I think it is necessary to have the second step because the hydrogen peroxide can stay by itself and not react with anything else until you are ready for it to do its job.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure how healthy this is in the long run though.</li>
            <li>are that it&#x27;s much faster, only 2 minutes in the morning and 2 minutes in the evening, plus you can whiten your entire mouth, not just the front teeth where the strips are applied.</li>
            <li>Step 1 is a bit strange the first time i used it because of the gritty texture, but you get used to it  after a while.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are pretty white to start with, just minor coffee stains...</li>
            <li>I didn’t like having to stop brushing, open a second tube and start the whole process again.  </li>
            <li>My breath isn&#x27;t as fresh as it is with my previous toothpaste</li>
            <li>So after a week, I noticed a slightly brighter smile.</li>
            <li>Add in the fact that the whole process only takes 2 minutes and you&#x27;ve got a product that people will actually use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The first paste also has a strange gritty texture, but I got used to that.</li>
            <li>My first experience with this product was pretty negative.</li>
            <li>It really did not take much extra time and after a week I definitely noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li>I didnt really like this toothpaste and will be going back to my regular Crest Pro Health toothpaste.</li>
            <li>In conclusion, if Crest Pro Health® HD can really decrease sensitivity, and increase the whiteness of my teeth with such a simple system, I am sold.</li>
            <li>In conclusion, if Crest Pro Health® HD can really decrease sensitivity, and increase the whiteness of my teeth with such a simple system, I am sold.</li>
            <li>I do wish both tubes had a flip top cap, not just the toothpaste, but that is my only complaint.</li>
            <li>At first it seemed like the 2 tubes would take twice as long, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>toothpaste was more liquid than other toothpastes, so this made brushing a mess.</li>
            <li>did notice a slightly brighter smile at the end of the week.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>The Crest Pro Health® HD is just  2 minutes a day and will quickly become a part of your everyday</li>
            <li>The best part is I didn&#x27;t even have to use strips or trays (which I hate using, but are the only things that ever seem to work).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and doesn&#x27;t spread easily when I go in to brush.</li>
            <li>I do keep using my old crest with whitening single tube of toothpaste and have to make a conscious effort to remember to use my new product.</li>
            <li>They look and feel extremely clean, and I think a little whiter!</li>
            <li>I also noticed that my teeth seemed a little sensitive right after brushing, but this eventually went away.</li>
            <li>I would have liked the product to have a little bit of a more \\&quot;minty\\&quot; flavor, but it was not an unpleasant taste, and this would not deter me from using it.</li>
            <li>He gets major plaque build up between dentist appointments, we started this regime prior to the last visit and it really helped to reduce it.  </li>
            <li>The process may seem a little strange but it is really easy.  </li>
            <li>The toothpaste squirts easily, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>This has caused my gums to be very sensitive and my teeth to be very yellow.</li>
            <li>I have to say I was very surprised how polished my teeth felt after the second step.  </li>
            <li>only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that this paste made my teeth very sensitive.</li>
            <li>and the same problem always seemed to occur, they made my teeth VERY sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I would have stopped using this after the second day if I didn&#x27;t feel like it was actually protecting my teeth a little better than just using regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>However,  I was excited to use the product and it did not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1: It feels like a traditional toothpaste although it felt a little tart.  </li>
            <li>The whitening aspect works about as well as any other whitening toothpaste, though it does taste a little more like whitening gel (just Step 2).  </li>
            <li>The major issue I have with this product is the time investment.  </li>
            <li>first step toothpaste, the cleaning one, was like any other toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I had some gum bleeding the first time due to that.</li>
            <li>I have receeding gums which leaves my the teeth area at the gumline exposed and causing major sensitivity with hot/cold products.</li>
            <li>Certainly no other person mentioned a difference in my teeth color.  </li>
            <li>and I have noticed a major difference.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not am major concern to me as my teeth don&#x27;t need major whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can see a significant difference in my teeth and there is the added bonus that it freshens my breath and makes my teeth healthier by destroying plaque!  </li>
            <li>No other flavors</li>
            <li>I am a major coffee drinker, and even that didn&#x27;t hinder performance.</li>
            <li>, you simply throw away your old toothpaste and replace it with Crest Pro Health HD, you brush your teeth twice a day for two minutes, using step one and step two!  </li>
            <li>Second, you teeth can be sensitive after brushing, so no drinking water for about 15 minutes after your brush!  </li>
            <li>However, after 3 days of using it morning &amp; night, I noticed a major difference in my teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had the patience to consistently use any other whitening system.  </li>
            <li>healthier.&lt;br /&gt;However the one major drawback for me is the polish taste.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical, but I love the way it makes my teeth feel!</li>
            <li>I have tried several different brands of whitening toothpaste but this is the first one to actually work.  </li>
            <li>The first step tastes like any other toothpaste while Step 2 is full-on hydrogen peroxide smell.</li>
            <li>No other issues with use.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that my teeth became more sensitive to heat and cold, so I had to tread gingerly when having something too hot or too</li>
            <li>Because of this thin material, there&#x27;s a lot more toothpaste in the tube than what you would normally come to expect from a regular tube of toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>If anything, I started to like it because it forced me to be more conscious about how long I was brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>If you are dying for a product that will get rid of your stinky breath when you wake up, then this product may be a disappointment, but if you are just looking for a clean, healthy and white smile, then you will not be let down!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has now been a month, and I&#x27;ve found that the routine of simply brushing for one extra minute with the second tube of paste was quite easy compared to the other methods of having to use a mouth tray, or strips.</li>
            <li>It does take a little extra time to brush each day, but the time and process is SO simple and easy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The first step left my mouth seeming really dry.</li>
            <li>At first, it seemed potentially tedious with two steps, but as soon as we used it, we realized how easy it was.</li>
            <li>The first tube leaves my mouth dry and gritty</li>
            <li>The first agent tastes like wint-o-green lifesavers, and left my mouth feeling dry.  </li>
            <li>that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1 is a purifying cleanser, and it is a much more abrasive formula than your average, slightly chalky toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I have never felt as passionately about a new product ever!</li>
            <li>At first I was skeptical about what benefits the two step system would offer, but after just the first use I realized the second step was worth it.  </li>
            <li>Right when I thought this wasn&#x27;t working either I noticed a slight change.</li>
            <li>I drink tea everyday, so my teeth is a little yellowish and I was pretty excited when I got the package.</li>
            <li>I actually count down 60 seconds to make sure I&#x27;m brushing long enough.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think I would like this product because my teeth tend to be sensitive to other whitening products I have used.</li>
            <li>Once you get used to it, it feels clean and no more</li>
            <li>The 2-step process will clean then whiten your teeth after just a few usese!</li>
            <li>first tubes active ingredients are Stannous Fluoride 0.454%.  </li>
            <li>first tubes active ingredients are Stannous Fluoride 0.454%.</li>
            <li>The product really gets your mouth clean, however, I am skeptical if the aggressive cleaning power is realistic for every day use.</li>
            <li>Other than that, my mouth feels fresh after brushing and not gritty.</li>
            <li>The first step makes your mouth feel a bit dry and after the second step my teeth are sensitive when I rinse (similar to whitening strips).</li>
            <li>he toothpaste take a little getting used to, as does the idea of brushing twice, but the outcome is worth it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While it does take a little longer to use the 2 step process, the added effort is well worth it.</li>
            <li>Have you ever left the dentist office wishing your teeth could feel that clean everyday.</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for an enhancement to their everyday brushing, and to keep their teeth clean in between dental visits.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to try this HD system as part of a promotional subject from Crest through BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I noticed that one of the main ingredients is hydrogen peroxide, so it seems feasible that you may get similar results by rinsing regularly with that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, the Rembrandt strips DID have some slight effect, but far from Hollywood tooth-whiteness, and those whitening strips, at only about 2 1/2&amp;#34; long, left more than just the back teeth unaffected.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using the first step, your mouth is left very dry and watering.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the mint flavor or step on and it really isn&#x27;t hard to add in the process of step two.</li>
            <li>I was a little adamant at first before receiving this product through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>I know that the price is high for toothpaste, but low if you consider the cost of white strips and toothpaste.</li>
            <li>At first i thought it would be like usual toothpaste with high claims</li>
            <li>Only potential downside is the two-step process, sometimes even the 2 minutes seems lengthy when I&#x27;m running late to work in the morning, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for a fantastic smile!!</li>
            <li>Also, my teeth were definitely noticeably whiter after about a week or so - definitely more noticeable than with other whitening toothpastes but with a lot less hassle than using things like whitening strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to say how much whitening it has done for me, as my teeth are fairly white to begin with, but I do feel as if my smile is &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34;, if that makes any sense.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m with the other positive reviewers on this stuff.</li>
            <li>I was happy that it didn&#x27;t taste bad.</li>
            <li>Also, I cannot use any mouthwash after brushing (which is a huge negative for me) because the sensitivity is killer.  </li>
            <li>I know my teeth are cleaner in general.  </li>
            <li>I generally use a whitening toothpaste</li>
            <li>I in general feel cleaner with this product.</li>
            <li>My bleeding gums have drastically improved along with the general feel of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received this free from Crest, though, and decided to at least give it a try.</li>
            <li>After a minute, and without rinsing, I brushed again for another minute with the “perfecting gel,” a clear gel polish.</li>
            <li>People noticed I was smiling a lot more and showing off my teeth which I&#x27;m normally too shy to do.</li>
            <li>So, in sum, it definitely whitens your teeth, but if you get canker sores in your mouth, maybe steer clear.</li>
            <li>The second tube has a clear gel that has peroxide as one of its ingredients, and you see the bubblies on your teeth and between the teeth as you brush.</li>
            <li>The second step is a clear paste that helps whiten and polish the teeth, and when I&#x27;m brushing with this paste it feels like it&#x27;s doing what it needs to do.</li>
            <li>The 2 part process includes clearly labeled tubes, you use step one for a solid minute, that cleans your teeth and strips stains while leaving your enamel intact, then step two whitens and polishes your teeth.</li>
            <li>I read the instructions and it clearly said to use step one for 1 minute and step 2 for the same.</li>
            <li>I feel that in a hurry to pack for a vacation and only grab one of the tubes, thus leaving me with only a half clean mouth.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really take much longer than usual to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li>The second tube has a clear gel that has peroxide as one of its ingredients, and you see the bubblies on your teeth and between the teeth as you brush.  </li>
            <li>Step 2 is a clear polish to help whiten your teeth to be added to your toothbrush for the 2nd minute of brushing (without rinsing in between).</li>
            <li>The only one minor caution I would have is that it does not leave your breath very minty.  </li>
            <li>The next step involves adding the clear perfecting gel to your toothbrush, and brushing for another minute or so to polish and whiten.</li>
            <li>It is clearly written on the package and tubes are made differently which eliminates any confusion.&lt;br /&gt;2.)</li>
            <li>Definitely makes your teeth feel cleaner, and there is a noticeable difference as far as whitening.</li>
            <li>Step 2: a barely noticeable taste, somewhat like baking soda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only issue is that my teeth and gums are rather sensitive and this irritated them after about four days of continuous use.</li>
            <li>but once I realized that each step requires only 1 minute and no rinse in between, my mind was at ease because my old routine took 2 minutes-</li>
            <li>On several occasions, I used Aquafresh ExtremeClean Whitening Action for a minute or so immediately BEFORE using the Crest HD and the difference is like night and day.</li>
            <li>The two tubes lasted much longer than I expected.</li>
            <li>The second step, the whitening gel, made my teeth and gums sensitive</li>
            <li>I personally wouldn&#x27;t spend the nearly $13 for this product.</li>
            <li>The one draw back is how sensitive my teeth are to this formula.  </li>
            <li>I know I have extra sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>would say that I won&#x27;t purchase this every time I buy toothpaste, but I probably will use it every other time to keep my teeth extra white and my mouth extra fresh!</li>
            <li>I feel as though I shouldn&#x27;t expect results this early (after only a week of use), though.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed that, since I have sensitive teeth, that the toothpaste is starting to irritate them.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say they were to the level of professionally whitened, but a definite improvement.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-The 2 step process is starting to get old -- I use an electronic tooth brush</li>
            <li>There is a plus with step 2, you don&#x27;t experience the foam action that you would with regular hydrogen peroxide, however I will probably stick to my cheaper alternative of just buying the $2 bottle of hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li>have made my teeth extra sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have received numerous comments from friends and family already asking if I got my teeth professionally whitened.</li>
            <li>I can turn it off early, but I would feel like I wasn&#x27;t cleaning my teeth properly.  </li>
            <li>The white spots one is warned of on the label on gums and soft tissue</li>
            <li>I had braces which ruined my enamel and white strips and all that make my teeth sensitive but not this stuff.</li>
            <li>The whitening really works with no real hassle.</li>
            <li>I have always used a sensitive tooth product without all those added goodies, now I can have all the extra benefits.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was at the dentist in January and had some early gingivitis following pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I felt like I just left the dentist chair after a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>I think it will get old using two different products each time I brush my teeth.</li>
            <li>I barely notice a difference.</li>
            <li>The only issue I had was sensitive teeth with the product.</li>
            <li>I used white strips, whitening mouth wash, toothpastes, and even some natural remedies and all of those do not compare to this product.</li>
            <li>The packaging reccomends getting a professional cleaning prior to</li>
            <li>so I was surprised to see actual results.)</li>
            <li>Whitens to a natural white removing surface stains, buildup etc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It’s not much different than my old routine which was Crest Pro-Health for two minutes with an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps I expected too much</li>
            <li>With my 3-nager I barely get to brush my teeth with 1 tube of toothpaste let alone trying to do 2 steps for 1 minute a piece.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;ve been very pleasantly surprised by this product.  </li>
            <li>I have a sensitive mouth that can&#x27;t handle whitening products, especially in toothpastes.</li>
            <li>in all, Crest Pro Health® HD™ delivered on it&#x27;s whitening promise, and if they ever do come out with a version for sensitive teeth, I&#x27;ll definitely give that one</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, product as expected</li>
            <li>The 2nd step has peroxide in it so if you have sensitive or bleeding gums it will sting.</li>
            <li>I understand that this is a system, so different steps are needed to complete the brushing and whitening process, I just wish they could combine it into one paste.</li>
            <li>I like it over the Crest 3D White Luxe Whitestrips Professional Effects which I did about a year ago.  </li>
            <li>The two main negatives that I have discovered is Step 1 leaves you with dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth or gums, but the whitening stage definitely irritated my gums.</li>
            <li>My dentist made me start using a soft bristle tooth brush a while back because I had some gum erosion.  </li>
            <li>Wow, I can feel &amp; see such a difference when I use this product.  </li>
            <li>but I have never really thought any home whitening product has really worked on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Really not that much else to say about it.  </li>
            <li>second thing of note: don&#x27;t use this if you are sensitive to whitening agents.</li>
            <li>far as the two-step process goes, it wasn&#x27;t as cumbersome as I initially thought it was.  </li>
            <li>I have relatively white teeth to begin with, but with age, I was getting yellowing near my gum line.</li>
            <li>(But I do have a sensitive mouth to lots of different toothpastes!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>The only con is my gums became sensitive after a week or so.</li>
            <li>Step 2 is the bonus step that only requires 60 seconds to complete.  </li>
            <li>different from sensitive teeth brand whitening toothpastes, it didn&#x27;t feel chalky or leave my teeth feeling coated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth, I would not likely recommend based off the warnings on the box.</li>
            <li>This time I didn&#x27;t notice any white spots on my gums, but my teeth were extremely sensitive when eating anything crunchy or chewy.  </li>
            <li>The ONLY downside is that this toothpaste made my sensitive teeth ache after two weeks.</li>
            <li>I used Crest Pro Health® HD™ toothpaste for 2 minutes 2x a day as instructed and I have to say I did not really notice much difference.  </li>
            <li>I am a busy mom of three, and sometimes it feels like I have to fight for five minutes to myself, even to do something as simple as brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>But this two step system has not only made my teeth sensitive</li>
            <li>This simple two step process take two minutes to complete which leaves your mouth feeling</li>
            <li>I am all about ease of use, especially on the early mornings when I am in a rush to get to work.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised, and after using it I will definitely buy it.</li>
            <li>I used Crest 3D white strips professional every six months</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I will continue to regularly purchase the product because it is a bit pricey, but I will most likely purchase it every couple of months to maintain my white teeth.</li>
            <li>I had actually just made an appointment with my dentist to have my teeth professionally whitened when I received it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I have quite severe periodontal disease, my dentist had been recommending both Crest Pro Health toothpaste and mouthwash, which I&#x27;ve been using religiously for nearly a year now.</li>
            <li>the gel has barely any taste at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the gel has barely any taste at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I discovered a big difference between use of Crest Pro Health HD on my &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; teeth and my adult child&#x27;s &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34; teeth when it came to whitening.</li>
            <li>I also can&#x27;t tell a difference in the whiteness of my teeth, but maybe it&#x27;s too early to tell since I&#x27;ve only used it for a week and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For me, if I brushed between 1 to 2 minutes my gums became sensitive.  </li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t noticed whiter teeth, but I haven&#x27;t been diligent to only use this toothpaste either.  </li>
            <li>I tried going back to my old toothpaste</li>
            <li>I was a bit surprised at the specificity of the use instructions, but they are simple.</li>
            <li>I am a mother of two young children and my mornings are already hectic as it is, but the process literally only takes two minutes.</li>
            <li>If I had to say something, I think I actually prefer my old toothpaste</li>
            <li>It takes about 2 minutes to complete both steps, so there isn&#x27;t additional wait time like there is with the whitening strips or similar</li>
            <li>I never really thought much about it.  </li>
            <li>Bare?</li>
            <li>have noticed that my teeth seem extra sensitive since I started using it, but this toothpaste has cavity protection and I have issues with sensitivity with any toothpaste that has cavity protection/tartar control/etc.  </li>
            <li>This may be just my experience or a combination of having lightly sensitive gums, and doing it for 4 minutes total.</li>
            <li>At the beginning of day 3, my mouth was so sensitive and all the product was doing was turning my gums white.</li>
            <li>on Amazon&#x27;s final price), would make me choke on my toothbrush if it were my normal daily toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>on Amazon&#x27;s final price), would make me choke on my toothbrush if it were my normal daily toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>A very simple substitution for your normal brushing routine, and you&#x27;re on your way to a whiter brighter future.</li>
            <li>big difference that I noticed was that my morning coffee didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; to my mouth and leave that gross feeling like it normally does.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would recommend trying this product (even though it is a bit more expensive than normal toothpaste).</li>
            <li>It literally takes two minutes to use - which is how long you are supposed to brush normally.  </li>
            <li>In all honesty these two things are minimal and so worth dealing with because you get healthier and whiter teeth in such a simple way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>The two of us used up the tubes after just over 3 weeks and are ordering more today because we are not happy returning to the old tube we used before because the cleanliness is just not the same.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never really had luck with other whitening toothpastes making any sort of significant difference in the look/color of my teeth.</li>
            <li>I have even received a few compliments on my smile since I started the regimen.  </li>
            <li>Within a few days I could see results - brighter and whiter and the fresh taste in my mouth was an added bonus.</li>
            <li>I noticed results in just two days and everyday my smile is brighter and whiter.</li>
            <li>mostly tastes like the whitening strips that I have tried so not great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth are whiter, but it doesn&#x27;t work any better or worse than others with stains on bonded / capped teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not awful, but it&#x27;s not great either</li>
            <li>okay, not great.</li>
            <li>I will admit it was kind of weird.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take that long, but the gel doesn&#x27;t taste good and has an uncomfortable texture.</li>
            <li>Too little, and it loses the flavor quickly, but hitting the tipping point and it lasts for the full brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>I have only used this toothpaste for about a week and already noticed slight results, actually my husband noticed right away!</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant to use the product, as often times, teeth-whitening products really hurt my teeth and make them very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have slight discoloration, and have tried other whitening products in the fast, but could never last more than a day due to sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>about half of both tubes still left to use which means it seems to last a long time and is worth the reasonable price to pay.</li>
            <li>about half of both tubes still left to use which means it seems to last a long time and is worth the reasonable price to pay.</li>
            <li>The whole process only takes two minutes (about as long as the first half of a Katy Perry song).</li>
            <li>I used to be less confident with my smile and was not really happy with my overall oral health.</li>
            <li>admit that it really does make your teeth whiter, but certainly not 6x whiter.  </li>
            <li>It just wasn&#x27;t worth it, so I just went back to using plain old toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I received this free as a BZZ Agent and boy was I skeptical as so many other products claim to do the same but fall short.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first paste you use is like a typical minty toothpaste, while the second one is a thinner clear gel with a peroxide scent.</li>
            <li>The system consists of 2 tubes: the first is like a typical toothpaste, and the 2nd is a clear whitening gel.  </li>
            <li>only problem I have is that the first step makes my mouth feel dry and gritty.</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t say anything on the package about the whitening aspect, the package I received looked a little different, and I felt I saw results after the very first brushing..</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only negative things I can say are that they first step waters down very quickly.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything better from this new Crest product, despite it&#x27;s promises.  </li>
            <li>Now before using this product, my teeth were already very white and knowing the results now,  I should have taken a photo before starting the new toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this new product to others if you are concerned about any of the same dental issues as I am.</li>
            <li>, I was a bit skeptical about this product when I first tried it because other systems don&#x27;t seem to work, they just make my teeth more sensitive,  </li>
            <li>It is much smoother than other products I have used, and seems to last longer as well despite normal daily wear and tear.</li>
            <li>I found that the two step system left my gums feeling very sensitive after the first few uses, so I couldn&#x27;t use twice a day.  </li>
            <li>My mouth feels much cleaner, fresher and less sensitive.</li>
            <li>, it is easy and it actually makes me brush for at least 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>did notice a slightly whiter smile after one week, and continued to use it into a second week.  </li>
            <li>whitening gel is thick enough to stay on the toothbrush and is easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I also noted that there is a definite heavy peroxide after taste but quickly subsides after rinsing in step 2.</li>
            <li>I have tried other teeth whitening products before and have never seen such fast and clear results like I do with this product.</li>
            <li>Overall, the 2-steps aren&#x27;t a hassle, especially in comparison to the process required with other whitening products; the time required to do this is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>The product is a little more expensive than I would normally care to entertain for a toothpaste, but I actually do believe it is worth it - even if you use it for a month, take a month off, use it for another month, etc.</li>
            <li>I have several very sensitive areas and during my trial only had one issue of discomfort.</li>
            <li>I was hesistant at first because in the past, whitening toothpastes have made my teeth very sensitive and my gums hurt.  </li>
            <li>As you are brushing the color changes right before your eyes, quite a few shades.  </li>
            <li>This new Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste system really makes my mouth feel super-clean, and I have noticed a slight improvement in the whiteness of my teeth as well.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical about this toothpaste, assuming that my teeth are too great a mess for any store paste to make a difference.</li>
            <li>and i don&#x27;t completely understand as it makes my mouth feel much cleaner than other products with the exact same active ingredient at the same concentration...</li>
            <li>I noticed a slight lightening of coffee/wine staining within the first couple of days</li>
            <li>In the first step, you use is the Purifying Cleanser which I would desribe as your typical minty toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It is an odd feeling at first, but once you do step two it goes away.  </li>
            <li>Crest was the first toothpaste to use stannous flouride and it is estimated a half billion cavities have been avoided by using Crest.  </li>
            <li>The first tube is like a typical toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it claims to do, but feels odd as it is a two step toothbrushing process.</li>
            <li>The taste was pretty on target too as a typical Crest toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Brushing your teeth is a pretty mundane task.  </li>
            <li>also convinced my wife to be a trial subject because she is interested in teeth whitening and dental health.</li>
            <li>2 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;the first week i used the toothpaste I did notice a slight difference in the color of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t attest to the whitening, but that may be due to the fact that my teeth are already pretty white from using the Crest whitening strips.</li>
            <li>Aware that I have not tried anything other than a basic whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels cleaner with just the first step than any other toothpaste, even the Crest Pro-Health regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>My wife is a seasoned dental hygienist and upon my most recent examination, she stated she could tell I was flossing daily when sadly, I still only floss once a week!  </li>
            <li>It is not a deal breaker because the product is better than other tooth paste I have used it the past</li>
            <li>My teeth did not show any significant change in color, and for a product that is not exactly inexpensive as compared to other toothpastes that claim also to whiten teeth, HD did not deliver to me.</li>
            <li>Other than only using it once per day, I followed the directions exactly as written and still saw no results after 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>so I usually have to brush teeth quickly, the fact that I have to  reload something else( step 2), seems like a time buster to me.  </li>
            <li>In the past I used whitening strips which made my teeth and gums super sensative</li>
            <li>The Crest Pro Health® HD is just  2 minutes a day and will quickly become a part of your everyday routine!</li>
            <li>and it foamed quickly, causing me to spit sooner than usual.</li>
            <li>I think that it could do a better job of whitening, but overall is a decent toothpaste that I would purchase if it was not too expensive.</li>
            <li>When I first used it, I was a little surprised by the taste of step #2 - you can definitely taste the peroxide.</li>
            <li>: I have extremely sensitive teeth - experienced the worst pain of my life during and after a Zoom session, the strips hurt me, and everything made for sensitive teeth hasn&#x27;t made much of a difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to like Crest Pro Health HD, I think I will be going back to my regular Crest Pro Health,  or at least until Crest can figure out a way to make a gel that leaves my mouth feeling fresh again.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to all the coffee drinkers, red wine drinkers, or anyone just needing that extra white gleam!</li>
            <li>I actually had to alternate the toothpaste  with my normal crest toothpaste for the first few weeks.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to try it because who doesn&#x27;t want whiter teeth but was disappointed to find that it didn&#x27;t seem to make that much of a difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this product for only 3 weeks, I&#x27;ve seen major results!</li>
            <li>At first, this was a weird sensation, but now I like it because it contributes to how clean my mouth feels.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels really clean after brushing with a cool and slightly numb feeling.</li>
            <li>No dramatic results for me, but minimal objective whitening was achieved.</li>
            <li>While I have decent teeth already, the extra step in the morning when I&#x27;m already a mess getting ready for work after a couple extra snoozes, I&#x27;m not seeing the effects.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Crest!y while thinking of a thousand other things.</li>
            <li>The whole 2 step thing took a minute to get used to and the taste isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;m used to from other tooth pastes</li>
            <li>I am very selective about the toothpastes and other oral products I purchase so,</li>
            <li>I felt that my mouth felt much cleaner and my teeth a llittle brighter due to this Crest product.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel much cleaner after the cleaning step than after using other toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Over the past few weeks, I was given the opportunity to try Crest Pro Health HD for free thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li>Those bottom teeth as well as all of my other teeth are now visibly whiter, and having the dentist notice the difference drove home the point that this stuff really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unlike other toothpastes that claim they &amp;#34;whiten&amp;#34;, I really like how there&#x27;s 2 steps.</li>
            <li>I like this because I don&#x27;t really like the peppermint-type flavor of a lot of other toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I have tried other ones, and did not notice much of a result.</li>
            <li>I like this because I don&#x27;t really like the peppermint-type flavor of a lot of other toothpastes.</li>
            <li>This was a much stronger feeling than with any other peppermint toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping that it would help reduce plaque build-up as I have problems with that due to some overcrowding of two lower teeth.  </li>
            <li>I used this product once a day for 14 days straight, without using any other products in-between.  </li>
            <li>After reading through the directions, I was a little concerned about not being able to spit during the two minutes I was required to brush my teeth because I usually do a few times</li>
            <li>I had been using a standard whitening toothpaste that didn&#x27;t seem to be doing much on it&#x27;s own, but I&#x27;m generally skeptical of whitening claims in general.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little different having a two step process to brush my teeth, but it was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>However, after trying this for several weeks, I can now say that this isn&#x27;t any more difficult than my normal brushing routine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The two-step system is pretty simple, except for the fact that since we have to use two different toothpastes the time spent in brushing seems like forever.</li>
            <li>It takes a little extra time, but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I skipped one brushing went back to my normal toothpaste (also a crest product) and was back with the Pro Heath HD the next night.</li>
            <li>At first this was a little daunting, but it actually helped me to brush much longer than I usually do (I&#x27;m a slacker and never really brush for the full 2 minutes you are supposed to).</li>
            <li>Only small complaint is the slight burning on the gums after step 1, doesn&#x27;t last long and can be avoided with more gentle precise brushing.</li>
            <li>The second step is a little less enjoyable, since you apply it to the toothbrush after spitting (but not rinsing).  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m interested in a whiter smile, and I&#x27;m a big fan of Crest in particular for helping me achieve that, but after only 4 days, I started skipping step 2.</li>
            <li>but I do feel I can back down to using the two-step process once per day since the &#x27;regular&#x27; toothpaste I use is Crest Whitening with Baking Soda &amp; Peroxide (Fresh Mint).</li>
            <li>We have continued to use it daily, and our teeth have never been whiter, even though we have used special teeth-whitening products in the past.</li>
            <li>How could that actually be better than the conventional toothpastes that I have been using in the past.</li>
            <li>It made your teeth feel very rough even though this toothpaste had a lot of grit in it and is very abrasive.  </li>
            <li>I got this product from Bzzagent free thanks to Crest, and was a bit skeptical.  </li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health HD is an okay product, but do not expect dramatic results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, my expectations were seriously blown away when I got the chance from Crest to review this product for free as a BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>But think about it, if a person has darker teeth to start the change will be more dramatic.</li>
            <li>At least my teeth should be clean even if they don&#x27;t get any whiter.</li>
            <li>I started using Crest Pro Health HD about a month ago  after receiving a free trial from Crest and after 4weeks of constant use, there is no doubt that my teeth are at least 1-2 shades whiter.</li>
            <li>The product instructions were clear and specific and the product left my mouth feeling refreshed</li>
            <li>The only slight downside was that I might have applied too much whitening paste to my gums, as one spot is slightly sensitive.</li>
            <li>After that first week I was checking the staining and there are NO brown lines on the backside of my teeth and the slight yellow at the corners of the bottom &amp;#34;canine&amp;#34; teeth is barely visible.</li>
            <li>The Step 2 is a clear gel that definitely lets you know you are using something different.  </li>
            <li>I have to admit that I think Crest should have put step 1 in the blue tube, since the toothpaste is blue, and then the finishing gel in the silver tube since it is clear, and I associate polishing with silver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what it was, perhaps the two step process, but it really felt that my teeth were cleaner than normal.  </li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t know that it compares with the brightening of a professional treatment, Crest HD definitely gives me the extra gleam I want.</li>
            <li>And lastly, I have had to use a sensitive toothpaste recently because of tooth sensitivity, and using this toothpaste</li>
            <li>I began using this product in early June and now a month later I definitely notice whiter teeth and</li>
            <li>After my two week trial I would brush with regular toothpaste then apply the whitening gel and I use the step 1 paste from time to time to give it that deep cleanse, just not everyday.</li>
            <li>so I had to cut back to using it only one time a day and a sensitive toothpaste</li>
            <li>I have defeated the sensitivity by only using this toothpaste once a day in the morning and my old regular toothpaste once at night.</li>
            <li>I still feel that there is some yellow on my teeth near the gum line overall</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health HD is a breakthrough, the daily innovated system offers a noticeable and different experience that improves both the oral health and appearance of my mouth.</li>
            <li>It really does feel similar to a dental cleaning minus the discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the Crest 3d white polishing treatment in addition to my current natural</li>
            <li>the Crest 3d white polishing treatment in addition to my current natural</li>
            <li>The two step system is definitely worth the extra few seconds.</li>
            <li>Within a few days of brushing morning and night with Crest HD, I definitely noticed a difference in my smile.</li>
            <li>Still leaves your breath fresh with no extra steps in your everyday routine.  </li>
            <li>The main reason why I was really curious to try this product was because of the 6x teeth whitening advertisement.</li>
            <li>I am thinking however, that everyone is different as I have heard better and worse results from others.</li>
            <li>After just a few uses you will notice a color change to your teeth that will not only allow you to smile, but makes you want to.</li>
            <li>That would normally be expected to stand for &amp;#34;high definition&amp;#34;, at least in the realm of TV, which is where it is most often use.</li>
            <li>my teeth and gums were a little sensitive for a few days, but everything feels fine</li>
            <li>I also did not like the watery texture of the second product and weirdly had a hard time brushing with it for a full minute, as there wasn&#x27;t much substance to brush with - no foam, dripped out of mouth easily, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, the two step process is a little over kill at first</li>
            <li>The first time I used the system I felt like the polishing/whitening step (#2) tasted a little metallic but as I continued to use the system I didn&#x27;t taste it again.</li>
            <li>Most of the other whiteners I used in the past made me gag, but this makes me feel like I just left the dentist</li>
            <li>I did notice a little change in the color of my teeth in the first couple days.</li>
            <li>When I first got the Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste I noticed how although the packaging is a little over kill for toothpaste</li>
            <li>The first step fluoride toothpaste was not overly minty flavored, it does get a little foamy though, but the texture was not something that would deter me from continuing to use it.  </li>
            <li>A little bit of a pain at first to stop brushing halfway through</li>
            <li>only give the 4 stars because I prefer a MAJOR minty toothpaste flavor.  </li>
            <li>, while my teeth feel pretty and shiny, there are a lot of little annoyances that bother me about this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>After three weeks there was a major different</li>
            <li>My gums/teeth also burned a little for the first three days.</li>
            <li>and I had no excuse to not whiten!</li>
            <li>The first step involves using what seems like a regular crest toothpast which i do feel is an improved version of other regular variety.  </li>
            <li>is maybe that the price is a little on the higher side just for toothpaste</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it all stars was that I didn&#x27;t experience a major whitening improvement.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant of the 2-step process but after the first use I wasn&#x27;t bothered.  </li>
            <li>The process is a little strange--I really want to rinse in between steps!</li>
            <li>It also helps that the first tube protects your enamel, because I was worried a little bit about my enamel with the Crest Whitestrips.</li>
            <li>I was willing to deal with a little discomfort because the toothpaste was working</li>
            <li>I was willing to deal with a little discomfort because the toothpaste was working</li>
            <li>all that said, I think I would repurchase this product (although I do acknowledge that the $15 price point is a little higher than I&#x27;d like to spend on toothpaste).</li>
            <li>all that said, I think I would repurchase this product (although I do acknowledge that the $15 price point is a little higher than I&#x27;d like to spend on toothpaste).</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t 6x whiter, whatever was exactly meant by that, but I did notice that my teeth were a little whiter.</li>
            <li>My teeth are really sensitive to cold water, and apparently are sensitive to the whitening component that is in most whitening toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>I know two-step with two tubes of toothpaste might sound little complicated, but it is as easy as regular one toothpaste brushing.  </li>
            <li>Step two is a gel that tastes a little strange, but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>I stopped for a few days to see what would happen and my teeth were right back where they were before.</li>
            <li>It takes less than two minutes of your time to brush with the first toothpaste, spit and then brush with the second paste.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the results were not as profound with my husband, whose teeth need whitening more than mine.</li>
            <li>then id pay for 2 tubes of toothpaste that you have to use right after each other, so basically lasting as long as 1 tube.</li>
            <li>both do agree that our teeth do feel dentist clean and that morning breath is a thing of the past!</li>
            <li>The size was larger than I expected and the cost was half what I originally planned to plan for it.</li>
            <li>Trying to put on a second toothpaste (with a screw on cap), mid brush is a bit odd and makes it even more... messy.</li>
            <li>not like a bright crazy unnatural white, but my pearlies were definitely whiter.  </li>
            <li>It is an innovative way to get a brighter smile without having to use any of the inconvenient strips, trays or overnight treatments that often produce minimal results.  </li>
            <li>It is a 2-step process that takes the same amount of time as you generally spend brushing your teeth.  </li>
            <li>It is a 2-step process that takes the same amount of time as you generally spend brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li>I can say I&#x27;m a big fan of Crest products in general.  </li>
            <li>Similar to teeth brushing in general.  </li>
            <li>My teeth in general are generally white, but I drink soda and coffee throughout the day, so it seems like from bed to morning my teeth lose their shine.</li>
            <li>It did not give me as much sensitivity as other whitening products especially the strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it is absolutely easier then dental trays or other whitening products but regular tooth paste is easier then a two part system.  </li>
            <li>Secondly, I do feel a difference in how my teeth feel after brushing where they feel much smoother and cleaner than a lot of other toothpastes i have used.  </li>
            <li>it is much easier to open one handed when your other hand is holding the toothbrush you&#x27;ve used for step one.</li>
            <li>The whitening power is also much stronger than other &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; toothpastes; I actually saw results!</li>
            <li>The different toothpastes have unusual textures, but they&#x27;re not unlike other whitening or prescription toothpastes I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Hope there are no long term effects.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been extra careful not to brush my gums to much and haven&#x27;t noticed the white spots as often.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The reason I was concerned in the beginning is because I have sensitive teeth and a majority of whitening products I can not use for long periods of time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not taste funny like other people ^ claim - if you have had your teeth professionally whitened or have used other at home kits...</li>
            <li>Had to go back my old Crest Pro-Health toothpaste occasionally to stop the sensitivity before going back to the HD kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Two minutes is not long at all.  </li>
            <li>but no where near the 6x whiter claimed (I drink coffee daily and red wine several times a week).</li>
            <li>I also notice the feel of plaque on my teeth quite often, and not long after I brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is pricier than normal toothpaste, so I will likely use it again, but not completely replace my regular toothpaste with it.</li>
            <li>but I am now noticing a brighter smile with none of the white spots or uneven bleaching I have gotten using traditional whitening gels and trays.</li>
            <li>Also the first part, the cleaner, why is it so firm.</li>
            <li>my first few uses</li>
            <li>The taste of the step 1 toothpaste was as expected of any normal mint toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>My breath felt cleaner after the first brushing and my teeth were whiter after just a few days.  </li>
            <li>This heavy coffee and tea drinker thanks you!</li>
            <li>There are a few cons to the product which users should be aware of</li>
            <li>They always left my teeth sensitive and painful, so I would stop use before seeing good results.</li>
            <li>4 minutes to whiten and brighten your smile is a small amount to ask.</li>
            <li>I , out of habit rinsed the first few times by accident.</li>
            <li>who would have known!&lt;br /&gt;After my first few days of brushing, i could see and feel a difference.</li>
            <li>My gums were sore and turned whitish in spots for the first few weeks of using this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>two step system just takes longer and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth the effort.</li>
            <li>If you think about it its really no longer than you normally are suppose to brush (the recommended two minutes).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit that the for the first few times, I didn&#x27;t like the taste of Step 2, but that was because of the peroxide.</li>
            <li>I never really thought it was going to do anything my normal toothpaste hadn&#x27;t already done.  </li>
            <li>Again, my teeth do \\&quot;feel\\&quot; and look cleaner, but I&#x27;m not sure if it is worth the price for this product.</li>
            <li>Price wise this toothpaste is very expensive</li>
            <li>Price wise this toothpaste is very expensive</li>
            <li>The first step tastes fine, but makes your teeth feel dirty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s minty, it seems to at least cover the basics of giving you clean teeth, but so are regular toothpastes</li>
            <li>So I love having clean teeth, and I hate going to the dentist, I hse</li>
            <li>It is a very thin paste with a very strong mint flavor.  </li>
            <li>Also, both steps (especially step 2) have a pretty strong taste of artificial sweetener.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Step-1 of this process is exactly like any other tube of crest toothpaste, it has the same flavor, the same feel and likely the same result.</li>
            <li>The first step is a little gritty paste that is designed to help be microscrubbers for your teeth.</li>
            <li>And bonus points for whitening better than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried in the past!  </li>
            <li>And bonus points for whitening better than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried in the past!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The two-step system is pretty simple, except for one little thing.  </li>
            <li>It took a little getting used to at first with the different steps</li>
            <li>and I was a little concerned at first cause of the extra time it took to use both tubs.</li>
            <li>And bonus points for whitening better than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried in the past!</li>
            <li>I am a major red wine connoisseur and drink coffee regularly.  </li>
            <li>When I first received it, I was a little hesitant in the amount of time it would take every time I brushed my teeth</li>
            <li>It also helps whitening better than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried in the past!</li>
            <li>When I first read the packaging, I was a little concerned about the warning that you may experience temporary symptoms like white spots or oral discomfort when using this product, but I didn&#x27;t experience anything like that.</li>
            <li>The first tube has an odd flat and gummy feel to it.</li>
            <li>I was a fan of Crest ProHealth in general, so when this new whitening product came out, I was very curious to try it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference with how much whiter my teeth have gotten, which I haven&#x27;t seen with other similar products.</li>
            <li>I expressed to my office personnel that I received Crest ProHealth HD from BzzAgent and even though at first I thought that I would not like having to take the extra time to utilize 2 toothpastes as it became a habit it appeared to take as long as any other teeth brushing routine.  </li>
            <li>However, compared to other brands of whitening toothpaste, the Crest Pro-Health HD made the biggest difference in the whiteness of my teeth - so if your teeth and gums aren&#x27;t very sensitive, I&#x27;d say give it a go!</li>
            <li>my smile has dulled down, After 1 single use of this crest HD you see results!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the whitest teeth due to high fluoride exposure as a child.</li>
            <li>It is high compared to toothpaste alone but compared to other whitening systems the price is quite comparable.  </li>
            <li>The bad news is, I&#x27;m not sure this is a perfect system for everyone.  </li>
            <li>The bad news is, I&#x27;m not sure this is a perfect system for everyone.  </li>
            <li>I give it 3 stars because it did clean my teeth well, but I can&#x27;t get past the dry sensation and the taste of Step 2.  </li>
            <li>At first I will admit I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the two step process since I really, really don&#x27;t enjoy brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li>After a month of use, I have noticed my teeth are slightly whiter, but not as much as I</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind it that much, and I have used both steps for about a week and a half now.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind it that much, and I have used both steps for about a week and a half now.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are slightly whiter, but not by much.</li>
            <li>The Step 2 finishing polish did not have too much of a taste, it was just a slight mint.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a slight improvement in the color of my teeth and my teeth really are \\&quot;squeaky\\</li>
            <li>Only problem is I have sensitive gums so if I use this twice a day for too long I start to get cuts along my gums.</li>
            <li>The whitener is also mild, and please use for at least 1 min each time or it will not work.</li>
            <li>The feeling goes away pretty fast and decreased over a couple weeks.</li>
            <li>Over the past couple of years I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth aren&#x27;t as white as they once were, and I&#x27;d wondered about ways to refresh my smile.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first since it was two steps, but the results were worth it</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply but not a great foamy feel.  </li>
            <li>After the first few days, I ended up only using the Crest system at night.  </li>
            <li>My wife felt an initial surge of encouragement the first few days, but then felt nothing else happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are looking for whitening, I&#x27;m not sure this is worth the extra step.</li>
            <li>I love the just clean feeling from the dentist, but I hate that it only lasts about a week.  </li>
            <li>&quot; show up in the first few days, which was white spots on my gums.  </li>
            <li>Luckily Step 2 quells that drought pretty quickly, but because (and here&#x27;s my second reason)it has a different consistency and is clear, its impossible to use each tube at equal rates resulting in uneven amounts of product as to get closer to the end.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel that it took more than a few seconds longer than usual to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li>I noticed a very slight whitening after the first week.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Whitening power is minimal and I reached full whitening in a few days</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad per se, but not nice and minty like regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>On the downside :  for busy people, including me as a new mom I do have to admit that a two-step process can be a little painstaking at times…  </li>
            <li>When I first received my sample of this two step toothpaste from BzzAgent, I must admit I was more than a little skeptical that 1.</li>
            <li>I must admit that I was a little skeptical at first as I have tried many whitening toothpaste, strips, mouthwashes, etc.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to be like any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried, but this product really surprised me!!</li>
            <li>My teeth are pretty white to begin with, but I definitely could have used a little whitening help on the front bottom teeth and didn&#x27;t notice a difference after my 2-week trial period.  </li>
            <li>Naturally, this isn&#x27;t as \\&quot;easy\\&quot; as a single step 2-minute brush, but it&#x27;s not over-burdensome.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The foaming tooth paste in Step 1 removes all plaque stains in a single use as if you had a professional cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>You will get that extreme clean sensation during the day, your teeth will be brighter and after a few weeks they will be whiter (you have to use it twice a day and as directed).</li>
            <li>I will say a few positive things about the product though:  </li>
            <li>I also feel that both tubes will last several months making the cost for the Crest HD very reasonable, especially if it means I can use the more expensive whitening strips less often.</li>
            <li>Normally I wouldn&#x27;t use this type of product due to safety concerns and/or being unfamiliar with it.  </li>
            <li>Due in part to the two packages of toothpaste instead of the normal one.</li>
            <li>I am normally hesitant to spend this much $ on a whitening toothpaste,  but in this case, I would definitely recommend you try it at least once.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical of a 2 step cleansing system when I received my complimentary box from BzzAgent, but after having a couple of weeks to test it out, I can say that the 2 step system is no more work than a 1 step toothpaste, but with much better benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Due in part to the two packages of toothpaste instead of the normal one.</li>
            <li>Consistent whitening of teeth on a daily basis, not just a 10 minute, harsh, whitening product that doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed a big difference between toothpaste brands in the past, other than in color, taste, and texture, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with the new Crest HD.</li>
            <li>in such a short time my overall mouth has never been this fresh, nor my teeth as slick....</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any whitening of my teeth in the past few weeks, and someone actually took a close-up photo of me a couple weeks ago that made my teeth look more yellow than I thought they were!</li>
            <li>She had cute little pearly whites when she was little but since her adult teeth have come in they&#x27;ve been less than white</li>
            <li>2- I have a filled tooth in front that usually looks darker than my other teeth, not always responding to whiting products.</li>
            <li>Overall this product only accomplished half the job.  </li>
            <li>However, the whole process really takes less than a few minutes.</li>
            <li>In fact, I would recommend keeping your tongue as far from this clear gel as possible because it does burn slightly.</li>
            <li>It sounds ridiculous, but it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll buy it again if it comes in other flavors and in actual paste format, but for now I think I will stick to my normal Crest Pro Health toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Although it did leave my breath fresh, the whitening affect was minimal, only slightly noticeable after two weeks of use.</li>
            <li>This is worth the cost due to the effects of step 1 even if the whitening part is average.  </li>
            <li>I also have not had any issues with sensitivity even after normal use, unlike other whitening products I&#x27;ve tried, which have definitely caused some discomfort.</li>
            <li>There is a slight minty taste to this light blue gel and your mouth will feel a little grainy after just spitting out &amp;#34;STEP 1&amp;#34;, but it will shortly go away when you have finished the next step.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks my teeth are certainly whiter.</li>
            <li>The smart thing that Crest did was making this your everyday brushing routine.</li>
            <li>The first product has a nice minty flavor, but the second step has an unpleasant after taste that is slightly salty.</li>
            <li>It also gets less gritty after a while, probably because there is less plaque to clean out from regular use.  </li>
            <li>spit that out and put a little of step 2 which is a gel that polishes and whitens on your brush and go on brushing the whole thing took 2 min of my time and gave me results that i get from a dentist trip with no dentist</li>
            <li>It made my gums bleed a little bit, my tongue very sore, and my teeth hurt.</li>
            <li>and I really think that my teeth are getting a little whiter.  </li>
            <li>My teeth did seem to get a little whiter, but I do not have a before and after picture to really tell if they did.  </li>
            <li>This is the one with little funky taste but it is also the one which is responsible for cleaning out the stains and yellowness from your teeth.</li>
            <li>I have to say, while it takes a little moe time to brush my teeth, it really makes them feel cleaner</li>
            <li>I thought brushing for 2 minutes in the morning and evening would take too much time, but I found I could do little things while brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth didn&#x27;t need whitening, so I was a little hesitant to try this product, but I didn&#x27;t really have anything to lose.</li>
            <li>Based upon other reviews (and her new crown)</li>
            <li>The two step process is easy and probably had me brushing for slightly longer than usual.  </li>
            <li>I break down my review into the two main product benefits: cleaning and whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would prefer to have been left with invigorating, minty fresh breath.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was a little nervous to try this since I do have sensitive teeth, but found that my teeth were whiter by about two shades in a little over a week</li>
            <li>It really cleans your teeth to the point where your teeth feel very dry and rough.  </li>
            <li>I find this  Crest HD,, and this is really works, I have a  yellow color  Teeth, but since I try  this for a couple of weeks, I can see a Little bit,  </li>
            <li>It takes a little adjustment to get used to the second brushing, but once you get it, it doesn’t really take any extra time or effort</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical that it would be able to do much for my teeth because I drink a lot of sodas</li>
            <li>I have tried other &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; toothpastes before, but they either didn&#x27;t work well or caused me a lot of discomfort since I have very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>The second step is a clear gel, and it&#x27;s hard to know just how much to use and</li>
            <li>I was curious how long that would last and was pleasantly surprised that coffee (even a iced beverage or frappuchino) didn&#x27;t affect how my teeth felt!!  </li>
            <li>It really is too bad because while having to go through a 2-step process isn&#x27;t the most convenient</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t suppose a bleaching product should taste good, but this one is exceptionally bad.</li>
            <li>I  know it sounds stupid, but it really was kind of an inconvenience.  </li>
            <li>I  know it sounds stupid, but it really was kind of an inconvenience.  </li>
            <li>Then use the second tube which is clear and not very tasty at all.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The best thing about it is that it forces me to brush my teeth for 2 minutes, because you use each tube for a minute.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect alternative for me than to go get my teeth whitened at the dentist office.</li>
            <li> this is perfect for that.  </li>
            <li> In fact it is no issue at all; Incredibly convenient!</li>
            <li> My teeth were incredibly shiny - like beauty queen with Vaseline on her teeth shiny!  </li>
            <li> If you can get over that, then this is probably the best toothpaste I’ve used.</li>
            <li> this is literally the best toothpaste ever.</li>
            <li> Both of these products (fluoride anti-plaque toothpaste and whitening gel) have a wonderful, &amp;#34;peppy&amp;#34; taste and the whitening is awesome!!nO would recommend these products to anyone wanting whiter, protected teeth!!</li>
            <li> This product is great!</li>
            <li> Excellent job Crest I will continue to use this</li>
            <li> If they could could combine this into one paste or have the gel and the paste come out side by side a la Mentadent toothpaste that would be delightful.</li>

            <li> And, I also have done the crest whitening strips, which worked wonderful but at what point in my day do I have time to put strips on my teeth and let them sit for an extended period of time?</li>
            <li> And I have to say, it is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is really a great product, and it will be a staple in our oral care routine for years to come!</li>
            <li> Not so perfect, in my opinion.  </li>

            <li> Very great toothpaste.</li>
            <li> But still the results are impressive!</li>

            <li> This is perfect because it is just like brushing my teeth twice in a row.</li>
            <li> Just great!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been brushing with this system (made up of a paste and a gel that you brush with for one minute each) for about two weeks and have been surprisingly happy with the results!  </li>
            <li> impressed with the cleaner feel.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, I was very happy with the results.  </li>

            <li> I use the paste and gel two times a day and have seen some great improvement in the color of my teeth!</li>
            <li> Great way to change up your routine and start feeling the difference in the health of your teeth!  </li>

            <li> Suffice it to say I&#x27;ve been very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste I have EVER used!</li>
            <li> It was a great touch up for my teeth for spring!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> My teeth literally felt like perfectly buffed pearls in my mouth.</li>

            <li> So I was really happy to get into the Bzz Campaign.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> &gt; Both toothpastes taste great.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and for the price a great deal.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Great addition to my morning routine.</li>
            <li> Even after two weeks of using product, my teeth still feel great--</li>
            <li> I was still happy with my results.</li>
            <li> And my breath smells great.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I got to try this product as a promotion by the Crest brand for a chance to review it and experience the product.</li>
            <li> This product was a great kit for offering a one box solution for caring for your teeth.</li>
            <li> Here are the details of what I experienced.</li>
            <li> , I purchased it for my girlfriend and daughter, both of whom have seen great results as well.</li>
            <li> The taste isn&#x27;t great</li>
            <li> Step 1 tastes great</li>
            <li> , step 2 doesn&#x27;t have a great taste</li>
            <li> The product is great</li>
            <li> The great part about the Crest HD is you get the benefits of both products in one package.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I bought one for everyone in my family.</li>
            <li> This is great.  </li>
            <li> I get that post-dentist office feeling which is great.  </li>
            <li> I have tried strips and gave up on them before ever noticing any great result.  </li>
            <li> This product is great.</li>
            <li> Plus it tastes great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like that great feeling</li>
            <li> This 2-step brushing system is great.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed a great difference in whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, great product</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I tried Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I found that combining the Crest with my whitening routine was a great match.</li>
            <li> Both smell great.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums feel great.</li>
            <li> and it did a great job of whitening my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Great stuff!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great Product.</li>
            <li> I am getting compliments from people about how great my teeth look</li>
            <li> All-in-all, this is a great product</li>
            <li> My mouth felt great after brushing with it.</li>
            <li> and I am so happy I did.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s great that it gets people to brush for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> , i have found it works great and have had no issues.  </li>
            <li> then this product is great.  </li>
            <li> but I am having great results with this product.</li>
            <li> I am beyone happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I was happy that the gel did not have an overtly chemical taste.</li>
            <li> and I felt it did a great job cleaning my mouth.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health HD did a great job whitening our teeth.</li>
            <li> Great Product.</li>
            <li> I used an electric toothbrush with the Crest Pro Health HD kit and have been happy with the results.</li>
            <li> you can be proud to show off.</li>
            <li> If you have the patience to use 2 tubes, this is a great toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Reason is, the whitening gel is like brushing with Vicks VapoRub, lol.</li>
            <li> Multi-benefit and great results.</li>
            <li> it is GREAT.  </li>
            <li> But it tastes great and doesn&#x27;t burn.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any sensitivity at all after using the product 2 times a day for 2 weeks, yet my teeth are noticably whiter and brighter.</li>
            <li> Amazon has great pricing on this kit if you&#x27;re shopping around.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had no gum issues and after using this product I can see a difference which i am quite happy with.</li>
            <li> Am I ever happy I did.</li>
            <li> Some reviews noted brown spots on the teeth, I have experienced none.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product...</li>
            <li> That part isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> Step One tastes great</li>
            <li> This product did a great job whitening my teeth</li>
            <li> The whitening is great also.</li>
            <li> I think Crest Pro Health HD is a great  two part whitening toothpaste system.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothpaste and brightener.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job but will also show if you don&#x27;t brush to your gums.  </li>
            <li> I think Crest Pro Health HD is a great way to keep teeth healthier and whiter.</li>
            <li> It also tastes great.</li>
            <li> You brush 1 minute with step 1 and 1 minute with step 2, which is great because everyone should be brushing for 2 minutes....</li>
            <li> so I use the product once a day instead of twice and now have found my happy medium.</li>
            <li> My hygienist also commented that my tartar looked great.  </li>
            <li> My husband has been using the toothpaste and is happy with the results.</li>
            <li> The taste of the toothpaste is great.</li>
            <li> I believe that it is a great product for some people</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I tried the HD product, and want to continue it as my routine brush.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s off to a great start</li>
            <li> I have also looked for it in Walmart and feel it&#x27;s a great price point for whitening products!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The oral hygiene aspect of the product is great.</li>
            <li> The pastes themselves felt great on my teeth too.</li>
            <li> though this paste contains stannous fluoride, I haven&#x27;t had any of the staining I experienced with the Crest Pro Health product I had tried.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the whiteness of my teeth has greatly</li>
            <li> but, I can tell you this is a great product.  </li>
            <li> The taste is great and minty.</li>
            <li> They are polished and look great.</li>
            <li> Great product for non dentist office teeth whitening.</li>
            <li> even my dentist commented on how great my teeth looked.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste part of this two step product has great taste and is recommended by my dental hygienist.  </li>
            <li> I have been happy with every Crest product I have ever used except this one -</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s a win win.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt great after I was done.  </li>
            <li> I am somewhat OCD with my teeth and what I use on them, but I can honestly say Crest&#x27;s Pro Health really impressed me!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall its a great product I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste and polishing routine.  </li>
            <li> , this toothpaste is a great alternative.</li>
            <li> The product is great</li>
            <li> By adding one minute longer to my brushing routine, I have seen great results in 6 days.</li>
            <li> The flavor tastes great and you can see and feel the difference immediately.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I was quite happy.</li>
            <li> so we are happy to continue to use.</li>
            <li> so it was  great that I could tell a difference.</li>
            <li> I used for 5 days and my teeth felt great</li>
            <li> If this toothpaste works for you, then that&#x27;s great, but just making some notes for those who may have gum or tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> In terms of impact, it&#x27;s been great.  </li>
            <li> #34;your teeth look great, I think I might have to start using your toothpaste (refer to the Crest HD).</li>
            <li> All in all this product has been a great way for me to get whiter, cleaner teeth</li>
            <li> This product works great.  </li>
            <li> It works great.</li>
            <li> The step 2 hydrogen peroxide gel is great for removing surface stains.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy with the product.  </li>
            <li> My concern is that this may not be great for my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I found that the toothpaste system is great tasting  </li>
            <li> Taste is not that great, but hey it&#x27;s not food.</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great has already helped whitening my teeth that were stained.</li>
            <li> On the contrary, I noticed that the lipstick color looked great with my pearly whites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Did a great job whitening my teeth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product for those of you that are concerned about whitening and does what it claims.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I tried this.</li>
            <li> IT ALSO HAS A GREAT INGREDIENT, FLUORIDE.</li>
            <li> I get that happy tingling that occurs after you come out</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so happy I did.</li>
            <li> Step one is a cleanser which tastes great,</li>
            <li> Every once in a while, we have all must have experienced what plaque build up looks like and feels like on our teeth-</li>
            <li> , therefore not seeing great results.  </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great idea to have then whitener separate.</li>
            <li> This stuff works and works great.</li>
            <li> It also has the great taste of Crest leaving your mouth feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> trial started out great.  </li>
            <li> The presentation is great.</li>
            <li> I am always prepared for a not so great taste with teeth whitening programs and toothpaste</li>
            <li> I though this was a great opportunity.</li>
            <li> Works great, I noticed a difference after just one use.  </li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> but it tastes great and gives you a healthier mouth.  </li>
            <li> I also experienced no nerve/gum pain whatsoever.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great toothpaste then you need to buy Crest HD.</li>
            <li> It is still a GREAT toothpaste</li>
            <li> and I am feeling a great report from my hygienist coming on.</li>
            <li> It makes my mouth feel cleaner longer throughout the day which is a great plus.</li>
            <li> I have been happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I could see this being a great item to rotate in and out of your brushing routine when want to up the cleanliness/whitening factor for a</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any sensitivity that whitening toothpastes sometimes cause.  </li>
            <li> but the end results have been great.  </li>
            <li> I’m really happy with this product over all.</li>

            <li> and I really liked it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this 2-step routine for just over 10 days now &amp; am loving it!</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with the product, and with Crest for letting me try it for free!  </li>
            <li> , I was so impressed with my results that I ordered three more to share with family members.  </li>
            <li> I think Crest created quite the remarkable product with this 2-Step paste.</li>
            <li> good news is, it did seem to whiten my teeth a bit, which I am always happy about--</li>
            <li> good news is, it did seem to whiten my teeth a bit, which I am always happy about--</li>
            <li> My experience an opinions are completely my own though!</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with the cost and the results that I have gotten using Crest Pro Health® HD™ Toothpaste!</li>
            <li> The more impressive part is that you continue noticing that difference throughout the usage.</li>
            <li> Loving it!  </li>
            <li> I really liked this toothpaste!  </li>
            <li> and I was most impressed with the cleaning property of the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> And after all that I endured, the results often weren&#x27;t even all that spectacular!</li>
            <li> impressed me most about this toothpaste was its staying power overnight.</li>
            <li> I wish the whitening had more bubbles so that I could feel the product working in my mouth, but I was impressed wih the after picture.</li>
            <li> The mouth-feel of my teeth, however, is truly remarkable.  </li>
            <li> Remarkable and noticeable results....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am loving the product!</li>
            <li> at your own risk!</li>
            <li> Some toothpastes aren&#x27;t the best tasting, but I love the mint flavor.</li>
            <li> but I love the cinnamon flavor the best</li>
            <li> The gel (step 2) doesn&#x27;t taste the greatest, but nor do most whitening products on the market.</li>
            <li> My teeth are noticeably whiter, but I am even more impressed with the way my gum health has improved.</li>
            <li> I thought you couldn&#x27;t get better than the Pro-Health, which is a great product itself, but this is!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m loving the way my mouth feels healthier!</li>
            <li> I am LOVING this product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall though, I was more impressed with the toothpaste than I thought I would be.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall though, I was more impressed with the toothpaste than I thought I would be.</li>
            <li> This is truly a great product, one of the best I&#x27;ve tried and I would like to thank the Crest brand for allowing me to try a kit free of charge.  </li>
            <li> I think the most surprising result was how great my gums felt!  </li>
            <li> The toothpaste and Polish have a pleasant taste</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this 2 part kit since I received it about a week ago, and I&#x27;ve found the taste for part one to be pleasant.</li>
            <li> In the beginning there was an after taste that I wasn&#x27;t too pleasant.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste has a pleasant minty taste and the whitening part tastes like the whitening strips.</li>
            <li> The taste and smell are pleasant also.</li>
            <li> It also has a pleasant minty taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The taste is pleasant and the foaming texture makes the bubbles do their job.  </li>
            <li> but this was quite pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Step one had a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li> and I was so excited!!!</li>
            <li> Easy and great feeling!</li>
            <li> So easy to use, and best of all - visible results (i.e. whiter teeth) after just 5 days of use!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to wake up to a pleasant mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So clean!!!</li>
            <li> My teeth felt SO clean!!!</li>
            <li> I am soooo happy I was able to try this system!</li>
            <li> , I just changed up my toothpaste routine, its so very easy!  </li>
            <li> This was very easy and efficient!  </li>
            <li> It takes 2 minutes, the flavor is great, and you have a beautiful sparkling, clean feeling mouth afterwards!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy to say that I felt no pain or sensitivity with this product and saw nice whitening results, even on my filled tooth!</li>
            <li> I can see how bright they&#x27;ve become.</li>
            <li> I am a coffee drinker and was concern that they weren&#x27;t as bright as they had been before.</li>
            <li> And we both agree that it does leave your teeth glossy and gleaming bright.  </li>
            <li> Great taste and leaves your teeth feeling amazing.</li>
            <li> My results are awesome and my smile is great.</li>
            <li> All in all a good product though.</li>
            <li> and I feel like it does a good job at both cleaning my teeth and whitening them.  </li>
            <li> good-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Brushing my teeth with a two-step process doesn&#x27;t take much more time than doing one step, and the results are incredible.  </li>
            <li> did either, even though we&#x27;ve always had good oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> I loved the two step process.</li>
            <li> I do think it&#x27;s a good idea, but am not yet convinced that it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a good amount of toothpastes and haven&#x27;t found one that had the three things I&#x27;m looking for:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> Brushing my teeth with a two-step process doesn&#x27;t take much more time than doing one step, and the results are incredible.</li>
            <li> It also has a good flavor.  </li>
            <li> And now I actually enjoy it because I know I am getting great results!</li>
            <li> The item did a good cleaning my mouth.</li>
            <li> Still, it made an improvement, and that&#x27;s a good thing.  </li>
            <li> I scored a free sample of this product and am so happy I did !!  </li>
            <li> I got it free from BzzAgent so that I could review it, and I think it is the best.</li>
            <li> A friend tested the product for me, and she loved it.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in time with a good quality.</li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> It may be doing a good job of cleaning my teeth, but it burns my tongue in the process.</li>
            <li> Step 1 tastes good - minty</li>
            <li> It leaves a good taste in the mouth also.</li>
            <li> It is a good whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> A good product, and one I will buy again, but</li>
            <li> It does not take any longer to brush your teeth, but you get superior whitening results.  </li>
            <li> This too may be a good thing, as it has me brushing longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a good texture too.</li>
            <li> I received my crest HD fhas an excellent from Smiley 360 a week ago, Crest has always had a fabulous product</li>
            <li> I feel like it did do a good job whitening and cleaning my teeth, but feel the after taste was not what I was used to or wanted.</li>
            <li> That is always a good thing!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> It’s a good feeling.  </li>
            <li> This seems like a good price because you get the whitener and toothpaste without the sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;Crest Pro Health HD</li>
            <li> Crest Prohealth HD is a good value because I can prevent cavities while I whiten my teeth and remove surface stains.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel really good after I brush.  </li>
            <li> his teeth are looking good.  </li>
            <li> TLDR; makes my mouth feel good, but the inconvenience of using with an electric toothbrush means I won&#x27;t continue to use it once it&#x27;s done.</li>
            <li> And I thought that was as good as it was going to get.</li>
            <li> good</li>
            <li> but otherwise it is good and does not irritate my gums.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> and/or effort is good in my book.</li>
            <li> The taste is good, and the two steps are not a hassle at all.</li>
            <li> As the package arrived I loved the presentation.</li>
            <li> The fact that I must use it faithful helps reinforce the oral hygiene good habit.</li>
            <li> Now that my teeth are looking good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit before trying this paste, I had sworn off Crest for good.</li>
            <li> and I totally loved it.</li>
            <li> I loved that this helped get rid of the surface stains.</li>
            <li> good tooth cleaning paste but weems like a lot of work for no noticeable difference in the color of my teeth</li>
            <li> I loved that.</li>
            <li> Aislinn the loved-</li>
            <li> It is as good as advertised.</li>
            <li> Step 1, the cleanser seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li> I still think it is a good product, if used sparingly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always taken good care of my teeth, brushing twice a day no matter what.  </li>
            <li> Best part of it all I got to try it for free from Crest and Bzz</li>
            <li> Good results.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t taste all that good either.</li>
            <li> The flavor of this toothpaste is good too - I&#x27;m a bit picky about that</li>
            <li> I received this for free from smiley360 to test out and the results were awesome!!</li>
            <li> I got this item free from Bzzagent and am impressed!!</li>
            <li> so I do have good oral hygiene.  </li>
            <li> For a whitening toothpaste I would say this is a good one to get.</li>
            <li> hold the maker P&amp;G in good esteem, so I had to try this product.</li>
            <li> After using for a couple of weeks, I think my teeth are a bit whiter, and the paste itself has a good flavor.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> you will probably need to do gel strips or see a dentist, but this is a good system if you want to just do it while brushing.</li>
            <li> My feeling was that the combo treatment wasn&#x27;t as good as using Crest&#x27;s 3D Polishing Treatment with Brilliance Boost.</li>
            <li> I have even noticed a good change in my breath, which to me</li>
            <li> I think it is a good product and would purchase it again&lt;</li>
            <li> The toothpaste part of step one tastes really good</li>
            <li> and i feel like you get a good amount of toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It tastes good.  </li>
            <li> As a coffee drinker, I noticed the difference in my teeth after about 3 days of usage (a good notice, as they&#x27;re whiter).  </li>
            <li> This product is so good.</li>
            <li> Brushing my teeth with a two-step process doesn&#x27;t take much more time than doing one step, and the results are incredible.</li>
            <li> good product.</li>
            <li> The step 1 paste has a good minty flavor...</li>
            <li> I received this for free and Crest Pro-health HD is the best toothpaste I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> I was given an opportunity to try this free through BzzzAgent, and I have to say, it was great!</li>
            <li> I must say this product is really good.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good product, but a bit pricy.</li>
            <li> but I have LOVED the results I have from using Crest HD.</li>
            <li> the end of the using the product I found my mouth feeling refreshed and smelling good.  </li>
            <li> good buy</li>
            <li> Although this might be a good product to try for those who don&#x27;t have time to set aside for that.</li>
            <li> Minty taste was superior to others.</li>
            <li> it is a good toothpaste that does have resutls</li>
            <li> Step 2 is a bleaching gel and doesn&#x27;t taste good.</li>
            <li> The taste is good to me-</li>
            <li> Again, maybe I have a predisposition with my teeth that does not allowing good whitening.</li>
            <li> IF the whitening portion of the toothpaste does as it claims, then I can see the product being a good value.</li>
            <li> Again, maybe I have a predisposition with my teeth that does not allowing good whitening.</li>
            <li> IF the whitening portion of the toothpaste does as it claims, then I can see the product being a good value.</li>
            <li> Took some time to see results but when I did I loved it.</li>
            <li> My teeth get a good cleaning with the grit of Step 1&#x27;s Purifying Cleanser.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I thought the product was good.</li>
            <li> has been sneaking my Crest Pro Health® HD because he has a lot of plaque and Step 1 makes him feel like he is doing something good for his health.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Crest Pro Health HD for over three weeks now and this is my review after a good usage of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crest Pro Health HD is a two step process to get Healthier and Whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> nothing else, this toothpaste has to be good for your oral health, as it is getting you to brush for longer.</li>
            <li> With that said, however, If your teeth could use some help and need to be whiter, than this could be a good product for you.</li>
            <li> The taste was good</li>
            <li> I have to say I was truly impressed how fresh my mouth stays throughout the night getting up with my newborn!  </li>
            <li> My teeth look and feel good! :)</li>
            <li> But the best part is the just-went-to-the-dentist clean feeling you get.</li>
            <li> My husband also used the toothpaste and was very happy with how his teeth looked and how clean his mouth fell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I noticed that my teeth felt clean and wonderful after each use.  </li>
            <li> wonderful because I remember the 1st time I used my electric toothbrush and my teeth felt like silk - so polished and clean</li>
            <li> Pros include:  Great price, great results, easy routine and</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed and decided to change it up going forward by doing a full two minutes on Step 1</li>
            <li> that &#x27;this must have been productive&#x27; kind of pleasant way.</li>
            <li> it is quick, painless and the results are great!!  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t believe this tooth paste is exceptional in whitening properties</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super awesome</li>
            <li> I received this from BzzAgent and LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!!  </li>
            <li> and I have to say that I am SUPER impressed!!</li>
            <li> My latest and what I thought would be greatest product I received (for free!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super impressed.</li>
            <li> Weirdness and all, I was super impressed.</li>
            <li> I must admit I wasn&#x27;t super impressed.  </li>
            <li> However, I was impressed from the first day!</li>
            <li> Add on top of that, the whitening ability to this kit and I&#x27;m in a happy spot.</li>
            <li> However, after getting a sample package and using it I am very, very pleased.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am very pleased with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> Love Crest Prohealth works great</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> So be warned, it doesn&#x27;t taste like toothpastes who say they try to taste great, but it doesn&#x27;t taste like you&#x27;re brushing with baking soda, either.  :)&#x27;</li>
            <li> So be warned, it doesn&#x27;t taste like toothpastes who say they try to taste great, but it doesn&#x27;t taste like you&#x27;re brushing with baking soda, either.  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> but it makes my teeth very smooth and feel like I was just at the dentist and got my teeth cleaned!</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro Health® HD for about two weeks now and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied will recommend to family and friends.  </li>
            <li> The answer does not matter to me as I am very pleased with the results and will continue to use both HD products.</li>
            <li> thought that it was very refreshing</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I will also continue to use it as I am so very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s 2.5 times more to pay - happy with the product but price point</li>
            <li> I have used the toothpaste once a day for three weeks and have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li> And how great is it that I got it free through BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> The toothpaste leaves my mouth/ breath smelling so great and feeling even better.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I think this combined with a tooth whitening strip would be the best combination for getting a whiter smile, but if you just need a refresher then this toothpaste works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> I received this to try as a promotion and was very pleased to be included.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got a chance to try it, because this product works really great.  </li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love a great compliment?</li>
            <li> This will be my go to product to make surely smile is at its best.</li>
            <li> And to my surprise, I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> The packaging is very attractive and colorful.</li>
            <li> That also means I had fairly stained teeth when I first tried this product, and I have to say I was impressed.  </li>
            <li> I received the Crest Pro-Health HD as a promotion and have been very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> Great product I will for sure be recommending to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the fact that the 2-step system has produced a very positive change in my tooth brushing habits.</li>
            <li> Shipping was perfect, arrived right when stated.</li>
            <li> The whiting aspect is fair but the best part of this product is how clean and healthy it makes your teeth feel</li>
            <li> a great toothpaste that leaves your teeth feeling very clean and polished.</li>
            <li> It is great tasting and leaves my mouth feeling very clean.  </li>

            <li> I was very happy to be able to try this free, because I had my doubts.</li>
            <li> I brush with it twice a day and my teeth feel great, look great, and they are not sensitive from it either which is a huge bonus!!!!</li>
            <li> I think a bright smile is the best accessory and very important in the business world as well.</li>

            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for over a month and love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much better than having to sit for 30 minutes with whitening strips in your mouth!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> This is extremely refreshing!</li>
            <li> but my wife has been kissing me a lot more!</li>
            <li> they look better too!  </li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t say for sure if the enamel is being stripped, but I have successfully lived by going with my gut feeling.  </li>
            <li> and I love it!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!</li>

            <li> I will for sure keep using this paste!</li>
            <li> and I love it!  </li>
            <li> I love this two-step toothpaste!</li>
            <li> This stuff was amazing, got a free sample to try by smiley360 and LOVED IT!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I got this as a free sample!!</li>
            <li> There are so many things I like about this product!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> My mouth has never felt or looked better!</li>
            <li> With this product I am able to quit wasting money on at home whitening kits that don&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> and I LOVE IT!.</li>
            <li> use my Sonicare toothbrush with the Crest Pro-Health HD system, and it works perfectly for me because I&#x27;ll know when my first minute is up</li>
            <li> and once it was gone I&#x27;ve bought more @Walmart!</li>
            <li> I’ve noticed they are getting more whiter and brighter!</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health HD is the most amazing product ever!</li>
            <li> Love how my teeth look and feel!</li>
            <li> added bonus is that after my latest dental appointment I can say this stuff is dentist approved!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> BUT, after trying it, I love it!  </li>
            <li> How great is that, right!?!  </li>
            <li> I would love if they had just a tooth paste that provided the awesome clean feeling.</li>
            <li> its a very effective way to clean your mouth and make your teeth whiter!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whereas I am not so happy with the Perfecting gel, it is too strong mint flavored and leaves a burning sensation in my mouth.</li>
            <li> This system is really easy an yields great results.</li>
            <li> At first I honestly was nervous to change toothpaste because I thought the one I was using was the best.</li>
            <li> Very Rare!! .</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say this is the most effective &amp; pleasant toothpaste I think I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> You brush first for one minute with the toothpaste which tastes minty and has a very pleasant flavor.</li>
            <li> It is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> step 2 gel makes my mouth feel amazing</li>
            <li> However, the results aren&#x27;t quite as amazing as when used as directed.  </li>
            <li> the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 1 month now and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> but its is an amazing product</li>

            <li> it was absolutely amazing</li>
            <li> For a free product it works great, but I would not pay $13 for it online or in store.</li>
            <li> Got Pro Health HD free from Crest to try and quite happy with it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but my teeth feel amazing</li>
            <li> SO amazing of a product.</li>
            <li> The smooth polished feel is great.</li>

            <li> This Crest Pro Health HD stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> We love how it freshens our breath and makes our teeth shine bright.</li>

            <li> amazing product.........</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I received a free trial from BzzAgent and am happy they introduced me to this product.</li>
            <li> Step 1 strips plaque away, and Step 2 polishes and whitens for an amazing experience.</li>

            <li> My breath was amazing.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro health HD is absolutely amazing. ..</li>
            <li> The Crest Pro-Health Two-Step system is amazing.</li>
            <li> , it also has whitened my teeth within one week of using it, so the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li> I had AMAZING results</li>
            <li> I liked this product to the point where I purchased another box at Walmart.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Final thoughts: Effective, yes, but with side effects.</li>
            <li> my review is completely my own thoughts and opinions.</li>
            <li> I also liked the taste of step 2.  </li>
            <li> but honestly I can not tell which picture is the before and which is the after.</li>
            <li> BUT I must say I am THRILLED with the results.  </li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own.”</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I liked the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> A couple of things to note about this product that I am not too thrilled about are:</li>
            <li> I must be honest</li>
            <li> Step two kind of tastes like the whitening strip paste</li>
            <li> Opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I brush my teeth three times a day and have gone through a variety of toothpastes trying to find one that I liked.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own without the whitening gel.  </li>
            <li> There was a nice minty, but not overbearing, taste after brushing as well.  </li>
            <li> I liked the two-step process.</li>
            <li> my own</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just a routine that has a nice ending....</li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I got this product thru bzzagent at no charge so that I can review it and give it my honest opinion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> but this has honestly changed my relationship with my toothpaste routine.</li>
            <li> Step 1 has a nice minty taste that doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The flavor is nice and minty.  </li>
            <li> But I found a remark in someone else&#x27;s review that I thought was amusing and not at all inaccurate.  </li>
            <li> recieved this product as part of a promotion all reviews are my own</li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> It also kind is a pain to use both products given.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> or I probably would not have purchased this on my own.  </li>
            <li> I liked a lot of things about Crest Pro Health HD.</li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of convenient that Crest has chosen to minimize that side effect through including a whitening agent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of convenient that Crest has chosen to minimize that side effect through including a whitening agent.  </li>
            <li> However, my analysis and opinion drawn from the results of use are that of my own.</li>
            <li> Thanks Crest for marketing this great product!</li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own.  </li>
            <li> I liked that it had the two steps</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s package nicely with both tubes together.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Crest Pro-Health HD two step whitening toothpaste for a couple of weeks and have been been loving the results.  </li>
            <li> feeling of the toothpaste kind of dries your mouth out...</li>
            <li> but my comments are my own.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s shame that i&#x27;m a smoker, but this item really good, make my teeth more cleaner.</li>
            <li> One nice thing is my Sonicare has a built in timer for two minutes.</li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> , I really LIKED this two-step process.  </li>
            <li> I liked this product.</li>
            <li> I was happy to be invited to this campaign (from Crest) as I love being able to try the newest dental products out on the market.  </li>
            <li> I feel like anyone can you their own toothpaste preference for step 1 and then use the step 2 product for whitening.</li>
            <li> I really liked that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In theory, that should be a good thing, but it feels too abrasive to be healthy.  </li>
            <li> I liked the recycled packaging of the Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It is effective, but I won&#x27;t recommend it if you are suffering from mouth ulcers.</li>
            <li> It is also kind of a pain having to use two separate steps without rinsing in between.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste is really, really nice.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I really was impressed.</li>
            <li> I received it from Crest/BzzAgent to try and provide my honest feedback</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> The purifying cleanser has kind of a foamy feel in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I also liked not having to bother with the strips, remembering which way they go on and having to throw them away because they get stuck and wadded up.  </li>
            <li> I am so impressed with how much whiter my teeth are.  </li>
            <li> I really liked that you didn&#x27;t have to keep the product away from your lips while using it.</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent and Crest, I tried this product for free!&lt;br /&gt;I am really happy with this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Step 1 is great as it has a grittiness to it that really cleans my teeth and a great mint taste, Step 2</li>
            <li> I have to say that I really liked this product.  </li>
            <li> and I actually really liked it alot.  </li>
            <li> All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> and honestly I cannot comment as yet as to whether or not my tooth sensitivity has improved.</li>
            <li> Step 1, the cleanser, has a nice wintergreen-type flavor.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m impressed with this gentle alternative to whitening strips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used whitening product because to be honest</li>
            <li> I like the nice minty taste of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of a pain to have to untwist a cap and deal with that when you have your toothbrush in hand</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I really liked the Crest Pro Health HD two step whitening system.</li>
            <li> It has done an incredibly job whitening my teeth but as a toothpaste alone it might be worth a try.  </li>
            <li> I will be honest though</li>
            <li> for my candid opinion, I will say that In the seventh grade I did a toothpaste research project for my science class testing all brands of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m writing this because I liked the product,</li>
            <li> would I buy this on my own, probably not.</li>
            <li> * Switching pastes halfway through brushing is kind of a pain in the neck.</li>
            <li> Whitens teeth nicely.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product.  </li>
            <li> I liked the 2-step process.  </li>
            <li> A flip lid on both tubes would be nice.  </li>
            <li> They did ask me to write a review, but I tried to be completely honest.</li>
            <li> I think that Crest Pro Health HD is a good product-it made my teeth a bit whiter and my mouth does feel healthy.  </li>
            <li> I liked the results from this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> All views and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I really liked the flavor of the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> but my opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> but I soon got use to that and liked it.</li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own</li>
            <li> These are my own views and opinions.</li>
            <li> It kind of reminds me of going to the dentist--they scrape all the gunk off your teeth and then polish them for you.</li>
            <li> I have since bought this toothpaste system on my own as well</li>
            <li> b/c it it kind of pricey,</li>
            <li> my dentist had told me that my teeth were good and healthy.</li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own</li>
            <li> The two-step system is kind of a pain to use if you don&#x27;t have a way to manage the amount of time you are supposed to be brushing with each paste;  I use a Sonicare</li>
            <li> so it beeps every thirty seconds and is handy for knowing when to switch from step one to step two.  </li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I do have nice looking teeth already</li>
            <li> Nor do I like the whitening strips that are so popular.  </li>
            <li> I would purchase this product on its own.</li>
            <li> My family is now using it and loving it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product and the opinions in this review are 100% my own</li>
            <li> So I guess I should expect this kind of reaction.</li>
            <li> I really liked it.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t mix them up, which is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li> It also contains hydrogen peroxide in the perfecting gel, which of course is a proven effective whitening and oral debriding agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> However, al of the opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> All in all I will continue to use the product and would probably continue purchasing on my own in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say I like it.  </li>
            <li> I liked the taste, thought the foam got around all of the teeth and think it&#x27;s a really nice improvement.</li>
            <li> I love the taste, and a good mouth feel.  </li>
            <li> Can they create a senstive teeth/gums version or would that not be effective in the whitening process?&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Toothpaste has a nice minty flavor&lt;</li>
            <li> I loved the taste of the cleanser and tasted somewhat like spearmint, which was so refreshing.</li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> As a coffee drinker my teeth looked kind of dingy.</li>
            <li> It is kind of a pain to brush two times, but I have truly noticed a difference in the way that my teeth look.  </li>
            <li> and I liked the results that I saw.</li>
            <li> I really liked using this.  </li>
            <li> Save your money with just the toothpaste, and ask your dentist for the best way to whiten your teeth if you really desire that.  </li>
            <li> But I have to honest</li>
            <li> Nice job, Crest</li>
            <li> and she told me that she liked it</li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own</li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> my own</li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> and my opinion is 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Step 1, the cleanser, has a nice wintergreen-type flavor.</li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Best of all, my teeth really are cleaner and brighter-looking.</li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own</li>
            <li> I honestly feel like the product worked for me.</li>
            <li> There were things I liked about the toothpaste and things I did not like about the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an issue with the two step system but the perfecting gel doesn&#x27;t taste nice at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely impressed with how much plague the toothpaste removes.</li>
            <li> because I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d have chosen this to try on my own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest  </li>
            <li> but my opinions are very much my own.</li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> It makes your mouth feel amazingly fresh and the whitening agent is incredible.  </li>
            <li> I wish there was some kind of strip included to judge the difference.  </li>
            <li> As a tax CPA, I drink more than my fair share of coffee at work.  </li>
            <li> Crest provided me with this system to test it out, and although I&#x27;ve been a fan of their whitening strips, I wasn&#x27;t sure this system could get me to give up my beloved baking soda/peroxide toothpaste.</li>
            <li> These opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> and if I hadn&#x27;t got the chance to try it for review, I probably would not have tried it on my own.  </li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own.  </li>
            <li> I really liked this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve kind of gotten used to it</li>
            <li> all, I really liked this system, and the pros outweigh the cons because of the whitening power.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own</li>
            <li> So I guess I should expect this kind of reaction.</li>
            <li> I also like that my husband can use the system, because you use it with your own toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I liked that I could control where I applied the gel, focusing it on my front teeth and avoiding my gums.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste for step one is grainy and the taste is not as good as many toothpastes.</li>
            <li> all, if you have good, healthy teeth and have used teeth whiteners without issue, I&#x27;d probably recommend this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li> At 12$ dollars/kit, it&#x27;s not cost effective for me to continue to use the product.  </li>
            <li> may be as effective at whitening as this.</li>
            <li> So my opinions are totally my own.</li>
            <li> I think that Crest Pro Health HD is a good product-it made my teeth a bit whiter and my mouth does feel healthy.  </li>
            <li> All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need that kind of negativity in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My dentist tells me we are supposed to brush for 2 minutes anyway, so the 2 steps just keeps me honest.  </li>
            <li> The dual process is kind of a hassle</li>
            <li> And I can honestly say that nothing has ever worked as well as Crest HD.</li>
            <li> I would however, purchase it on my own to keep using it.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Crest, for a great product!</li>
            <li> Honest.</li>
            <li> Honest.</li>
            <li> The packaging of the Crest Pro Health HD was eye catching.  </li>
            <li> Then, you brush with the (kind of flavorless) gel for one minute.</li>
            <li> wintergreen flavor was nice</li>
            <li> The product is effective but not in a week&#x27;s time frame.</li>
            <li> I liked the taste and ease of use.  </li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the system for about a week now and have seen nice results.  </li>
            <li> I actually liked the smell and the taste of a Step 1 Purifying Cleanser that uses Stannous Fluoride to strip away plaque.  </li>
            <li> My opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I started using warm water and it lessens the effect, although the feeling is still there.</li>
            <li> My husband also tried this product and asked if I would buy it again as he really liked it.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Crest Pro-Health HD to try and provide my honest feedback as a bzzagent.  </li>
            <li> my own based on my experience with the product.</li>
            <li> You just need to have a timer or a watch handy when brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has a nice texture and grit to it.</li>
            <li> and I was thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> However, I loved the smooth mint flavor of the toothpaste and my teeth did, in fact, feel cleaner throughout the day!  </li>
            <li> I love love love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> The Crest Pro Health System is easy and effective!</li>
            <li> and I thank Crest Pro Health® HD™ for making it so easy and effective!</li>
            <li> The best part was how quick and easy it was to use -</li>
            <li> This toothpaste makes my mouth feel very clean and leaves a good taste in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with this toothpaste and I am excited for the results once I finish my tubes.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant change in the whiteness of my teeth, but I was happy with the color of my teeth to begin with.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m excited to how my mouth feels after a month with this toothpaste!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get my Crest Prom Health HD in the mail!!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this new product!</li>
            <li> This 2 step process is the best new toothpaste I have ever used!</li>
            <li> This has a great taste and it makes your teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> I experienced no sensitivity, but my mouth feels so clean.</li>
            <li> It has a great minty taste, and leaves my teeth feeling clean after each brushing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I have been consistently using Pro-Health HD for over a month, and I&#x27;m satisfied with the result and am impressed with the amount of toothpaste and whitening gel that comes in the two tubes.</li>
            <li> Gives your teeth a great clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> My gums and teeth feel great and clean.  </li>
            <li> Each day feels like a great trip to the dentist, and I know my teeth are clean.</li>
            <li> Step one provides a great clean feeling, while step two has the whitening power in a one-two punch system.</li>
            <li> STEP 2  HAS PEROXIDE WHICH IS GREAT TO WHITEN AND CLEAN.</li>
            <li> I experienced no sensitivity, but my mouth feels so clean.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean afterwards and they are looking great.  </li>
            <li> I use a Sonicare electric toothbrush and had been previously happy about how clean my teeth felt using</li>
            <li> Both solutions have a pleasant taste and are easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use and makes your teeth feel amazing when you are done.</li>
            <li> But the best part is that after just a week or so, my once very sensitive teeth were not bothering me at all!</li>
            <li> Excellent product,  comes highly recommended.</li>
            <li> but the difference in how your teeth feel is pretty incredible.</li>
            <li> The flavor of Step one was very pleasant and it was super easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not time effective for me, sorry.&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention, Step 2 doesn&#x27;t really taste very good.  </li>
            <li> The two steps seemed daunting at first, but I was so impressed by how clean my teeth felt, and the feeling lasted almost all day!  </li>
            <li> Having an opportunity to try new Crest Pro Health HD through BzzAgent seemed ideal!  </li>
            <li> This new Crest Pro-Health HD tooth-whitening system provides excellent whitening with no sensitivity.</li>
            <li> THIS NEW PRODUCT IS THE BEST</li>
            <li> The timing was perfect because I have been wanting to try a new toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> (if I am thinking about my time it&#x27;s not such a good thing, but if I am thinking about my health it is a great thing!).  </li>
            <li> The two step process is easy, and both products are good tasting.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever washed your face with any St Ives Face Scrub and experienced the way your face feels super polished and buffed out, this is how your teeth will feel.  </li>
            <li> This product is a great value for quick results.</li>
            <li> and I am super happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> It was a good thought, and ok product, but it is not something I would go out and buy when I can use my favorite toothpaste and my whiten trays/whitening strips than use two toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this toothpaste to a friend just for the excellent cleaning ability, and chance that it&#x27;ll whiten better for them than it did for me.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt bright and strong after just once use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and promotes good brushing.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with how white my teeth are and how good they look after one use.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste works great, works fast, feels good.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The product is very easy to use-</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use, just two minutes twice a day.  </li>
            <li> that said, this is very strong stuff.</li>
            <li> very easy</li>
            <li> I have found that some minty toothpastes can be very strong in flavor that could even upset my stomach.  </li>
            <li> This was very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It was very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I found there to be some very strong pros and very strong detractors to this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This two-step toothpaste is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I gag every time I use step 1, very strong wintergreen flavor.</li>
            <li> After a week of using Crest Pro Health HD I still find its 2-step regimen very easy and convenient to use.</li>
            <li> more taste 3) more foam!  </li>
            <li> I think this product is awesome for people with sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I was because I really do love it!</li>
            <li> I was real excited to be chosen to try this product.  </li>
            <li> It also leaves my mouth and breath very fresh and pleasant.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a great product, I love what it&#x27;s done for my smile!</li>
            <li> Super Super Happy!</li>
            <li> I received a sample before the release from Smiley360, I love this amazing product.</li>
            <li> So far one of the best toothpaste brands that I have tried.</li>
            <li> The taste of the paste is also great and leaves my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best toothpaste set I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Wow, this product was great!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> Works great, whitens teeth, leaves your mouth feeling fresh</li>
            <li> I loved these detailed instructions</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for nearly 2 months now and have LOVED the results!!</li>
            <li> It has a nice minty flavor that is not at all overpowering, it reminds me of some of my favorite gums.</li>
            <li> There are two steps to complete the process of whitening and cleaning your teeth which should be done twice a day for the best results.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Taste is nice, refreshing and minty without the &#x27;fluoride&#x27; taste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The best part of my experience so far with Crest Pro Health® HD™?</li>
            <li> Besides the whitening aspect, I liked that the two step process made me spend more time brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> It is by far the best whitening toothpaste system I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> As far as ease of use, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> I loved these detailed instructions</li>
            <li> I use it with a sonic care which I believe makes it more effective.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample from BzzAgent and after trying it my teeth have never felt so good.</li>
            <li> so I would have liked this more if it was just one tube to dealt with.</li>
            <li> My breath was fresh and my gums looked great.  </li>
            <li> this was one of the most amazing products I had used for my teeth.</li>
            <li> The mint flavor made the whitening process kind of enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with the results of this toothpaste so far, and plan on continuing to use</li>
            <li> It works, and my mouth feels clean and tastes pleasant -</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t enjoy the 2 step process, wish it was an all in one, but over all good.</li>
            <li> a matter of fact, my FAVORITE aspect of using Crest Pro Health HD is the amazing &amp;#34;fresh from the dentist CLEAN&amp;#34; feeling I get each time I use it.</li>
            <li> It is by far the best product I have tested through that program.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not a smoker - nevertheless my teeth had yellowed more than I would&#x27;ve liked</li>
            <li> Step 1 has a pleasant taste and makes my teeth feel insanely clean.  </li>
            <li> Wow, Crest Pro Health HD is the best at-home whitening I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It even tastes clean and pleasant -</li>
            <li> It even tastes clean and pleasant -</li>
            <li> Even though Crest Pro-health HD seemed to give me a brighter smile a result which I am happy about.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth this may not be the best for you...  </li>
            <li> I gave this product a good try for 2 weeks after receiving it free as a BzzAgent from Crest.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I received a sample from Crest and BzzAgent to review with my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> It gives your mouth a very fresh feel, but it doesn&#x27;t taste good.  </li>
            <li> so I am sure happy that Step 2 makes me teeth super</li>
            <li> The product is very easy to use, and the flavor is mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li> right now.&lt;br /&gt;I was eager to try tis product solely because of the reputation of the Crest brand and was looking forward to great</li>
            <li> think Crest is on the right track for a great product, but they still have some work to do.  </li>
            <li> The newness of the feel was quickly diminished when we saw how amazingly it worked!</li>
            <li> and I think the product is easy to use!</li>
            <li> This is so easy because all your doing is brushing!</li>
            <li> Easy to use!  </li>
            <li> It was surprisingly easy to incorporate the two steps!</li>
            <li> The 2 step system is easy to follow and doesn&#x27;t require any wait time!</li>
            <li> The  two step system is easy and  you can spit  after step one, but no rinsing!</li>
            <li> Its ridiculously easy: brush with #1, spit, brush with #2, then spit and rinse - DONE!</li>
            <li> EASY TO USE!  </li>
            <li> Easy peasy!</li>
            <li> The two step process is easy!</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste is a good system for getting a great clean while also helping to remove stains and provide a whiter smile.</li>
            <li> liked the very clean feeling after brushing with both steps.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that this is one of the BEST products I have used in a long time that has amazing results.</li>
            <li> I first tried this when I received a free product sample as part of the BzzAgent program and after three days of use, I was so impressed with my results that I ordered three more to share with family members.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am happy with the product because despite the discomfort, I am seeing results I am happy with.  </li>
            <li> After just one use, I was amazed to discover my teeth felt as clean as they do after a good dental cleaning.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for clean teeth and mouth, this is a good product.  </li>
            <li> It is a good product, but I do not see much difference whitening wise.  </li>
            <li> I take great pride in my smile and am always perusing the dental isles looking for something that will be even better.  </li>
            <li> But, I would imagine it would be more effective if my teeth were more stained to begin with.</li>
            <li> has not made my teeth more sensitive, so I&#x27;m happy!  </li>
            <li> I loved the clean that I received when using the Step 1 Purifying Cleanser.</li>
            <li> He said I was doing a really great job flossing, and honestly, I don’t floss as much as I should.</li>

            <li> Just after the first use I noticed a great change in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li> The first step tastes great.  </li>
            <li> I am an avid coffee and wine drinker with what I think are great teeth.</li>
            <li> Wait a week for full results then show off your beautiful smile !</li>
            <li> After the first brushing, my teeth felt great even though I just went to the dentist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The taste isn&#x27;t that great at first</li>
            <li> First couple days I thought it was great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, the sucralose ingredient in the whitening gel leaves an after-taste that&#x27;s too sweet, but can be mitigated with a good water rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I got this from bzzagent and thought that it was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> but it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> but it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> #34;This is a good way of getting me to brush for a full 2 minutes&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;-High</li>

            <li> Denial health is very important to me.</li>
            <li> The whitening paste makes your teeth feel very smooth</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t taste much for the whitening paste, which is good since most don&#x27;t taste that great!</li>
            <li> It was very smooth.  </li>
            <li> I think they look &amp;#34;healthier&amp;#34; and that is very important to me.</li>
            <li> Oral care is very important to me</li>
            <li> Okay, positives first: Great packaging.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In addition to keeping the stains away, the toothpaste leaves my mouth feeling fresh and has a pleasant flavor.</li>
            <li> since I&#x27;ve never tried any product with this quick or good of a result.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is quite a pleasant minty taste and leaves my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> I studied my teeth in the mirror before my first use to get a good image in my mind of their appearance and honestly, they were dingy.</li>
            <li> this is you are looking for something easy to use and effective.  </li>
            <li> I found that Crest ProHealth HD worked effectively and it was easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is easy and effective.</li>
            <li> I received Crest HD to try for free and I love it!</li>
            <li> Tried it for free and am I ever glad I had the opportunity!</li>
            <li> I got to try this for free as a part of a BzzAgent campaign, and I am really glad I did!</li>
            <li> I got my kit as a free sample which made it all the better!</li>
            <li> I got the opportunity to sample the Crest ProHealth HD for free (#GotItFree) and really love it!</li>
            <li> I have to say that I greatly enjoy this Crest Pro - Health product and love the results!</li>
            <li> i got a kit of the crest pro health hd 2 step toothpaste for free through bzzagent and i am so glad i got a chance to try it!</li>
            <li> I received this kit for free from crest as a trial and boy am I glad I had the chance to try this out!  </li>
            <li> Leaves your teeth feeling clean and smooth, your breath very nice and refreshing, and whitens your teeth to boot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super convenient, and really the best whitening system we&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li> I love this great tasting toothpaste, and would suggest it to anyone looking for a toothpaste that promotes a clean and fresh feeling mouth and whiter teeth!</li>
            <li> , I am very pleased with how clean my teeth feel and</li>
            <li> Give it a try for a beautiful, clean smile.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s a certain potency or, may I say, stinging to the cleaning process, but a good rinse at the end with warm water remedies</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy that I got to try this product free from Crest/Bzz as part of brand promotion, but it is worth the price</li>
            <li> The whitening is also a huge advantage!  </li>
            <li> After the 1st use I noticed a huge difference!</li>
            <li> Noticed a huge improvement in just 1 use!</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t quite been a week and my teeth are brighter and after every brush it is cleaner than my mouth feels leaving the dentist, without the huge bill!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a difference in my gums but also in how my teeth just feel better.</li>
            <li> OK, but 6x whiter?</li>
            <li> However the product works better than cheaper &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I also find myself rinsing a lot more to get the product out of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I pay greater attention to the time I spend brushing because of the two-step process.</li>
            <li> Step two doesn&#x27;t taste as good but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> I was a smoker for many years, so I have had plenty of experience with whitening products.  </li>
            <li> It making my teeth whiter I been using it for 1 week with lovely results.  </li>
            <li> it is more of a gel-</li>
            <li> and it is quite enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I tried the Crest Pro Health HD system by Crest in return for a review and was hoping for the best as I&#x27;ve always had issues getting my teeth white (years of drinking coffee).</li>
            <li> This tube doesn&#x27;t have the most pleasurable taste at all</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like Step-2 added an invisible, magical force field to my teeth to repel any and all build</li>
            <li> It tastes a lot like the stuff that&#x27;s on a Crest WhiteStrip, so definitely not the greatest taste in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I have tried many teeth whitening products over the years, but never stuck with any of them.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> I would be able to keep up this 2 step process for more than a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> No way would I be able to keep this up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to keep it up all week without a problem and plan on keeping it up since it has been so easy.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I love my HD Crest toothpaste...</li>
            <li> But after so many years, I wrote it off as, \\&quot;well, time to go the dentist and get the job</li>
            <li> I LOVE the way my teeth feel after.</li>
            <li> You can visit their website for more details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the taste of step one and sorta dislike the taste of step 2</li>
            <li> I love how my teeth are whiter and feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> What I REALLY love is the way my teeth &amp; mouth feel afterwards.</li>
            <li> I love the results of whitening strips</li>
            <li> I continued to see my brightness improve the more I used it.  </li>
            <li> Some things I love, some are just okay.</li>
            <li> Not too many people will be able to afford this product.</li>
            <li> I would also want better results for the retail price.</li>
            <li> When I received the package, I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like using a toothpaste that required two steps.  </li>
            <li> We were provided this product for free to try from BzzAgent and Crest!</li>
            <li> and I do a better job at brushing.</li>
            <li> I love this kit.</li>
            <li> but I must say that I enjoyed this product better.</li>
            <li> My teeth seem brighter, but more time will tell.</li>
            <li> You brush your teeth for two minutes twice a day--one minute for each step--and you get visibly whiter, brighter, more even-toned teeth.</li>
            <li> so perhaps I am more maintaining with this</li>
            <li> i love this  </li>
            <li> I got a sample of this to try for free and give my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> the flavor for the HD is more subtle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but this did not happen in a week, it took more like two weeks or more to achieve a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> The flavor is also okay.</li>
            <li> product is a 2-part whitening and better oral health product that claims to work within a week.</li>
            <li> I really love the taste of the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Within a week you really notice a difference and your teeth look and feel great.  </li>
            <li> I will say that my teeth and gums do feel healthy, but the reason I tried this was for the whitening.</li>
            <li> review is in return for enjoying this product FREE from Crest!</li>
            <li> I have found that many whitening products burn my mouth, but this product does not do that.</li>
            <li> I feel myself smiling more these days to show off my pearly whites :)</li>
            <li> To me this works better than the strips and there is never any sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this toothpaste and would buy it again.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this toothpaste, which I received free from Crest!!</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> On top of the color, once i finish with step 2</li>
            <li> I love the two-step system.</li>
            <li> I am not a cola, coffee, or tea drinker, and I don&#x27;t smoke, so I don&#x27;t have surface stains, but I can still see notable improvements in the color of my teeth after just 10 days of use.</li>
            <li> chair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product as part of a promotion from Crest, but I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> My teeth did whiten some, even my crowns looked better.</li>
            <li> I feel my oral health is much better now after using this product.  </li>
            <li> I love that this product can help me by removing plaque and reducing my chances of getting gingivitis.  </li>
            <li> I needed to know that it was safe before using it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried it and am using it.  </li>
            <li> Glad I tried and now my wife and friend will be checking it out too.</li>
            <li> love the 2 step system.</li>
            <li> 2 steps are too many.</li>
            <li> They both leave a refreshing taste...and my teeth have indeed whitened.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to feel the difference before but</li>
            <li> I think I am even beginning to notice a change with how my teeth look. :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I had a visit to my dentist and my hygienist noted that my teeth look great and it was obvious I was doing a good job brushing</li>
            <li> It seems to be much more than that, though...</li>
            <li> and  I feel this step whitens better than anything on the market.</li>
            <li> Got it free from Bzz Agent for reviewing purposes!</li>
            <li> With this two-step toothpaste, I am able to whiten while brushing and see immediate results.</li>
            <li> The product is much easier to use than the trays or strips and seems to have great results.  </li>
            <li> I really liked how smooth my teeth felt from the polishing step.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest Pro-Health HD for more than a week now twice a day</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt or look more cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I love it .  </li>
            <li> What else is better than this.</li>
            <li> I found this system to be a much better alternative to whitening strips or</li>
            <li> Did i notice better morning breath?</li>
            <li> Not overly minty but still fresh, which I loved.  </li>
            <li> I probably paid more attention to the health of my teeth than ever before and have grown to realize my teeth deserve the attention.  </li>
            <li> I have to say, I didn&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> I just love not having that fuzzy feeling on my teeth.....</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d love for this to work</li>
            <li> Overall very impressed with the product for the price.</li>
            <li> and it added more whitening for sure.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t felt any sensitivity on my gums or teeth for using it, but the box does warn that it can happen, I love it and will keep on using it, maybe longer use will get better results in the whiting department</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Let me start off saying that this is probably a fantastic product for SOMEONE ELSE!  </li>
            <li> AND you brush more, which is also better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The flavors aren&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Some toothpastes can be overwhelming with the mint flavor</li>
            <li> I also really love the way my teeth feel after.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I got this product free as a BzzAgent to try!</li>
            <li> I would also like for it to have more of a minty taste.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure and read the directions in the package, as I get the impression if you don&#x27;t follow that, it won&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and can&#x27;t believe the results.</li>
            <li> Love the way this works.</li>
            <li> I like to cook a lot, and when I make something at home, I always think that it tastes better because I put all of that work into making it myself.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> even more so, my teeth have never felt cleaner.</li>
            <li> I was glad that I could try out the Crest Pro Health HD two step system for BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I made sure not to rinse my mouth in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Been many, many months now</li>
            <li> I mentioned the Crest Pro Health HD cleaning system and she was very impressed with the results after only one month.  </li>
            <li> The whole process takes about 4-5 minutes and my mouth feels great for hours.  </li>
            <li> : The two step process forces me to spend more time brushing my teeth, instead of rushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the results weren&#x27;t as prominent.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take any more time out of my brushing routine to use.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to receive my free Smiley360 kit for the Crest Pro-health HD.</li>
            <li> I would expect to see an even more noticeable difference the longer</li>
            <li> for whiter teeth, her teeth seem to have responded better than mine.  </li>
            <li> I do feel that my teeth and gums look and feel healthy, I just which sensitivity was not a side effect.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the flavor of the Step 1 toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use the product for another month and then I will be able to tell you if my teeth look whiter.</li>
            <li> I love how coffee and tea stains don&#x27;t even appear anymore.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I had an opportunity to try this product...</li>
            <li> I love fruits</li>
            <li> and we have to say that we absolutely love how this product leaves our teeth feeling.  </li>
            <li> AND I now have whiter, brighter, cleaner teeth and better smelling</li>
            <li> But I was so pleased when my spouse noticed the change.  </li>
            <li> I am a smoker, coffee drinker, and love soda</li>
            <li> I used it for a week straight and felt great about the shade of white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I love that I can use Crest ProHealth HD to brighten up my teeth on any given day</li>
            <li> I was able to sample this 2 step toothpaste through bzzagent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like the two step process of brushing.  </li>
            <li> and I thought this one probably wouldn&#x27;t be any better</li>
            <li> This is what I&#x27;m most pleased about</li>
            <li> , I received this for free, and am now a convert to the HD Two-Step Toothpaste by Crest!</li>
            <li> The two step process doesn&#x27;t take much more time -- you do step 1, spit without rinsing, and then do step 2.</li>
            <li> I love that this is a pro health and whitening in one.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t notice anything off-putting now and love that it has whitened my teeth.</li>
            <li> and I am smiling with more confidence.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use for a couple more months in hopes that they do.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the feeling after using this product.</li>
            <li> Bzz Agent Opinionated here, with the latest on Crest Pro Health® HD™.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really glad I had the opportunity to try it.  </li>
            <li> My teeth have a nice smooth surface as well.</li>
            <li> Step 2 was a lot better.  </li>
            <li> Ok so im a bzz agent.  </li>
            <li> I did appreciate the flip top opening, though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as if having a longer process has convinced me that I need to take better care to do the tooth brushing procedure with more</li>
            <li> I love love teeth whitening products.  </li>
            <li> I felt more confident after using this toothpaste</li>
            <li> /&gt;I can recommend this to anyone and most of all, no sensitivity problems, which I was worried about too.  </li>
            <li> I was able to try this product as a BzzAgent member.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure out how toothpaste would be able to whiten my teeth in a week.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste makes your teeth and gums feel so much better, cleaner and healthier.</li>
            <li> This paste tastes great, freshens your mouth, and makes everything feel super clean.  </li>
            <li> I was able to review this product courtesy of Crest.</li>
            <li> I love this system.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to but another whitening product any more</li>
            <li> I love the Crest Pro Health HD that I received free from Crest through BzzAgent to try!  </li>
            <li> They are better at removing the surface staining.</li>
            <li> because I wasnt sure if I could brush with my tongue and the roof of my mouth with the Pro-Health ...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Also I didn&#x27;t take a before picture so there may be more of a change, but I just didn&#x27;t notice since it was gradual.  </li>
            <li> Love the Crest HD.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about my coffee or favorite garlicky foods lingering on my breathe</li>
            <li> ok, they want to scrub the tartar and stains away.</li>
            <li> not so good:&lt;br /&gt;My gums where I use the product in step 2, which is the front area of my top and bottom teeth</li>
            <li> I like the separation of the tooth care and whitening; it feels like it is more specialized.</li>
            <li> Her smile is already perfect, so she doesn&#x27;t need much help.</li>
            <li> Her smile is already perfect, so she doesn&#x27;t need much help.</li>
            <li> and I love this product so much more than I ever imagined that I would.</li>
            <li> I read the instructions on the box to make sure that I was using the toothpaste correctly and gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use it, and hope that over more time the whitening effects will improve.</li>
            <li> After using it now for two weeks, i can safely say that it somewhat helps in keeping my teeth whiter.</li>
            <li> If nothing else, I&#x27;m glad that Pro-Health HD made me realize this.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> I am always glad it is over.</li>
            <li> I did receive a free sample but will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> I love the way that my teeth look and feel.  </li>
            <li> and i am always changing up the toothpaste i buy to see if i can find something better and better.</li>
            <li> i did receive this product to try for free, but the reviews that i am sharing are all my own.</li>
            <li> Most whitening toothpasts will do that.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I always feel confident after brushing with this product - fresher breath, and whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind not being able to rinse my mouth out between steps, but it did bother me that I would brush my tongue after Step 1, and then have to rinse my toothbrush before Step 2 (which I feel like would defeat the purpose of not rinsing - it wiped out most of the residue</li>
            <li> results were fantastic!  </li>
            <li> enjoyed the taste.</li>
            <li> taste, although I prefer a more &amp;#34;Minty Taste&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure under a microscope</li>
            <li> You will find this with most whitening products.</li>
            <li> and I love this product.</li>
            <li> I was able to try a free sample of Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste and I really liked the results I saw.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that my morning breath seemed better</li>
            <li> but I love the way my mouth felt after using it.</li>
            <li> The two minutes each morning and night helped me establish a better routine.</li>
            <li> Enjoyable.</li>
            <li> but I must say this is phenomenal  </li>
            <li> Overall impressed by the time I have to put in and the job that this product does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I have it and plan on rebuying as soon as I can.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many tooth whiteners before.  </li>
            <li> I think this product is ok</li>
            <li> I love to drink tea, coffee, and wine...</li>
            <li> My teeth feel healthy and they look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking for good plaque control, cavity control, fresh breath and whitening all in one product.</li>
            <li> I love Crest Pro Health HD.  </li>
            <li> I was able to tolerate the taste for the 1 minute that it takes to brush</li>
            <li> Mostly I like the toothpaste, but there are a couple of things I dislike.  </li>
            <li> I understand some people will love a product and others will say eh.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> so I made sure I scheduled a cleaning before even opening the box.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m looking forward to the results with the end of the tubes :)</li>
            <li> You get the same tingling as you do from the strips and equally as impressive results.</li>
            <li> I love my coffee, which does a number on teeth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know for sure if it worked, but it sure felt like it did.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure my teeth were whiter but</li>
            <li> However, it may have more to do with the extended brushing.</li>
            <li> After six days of using both tubes twice a day, I can tell you my teeth were whiter and better yet</li>
            <li> But it does require more time.</li>
            <li> I am able to use Crest Pro Health HD twice a day with no issues.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I believed using two products would make a difference...</li>
            <li> and I have to say I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use the product to see if there is any more change in shade.  </li>
            <li> I would like to thank Crest ant BzzAgent for the opportunity to try this :-)</li>
            <li> I am used to a more pronounced flavor of toothpaste, but when I tried this the flavor was more mellow</li>
            <li> I love that the whitening is part of a system because it&#x27;s easier to make into a habit.  </li>
            <li> It takes some adjusting since I&#x27;m not used to having 2 tubes and taking more time to brush.  </li>
            <li> Got this as a free trial from Crest then also bought another on my own so my wife could use it.  </li>
            <li> It seems to have done the job better than all of those combined.</li>
            <li> This product is better than most I have tried</li>
            <li> and I love the results.  </li>
            <li> I cannot speak on the gingivitis as well as I have healthy teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> , there are also many more benefits to this product than the whitening.</li>
            <li> sure does what it promises.  </li>
            <li> I told my husband it was OK for him to try it out instead of me - he asked me, I didn&#x27;t ask him BTW.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed, however, if my teeth are whiter, so I might give the product more time to see if I can notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I love most about the 2 part system</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> To me, I love the taste.</li>
            <li> Tube number 2 is cumbersome and needs a flip top cap like tube number 1.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> And, the best part is, it doesn&#x27;t take any extra time!</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve never tried this on my own without getting this for free to test out through Bzzagent.  </li>
            <li> but I took a star off because I felt that this would have been better if step 2</li>
            <li> Maybe it will take some more time.  </li>
            <li> I got to try this for free, but these opinions are my own.  </li>
            <li> This is a 2 step process, which i was like, ugh, who has time in the morning for one more thing.  </li>
            <li> , I received the product free as part of a promotion from Crest!</li>
            <li> The teeth cleansing system is an interesting experience.</li>
            <li> Its an OK product, I would say if you want to try it once and see for yourself go ahead</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take up more of your time, but there are habits that need to be adjusted.</li>
            <li> I have been complemented on my whiter teeth, and my favorite benefit is having fresher breathe when I wake up each morning.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad to have the opportunity to try the product before buying.</li>
            <li> : Make sure to spit and rinse since there’s a warning on the container not to swallow the gel.</li>
            <li> I am pleased to tell you that since trying out this product I have noticed a change in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li> After about a week of brushing - I noticed that my teeth were indeed whiter. :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Brushing twice vs whitening strips is much more convenient to me.</li>
            <li> Love this product though and it will by toothpaste system from here on out.</li>
            <li> they even became more polished.</li>
            <li> I love the way my teeth feel now.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclosure I got a free trial of this product from Crest, but my review is entirely my own opinion.</li>
            <li> After all, whitening your teeth can take time, and I wanted to make sure I could see any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Love that feeling.</li>
            <li> However, the greatest thing is that the whitening actually works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I haven&#x27;t been 100% diligent using this at every opportunity, but I will say that somehow the &amp;#34;two tube&amp;#34; system that they have makes me more encouraged to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> but i love it.</li>
            <li> I used to brush my teeth in 15 seconds and be done, now i consciencely take two minutes and as a result take better care of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I think I could have had better results with just a day or two of WhiteStrips.</li>
            <li> love Crest.</li>
            <li> I love that this toothpaste provides me with cleaner and whiter teeth without having to pay hundreds of dollars to my dentist.</li>
            <li> I also did notice my teeth are whiter, this is not drastic and though my husband noticed, it might just have been because he was looking for it &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> The two step process encourages me to brush more thoroughly and for a longer time, which has to help with dental health.</li>
            <li> Although I was provided a free sample of this product in exchange for my candid opinion, I will say that In the seventh grade I did a toothpaste research project for my science class testing all brands of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> time you&#x27;re at Target Walgreens or Walmart- pop it in your cart and give it a shot :-)</li>
            <li> You would think that a 2-step program would require more time brushing but this system doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how it was going to work.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks I noticed even more results.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with the fact that it only takes two minutes twice a day.  </li>
            <li> its actually whitening my teeth and its awesome!</li>
            <li> The whitening gel tastes a bit like peroxide, but since you are using it on your brush without rinsing, the taste of the toothpaste masks most of the yucky taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> There is not too much more to say except just brush your teeth &amp;#34;twice&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I love the product and am so glad I had the chance to try it.</li>
            <li> I hear about a product with magical claims, and dismiss them as marketing &amp;#34;mumbo jumbo&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> But, I am pleased to say that their claims are sincere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not because they are putting me up to anything or rewarding me in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to say I love this product and saw an improvement within 4 days of using it.</li>
            <li> had I been able to continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> but I think it would take some more time for anything visible.</li>
            <li> I got this Crest HD kit free through Bzzagent!</li>
            <li> I am glad I did not spend money on this.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using the Crest Pro Health HD product.</li>
            <li> I love Crest for all there products, and this did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> It came in perfect time, since I was already planning to get the white teeth strips.</li>
            <li> The one improvement I would suggest is making the cap on product 2 a flip top as the cap is on product 2 -</li>
            <li> I wanted to be sure about the whitening aspect</li>
            <li> Plus the two tubes take up more space in my medicine cabinet.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the way this system makes my mouth feel.</li>
            <li> This is a warning that Crest has listed, so I know many consumers experience this reaction.</li>
            <li> My mouth has only shed 1 the surface layer once, which is the best I&#x27;ve experience since the whitening craze took over the toothpaste aisle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried SO many of them.  </li>
            <li> and the gel smooths everything over; both are refreshingly minty.  </li>
            <li> I really love the product, but I take one star off for two reason:  </li>
            <li> do love the taste.</li>
            <li> So, yes, the Crest Pro Health® HD™ _did_ whiten my teeth as promised - not dramatically, but I think with extended usage, the whitening would become more</li>
            <li> I am pleased that Crest continues to develop ever improved product offering.</li>
            <li> The packaging of step two wasn&#x27;t much better.</li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t for the packaging I would love this product, but the packaging makes me unsure I&#x27;d want to continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> and I love this product.</li>
            <li> To top it off, I just went in for my semi-annual cleaning today and my hygienist commented on the lack of tartar and staining on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> What I love most is that polished feeling</li>
            <li> It would just make it more convenient for the consumer.</li>
            <li> You will love the way your teeth feel like you visited the Denitist</li>
            <li> and you will love the results.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love anything I can use that</li>
            <li> I also make sure I get every portion of my mouth, so I work in quadrants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re a better dental patient than I am, you&#x27;re probably already brushing for two minutes.</li>
            <li> My dentist will be pleased, I&#x27;m sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you absolutely love drooling on yourself.  </li>
            <li> I honestly cannot notice any huge difference in whiteness.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t agree 100% because the act of brushing it around your teeth and gums seems like more focused coverage to me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to go back to the dentist because I KNOW that they will be impressed with how healthy my teeth and gums are.</li>
            <li> he bottom of the toothbrush) in combination with the toothpaste and found much better results and faster results.</li>
            <li> I could tell more of a difference with this than whitestrips.</li>
            <li> Wish the results were more striking faster.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was an ok product - my teeth were whiter</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> Honestly, if I had not have been given this for free to try, then I probably would not have bought this.</li>
            <li> I truly love this and have been telling everyone about it.</li>
            <li> Love that I can kill two birds with one stone - whiten without sacrificing a quality brush.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with the product, the second day I used it my husband asked me what I was doing.  </li>
            <li> My teeth have mostly been stained from coffee, I don&#x27;t smoke or drink.  </li>
            <li> I feel more confident smiling in pictures now.</li>
            <li> This is now my favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Interesting product.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> I am noticing that over time they are looking much better, too.</li>
            <li> In addition to the whitening, this is a notable product for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It would make it a lot more convenient.</li>
            <li> Love the Crest Pro Health that I received from Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li> I do like getting a better quality whitener from just a toothpaste versus using strips though.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> , Let&#x27;s try one more time&#x27;</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love this process much better.  </li>
            <li> so I see the need to brush more often.</li>
            <li> but like i said your teeth feel better and cleaner when you use it</li>
            <li> The step 2 paste was really interesting.  </li>
            <li> I was able to try this product through Bzzagent.  </li>
            <li> The taste wasn&#x27;t my favorite</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not terrible.  </li>
            <li> I will admit, I love having cleen teeth.</li>
            <li> I got the opportunity to sample the Crest ProHealth HD for free and loooove it!</li>
            <li> I got it free from Crest all for being a BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> I love this tooth paste.  </li>
            <li> I have never found a toothpaste that works better.  </li>
            <li> and I am getting more used to the taste and tingle of Step 2.  </li>
            <li> Just wish they&#x27;d use a sugar alcohol in place, but I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a reason.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this to someone who is looking to start a whitening regime but isn&#x27;t sure where to start.</li>
            <li> I love the way this tastes, and feels.</li>
            <li> but I love this.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my teeth feel after brushing.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more Crest Pro-Health HD when my free bottles run out!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really more like 4 1/2 stars to me.  </li>
            <li> The most important thing is that it works!  </li>
            <li> It starts to irritate my gums if I use it more than once a day.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m already watching the timer to make sure I&#x27;m brushing thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> , if you spend just a moment reading the label on the toothpaste, this interesting gem comes up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, the separate steps produce a better result.</li>
            <li> I love going to the dentist, and my mouth feels like I have been to the dentist every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure how to do the routine.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should stick with the 2 minutes between the 2 toothpastes or add 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I decided I was over thinking &#x3D;) and just did each toothpaste for 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thank you Crest for letting me try Crest Pro Health HD for free!</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I was asked to try this product for free!</li>
            <li> Thank you Crest for allowing me to try the product for free!</li>
            <li> The results after just a couple days of use were fantastic!</li>
            <li> through BzzAgent, I could already tell it would become my favorite toothpaste ever</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I used this for a couple of weeks before writing a review.</li>
            <li> While I did not see my teeth lighten by 6 shades as promised, they are noticeably smoother and more polished, and have that &amp;#34;I just came from the dentist&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li> I have been extremely pleased by this product and would recommend it highly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> did receive this product for free to review from Crest through Bzz Agent, but my opinion is my own.</li>
            <li> After two weeks use, my mouth felt better than before.</li>
            <li> And it was more than the whiteness; it felt healthier and clearer.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried it</li>
            <li> After a couple more days, the numbness went away.  </li>
            <li> I was glad I did.</li>
            <li> And they were even more noticeably whiter after one week.</li>
            <li> Not only does it do an awesome job by whitening my teeth, it feels good and leaves my mouth feeling fresh and healthy.</li>
            <li> My teeth, that is :)</li>
            <li> Honestly,not sure if I would purchase this product yet,</li>
            <li> and I would love to continue using this product</li>
            <li> I woke up in the morning with NO horrible morning breath taste in my mouth!</li>
            <li> Yeah, my teeth seem more white/brighter than a week ago.  </li>
            <li> The taste is good and as i have already mentioned, it makes my mouth feel fresh and cleaner for a longer time than</li>
            <li> But I would surely recommend using it once for sure.</li>
            <li> This even made my fianc&amp;eacute; have to use it :)  </li>
            <li> I thought this would be more time consuming</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m much more used to the routine.</li>
            <li> Received this product for free in the mail by the Smiley program!</li>
            <li> Much better now.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t love stannous fluoride.</li>
            <li> I just prefer one step, but this is a refreshing paste.  </li>
            <li> It takes more time without the added benefit of making my teeth any whiter.</li>
            <li> The dentist did notice that my gums were in better shape.  </li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I tested it for 1 week then compared a before and after to see if their claim of &amp;#34;6x healther teeth &amp; 6x whiter teeth in 1 week&amp;#34; was an accurate claim, and I can honestly say I feel like I got an even better result than that.  </li>
            <li> I really love the way this feels after i use both steps.</li>
            <li> I would buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this for the last two weeks and am very impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> and I loved the minty fresh breath.</li>
            <li> And as an added bonus makes my breath so much better.</li>
            <li> Not any more.</li>
            <li> My breath has never been better.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)  </li>
            <li> Crest even let me try it out for free through BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> This gel tastes more like a product from the dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> In my experience, those strips whitened my teeth faster and more noticeably.  </li>
            <li> This Pro Health HD product seems to me better at reducing stains or maintaining whiteness than whitening itself.  </li>
            <li> As I have found most whitening systems do not work.</li>
            <li> But I fell in love with the crest 2 step system.  </li>
            <li> and I’m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> and I never seemed to be able to follow through on those to get them to work well.  </li>
            <li> I read the directions, which I am glad I did, because you use the step 1 for a minute (the fluoride toothpaste to protect against cavities &amp; gingivitis)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not quite sure what the advantages are yet.</li>
            <li> This product seemed interesting.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use it to see if there is an improved whiteness with more time.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did because I would have never thought that I needed a 2 step cleaning process for healthier teeth.</li>
            <li> Anyways, the 2 step process feels clinical and it does take a bit more time and effort, but when I do it, I feel a bit like a dentist.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting product.  </li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE it.</li>
            <li> As my hubby said more kissable now.  </li>
            <li> Sure- strips work</li>
            <li> I have yet to see outstanding results</li>
            <li> okay I guess.</li>
            <li> and yea you may have to devote a couple of more minutes to your tooth-brushing routine</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying more Crest [HD].  </li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try out and review the Crest Pro-Health HD Two Step product and am extremely glad I was given this opportunity by Crest.</li>
            <li> Another benefit was it was a product from Crest which is a brand I have enjoyed using in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She enjoyed the product and would recommend it for this reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was hoping for better whitening capabilities, but would recommend using it if you want cleaner, healthier teeth.joyed the product and would recommend it for this reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was hoping for better whitening capabilities, but would recommend using it if you want cleaner, healthier teeth.</li>
            <li> but my results continued to get better.</li>
            <li> guess this is okay .&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> $6 for this , -I can&#x27;t complain . :)</li>
            <li> I love feeling cleen teeth.</li>
            <li> but that is ok</li>
            <li> /&gt;The taste is good, leaves you with fresh breathe that lasts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t control how sunny it was though, so brightness may differ :)</li>
            <li> I am smiling so much more because my teeth look better than in years.</li>
            <li> I was sent this toothpaste system for free from Crest and BzzAgent and was asked to write a review, which is my own opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am impressed!</li>
            <li> I wish both tubes were flip top.  </li>
            <li> The thing I love most about this toothpaste is that it feels like I visited the dentist office for a cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my mouth has ever been this healthy.  </li>
            <li> I have a dentist check up at the end of July, and I fully anticipate my hygienist to comment on how much better my mouth and teeth are.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much more time to whiten when you&#x27;re already brushing vs doing whitening strips or whitening trays</li>
            <li> However, I still enjoyed using the toothpaste and will probably be buying more.</li>
            <li> I can lick the top of my teeth, and they have a polished feel to them that I also have when leaving the dentist office.</li>
            <li> Those will be the times I make sure to stock up on this toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> Those will be the times I make sure to stock up on this toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I got the opportunity to try this product out for free and let me tell you I don&#x27;t regret trying this one out!  </li>
            <li> THIS IS MUCH BETTER THAN DEALING WITH WHITENING STRIPS.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a smooth gel that polishes the teeth, it also has a nice taste.</li>
            <li> The taste of the Crest Pro Health HD is not quite a minty as some I&#x27;ve tried, but It seems like the fresh taste lasts longer and my mouth feels really good.  </li>
            <li> I got to try this free as a promotional sample review from Crest but opinions are all my own.</li>
            <li> I love that it doesnt take up any more time during my toothbrushing routine.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product free from crest on bzzagent!  </li>
            <li> teeth love this</li>
            <li> It only bothered me if I happen to be in a rush, but otherwise, the product is GREAT!</li>
            <li> Flip top, use, close top.  </li>
            <li> My teenaged daughter and myself love it, too.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this product.  </li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt or looked better.</li>
            <li> and they are already looking whiter! :)</li>
            <li> You use the cleanser and brush your teeth for one minute  and spit when the time is done (dont rinse) and then use the perfecting gel and brush your teeth for one more minute.</li>
            <li> and I love the way they feel after I use this stuff.</li>
            <li> I always taken the best care possible for my mouth.</li>
            <li> My favorite part of this product....</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not feeling the love.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased to be selected to try this kit from BzzAgent as it&#x27;s not something</li>
            <li> Been using Crest for most of my life...</li>
            <li> one more day before I quit using it.</li>
            <li> I do think my teeth look whiter and for sure they feel way healthy and better.</li>
            <li> packaging is compact, sleek and stylish.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love a product that whitens teeth</li>
            <li> After a minute I was able to spit and rinse.  </li>
            <li> after one minute, spit (DO NOT RINSE) and then use the perfecting gel and brush your teeth for one more minute).</li>
            <li> Its important to note that Step 1 you brush for 1 minute and then DON&#x27;T RINSE!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be purchasing this product over and over as I just love the simplicity of it.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more for my family and myself once our sample runs out .</li>
            <li> I wish that it had more of a minty flavor.  </li>
            <li> If I floss before, my gums are more tender.  </li>
            <li> I will def be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even sure it was whitening my teeth - they almost look like they were turning green-ish.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to tell if they are whiter yet</li>
            <li> More complication is not what I am looking for in morning or bedtime routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> From my research also found it had more anti-microbial properties.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> I did receive a free product for the purpose of my review and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I have tried many whitening systems, and.</li>
            <li> I received this system through a sampling site for free, but my opinions are all my own.</li>
            <li> After using the system, I was very happy that no such residue occurred.</li>
            <li> I was sure to give this a try.</li>
            <li> I do love the product.</li>
            <li> I am a bzzagent, which means I get to try products for free and share my honest opinions.  </li>
            <li> The instructions are to brush teeth for one minute with tube 1 paste, spit but do not rinse, brush for one more minute with tube 2 paste, and then spit and rinse.  </li>
            <li> Will finish the tube and post more pics.</li>
            <li> With that said, if you are expecting a bright glowing white smile, this probably is not the best product for that.  </li>
            <li> Give it a try and see for yourself how wonderful this daily system truly is!</li>
            <li> love this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Perhaps after continuous use, I will see better results.  </li>
            <li> Then the whiting/polish step can work it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> It can be more concentrated and get everywhere</li>
            <li> Having the whitener separate lets it work better</li>
            <li> My teeth felt smooth and polished immediately, and after a week I have noticed that they are whiter too!  </li>
            <li> My teeth did look good for what that&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> I saw a bit more whitening after three uses,  </li>
            <li> I drink a lot of coffee and after using the product my teeth looked noticeably whiter to me, but I asked my wife just to make sure.</li>
            <li> The more I used it, the stronger the sensation.</li>
            <li> Now, I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> i love it -</li>
            <li> I am happy to report that my teeth look a lot brighter thanks to this kit.</li>
            <li> and I am planning to continue this regimen for a longer period of time to get more benefits from it.</li>
            <li> I received this free product to try and give review, Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> The whitening strips were always a pain to use, so I thought this would be more convenient.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not at all inconvenienced by the amount of time it takes to use this product as it does not need any more time than we should already be giving when brushing our teeth.</li>
            <li> No doubt will result in a healthy mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> what most pleases me is that the whitening effect is immediate.</li>
            <li> You brush for 1 minute with the step 1 purifying cleanser, spit, and brush for 1 more minute with the step 2 purifying gel.  </li>
            <li> On top of that, stannous fluoride can also help to address tooth sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li> That said, I wasn&#x27;t expecting to see any more of a change in the whiteness of my teeth...</li>
            <li> I love this system.  </li>
            <li> It claims to do a better job at cleaning plaque, fighting cavities and gingivitis, and whitening teeth.</li>
            <li> Where it is supposed to differ is that it is supposed to reduce existing gingivitis and whiten more over three weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s making me be more deliberate about my brushing</li>
            <li> His teeth have much more yellowing.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t too sure I would like the Crest Pro-Health since it&#x27;s a mint flavored experience.  </li>
            <li> the taste is really, really refreshing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that much better.  </li>
            <li> I experienced sensitivity, my gums were very tender</li>
            <li> This is more than toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I was incredibly pleased.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll run out of Step 2 before Step 1, at which point I&#x27;ll throw Step 1 away.</li>
            <li> I picture the Crest executives wondering how to make more money off of what that they already produce.</li>
            <li> Many people forget about oral health</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this duo that I received from Crest to try for free to review!  </li>
            <li> : I did receive this for free for review purposes and this is my honest opinion about this product.</li>
            <li> The product itself is ok.  </li>
            <li> Okay, there are plenty of whitening toothpastes out there, so</li>
            <li> Much more so than trays and strips.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this product, but did have some reservations.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received this and love the way it works.  </li>
            <li> My smile was bright in the millions of wedding photos in which I had to partake.  </li>
            <li> Crest really did a great job with this product.  </li>
            <li> The product has lasted me all this time, and still many more brushes to go.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I need to give it more time to work, as I&#x27;m halfway through each tube.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more than tolerable.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Love the packaging, love the taste, don&#x27;t even mind the two step process one</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> Glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s even better is I #GotItFree.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried a number of whitening products, some that work, but many, many more that don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The minty-ness always leaves my mouth feeling great afterwards, too, which is really what I&#x27;m looking for out of any toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I was also glad that I didn&#x27;t notice any sensitivity caused by this product.</li>
            <li> They should have made that bottle with a flip top like they did the toothpaste bottle.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this I used Crest Pro-Health toothpaste and was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> but somehow they got deleted from my phone).&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all this product is okay.  </li>
            <li> Crest is my favorite brand of toothpaste</li>
            <li> I am assuming it was working its magic.  </li>
            <li> I honestly did not notice a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s plausible.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> My dentist will be pleased to see me</li>
            <li> I feel that the teeth whitening strips do a better job for that.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d say this is better).</li>
            <li> Taste- Not my favorite but tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I got this as a free sample from BzzAgent and would not purchase this on my own once my sample runs out.</li>
            <li> they are smooth all day, even after I eat!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While this product is great and actually really does work, there are some negatives that I will address:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product because #1 it works, and #2</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I can say I&#x27;ve ever really enjoyed brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> I love the tingling/tightness I feel in my gums after step 1, and my teeth appear whiter as well.  </li>
            <li> My teeth were not terribly discolored to begin with, so maybe it works well for those people.</li>
            <li> I was able to try it through the survey site im on bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> Works as it States it does but needs a sensitivity treatment added and a better flavor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products for teeth whitening but many do not work because they require that you put paste or a strip on your teeth.</li>
            <li> After trying the product for now 4 weeks, I am glad I received this sample</li>
            <li> It is definitely more convenient than the strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I was sure to always do a minute per step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never been able to replicate that feeling.  </li>
            <li> I made sure not to rinse my mouth in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product as part of thr promotion for the brand, but I love it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad i took the time and followed the 2-step process - I made sure I kept it up and used it as it was designed.</li>
            <li> But I opted to give this a shot, as I truly would love whiter teeth without the cost of having it done at the dentist.  </li>
            <li> It helped me to pay more attention to these spots</li>
            <li> I will be using again :)</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I got into Bzzagent and got a free sample of Crest Pro Health HD!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been letting my husband use it until I found out that I could get more :)</li>
            <li> I was able to receive this toothpaste as part of a promotion</li>
            <li> I have to say that when I received the package  and saw that there were two products and two steps, I felt like it was going to make brushing my teeth more of a production and take longer than I had time for.  </li>
            <li> The polishing paste is where I think the magic happens.  </li>
            <li> Love that it doesn&#x27;t add any time to my routine.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the result as well as I can definitely see a difference in my teeth appearance.</li>
            <li> a nutshell, if you use this product you spend an extra minute brushing, but the results are impressive.</li>
            <li> I received this kit free from BzzAgent for honest opinion.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s more to carry around when traveling and more times to setup/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also like to note that I think the color on my teeth looks a bit more even (</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also like to note that I think the color on my teeth looks a bit more even (</li>
            <li> My teeth feel healthy but they also look healthier.</li>
            <li> Now I pay more attention and make sure I brush for 1 minute using step 1 and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Convenience: Not so much... it would be great if this product were combined into one gel.  </li>
            <li> Was ok but not something I&#x27;d recommend or advise against...</li>
            <li> I am totally in love with the effects of this dental cleaning system.  </li>
            <li> I love the ease of use every morning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be purchasing more when my sample runs out.</li>
            <li> I love that it ensures I don&#x27;t rush when I brush, so my teeth ALWAYS feel cleaner - even when I am falling asleep while brushing.</li>
            <li> Hey, free toothpaste!</li>
            <li> The packaging colors pop at you and had a sparkle that was appealing to me.  </li>
            <li> I drink tea and coffee every day, and I was able to notice visible whitening after a day&#x27;s brushing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fabulous!  </li>
            <li> I thought that maybe there was finally a simple (although a bit pricey) way to get impressive whitening + cleaning results in no time at all.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to use it more than a couple days because of the pain on my gums</li>
            <li> many wats</li>
            <li> I will for sure continue to use the product until it is gone.</li>
            <li> I felt it most noticeably on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the way this product whitened my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I found that part of the product to be more time consuming than I would have preferred.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this 2 Step system.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It cleans teeth better than any toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> and it felt refreshing.</li>
            <li> I would advise a mouthwash follow up for sure.</li>
            <li> Most people don&#x27;t brush for the recommended two minutes.  </li>
            <li> I received a free trial of this system from Crest, and I am so thankful I gave it a try!  </li>
            <li> It took some convincing to get my husband to agree to using the 2 paste system but he has been compliant.</li>
            <li> but since I was able to convince my husband to do it</li>
            <li> I received this product for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since there was not a lot of discoloration, I was hoping for much better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m really pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I found myself touching my teeth with my tongue all day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Sonicare toothbrush for many years now</li>
            <li> but I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Was given this  product for free to try and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> but I feel like my teeth look better after using it for a week.</li>
            <li> I like using this two step system better than teeth whitening trays.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample through Smiley360, however the opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I love the way that my teeth feel after my two minute brush and polish.  </li>
            <li> There was a noticeable whitening of my teeth after about a week and even more so after two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Because of this, I am always on the lookout for better oral hygiene products.</li>
            <li> and I really wanted to like this product because it sounded great</li>
            <li> and I love whitening toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE this product I love</li>
            <li> and I love the Texture.</li>
            <li> One tip I have would be to be sure not to rinse before using step 2.</li>
            <li> This cleared up after a bit, but I&#x27;m sure that something like this varies from person to person.</li>
            <li> I have been using home whitening kits/products off and on for the better part of 15 years.</li>
            <li> I have found that, like most things, some worked well, and others flopped.</li>
            <li> I gave it an OK</li>
            <li> Will definitely continue using Crest Pro Health HD and am happy to change my brushing habits from here on out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this 2-step Crest Pro-Health HD works for some people, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> By the time it was two weeks, it was prominent difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not a hard process and probably my own issue, but in the spirit of being completely honest that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m at with the toothpaste!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel incredibly clean and are many shades whiter!  </li>
            <li> I was very excited when I was able to test this product (for free!)</li>
            <li> The taste is fine for both steps, but it&#x27;s just very mild, which I suppose is good for people who don&#x27;t like a strong mint taste.</li>
            <li> I happily returned to my normal toothpaste, and I will not keep Crest HD in my medicine cabinet!  </li>
            <li> I got my Crest Pro Heath HD sample for free from Crest via BzzAgent  and was so excited to try this!!</li>
            <li> the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;second step is good too...... very strong bleaching agent as you certainly feel a burn in your mouth.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt smooth and I loved the minty fresh breath!</li>
            <li> I tried this toothpaste free, thanks to Crest, and I loved it!</li>

            <li> It does a great job of giving you a fresh from the dentist clean feeling, but the whitening?</li>
            <li> The toothpaste tastes great, your breath smell kissably fresh, and makes your teeth feel dentist office clean.</li>
            <li> Now, who doesn’t want to have that great, fresh, and clean feeling every time they brush their teeth?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really love the clean feeling after using the paste and its so nice and convenient that the whitener is included.</li>
            <li> In addition to the results, the taste is refreshing and my mouth feels very clean.</li>
            <li> I wish the flavor was better, my teeth feel very clean after I brush, but I do not have that minty feeling in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> After use my mouth and teeth feel better and very clean - and the feeling lasts for a while.</li>
            <li> The fact they did notice was very exciting!  </li>

            <li> This is an amazing product that gives you a clean like never before.</li>
            <li> You just have to add this to your normal brushing routine, and I have experienced NO sensitivitely, and I feel like the results are more immediate</li>
            <li> It is amazing and the clean feeling lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> , I think it is good to use, the results are not as good as the general toothpaste brush and comfort.</li>
            <li> My teeth honestly feel so clean after I use this product.  </li>
            <li> There’s almost a afterglow where my teeth feel nice and clean.  </li>
            <li> * Leaves my teeth nice and clean</li>
            <li> The two-step process to brushing is really nice, and it helps focus on spending the required amount of time brushing to get my teeth really clean.  </li>
            <li> I liked the feeling of clean while brushing.</li>
            <li> The most remarkable thing I noticed was that my teeth felt much cleaner use this toothpaste compared to another toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I have also noticed that my mouth still feels clean in the morning, which is so nice.  </li>
            <li> The positive aspect was that my teeth did feel especially clean after brushing, which lasted until I woke up in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this great duo.</li>

            <li> Fast easy and great minty taste.</li>
            <li> The Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste System is so easy to use and very effective!!  </li>
            <li> This is a pain for me because Step one has an easy flip top and Step two has a twist top.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that is worth a try and lucky for me</li>
            <li> An excellent, easy way to whiten daily!</li>
            <li> The Smooth Mint flavor is pleasant and your mouth remains feeling fresh for hours.</li>
            <li> Had pleasant taste and made my teeth feel super clean.  </li>
            <li> I was very impressed with how it immediately left my breath feeling strongly minty.  </li>
            <li> After about three weeks, I&#x27;m starting to see some solid results (photo isn&#x27;t very good, but I think my teeth look great!).</li>
            <li> This toothpaste leaves your mouth feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels very clean and I feel as though I wake up with a cleaner mouth.  </li>
            <li> My teeth were noticeably whiter, and my mouth felt very clean.  </li>
            <li> and my teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> It also feels very clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel very clean.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my teeth and mouth feeling very clean.</li>

            <li> My mouth felt very clean.</li>
            <li> I felt like it didn&#x27;t leave my teeth feeling very clean -</li>
            <li> The cleaning paste does an excellent job of getting that morning and evening scummy feeling off my teeth, while the polishing and whitening paste does a better job of making my teeth sparkle than others in a single tube.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy I was able to try out this product for free, thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li> :) Plus, my teeth are bright and white, which of course makes me feel good about myself.</li>
            <li> I smile even more often because my teeth have been looking better!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s actually pretty good at whitening.  </li>
            <li> your breath is pretty good this morning&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;no morning breath&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I am looking forward to it becoming available for purchase!</li>
            <li> But the step 2 toothpaste was not bad tasting, and was effective for an at home product.</li>
            <li> However, the first application of toothpaste tastes good and takes care of your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled to try this product as part of a promotion from the Crest through BzzAgent and was pretty happy with it the first two weeks.</li>
            <li> It does nothing to freshen your mouth after the first step or even as a good tooth brushing would.</li>
            <li> I was pleasant with the long-lasting fresh breath in the morning as well as the clean and refreshing feel of my teeth after using this set.</li>
            <li> Step 2 is completely clear of color and whitened my teeth beautifully after Step 1 cleansed my teeth of plaque.</li>
            <li> did_ do a pretty good job of whitening, with a minimum of hassle</li>
            <li> However, I was willing to give this a try and wanted to give it a fair try.  </li>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve used in a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The flavor was pretty good.</li>
            <li> First the good.  </li>
            <li> first thing I noticed was how good the toothpaste tasted.</li>
            <li> After the first two or three day I knew I loved the minty taste of it</li>
            <li> The taste was pretty good.  </li>
            <li> The taste is pretty good and the texture as well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty good tooth brusher.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product.</li>
            <li> I was interested to see how it worked as I figured it couldn&#x27;t be as good as it claimed.</li>
            <li> Professional whitening made it easy and affordable !!!</li>
            <li> The first step is a tarter control paste that tastes great and leaves your teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited that this can help reduce/reverse gingivitis as well!</li>
            <li> Original sample came from BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro Health HD Toothpaste for one month now and the difference it has made in the brightness of my teeth is nothing short of remarkable!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try it!</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro Health HD Toothpaste for one month now and the difference it has made in the brightness of my teeth is nothing short of remarkable!</li>
            <li> so I was excited to use this product!</li>
            <li> and I was really excited about this product!</li>
            <li> I am really excited about this product!</li>
            <li> either it&#x27;s is a great new morning routine</li>
            <li> So happy I got to try this and make this my new toothpaste.</li>
            <li> A great new product from Crest.  </li>
            <li> Im having a great time using this system that I got for free thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li> am a huge fan of this product, great toothpaste with whitening that is comparable to using strips, but so much easier.  </li>
            <li> Love it 2 steps is easy to do.</li>
            <li> After 2 days my teeth are definitely whiter, but more impressive is how clean my mouth feels.</li>
            <li> I was able to easily add this 2 step toothpaste to my morning and evening routine.  </li>
            <li> I also liked how quick and efficient it wAs</li>
            <li> So why 4 stars instead of 5 not my favorite in the taste department but easy to use.</li>
            <li> The paste had a surprisingly nice mild taste that wasn&#x27;t overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure about adding another step to my toothpaste routine, but it is really easy to adjust to.</li>
            <li> so it was easy for me to know when I need to switch from top to bottom on my mouth or switch toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I myself love this easy two step toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s a 2 step process, it&#x27;s easy and you are sure to see results.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and has no horrible aftertaste.</li>
            <li> , I love this product, I have cant tell you how easy it is</li>
            <li> I would use this product again, because it is so quick and effective.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s so easy to use with no strips or trays to put on.</li>
            <li> I needed something quick and effective.</li>
            <li> Nothing&#x27;s perfect, though, and I do notice that my mouth seems dry for about 30 minutes after use.  </li>
            <li> I also liked the mild minty flavor of the purifying cleanser (step 1).</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is thicker than most and doesn&#x27;t have a strong mint taste.</li>
            <li> The whitening/polishing gel was gentle on my teeth, and didn&#x27;t cause sensitivity the way trays or whitening strips do sometimes, and also had a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li> With all the claims of one toothpaste being able to clean, whiten, etc it is refreshing to see a dental care system that shows specialized products are probably better.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest, we&#x27;re able to give this toothpaste a good run at no cost.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free through Bzz Agent and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I loved step 2 as it made my teeth feel super clean</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free, and I am forever grateful!I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free from BzzAgent and Crest, but I will definitely be buying this great product once again!he toothpaste aisle at the store!</li>
            <li> I got this product for free from BzzAgent and Crest, but I will definitely be buying this great product once again!</li>
            <li> I am a coffee and diet soda drinker, and the light brown staining seems to be disappearing more and more after every use.</li>
            <li> It thoroughly cleanses your teeth while giving you a healthy feel and white brilliant teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many commercially available tooth whiteners, including strips, gels and toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I thought it was a good product and a good whitener.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit suspicious of a tooth paste product that required 2 brushings, however, after a week of brushing with &amp;#34;Tube 1&amp;#34; then &amp;#34;Tube 2&amp;#34;, I am more than pleased at the whitening and smooth feeling on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I love that Step 1 really feels like I&#x27;m getting a good scrub like the dentist</li>
            <li> However, if you are looking for a daily way to keep your teeth looking good then this is is a good product to try.</li>
            <li> over-well worth the investment in a smile to be proud of</li>
            <li> I find the flavor to be minty and refreshing and the most important factor is that it WORKS.  </li>
            <li> I was able to snag this as a free sample thank to Crest, and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> It tastes nice, feels nice, and I absolutely feel like my teeth are cleaned.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is a great system for whitening and cleaning in the comfort of your own home.</li>
            <li> I was able to receive this product free for review and Im glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li> Healthy teeth and gums are more important.</li>
            <li> I received this free from Crest for a Bzz agent campaign and am so glad I was able to try it.</li>
            <li> Glad I was able to try this with a free promotion.</li>
            <li> So when I was able to try the CrestHD for free through a promotion from Crest, I figured I&#x27;d give one more product a try.  </li>
            <li> Not in a fakey, car-salesman kind of way, but in a real, &amp;#34;hey- you-have-nice-teeth&amp;#34; kind of way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> However, a couple days later, I was offered Crest Pro Health HD through BzzAgent for free, so I thought it was perfect timing and figured I would try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mouth does feel fresh and clean after using the toothpaste and it has a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li> I have use a whitening system before and it was not that good, but this new Crest Pro-Heath HD whitening toothpaste and gel was very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I was also happy that I was able to use this for the full week without the tooth pain that I had previously experienced with other whitening solutions.  </li>
            <li> Aside from whitening strips, this is the single best product I&#x27;ve found for whitening my teeth.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it makes your mouth healthy and beautiful at the same time.</li>
            <li> I received a product sample of Crest ProHealth HD from Crest and I am so happy with the results so far!</li>
            <li> The taste of both products is successfully underwhelming and leaves a clean feeling and super smooth surface to run your tongue</li>
            <li> What I liked best with this product is how long my teeth stay feeling fresh, no yuck build-up on them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy, and it tastes pretty good.  </li>
            <li> So, full disclosure, this stuff does not leave a pleasant minty fresh taste...</li>
            <li> The taste was pretty good and the process to use it twice a day was easy.</li>
            <li> These products were easy to use, tasted good, and really whitened my teeth!</li>
            <li> I actually enjoy the first step because the taste is so pleasant.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health® HD toothpaste works pretty good and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed was the mild taste and great feel to the system.</li>
            <li> I was very fortunate to receive this Crest Pro-Health HD whitening set free to test and review from Crest through Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> A good toothpaste that&#x27;s best qualities are whitening capability with less sensitivity and a smooth, clean feeling for your teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super excited to see what they will look like after a couple of weeks!!  </li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt so clean!  </li>
            <li> So Clean!</li>
            <li> 2 minutes of your day is all it takes to make your teeth dentist-cleaned clean!  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s that clean!</li>
            <li> I also couldn&#x27;t believ how incredibly clean my teeth felt after just one use!  </li>
            <li> My teeth stay fresher longer and feel squeaky clean after using it with the freshest breath!  </li>
            <li> To me that is CLEAN!</li>
            <li> I almost look forward to brushing because of the flavor and the clean feel!  </li>
            <li> You wake up with your  mouth feeling as clean as it did when you went to bed!</li>
            <li> I woke up this morning and my mouth still felt clean!</li>
            <li> I was amazed that my mouth felt so clean!</li>
            <li> My mouth felt so clean, cleaner than it ever has!</li>
            <li> With this toothpaste my teeth always feel clean!</li>
            <li> and my teeth still felt clean!</li>
            <li> MY TEETH HAVE NEVER FELT THIS CLEAN AND SPARKLING!</li>
            <li> I was excited to see if this would work and be as easy as it sounds!</li>
            <li> Between the clean feeling and whitening I feel more confident and SMILE MORE!</li>
            <li> My teeth are clean though!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks and my teeth feel clean and whiter too!  </li>
            <li> It makes my teeth feel so clean!</li>
            <li> and with as clean as my mouth feels, I may never use Colgate again!</li>
            <li> and my teeth feel every bit as clean as they do when I&#x27;ve just had a dental cleaning!</li>
            <li> and I do not have a lot of time for myself, but I love that in 2 quick minutes I can whiten my teeth!  </li>
            <li> While it did not make my teeth significantly whiter, I was impressed by the overall feel and quality of the product.</li>
            <li> I love my new teeth!!!!!</li>
            <li> all whats a face without a clean and bright smile.</li>
            <li> The taste is good, and it makes my mouth feel fresh and clean (as does Crest Pro Health toothpaste in, um...regular definition, I guess).  </li>
            <li> HD is definitely effective at whitening and keeping teeth smooth and clean but it can irritate the mouth.</li>
            <li> I think that Crest Pro Health® HD™ is an awesome product at getting your mouth clean, while at the same time it does not work in the time-frame it boasts towards whitening.</li>
            <li> The texture of the paste and the minty freshness makes my mouth feel clean, and I notice it most with better smelling breath in the morning.</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;ve enjoyed the most is how clean my teeth feel.  </li>
            <li> I did enjoy though the nice clean feeling on my teeth after use.</li>
            <li> I have the Sonicare diamond clean and until recently I used what I though was the best toothpaste around.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, an effective, clean, smooth effect.</li>
            <li> But after using it I was really impressed how clean and white</li>
            <li> Overall I am very impressed with how clean my teeth are.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m impressed at how clean my teeth feel compared to using my regular toothpast.</li>
            <li> My teeth looked whiter and I loved the fresh clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> My favorite thing is how clean and healthy my teeth feel after cleaning them with Crest Pro Health HD.</li>
            <li> I love this two step system.my mouth feels so clean after using it.i love that it&#x27;s done from step one to finish in</li>
            <li> Instantly, my teeth feel cleaner--dentist clean would be the best way to describe it.  </li>
            <li> My mouth does feel much more clean in the morning when I wake up, so I&#x27;d wager that my breath smells better</li>
            <li> I also loved how clean my teeth felt and how fresh my breath was.</li>
            <li> and they end up very bright and white when you are done.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to use and my mouth did feel very clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> I love the results and how easy it is to get and maintain a nice, clean smile!</li>
            <li> There are two steps to the process, but it was very easy and didn&#x27;t take that much more time and well worth it.  </li>
            <li> Love the new Crest Pro Health HD , I did receive it free from Crest, but truly and honestly love it!!  </li>
            <li> Recenetly got a free sample from Crest through the awesome peeps at BuzzAgent and have been enjoying the extra clean feeling the two step process leaves.  </li>
            <li> A dazzling smile, fresh breath that lasts for hours and teeth that feel polished and so CLEAN!</li>
            <li> I love the feeling of the first step as it foams up and works to remove plaque - it kind of reminds me of scrubbing our tub clean!</li>
            <li> I was even more thrilled with the results; my teeth and gums actually felt like I had been to the dentist for a cleaning!&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the results from this product, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> All my friends and family are asking what I have been doing because my smile looks amazing.</li>
            <li> effects: With continued use, my teeth are becoming sore, as are my gums.  </li>
            <li> It does require that you brush your teeth for 1 full minute with each step which for most people is probably more than they&#x27;re used to brushing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hesitate to say this since this is a whitening product, but they FEEL even better than they look, polished and smooth.</li>
            <li> My teeth are becoming whiter, they do not look like they have the yellowish tint anymore.</li>
            <li> received this free from BzzAgent but will be purchasing more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I got to try it for free from Crest.  </li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s been a great product.</li>
            <li> I received a free package of this product, tried it, and now I love the Crest HD 2 Step System.  </li>
            <li> So I got this product as a free sample, and I&#x27;m probably going to be buying more.  </li>
            <li> The fact that it was from Crest and P&amp;G made me more comfortable with it.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get a free box through a promotion from crest.</li>
            <li> Having a healthy feeling mouth is important to me.  </li>

            <li> I got a free sample of the Crest Pro Health HD and have been using it for a month now, and my teeth have never looked better.  </li>

            <li> I received the product to try for free, so I used it, but I don&#x27;t think I can use it more than one time.</li>
            <li> I am using this product as a free trial from Crest :)</li>
            <li> I was able to give Crest HD a try for free.</li>

            <li> I received it free through a crest promotion and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> This is great to use if you are sensitive to the whitening strips (like I am).</li>
            <li> When I got a free sample of this product I wasn&#x27;t sure I would truly see or feel any difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great to use with my sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> From the very first brush my teeth felt smooth and I loved the minty fresh breath!</li>

            <li> I have been using a free sample of Crest Pro Health HD for almost two months now and am really enjoying this</li>
            <li> I have to say that I love this toothpaste, which I did get for free as part of a promotion from Crest.  </li>
            <li> When Crest offered me a free sample of Crest Pro Health HD I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work</li>
            <li> Purifying Cleanser seemed to be like the Crest Pro Health Advanced toothpaste that I was already accustomed to using, and I found that to be enjoyable.  </li>
            <li> I was a Crest user before, but enjoy this product much more.  </li>
            <li> I received my Crest Pro Health HD free from Bzz Agent and I love this product.  </li>

            <li> /&gt; was able to try this product for free from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> It has a great flavor and did not bother my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Thanks to the generosity of Crest, I was able to try this product for free*</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free</li>
            <li> I recieved this as a free sample to test and absolutley love it.</li>
            <li> What I have noticed (and more importantly my friends and family) is that that the Crest Pro Health HD whitening system that BzzAgent sent me did make a difference in the brightness and whiteness of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say, Crest Pro Health HD kept stains away and my dental assistant complimented me on their natural looking brightness.</li>
            <li> Works great and gives you the incentive to brush completely.</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest products most of my life and started using the Pro Health line last year because of how healthy it made my mouth feel and the results I experienced at the dentist.  </li>
            <li> I received a free sample as part of a promotion from Crest as a BzzAgent, but I&#x27;ll gladly pay for this when it comes out.  </li>
            <li> I received it free to try from Crest, and I&#x27;m so glad-</li>
            <li> and if I notice (or more importantly my dentist notices) reduced gingivitis and brighter teeth, then the rating slips up to five stars.</li>
            <li> , I enjoy being healthy, and I have an HD TV-</li>
            <li> I love the just cleaned feeling of shiny, smooth teeth after every visit with a hygienist.  </li>
            <li> I love it and will continuer to use it regularly to keep my teeth and smile looking their best!</li>
            <li> My superficial stains are noticeably gone and most importantly, my teeth always appear 1-2 shades lighter after use.  </li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free courtesy of Crest.  </li>
            <li> After using the product for a couple of weeks I do have to say I&#x27;m becoming a believer.  </li>
            <li> Even using this product every couple of days still shown signs of my teeth becoming whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth, this product may be great for you.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample to try out and review and thought \\&quot;sure why not\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> However the most important thing is if a product lives up to its claims.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the results so far after 2 weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> I love the Crest PH Advanced because it freshens my breath, and cleans my teeth.</li>
            <li> My teeth went from coffee and wine stained to brilliant, youthful white in under two-weeks.</li>
            <li> I have always had the kind of smile that never seems to get any brighter, no matter what products I use.  </li>
            <li> The toothpaste has a nice minty flavor that leaves your mouth feeling fresh.  </li>
            <li> I loved it so much</li>
            <li> If you are looking for your own at home fresh from a dental cleaning, this is it.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that my smile is brighter</li>
            <li> Have been using for a couple of weeks now, and my teeth feel nice and fresh</li>
            <li> Leaves nice fresh breath after.</li>
            <li> Really nice fresh breath that lasts and</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary from Crest and Bzzagent, but all opinions are of my own.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Thanks to the generosity of Crest, I was able to try this product for free*l feel like the system is a good upgrade from my normal brushing</li>
            <li> I enjoy the fresh feeling of the pastes, but I am more of a one step kind of person.  </li>
            <li> Someone even commented on my nice smile two days ago.</li>
            <li> To give this product a fair review, I did use this product for a whole month.  </li>
            <li> He started using the toothpaste and loved it so much that he bought some for when he travels.</li>
            <li> It has made brushing actually a nice activity and not a chore knowing the results will be a cleaner brighter smile.  </li>
            <li> I loved how it made my whole mouth feel, including my gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> I continued to do this, rather than the straight two-week trial so that I could give a fair comparison of the toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> On top of that you get a fresh, clean mouth and a healthy mouth that lasts for hours and hours!</li>
            <li> It not only does a great job whitening my teeth, but it makes my mouth feel clean and healthy as well!  </li>
            <li> I do think this product would be good for maintaining whiter teeth since it seemed to help me from making new stains which is good because I am an avid tea drinker.  </li>
            <li> The two step process is easy and leaves my teeth feeling clean and sparkling!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true you could brush your teeth with straight hydrogen peroxide, but this is a MUCH more pleasant alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to say that having gotten the opportunity to try the Crest ProHealth HD for free was a great chance to find something new.</li>
            <li> I love knowing the floride paste is keeping my teeth strong and cavity free.</li>
            <li> Step 2 is more mild flavored, way more tolerable.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t super impressed with the whitening ability of this toothpaste - it claims to make teeth 6x whiter in a week, but I definitely didn&#x27;t see results even close to that.</li>
            <li> The polishing paste really does give you a &#x27;dentist clean feel&#x27; - I was impressed, however the whitening agent was only slightly more effective than the Crest (non-HD) whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt so clean, very smooth like glass.</li>
            <li> so my teeth always have a very smooth and clean feeling after brushing.</li>
            <li> This new, 2-step teeth-brushing system provides amazing results!  </li>
            <li> Loving BzzAgent right now.</li>
            <li> step 2 is a smooth gel, and once you start brushing with it, you really begin to feel that great, clean feeling as it polishes your teeth.</li>
            <li> The two step system makes your teeth feel SUPER clean, which I love!  </li>
            <li> mouth felt squeaky clean immediately, there was no horrible after taste and most importantly.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt very clean and smooth</li>
            <li> Of course, most of my own observations are purely anecdotal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of course, most of my own observations are purely anecdotal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Certainly the fresh taste is great</li>
            <li> perfecting gel, on the other hand, I was not so impressed with.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t say that is completely true!</li>
            <li> I would also recommend it to others who are looking for a feeling of healthy teeth and long-lasting fresh breath!</li>
            <li> Overall a good toothpaste!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so quick and easy!</li>
            <li> I received my first box as part of a promotional campaign via bzzagent, and I promptly stopped by Target on my way home and bought more!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I saw the BzzAgent campaign for Crest Pro Health® HD and was able to try this product as part of a promotion.</li>
            <li> Was able to try this free thanks to Crest and BzzAgent and am VERY glad I did.</li>
            <li> I know this product is a bit more costly, but it&#x27;s worth it for the results you get!</li>
            <li> OK, so my expectations of getting 6 times whiter teeth in just a week went out the door immediately, but I was still hopeful they would be significantly</li>
            <li> I was really impressed and could tell a big difference the first time I used it!  </li>
            <li> LOVE my smile after I brush with the 2 pastes!</li>
            <li> i think the first step paste is much more viscous (flows better) than most competing products.. that could be</li>
            <li> BzzAgent is so cool, if you&#x27;re not part of it, you should check it out!</li>
            <li> Plus, it is super easy!  </li>
            <li> This is one of the most unique products on the market.  </li>
            <li> and I found that to be true!</li>
            <li> toothpaste system came in an awesome little package that looked appealing.</li>
            <li> First off, I love this product!</li>
            <li> if I don&#x27;t like the taste, but this one actually tastes really good!</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health HD gives me even more reasons to smile - and often!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the results of a whiter smile!</li>
            <li> the one thing I was most excited to test was Crest Pro Health HD&#x27;s claim to whiten teeth up to 6x after a week&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> the one thing I was most excited to test was Crest Pro Health HD&#x27;s claim to whiten teeth up to 6x after a week&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> The best part is that I didn&#x27;t feel I was sacrificing the cleaning quality of my toothpaste for these other benefits.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The most significant thing that I noticed was that my felt a lot cleaner after brushing with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Probably the most significant drawback is the price.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s making me brush my teeth longer, so that&#x27;s probably not a bad thing either!  </li>
            <li> This new Two-Step has a great taste and the fact that the first tube  helps to get rid of plaque while the second tube polishes and whitens makes it the best mouth product I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> fresh, clean !!</li>
            <li> The new system is a great, easy way to clean and whiten teeth.</li>
            <li> had the wonderful opportunity to try this new product for free thanks to Crest and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I think this is an easy system to use compared to others.  </li>
            <li> Easy enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am so much more confident in my smile now.</li>
            <li> I have used many many types of whitening products— toothpaste, strips, dentist trays, at home lights— all with varying degrees of success.</li>
            <li> It is an easy to use 2 part system (just like Supersmile).</li>
            <li> I use this product when I wake up and again before bed with my electric toothbrush and it is a BETTER than the dentist clean in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> But the Crest Pro Health HD whitening toothpaste really is easy to use.</li>
            <li> The flavor is also very mild and doesn&#x27;t sting.</li>
            <li> I also love the clean feeling the toothpaste gives.</li>
            <li> so you certainly will feel the difference right away - great for plaque removal.</li>

            <li> You aren&#x27;t supposed to rinse your mouth between steps, and it&#x27;s easy to understand why once you&#x27;ve used the system:</li>

            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to know when each minute is up.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s also way to easy to use.</li>

            <li> The two step process is easy to use because there is no rinsing between steps.</li>
            <li> This seems like a porr design and something that could easily be improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The two step process is really easy.</li>
            <li> My mouth felt healthy and my smile was looking much better as stains began to fade.  </li>
            <li> and you will see results very quickly.</li>
            <li> But, after a week of using it, I realized it was a rather easy process since the 2 minutes is split between the 2 tubes.</li>
            <li> The process of using two-steps is easy to adjust to.</li>
            <li> That &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling after a dentist visit is the best, but it never lasts more than a few days after brushing with a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> but once I used it, I forgot all about the time as I love how clean it makes my teeth feel.  </li>
            <li> I love having clean teeth.</li>
            <li> This two step system is easy and convenient for every day use and is truly the Power Couple for my mouth :</li>
            <li> Adding Crest Pro Health HD to my routine was easy.  </li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed the way Crest toothpaste leaves my mouth feeling and have always had great results keeping my teeth white with their products.</li>
            <li> I like this system because it is really easy to use.</li>
            <li> It was easy to incorporate 2 steps in my morning routine and it took 2 minutes of my time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really easy process:  </li>
            <li> It is literally the closest thing I&#x27;ve experienced to the feeling of getting my teeth cleaned at the dentist, only much more convenient.</li>
            <li> It is literally the closest thing I&#x27;ve experienced to the feeling of getting my teeth cleaned at the dentist, only much more convenient.</li>
            <li> My teeth look and feel great for many hours after I&#x27;ve brushed them!  </li>
            <li> Makes your teeth feel healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> The directions were easy and printed on each tube which helped because I wasn&#x27;t use to &amp;#34;spit/</li>
            <li> The two part system is so easy to use; one minute with the purifying cleanser to help with plaque buildup and one minute with the perfecting gel which polishes and whitens your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Product is great for whiter teeth, however I have to use a regular toothpaste afterwards because I prefer a more minty flavor after I brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to incorporate 2 steps in my morning routine and it took 2 minutes of my time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you love it when your mouth feels clean.</li>
            <li> The two step process is easy to follow.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s quite strong</li>
            <li> The taste is minty and strong with an after taste of hydrogen peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strong, wintergreen sort of flavor.  </li>
            <li> The strong flavor also helps to cover up the flavor of Step 2, which is why I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s so strong</li>
            <li> It also had that mouthburn type of reaction that you might get with a strong mouthwash.</li>
            <li> if this is the toothpaste for me, it may just be too strong for my mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also had that mouthburn type of reaction that you might get with a strong mouthwash.</li>
            <li> The taste was like the whiten strips but not as strong</li>
            <li> The smell was like the whiten strips but not as strong</li>
            <li> I also noticed in the ingredients list that in contained hydrogen peroxide, which I tasted strongly in Step 2.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy on the teeth and leave a fresh minty taste.</li>
            <li> got to try this product for free thanks to Crest and Bzzagent, and I&#x27;m glad I did because I was able to discover a quality product!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest and Bzz Agent, I was able to try this item for free, and so glad I did!</li>
            <li> It leaves your mouth feeling great and the whitening is a major bonus.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it works as good as their high end whitestrips, but it does remove surface stains.  </li>
            <li> My husband tried the product and liked it very much.  </li>
            <li> I have nothing but good things to say about the product, and highly recommend it to anyone with teeth sensitivities looking for a whiting product.</li>
            <li> I liked that very much as mornings can be a bit hectic.</li>
            <li> Leaves your teeth feeling so smooth and clean!</li>
            <li> Even though I receieved this product free of charge I can honestly say I absolutely LOVE this new toothpaste!!  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen this wonderful product at major retailers just yet, but if you are interested, it is available at CVS for $15.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be sure to go to my local Target and buy more!!</li>
            <li> After finishing the process my teeth felt very clean and my breath fresh!</li>
            <li> I experienced gum bleeding with the 3D white toothpastes and didn&#x27;t feel like my mouth was very clean after use.</li>
            <li> Still, a solid 4 stars for leaving a very clean \\&quot;from the dentist\\&quot; feel, and for the great whitening effect in about 10 days.</li>
            <li> I got results, but I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call them amazing.</li>
            <li> Human nature is to give a better review when someone gives you something, i.e. they where nice I should be nice.  </li>
            <li> to summarize, the step 1 toothpaste does not taste or feel the best, and if you overuse the product you will get sore and irritated gums, but it is still worth it if you want smooth and white teeth!</li>
            <li> Cudos to Crest for another amazing product that delivers exactly what it promises</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product due to the wonderful people at Crest and BzzAgent, and I&#x27;ve been using the system for about a week now.</li>
            <li> I honestly feel that you will see a very noticeable difference if you try it!  </li>
            <li> This tastes kind of funny compared to the toothpaste I am used to...</li>
            <li> This tastes kind of funny compared to the toothpaste I am used to...</li>
            <li> To be completely honest the first step makes your mouth feel like a cats tongue and has a funky taste.</li>
            <li> pretty nice product...</li>
            <li> Upon first using the 2 step pastes, I was thrilled.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that really like this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s what it takes to get me to make sure I get 2 full minutes of brushing in--well</li>
            <li> and I really liked it at first.</li>
            <li> This tastes kind of funny compared to the toothpaste I am used to...</li>
            <li> While I found it challenging to brush my teeth for 2 full minutes, there was a noticeable difference after.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t my favorite flavor, not bad</li>
            <li> Keeping fingers crossed because I am very pleased with it so far!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing product provides a fresh from the dentist clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Most importantly my teeth and gums feel and look clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that my mouth feels really clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I love the smooth clean feeling of my teeth after each brushing with Crest Pro-Health HD.  </li>
            <li> Like a fresh from the dentist kind of clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel more smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love how quick and easy this product is.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel incredibly clean (pearly smooth) and the taste is refreshing.</li>
            <li> : I loved how clean my teeth felt after using this toothpaste and it whitened very well (though perhaps not as dramatically as the producer is suggesting).  </li>
            <li> The paste does have a nice, fresh, clean feeling though.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s pro health advanced this toothpaste does everything that my teeth need to be healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel more clean &amp; smooth than ever.</li>
            <li> I didn’t enjoy a clean refreshing feeling in my mouth after brushing.</li>
            <li> The BEST part of this product is that my &amp;#34;morning breath&amp;#34; is extremely reduced!</li>
            <li> I mean I&#x27;ve tried a number of toothpastes over the years and while I&#x27;m happy with the kind I&#x27;m using now, toothpastes always seem to overstate how effective they are.</li>
            <li> The two step system is very easy and fast--just 2 minutes of brushing and your teeth have that just-from-the-dentist super clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> I am more confident with my smile and my fresh breath!</li>
            <li> a BzzAgent, I was sent a free sample by Crest and couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to get my teeth whiter in two-minute, twice-a-day brushings after about a week of use.</li>
            <li> Best of all, my mouth felt fresh and clean, using such a user-friendly whitening regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was able to try a full size sample for free and being a fan of crest whitening strips</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks and overall am pretty impressed.</li>
            <li> so I’m glad that the process helped me become more aware of that.  </li>
            <li> Read the fine print...</li>
            <li> Both tasted fine, and went well together.  </li>
            <li> the taste wasn&#x27;t the greatest and brushing second time without rinsing first</li>
            <li> /&gt;The fine folks at Crest provided me this sample</li>
            <li> The taste is fine and there&#x27;s no sensitivity like I had with the strips.  </li>
            <li> Which is perfectly fine as you do not rinse the mint out from step one.</li>
            <li> The entire process took literally two minutes and really impressed me after my first use.  </li>
            <li> I already had a healthy brushing regiment and white teeth to start &amp; still experienced a noticeable difference in how clean the surface of my teeth felt.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste tastes fine.</li>
            <li> First I&#x27;d like to say while i received this product free from Crest, my review is honest</li>
            <li> my mouth felt clean and smooth with  nice minty fresh breath.</li>
            <li> Besides that, the way it left our teeth feeling so fresh and clean was awesome!</li>
            <li> My first box may have been free, but I have continued using it on my own.</li>
            <li> I was more than satisfied with my experience and would recommend it to anyone willing to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Taste was fine.  </li>
            <li> I am more than impressed and just after  a few days my teeth have started to whiten!</li>
            <li> The pros:  1) Tastes fine.  </li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, I have noticed that my teeth are actually whiter from a toothpaste, and that is a great feeling!  </li>
            <li> and you will be fine.</li>
            <li> Not the best taste, Slightly whiter teeth but not 6x as claim.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a Sonicare toothbrush for years, and this system works just fine with it too.  </li>
            <li> I was super exited for this because I love having whiter teeth</li>
            <li> The idea that you had to brush for one minute with each step was also beneficial as it caused me to focus on the time versus just a quick (too-quick according to many dental studies</li>
            <li> did notice a modest amount of whitening but not anything bold or significant.&lt;br /&gt;The taste and texture of both products is appropriate and pleasant, not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky to have naturally healthy teeth, so</li>
            <li> But, it quickly became routine and does not bother me any more.</li>
            <li> Thank you Crest for a super product!</li>
            <li> this two-step process that is quick and thorough!</li>
            <li> When the package arrived, the package was visually bold and striking.  </li>
            <li> The real positive that came from my free promotional kit (I got it free from Crest through a Bzzz promotion!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great thing to do if you are wanting a cheap way to whiten teeth, super easy, and won&#x27;t make teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li> I can reiterate what many other reviewers appear to be saying - although my teeth do feel very clean with use of this product, I haven&#x27;t experienced any noticeable difference in the health of my mouth or the whiteness of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am pretty confident I will see a difference and am happy with the product so far.</li>
            <li> It has a clean, but not overpowering flavor, and after one week of use I went to a dentist appointment and was complimented by the dentist on my clean teeth!</li>
            <li> The two-steps aren&#x27;t really any more work!</li>
            <li> I took the \\&quot;one-week\\&quot; Crest challenge with a free sample, and I gotta say, my smile is looking pretty good.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest for sending me my free sample!!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest, I got to try the product for FREE!!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Bzzagent and Crest, I was able to try this product!  </li>
            <li> Thanks Crest for making a better whitening product!</li>
            <li> I have started to recieve more compliments on my smile and the yellowness that happens over time is disappearing into a beautiful white sparkle...</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health HD was easy to use, the taste was great, and it only takes 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> This two step system has given me more confidence in my smile and breath while still being fairly easy to use.</li>
            <li> I especially like how easy it is to use and how great your mouth feels after</li>
            <li> liked it since it is easy and fast.  </li>
            <li> it did not foam very much, and had a distinct minty taste, which was strong but very refreshing.  </li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Crest for many years- and applaud them for launching new products that just keep getting better and better.  </li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try this product for free thanks to Crest and through my role as a BzzAgent, and boy, am I glad I did!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Crest Pro Health HD thanks to Crest, and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Toothpaste is super important to me and the aspects that are most important to me are taste, price, availability, ability to whiten, anti-cavity, packaging and ingredients.</li>
            <li> I received this as a Free Sample and I am so lucky I did!</li>
            <li> Love this its super easy to use kept my teeth feeling clean all day</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s very easy to use...</li>
            <li> Very easy to use the two step system, not complicated at all.  </li>
            <li> I think that the system is easy to use - much more time effective for me than white strips or trays, and I feel it had better results.</li>
            <li> This product works and I was lucky to receive this product for free to review and I am glad that I did because I now have a whiter smile :-)</li>
            <li> Overall, I was very pleased with the product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, one of the best things about this toothpaste is it doesnt have those really little abrasive balls that everyone found out was getting under the gums and dentists</li>
            <li> I never said anything to the dental hygienist, but she commented on how little plaque I had on my teeth and that I had been doing an excellent job brushing.  </li>
            <li> But I was very pleased with how the one two-step process made my teeth feel clean and look much wider.</li>
            <li> I am very glad that Crest chose me as a recipient of a sample product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel smooth, fresh and look amazing just after the first brush!  </li>
            <li> I am so fortunate I was able to try this for free thanks to Crest!!</li>
            <li> The system is easy to use and you will forget to brush your teeth because your teeth really do feel clean all day!!.  </li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this product as a part of BzzAgent&#x27;s sponsored trials!</li>
            <li> a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> I must start by saying that I am a HUGE Crest fan.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge difference in the shade my teeth are</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t notice a huge change in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li> : While there wasn&#x27;t a huge improvement in whiteness, there was an improvement nonetheless.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a huge bathroom vanity, so for me, having to store 2 tubes of toothpaste</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a huge whitening transformation, but I do not drink coffee</li>
            <li> $20 is a huge rip off.</li>
            <li> : I got to try this free thanks to Crest, but I am reviewing it honestly.</li>
            <li> I am trying this sample for free thanks to crest however all opinions are my own.  </li>
            <li> My teeth seem to be whiter too and that is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I noticed a huge change in the whiteness.  </li>
            <li> it really whitened teeth from what i see - not considering it as the biggest breakthrough but seems to me like whitening was gentle - so quite happy here</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a huge difference in the whiteness of your teeth, I don&#x27;t think a toothpaste is going to cut it.  </li>
            <li> The cleanliness factor is huge with this</li>
            <li> As far as whitening and leaving your breath fresh this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for free thanks to Crest, but the opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say there was a huge change, but anything is miles ahead of the competition.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took before and after photos to see if there would be a huge difference in my teeth.</li>
            <li> there was zero tooth sensitivity noticed which had been a huge concern of mine with any whitening</li>
            <li> so that is huge to me.  </li>
            <li> but after about a week of using Crest Pro-Health HD twice a day I saw a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t notice a huge diffference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> tried this product for free thanks to Crest and BzzAgent, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> while I might not have been expecting a huge leap forward, this is probably the most powerful toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I used it for 1 week and noticed a huge difference in the color of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t notice a huge change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried a few whitening toothpastes and hadn&#x27;t been impressed, but I&#x27;d received this as a free sample.</li>
            <li> I actually enjoy brushing my teeth every morning and night now because I get to see results and my teeth have never felt so clea.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel smooth, just like how they feel after leaving from a dental appointment.</li>
            <li> I have tried every whitening toothpaste and product available.  </li>
            <li> I had not received the free trial of Crest -Pro Health HD through BzzAgent</li>
            <li> But worth it because I love my whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> got this as a part of a free promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free marketing sample.</li>

            <li> I received the Crest Pro-Health HD toothpaste for free as a part of a promotion from Crest via BuzzAgent.</li>
            <li> This product, however, is a big win.</li>
            <li> I received this for free from BzzAgent</li>
            <li> Fortunately, my Sonicare toothbrush handled that for me.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product and thanks to Crest for letting me try this product for FREE!</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> We are loving this toothpaste combo that we received free thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li> I feel more confident, and my teeth really do look whiter.</li>
            <li> I feel more confident, and my teeth really do look whiter.</li>
            <li> So, far, so good.</li>
            <li> First, it tastes pretty good.  </li>
            <li> works good, could use more product in the second tube</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste keeps your mouth super clean all day though eating and drinking .</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product and be able to ditch my bleaching routine that I do every 3 mos or so.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Crest for such a great toothpaste product!</li>
            <li> Thanks Crest for such a great toothpaste product!</li>
            <li> If it were all in one process, that would be ideal, but the results make the extra step worth it.  </li>
            <li> It was as good as professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I love the super clean feeling this system leaves me with.</li>
            <li> This seems to be as good as I can expect, unless I get it professionally done at the dentist, which I don’t think I’ll be doing anytime soon.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest, I was able to try it for free!  </li>
            <li> My teeth are naturally not-that-white, and I don&#x27;t help things by drinking lots of tea, so I was hoping to see some good results after the week was up.</li>
            <li> Overall the product does a good job cleaning, and an okay job whitening, considering it is an over the counter product</li>
            <li> For me, I was much more interested in the health aspects of the Crest Pro Health® HD(tm)toothpaste, so I still feel like the system is a good upgrade from my normal brushing</li>
            <li> but I really was impressed by how white my teeth were!</li>
            <li> This is better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and thanks to Crest for letting me try it for free!</li>
            <li> I think that the biggest advantage of this system is that it&#x27;s fairly affordable compared to whitening strips or professional whitening.</li>
            <li> far so good.</li>
            <li> I feel more confident, and my teeth really do look whiter.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest, I was able to try Crest Pro-Health HD for free!  </li>
            <li> I love the super clean feeling I get with Crest HD.</li>
            <li> I got this product and so far have mostly good things to say.</li>
            <li> but it really isnt anything more than just one more step.</li>
            <li> Once I got into the rhythm of brushing, spitting, remembering to not rinse!, and then repeating with step 2, I realized that it really wasn&#x27;t that more more work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to find this product in my local stores, so that was a good thing for when I need a refill.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say I love the super clean feeling and no morning breath.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not uncomfortably gritty - in fact it feels kind of nice.  </li>
            <li> So far after two weeks of use, this seems like a good product.  </li>
            <li> After step 2 is added and complete, a good thorough rinse takes away the &amp;#34;chalky&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li> and I love that the step one gives me that super clean feeling and the step two polishes and shines.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt as smooth right after brushing and felt and stayed smooth for most of the tie till I ate another meal which is really a fantastic plus</li>
            <li> How much easier can it be to have a great white smile!!!</li>
            <li> in all, if you&#x27;re looking for super clean feeling, whiter teeth, give this stuff a shot!</li>
            <li> The first bottle of actual tooth paste was pleasant and nice to use.  </li>
            <li> After the first use, my teeth looked whiter and felt very clean, dentist clean!</li>
            <li> The two step process is easy to do and doesn&#x27;t end up taking any longer than my normal routine, so that&#x27;s nice.  </li>
            <li> It is nice to use a whitening product that is easily integrated into my normal routine</li>
            <li> The first toothpaste is super foamy, I liked the flavor of it</li>
            <li> I got to try this product for free, which is nice because I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought it other wise.  </li>
            <li> and I am ordering more for me and my family at my expense right away.</li>
            <li> I am HIGHLY recommending that you try this product, you will love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, and my mouth was definitely clean, but the whitening is the stand out feature</li>
            <li> and he instantly loved the clean and refreshing feel it left.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I tried this product and would definitely recommend it to anyone that is looking for a brighter, fresher smile!</li>
            <li> Crest PH Advanced helped me feel confident when dealing with others because my breath was fresh and my teeth were clean.</li>
            <li> I also find the taste to be pleasant in general, and I do feel that the stains on my teeth are disappearing and my teeth are getting whiter.</li>
            <li> It’s is vey easy to use and the taste is not bad.  </li>
            <li> After getting this free kit and having such good results I&#x27;m excited to try more new free products!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tried out this Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste that I got through BzzAgent and can see my teeth are whiter after the first application!!  </li>
            <li> Thanks Crest!!!</li>
            <li> It leaves your mouth feeling very fresh and my teeth were shiny</li>
            <li> The reason I removed a star, though, is because my mouth didn’t feel very fresh and minty as I would like after brushing.</li>
            <li> but to me very worth it.</li>
            <li> but it definitely whitens very effectively.</li>
            <li> It is very powerful and I could feel the difference in terms of the plaque being removed.  </li>
            <li> system worked well for me, leaving my mouth feeling very fresh for hours after brushing.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh, clean feeling of my teeth after checkups at the dentist.  </li>
            <li> I feel fresh, clean and confident.</li>
            <li> I love how clean my mouth feels and how fresh.  </li>

            <li> My teeth felt and looked really smooth, clean and tartar free.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt and looked really smooth, clean and tartar free.</li>
            <li> The toothpastes had a great taste to them and definitely left my mouth feeling clean, but there were two drawbacks in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li> In the course of a month, I had to use my old toothpaste while I was traveling and did not feel like my teeth were clean and bright</li>
            <li> This product is great for use in between dental cleanings to keep your teeth clean and white.</li>
            <li> I love how fresh and clean my mouth and teeth feels.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s minty and fresh, and generally decent, bordering on good.</li>
            <li> My teeth also feel very clean and my breath fresh after using the Crest Pro Health HD set.  </li>
            <li> My teeth felt very clean and my breath smelled fresh.</li>

            <li> First I have to preface by saying that I do take very good care of my teeth, see my dentist regularly and always use whitening toothpaste and mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> Although I haven’t seen much change in the shade, my teeth feel extremely clean all day!!  </li>
            <li> After only one use of the toothpaste and whitener I was delighted to find out how clean my teeth felt!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving my new Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Thanks to the good people at BzzAgent and Crest, I was able to give this product a test run for free!&lt;br /&gt;Although I cannot say with any scientific certainty that this toothpaste does in fact make you teeth whiter, but what I can say is that it makes your teeth and mouth feel brand spanking new.  </li>
            <li> Clean feeling is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Then when you apply the finishing step, my teeth become so smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I would recommend if you are looking for a clean mouth with smooth feeling teeth and do not mind a 2 step brushing process.</li>
            <li> It leaves my teeth feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel smooth and clean even up to when I do my nightly brushing.&lt;br</li>

            <li> it feels like you just got a cleaning at the dentist, teeth surface feels clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> My gums feel healthier, my teeth are becoming plaque free and my smile is sparkling.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel smooth and clean longer throughout the day, and I have the post-dentist feeling in my mouth every time I&#x27;m finished.</li>
            <li> Then, Step 2 leaves your teeth feeling silky smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Running my teeth on my gums insured they were clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I do notice that my teeth feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> it leaves my teeth feeling soo smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> What I can say is that after I brush my teeth they feel smooth and clean</li>
            <li> And that clean, smooth feel lasts all day even after I eat.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> , my teeth still have a clean, smooth feel.</li>
            <li> I wake up with really smooth and clean teeth.</li>
            <li> The smooth clean feeling lasts through food and sleep.</li>
            <li> I found that the Crest PH Advanced kept my teeth feeling clean ALL day; even after eating.</li>
            <li> All in all, after 2 days, I&#x27;m pretty happy with Crest Pro Health HD so far.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> No morning breath and clean, smooth teeth.  </li>
            <li> The 2-step process is super easy.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s super easy and the added steps, in my opinion, are what make the difference.</li>
            <li> I also have really brilliant white teeth now, and I am an avid Dt. soda drinker.</li>
            <li> My Listerine Whitening rinse is far superior (if I use it twice per day for one full minute before brushing).  </li>
            <li> I like the quick and easy steps to also get my whitening in</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of strange, but nice.  </li>
            <li> Super easy to use.</li>
            <li> The first toothpaste is the cleaner, which really seems to do a good job with the cleaning.</li>
            <li> I was able to test this product free thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li> but it was quick and easy.</li>

            <li> I was able to try Crest Pro-Health HD free thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li> can honestly say that my teeth have never felt cleaner than when I used this system with my Spinbrush classic.</li>
            <li> The flavor wasn&#x27;t the best and left my mouth feeling kinda dry, but it was effective at whitening without causing tooth discomfort.</li>
            <li> The gel also tasted fine, was cool and cleansing.  </li>
            <li> , that was the first thing i noticed (and it smells good too haha).</li>
            <li> The directions were easy to follow and it was a quick process.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, when this popped up as my first BzzAgent free sample, I was not the most enthused</li>
            <li> So glad I got to try this product for free thanks to bzzagent and crest!</li>
            <li> sweet boyfriend has told me that my smile looks better than ever.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health HD is my favorite, new #HealthyObsession!!!  </li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with the new Crest Pro Health HD!!!</li>
            <li> Love this new toothpaste!!!</li>
            <li> and I really like the product it was very easy to use</li>
            <li> What I did not like about step 2 is that it had a very &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; hotness taste like a VERY STRONG peppermint taste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really my new healthy obsession!  </li>
            <li> I will admit that my teeth feel so clean and smooth after using it and my breath is so fresh!</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health HD is a quick and easy way to a whiter smile!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> You do have a nice clean feeling when done, but I think that most people do not typically brush for a full 2 minutes like they should.  </li>
            <li> - my mouth feels really clean and fresh and so easy - my smile is brighter and the minty taste is refreshing.</li>
            <li> I let them know that not only is this amazing toothpaste easy to use, and helping to keep my teeth clean and healthy...</li>
            <li> In addition to cavity-fighting fluoride, the toothpaste contains some sort of abrasive which does not damage teeth but gets them super clean, nice and smooth and very shiny.</li>
            <li> I had that fresh clean smile....and breath!</li>
            <li> My mouth is so fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> Mouth feels fresh and clean after every use!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product and will definite continue to use this as my new toothpaste and recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my new morning routine and will keep using Crest Pro-Health HD.  </li>
            <li> I was really impressed with the new Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step system toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels very fresh and minty clean after brushing.  </li>
            <li> It makes your breath feel very fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> This gel had a very medicinal flavor which I didn&#x27;t find pleasant, but it wasn&#x27;t off-putting too much.</li>
            <li> the product takes way more time to work ... for me worked really smoth and easy ..</li>
            <li> : Tastes good despite being a function focused product, easy to use, immediate results, will last a while&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> All my teeth were super smooth and free of plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved how easy the system all you needed to do was just simply brush with each step for two minutes.</li>
            <li> This was super exciting since I assume with continued use I can expect even greater results.</li>
            <li> This gel had a very medicinal flavor which I didn&#x27;t find pleasant, but it wasn&#x27;t off-putting too much.</li>
            <li> The two step process is easy but your teeth feel super clean when finished.</li>
            <li> I started using it right away and was excited about the results, my teeth felt cleaner longer and were visibly whiter!  </li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use and makes my teeth very shiny and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> The two-step process takes no time at all and left my mouth feeling - amazing!</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health HD toothpaste is a great way to whiten your teeth, I have to say that I have tried other product but never had great success and could never bring myself to spend money to have my teeth professionally whitened.  </li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure about the taste, but I like it</li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am willing to keep using this, just for that magical force field alone.</li>
            <li> First you brush for a minute with the purifying cleanser which has a refreshing minty taste, then brush for another minute with the perfecting gel.  </li>
            <li> he too was excited to try it.</li>
            <li> Upon waking my mouth and breath feel fresh!</li>
            <li> I was excited.</li>
            <li> I think having two steps also makes me more aware</li>
            <li> My mouth feels fresh and glossy all day!</li>
            <li> thanks to Smiley360&#x27;s free sample offer I was able to try for free before buying.</li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant whitening, compared to the label which says up to six shades lighter teeth in a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> I have noticed a significant change in the color of my teeth</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s a significant difference.  </li>
            <li> My husband has seen more than stellar results.</li>
            <li> Within the first day I was able to tell a difference in the way my teeth felt.  </li>
            <li> This bothers me a bit, but let me tell you the pluses for this makes it all worth it!</li>
            <li> The first tube you use has a &amp;#34;wintergreen&amp;#34; taste -- not one of my favorite flavors.</li>
            <li> Does this product deliver significantly whiter teeth?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure my teeth would be whiter than they have been in years.</li>
            <li> The flavor is great and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trying to whiten your smile, give this a shot!</li>
            <li> I was so excited because I have been using crest products exclusively for years.</li>
            <li> The one big issue I have is that tube 1 has a flip top (great!), but the 2nd tube is a twist cap.  </li>
            <li> Instead of being excited to use this stuff, you&#x27;ll feel like it&#x27;s a chore.</li>
            <li> but when I looked in the mirror and saw the instantaneous results it made me smile!</li>
            <li> my smile look happier!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product because I am a fan of Crest whitening strips.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the first step of this teeth whitening system.</li>
            <li> Although I could be sure that there was a difference, a friend came by today and the first thing she said when she hopped out of her car was, &amp;</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my mouth feel fresh and, after a week of use, my teeth are noticeably whiter and brighter!  </li>
            <li> , is how it allowed me to like my smile!</li>
            <li> i was excited to receive this to try out as a bzzagent.</li>
            <li> Yeah worth it!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this courtesy of Crest (thanks Crest!), but, rest assured, my review is exactly as it would be if I&#x27;d bought it with my own hard-earned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 2-step process is unique.</li>
            <li> The first time that I used this product, I truly wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from it.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to be selected by BzzAgent to try out a full size sample of Crest ProHealth HD toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> The two steps, at first I thought would be a pain, but super easy!</li>
            <li> and I did not notice a significant difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> and I was so excited to do so.  </li>
            <li> I received a sample of the Crest Pro-Health HD system from BzzAgent and was excited to try it out.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend Crest ProHealth HD to everyone, the world deserves a brighter smile!</li>
            <li> Also, each day after brushing the night before, I woke up with fresh breath!</li>
            <li> The most noticeable change will be during the first use.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can smile with confidence now!</li>
            <li> What makes this product unique, as the name says, is that it is a two-step process designed to get teeth both cleaner (by stripping away plaque) and whiter (by polishing teeth).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how to feel about it at first.</li>
            <li> My biggest challenge with the two steps at first was making sure I didn&#x27;t rinse in between, but even after 2 days or so, I got the hang of that too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first 7 days of using this product, my teeth sure were whiter.</li>
            <li> I supposed I may buy it again to use in between real whitening treatments as a way to keep my teeth bright, but I dont think it will MAKE your teeth white on its own.</li>
            <li> This is a fun product: an oral hygiene adventure!</li>
            <li> Step two is the unique part-</li>
            <li> The taste is minty fresh too!</li>
            <li> Step two is the unique part, it whitens and polishes your teeth.</li>
            <li> We are 2 weeks into it and they are even better than the first week.  </li>
            <li> first i wasn&#x27;t sure about the way my mouth felt</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> I have the smile of a star!</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s also the best product to use if you are looking for the quickest way to whiten teeth since 2 minutes is significantly shorter than the usual 60 minutes.</li>
            <li> Step 1 and Step 2 equals a brighter smile!</li>
            <li> and I was really excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to see the results as I continue to use this system.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this product.</li>
            <li> Buy it, try it, &amp; start showing a whiter smile!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try a whitening product as I have never had my teeth whitened or used whitening strips.  </li>
            <li> anyways, i love this toothpaste so much!</li>
            <li> In full disclosure- I received a free trial of this product from Crest.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> My mouth felt healthier, and my smile was brighter!</li>
            <li> Its worth it!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the try!</li>
            <li> No one gets excited to brush their teeth as it is an automatic routine.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to receive the Crest Pro Health HD system as part of the BzzAgent campaign.  </li>
            <li> It seemed like a unique product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it!  </li>
            <li> For $13, this is definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> I have not noticed a significant whitening difference but look forward to finishing the set and to see if I get my desired results.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to try this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure -- I was given this product free by the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> It adds another minute to your dental care, but it&#x27;s really worth it!</li>
            <li> I received full size tubes of Crest pro-health HD 2 step whitening toothpaste from BzzAgent for free.</li>
            <li> In the sake of full disclosure, I did receive a free sample of this product through BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sure the toothpaste is two steps and at first looks like it will take longer.</li>
            <li> I was excited to be invited to use Crest Pro Health HD as a Bzzzagent.  </li>
            <li> At first I was like, okay,</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my smile within one week!  </li>
            <li> While it probably maintained my original color, I didn&#x27;t see any significant difference in the whiteness or brightness of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Six shades, to me, is a significant difference.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li> First of all, I have to say I don&#x27;t love the taste.  </li>
            <li> When I used it the first time, I found I enjoyed the taste</li>
            <li> I do not have the whitest teeth, so I was excited to try this product from Crest and BzzAgent, Crest Pro Health HD.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love the flavor, but willing to overlook that for results!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However after the first use I found that it is more than just &amp;#34;another toothpaste&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I was selected for this campaign</li>
            <li> I was excited about trying this product, after all who&#x27;s teeth couldn&#x27;t use some whitening.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Initial pros: the full size package we received is huge</li>
            <li> I was able to use it to quickly and easily clean AND brighten my smile.  </li>
            <li> brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really excited to try this because I drink a lot of coffee and the coffee was beginning to noticeably stain my teeth.  </li>
            <li> So full disclosure, I received Crest Pro Health® HD™ toothpaste for free to try as part of a promotion with Crest and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> Other than that I have loved it!</li>
            <li> I was excited to continue using the product to see the results.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get my BzzAgent Crest Pro Health® HD™ kit in the mail, but a bit leery as well.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s actually pretty fantastic!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s actually pretty fantastic!</li>
            <li> but well worth it!</li>
            <li> I received a sample from Crest and BzzAgent and am so excited with the preliminary results .</li>
            <li> I received a full size product to try for free from Smiley 360.  </li>
            <li> What makes the Crest Pro Health® HD system unique is the two step process.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for 6 days and have seen a significant change in the whiteness of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I plan to continue using it until it is gone and then determine if the difference is really significant.  </li>
            <li> my smile has after using this product!</li>
            <li> I know the change must be significant.</li>
            <li> Worth buying!</li>
            <li> A brighter smile, cleaner teeth and fresher breath!</li>
            <li> 9 days later, I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> and my mouth feels so fresh!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 100% worth it!  </li>
            <li> I was able to tell a difference in the first week.  </li>
            <li> you aren&#x27;t sensitive and you&#x27;re looking for a toothpaste that gives you a super clean feeling, this is a good</li>
            <li> I did not however notice a significant difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Even if it doesn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s the cleanest any toothpaste has ever made my mouth feel and that alone is worth it!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I was selected for this campaign</li>
            <li> Also I was excited to try this product since its claim was providing cleaner, whiter teeth within a week.  </li>
            <li> Over the past 3 weeks, my wife and I have used the Crest Prod Health HD product (as part of a BzzAgent campaign we were supplied with the kit from Crest) and the results have been great!  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> How refreshing that a product works.&lt;br /&gt;I was sceptical at first, but as soon as I received Crest Pro-Health HD (I am a BzzAgent)</li>
            <li> my free full size sample runs out</li>
            <li> I am even excited to go to the dentist</li>
            <li> I did not see any significant change in tooth color.  </li>
            <li> I originally thought it would be a hassle</li>
            <li> So join me in making your smile what they noticed about you &amp; remember!</li>
            <li> I received a free full size sample from Crest.</li>
            <li> The result is so worth it!</li>
            <li> I am going to have my husband test out the product to see if he sees any significant whitening.</li>
            <li> I am going to have my husband test out the product to see if he sees any significant whitening.</li>
            <li> Many times, I have just used the first - spit it out and rinsed because I forgot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small thing, but if there were some way it could be in one tube - it would be wonderful.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to give this a go.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Whitening: Im not sure this product did a superb job at making my teeth whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would like something that whitens and makes my mouth feel fresh!</li>
            <li> After several weeks, they were remarkably whiter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> When Bzzagent offered me the chance to try this product, I was somewhat excited.</li>
            <li> When I first heard about Crest Pro Health HD, I have to admit that I had hoped it would involve a bit of magic.</li>
            <li> I am part of a campaign through Bzz Agent to try this unique product.  </li>
            <li> so I have to admit I was excited when this product (Crest pro Health HD) came out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m big on having a real healthy mouth...</li>
            <li> I made this mistake the first time &amp; the system works much better when directions are followed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I did not notice a significant improvement in the whiteness of my teeth or significantly improved oral health after using the product for a month when compared to a tube of toothpaste that costs 1/3rd the price.</li>
            <li> I will not only continue to use Crest Pro Health HD myself, but I have already spread the good word to my husband and he&#x27;s excited to have the fresh, clean, healthy experience too.</li>
            <li> After my first use I noticed a difference in the clean feel of my teeth, they felt so smooth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether I&#x27;ve had the 6x whiter teeth that the product claims, but I&#x27;m very happy about how clean my teeth feel.  </li>
            <li> It made my teeth feel so clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> Without a doubt, my mouth feels clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> My mouth has never felt so clean or fresh!  </li>
            <li> And in addition to feeling clean, the added bonus was that my teeth were significantly whiter after just two days of using the product.</li>
            <li> Loving my new smile!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pretty impressed with how nice my mouth feels and looks after using this toothpaste, and despite the hefty cost and extra sensitivity, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase Crest Pro Health HD in the future.</li>
            <li> I was super excited when I received it for free in the mail from Crest to review.</li>
            <li> but I was super excited to receive this toothpaste for free via BzzAgent and Crest.</li>
            <li> For free courtesy of Crest, I was super excited.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try the product , but after the first use of it I realized this product is not for me ...</li>
            <li> I use a Sonicare toothbrush, so before trying this new product I was already used to an effective brushing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay foamed very long, so you have to be quick.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product.</li>
            <li> Works great, super easy to use, no funny tastes or feeling when you are done, my new favorite whitener!</li>
            <li> But this does give me a clean feeling.</li>
            <li> my teeth did not feel clean any of those times.</li>
            <li> It bubbles in your mouth like hydrogen peroxide and makes your teeth squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product free thanks to Crest and I am so thankful to have had the opportunity.  </li>
            <li> I was lucky to receive this toothpaste for free from Crest as a BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> Not once has ANY of the toothpastes I&#x27;ve used ever gotten my teeth as clean feeling as this 2 step program did.</li>
            <li> It did make my mouth feel clean.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels really clean after brushing, which I love.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although, thanks to Crest I was able to try this product out for free I cannot get over the cost.</li>
            <li> Foods no longer stick to my teeth and my mouth feels clean throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free and really looked forward to using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Step 1 is to clean your teeth and remove plaque.</li>
            <li> I will say however if you are using this product to get your teeth clean</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s effective, fast to bring results, and fun to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> peppermint flavor gel toothpaste (Step 1) made my mouth feel incredibly, incredibly clean.</li>
            <li> No bleeding with this product, and even 7 hours after morning brushing and eating, my teeth still feel clean.</li>
            <li> my teeth felt so clean.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean and I feel they are whiter.  </li>
            <li> stopped bleeding&lt;br /&gt;After-Dentist clean feeling that lasts&lt;br /&gt;Really does whiten teeth&lt;br</li>
            <li> That being said, I will still recommend this product to others and probably purchase it once it runs out, as you can&#x27;t beat the clean feeling and ease of whitening.  </li>
            <li> Overall though this is a great product and worth a try.</li>
            <li> My mouth has never felt so clean...</li>
            <li> After brushing with both products...my teeth feel dentist clean after each use.</li>
            <li> I like how it makes my teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> It made me think that my teeth were not that clean.  </li>
            <li> but my teeth do feel really clean.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste gives you the clean fro!m</li>
            <li> My mouth has never felt so clean...</li>
            <li> Another minute of brushing with this paste will leave a euphorically clean sensation all around your mouth.</li>
            <li> My teeth are dentist clean and they don&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; on them.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste made my mouth feel really clean</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean every time and everyone comments on my pearly whites.</li>
            <li> I have never felt my teeth so clean.</li>
            <li> Even after leaving the dentist my gums and teeth never felt this clean.</li>
            <li> Given this purported to clean your teeth too, I figured it had to have some stuff closer to the stronger things the dentist uses.  </li>
            <li> It does not taste as minty as the toothpaste I was used to using but it does make my mouth feel clean.</li>
            <li> Clean, clean, clean.</li>
            <li> no pain AND clean teeth.  </li>
            <li> The clean lasts through the night and if I forget my morning brushing or don&#x27;t have time, the clean feeling lasts well into the afternoon .</li>
            <li> While this product made my teeth feel clean, I didn&#x27;t see any difference in the color of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> My teeth still felt clean</li>
            <li> My teeth were amazingly clean every day.  </li>
            <li> After using it, my teeth are slippery and feel really clean, I just didn&#x27;t like the added sensitivity I had from long-term use.  </li>
            <li> but they did feel clean.</li>
            <li> Before using this I would always feel like my toothpaste didn&#x27;t get my teeth completely clean.</li>
            <li> But after using this I can&#x27;t believe how clean my teeth feel.</li>
            <li> the ultra clean mouth feel you get after use.</li>
            <li> a fully clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> in makes sense - clean your teeth then polish &amp; whiten.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your teeth feel clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li> and I felt like my teeth were clean after this</li>
            <li> I think it is a lot more convenient than trying to remember to do white strips, and I think it is as effective at whitening.</li>
            <li> I did feel like my mouth was clean</li>
            <li> It made my teeth feel squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous teeth whitening products and this is by far the best!!</li>
            <li> and my mouth feels clean - like after a dentist visit.  </li>
            <li> We are hoping now that his teeth are clean again that using it will keep the build up to a minimum.  </li>
            <li> My teeth felt polished, I could feel how clean they were.</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two Step Toothpaste for free through BzzAgent, and I loved the idea of it.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel amazingly clean.</li>
            <li> My mouth felt clean all day...and still feels clean every day.</li>
            <li> the whole process is much more comfortable than whitening strips.  </li>
            <li> For me, I felt like it gave that fresh-from-the-dentist clean feeling, and that lasted each day.</li>
            <li> Fresh breath, white teeth, and that clean feeling all the time are all great things in toothpaste.</li>
            <li> even more my smile looked brighter and my mouth tasted fresh.  </li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health HD is the answer to clean your teeth, whitening your teeth and freshening your breath.  </li>

            <li> My teeth feel so clean afterwards</li>
            <li> One thing I liked about these products is that you feel more inclined to brush for longer; they recommend 3 minutes total of brushing (1 for the cleansing, and 2 for the purifying gel).  </li>
            <li> My mouth felt really clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li> However, my mouth still feels clean after using the HD system.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t give this product 5 stars because while step 1 makes your teeth and mouth feel clean as hell it also dries your mouth out.  </li>
            <li> I received this toothpaste for free and I cannot say enough good things about Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste.</li>
            <li> clean feeling even lasts through the night so that never once did I wake up with &amp;#34;morning breath mouth&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even better, I got to evaluate the product for free thanks to Crest.  </li>
            <li> I was initially given this kit for free to try this toothpaste out, but loved it so much I ended up buying 4 more kits to have available when I run out.</li>
            <li> my mouth, even after meals, remain clean until my bedtime brushing.</li>
            <li> I received the product for free (BzzAgent/Crest HD Sponsored) and was intrigued by the bold &amp;#34;6x whiter in a week&amp;#34; label.  </li>
            <li> I was able to try Crest pro health HD toothpaste for free thanks to Crest.  </li>

            <li> I have never had a toothpaste clean as well as this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an overly mint-y toothpaste, so don&#x27;t expect that &amp;#34;refreshed&amp;#34; feeling in your mouth, but it does leave them feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that sort of clean</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to people who wanted a multi-purpose, affordable way to whiten their teeth while at the same time having more effective cleaning.</li>

            <li> My teeth felt clean and polished.</li>
            <li> I am so glad Bzzagent chose me to  try it free thanks to Crest.</li>

            <li> The flavor is not overpowering, yet my mouth feels clean all day.</li>
            <li> I remember the 1st time I used my electric toothbrush and my teeth felt like silk - so polished and clean</li>
            <li> Once the gel combined with the cleanser, my mouth was already feeling extremely clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how this great system will affect my smile within the next week.</li>
            <li> My teeth never felt this clean after a brush.</li>

            <li> I was able to try it free thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel about as clean as they do after a dental cleaning.</li>
            <li> I also like how the toothpaste makes my mouth feel clean.</li>
            <li> I know I will continue to use this product because my teeth never felt this clean before</li>
            <li> so I figured I have a clean slate to start this journey on.</li>
            <li> It is actually more effective than sodium fluoride because not only does it strengthen teeth, it is also antimicrobial!</li>
            <li> It leaves your mouth with a dentist-esque clean.</li>
            <li> I had to go to the dentist and have them clean my teeth to get the stains off.</li>
            <li> My teeth did feel clean after brushing and had the feeling of going to the dentist.</li>
            <li> However I don&#x27;t think the benefit of a clean feeling outweighs the increased sensitivity and lack of whitening.</li>
            <li> but it is super important.</li>
            <li> I received this FREE PRODUCT thanks to Crest and I am completely in love with it.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed how whiter my teeth were and how clean my mouth felt.  </li>
            <li> but I do like the clean feeling.</li>
            <li> white.&lt;br /&gt;Super clean mouth?</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel as clean.</li>
            <li> So I had a chance to pick this up for free, because it really sounded interesting</li>
            <li> I will say that my teeth feel clean after use</li>
            <li> I tend to have more sensitive gums than many others, so I didn&#x27;t want to firebomb this</li>
            <li> my mouth still feels clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean</li>
            <li> Step 1 is intended to clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li> were literally squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> I felt like my teeth stayed cleaner longer during the day and in the morning I woke with them feeling clean still.  </li>
            <li> They never felt clean and I also seem to have a film on my teeth (maybe from the step 2).  </li>
            <li> but my mouth doesn&#x27;t feel as clean anymore....</li>

            <li> I like the clean feeling that lasts all day.</li>

            <li> The spray got everywhere and it just became a hassle to clean up..</li>
            <li> And even though the molars do not feel completely clean all day, they still feel cleaner than they did before using this product.</li>
            <li> but it does give a clean feeling in the mouth when I run my tongue over my teeth.</li>

            <li> I think that I have never before used a toothpaste or cleaning system that has made my teeth feel so clean as Pro Health HD.</li>
            <li> What I found is that the toothpaste works well to clean my teeth</li>
            <li> This two-step system which includes a purifying cleaner and perfecting gel does work to clean and brighten your teeth.  </li>

            <li> I never felt like I got my teeth as clean as they could be...</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so clean afterwards, like going to the dentist.</li>
            <li> Step 2 almost feels like relief gel because step 1 gets the teeth really clean.  </li>
            <li> It makes your teeth feel clean</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so shiny and clean after using this product...</li>
            <li> I got the Crest Pro-HD product free as part of a promotion from the brand but love the product so much I have stocked up on it for the rest of the family.  </li>
            <li> My teeth felt like they were clean by a dentist.  </li>
            <li> &quot; clean when I rinse with mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> ; clean after using it.</li>
            <li> I was able to try if for free thanks to CREST.</li>
            <li> It is super smooth and makes them sparkly</li>
            <li> This one has a focus on plaque removal and gives you that really CLEAN feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2: is the gel that gives your mouth a thoroughly clean feeling.</li>
            <li> but truly whiter and SQUEAKY clean, without a doubt.</li>
            <li> love the pro Health toothpaste in the 2 step kit, it is much better than the regular Crest Pro Health Whitening Toothpaste, it removes the plaques better giving a nice smooth clean feel on the teeth and leaves my breath fresh longer, also while brushing it foams more than the regular one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use my electric toothbrush to help me time the application of each paste (it beeps every 30 seconds) and find both pastes pleasant enough.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant taste that is reminiscent of wintergreen altoids.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant taste that is reminiscent of wintergreen altoids.</li>
            <li> Another thing I liked was how the directions were very clearly written on the backs of both tubes so you didn&#x27;t have to keep the box.</li>
            <li> It had a nice minty flavor that wasn&#x27;t too strong, and it left my mouth feeling super clean!</li>
            <li> Not only did they feel great moments after brushing but the WHOLE day my teeth felt clean, even after eating &amp; drinking!</li>
            <li> I regularly use another competing whitening toothpaste and received this to try for free, so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because it whitens better or just does a better job of creating a more brilliant luster.</li>
            <li> I went into this positive for most whiteners in my opinion do not work well.</li>
            <li> I can barely get one step done on most days before but now, after feeling the incredible clean feeling after the two steps, I will NEVER go back!!  </li>
            <li> after the first use, my teeth did feel very clean.</li>
            <li> I love that I get a cleaner feel that lasts longer, and my teeth are whiter, but not a fake bright white.  </li>
            <li> I was very interested in trying this two-step toothpaste when I got a free sample.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other whitening products before that didn&#x27;t yield results this good, this quickly, or this easily!</li>
            <li> Before I review this product I think there should be full disclosure, I was able to try this product free thanks to a promotion by Crest.</li>
            <li> The Crest Pro Health® HD™ is a good product but not a long term toothpaste for me.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have had my teeth cleaned professionally every day and love it!</li>
            <li> Total win, right?</li>
            <li> So I was most definitely whistling a different tune when my hygienist told me how beautiful my teeth looked and gave me a clean bill of health with no scraping whatsoever!</li>
            <li> Let me first start off by saying that I was a very lucky girl that I got to try this for free from P&amp;G.  </li>
            <li> It only takes two minutes each morning and night for a clean and bright smile!  </li>
            <li> It works much better than other whitening products I have tried and is very easy to use!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely incredible how clean they feel, but I am a little worried about the whitening portion.  </li>
            <li> so my teeth can look stained easily, but this toothpaste cleaned it right</li>
            <li> Pretty excited about this process!</li>
            <li> Do you like a bright, white smile!  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and does not require any more time than a regular toothpaste but the effects are phenomenal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to fit this into your morning and evening routine and it&#x27;s kind of addictive because it works so well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest Pro-Health HD for about a month now and am pleased to say that I see significantly reduced plaque buildup and much whiter teeth.  </li>
            <li> I was reading through the other reviews and most seemed not so good</li>
            <li> When I read that it would take a week to see results I honestly didn&#x27;t think that would happen, but my own family made a comment that my teeth looked &amp;#34;really white.&amp;#34; I used other Crest toothpaste</li>
            <li> you can afford the cost (which is considerably less than a dental cleaning), I believe that this is the best home treatment available both for real cleaning and for whitening.</li>
            <li> Really gets the mouth feeling so fresh and clean!!</li>
            <li> most certainly made my teeth whiter.</li>
            <li> If you love that just from the dentist feeling, you will certainly get it from this toothpaste system</li>
            <li> Years ago I switched from Listerine to Crest mouthwash and my teeth became so stained that the dentist had to use a special ultrasonic cleaning system on me to get them off.</li>
            <li> today,&amp;#34; without even remembering that I was using a special toothpaste.</li>
            <li> so I have not noticed any special whitening powers after a week of use.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice the part 2 doing anything special for my teeth though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not anything special either in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any special dental needs i.e. sensitivity, but do feel that I have thinner enamel.</li>
            <li> This product worked right away!  </li>
            <li> When I got my kit in the mail, I wanted to start using it right away!  </li>
            <li> My wife noticed right away!</li>
            <li> I felt and saw the difference right away!</li>
            <li> So treat them right!</li>
            <li> so the price was right!  </li>
            <li> I am not obligated to give a positive review, and my evaluation is honest and is based on my own personal experience.ng period.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I am not obligated to give a positive review, and my evaluation is honest and is based on my own personal experience.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try CREST HD for free and at first I was nervous because it was a two step process, but I got over that quickly because of how great my mouth felt the next day.</li>
            <li> But I will say that it is by far the easiest, simplest, most straightforward teeth whitening system that I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Crest Pro-Health HD 2-step (Thanks CREST!!)</li>
            <li> Another bright spot is that it leaves your mouth feeling ridiculously clean even without following with a mouthwash.</li>
            <li> every use my mouth feels fresh and clean and my teeth feel smooth as glass.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Crest PH Advanced has a fresh clean taste.</li>
            <li> My whole mouth feels clean and healthy..</li>
            <li> I love how clean my teeth feel after brushing with Crest Pro-Health HD, but I really haven&#x27;t seen any whitening after a week of use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an overwhelmingly minty flavor which I do tend to prefer and it doesn&#x27;t really foam up, but, my mouth did feel extremely clean.  </li>
            <li> however it was quite a quick process and the the sensation was actually quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> I had been using a particular brand of toothpaste for 10+ years and had not found anything that even compared to it until I was able to try Crest HD for free as a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> I really loved the clean feeling it left in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I loved the clean feel it left</li>
            <li> This toothpaste after the first use gave me a just left the dentist clean feeling that I hadn&#x27;t experienced in years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this toothpaste out</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this product</li>
            <li> I will say I was super excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> I was super excited when Bzzagent sent me</li>
            <li> /&gt;Flavor: I wasn&#x27;t super excited about the flavor.  </li>
            <li> If the results are the most important thing for you, then I highly recommend Crest Pro Health HD.</li>
            <li> Most important feature is efficacy, and I say in this category Crest Pro Health HD scores high.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t think the 2nd step tastes very good, but it&#x27;s not awful either.</li>
            <li> I used it this morning (~ 6:30am) and my teeth still have that clean smooth feel right now (~ 4:30pm).</li>
            <li> am excited to finish out Pro-Health HD to really see results, but as of now, I would recommend this product because it makes my teeth feel very clean after I use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now, and while I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference in the whiteness of my teeth, I do feel like my smile is brighter</li>
            <li> bright white</li>
            <li> We received a product package free from Crest and tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;After a week&#x27;s time my teeth were whiter colored and my mouth really was feeling more fresh and clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a week of using Crest Pro Health HD I noticed a difference in my smile and teeth color, and now after 4 weeks, I have noticed a huge difference....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a huge whitening effect but did have a noticeably cleaner smile.  </li>
            <li> As far as whitening, I haven&#x27;t noticed anything amazing there, but I&#x27;m still going to give it some time.</li>
            <li> I use the mouth wash too and my teeth stay white and bright.  </li>
            <li> My teeth, while still bright and shiny, are definitely whiter than they have been in years.</li>
            <li> while I feel that I&#x27;m still not seeing bright teeth, it is definitely whiter than what I had.</li>
            <li> This cleaning provides a great surface for the Step 2 whitening paste to whiten your teeth with results definitely visible after the first application.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do as great a job in whitening as I had expected.  </li>
            <li> and I know that my teeth don&#x27;t always look bright and white.  </li>
            <li> My smile is dazzling white, after just two weeks of using the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I was definitely interested in trying Pro Health® HD(tm) being a regular coffee drinker, so I was happy to get a sample of the product as part of a promotion from Crest.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone willing to sacrifice time and taste for a more powerful brushing session.</li>
            <li> I did notice my teeth were becoming more sensitive</li>
            <li> I must say, I am a huge fan of the super clean and ultra fresh feeling that I get in my mouth once I am done brushing with this two step system.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as white and bright as they claimed but there was a noticeable difference.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> On top of just feeling overall great, my teeth have whitened considerably.  </li>
            <li> I prefer to brush my teeth for a full 2 minutes with the &#x27;step 1&#x27; to get an adequate clean and cavity prevention, and 1 minute with the &#x27;step 2&#x27; whitening paste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Step 1 leaves your teeth feeling super clean, and Step 2 helps lift and remove stains.  </li>
            <li> The good news is, my teeth did get whiter, but how the toothpaste and gel made my mouth feel left me not wanting to continue use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After over a week of brushing morning and night with both Step one and two, I can confidently say that it really does work.</li>
            <li> I do feel like my teeth are super clean</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re supposed to brush with each paste for one full minute each, with no rinsing in between.  </li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro-Health HD for free complimentary of BzzAgent as part of my bzzAgent campaign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very concerned about keeping my gums healthy.</li>
            <li> My teeth are not noticeably whiter, but to be fair, my teeth are naturally very white.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this is a good product, just maybe not for anyone with OCD.</li>
            <li> The tooth paste (step 1) was very minty and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Thanks Crest for the free sample!</li>
            <li> This product left my teeth feeling and looking good, but there were some things about the product that I&#x27;m not 100% sold on.</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent, I get to try it for free!</li>
            <li> After using step one, my teeth felt super clean.  </li>
            <li> I really have enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li> After just 1 week we both noticed that our teeth felt much cleaner and the shade had more brightness.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see how they feel after a full week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was provided with a full sized sample of crest ProHealth HD from the BzzAgent program.  </li>
            <li> My mouth tingled a bit after use, but it was not painful at all.  </li>
            <li> but it really doesn&#x27;t take any more time than what I was doing before.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel super clean however</li>
            <li> So, while it&#x27;s a cool product/concept, it didn&#x27;t provide the advertised benefits for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a bzz agent and recieved a full size product for sample.</li>
            <li> Also, why is this toothpaste so sweet?</li>
            <li> you can get a good deal on this, or you have really yellow teeth</li>
            <li> you can get a good deal on this, or you have really yellow teeth</li>
            <li> Thanks for letting me try this out for free!</li>
            <li> Full disclaimer, I received a sample of this to test.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews so that should tell you how much I like it.  </li>
            <li> But instead, think of these as two separate brushings, each requiring the full amount(give or take a bit)</li>
            <li> I used it for a week and it really made my teeth whiter :)</li>
            <li> So when I was offered the chance to try Crest Pro Health HD for free through BzzAgent.com, I figured it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t a challenge to brush for the full 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Full disclosure:  </li>
            <li> Gives me the feeling that my teeth are super clean.  </li>
            <li> I received a full sized product as part of te BZZ Agent campaign going on</li>
            <li> I was able to try this free with BzzAgent but will gladly pay to keep using it in the future!</li>
            <li> I received a full size product to test and review as part of a campaign.</li>
            <li> Received a full size sample of Crest Prohealth HD from the maker.  </li>
            <li> although I have yet to have a dental cleaning so whether my dentist says anything will be the true test for me).  </li>
            <li> far I&#x27;ve really liked these.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest for inviting me to try this product for free!</li>
            <li> I loved the idea that I could potentially have whiter teeth without the cost of going to a dentist.  </li>
            <li> I really think it makes them 6x more brighter?</li>
            <li> As an extra benefit, the tube that has the whitener tastes good.</li>
            <li> I received this as a BZZ Agent, but I will continue to buy it because I love it so much.</li>
            <li> After a full week, I cannot believe the difference.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product for another 4 weeks to get the full effect</li>
            <li> Overall good product as all crest products, but</li>
            <li> After a full week&#x27;s trial, did I see the 6X brightness, as promised on the box?</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this, but I had to stop using it because it was tearing up my gums with its abrasive material.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t require any more time than your usual brushing so it will fit perfectly in your busy routine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan, I love this system, because it has given me a lot of power over the cleaning of my mouth, and that I really feel a seense of ownership.</li>
            <li> I received a full size sample of this as a member of bzzagent.  </li>
            <li> Full disclosure</li>
            <li> One full minute for each toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> A downside was that it is time consuming to use, if you follow the directions and brush for the full 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest, I got to try Crest Pro-Health HD for free!</li>
            <li> I found the two step process a bit cumbersome because of the no rinsing after brushing for a full minute.</li>
            <li> : This disciplines me to brush for a full two minutes.</li>
            <li> The good thing is that it didn&#x27;t contain enough SLS to cause a reaction to it!</li>
            <li> I have to plug Crest as I received it for free, but it is very much worth</li>
            <li> I will stick with my Colgate all in one whitening toothpaste but it was a good experience to get to try a different brand.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not such a good thing</li>
            <li> Thanks for letting me try this product for free, Crest!</li>
            <li> Full disclosure</li>
            <li> And my teeth feel SUPER clean as well.</li>
            <li> All in all a good product with definite results</li>
            <li> it forces you to take the full 2 minutes to brush your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Really works and affordable price (even better</li>
            <li> Not as good as the white strips.</li>
            <li> You have to brush with this for a full minute</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest for inviting me to try this product for free!</li>
            <li> My mouth felt super clean.  </li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better product for toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> else I just don&#x27;t feel like the toothpaste is good enough.  </li>
            <li> Tastes good, no gritty aftertaste.</li>
            <li> I will admit this toothpaste did such a good job cleaning and whitening my teeth</li>
            <li> I will absolutely go buy more when this runs out.  </li>
            <li> All in all a good product that I will likely purchase again.</li>
            <li> would like to say thanks to BZZZZ  and crest for allowing me test this product for free!</li>
            <li> After using for 4 days, my mouth is full of sores, had to buy anbesol.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel super clean and I can feel my gums getting Treatment also.</li>
            <li> &amp; I haven&#x27;t even been using the product a full week yet.</li>
            <li> Of course it will last longer that way and still does a good job.</li>
            <li> The only thing I dislike about Crest Pro Health® HD(tm) is that the toothpaste stage doesn&#x27;t foam up as good as others on the market.</li>
            <li> The Step 1 toothpaste has a sweet, minty flavor.</li>
            <li> This stuff is real, and better than advertised.</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent, I was able to try this 2-step whitening toothpaste by Crest (Crest Pro Health HD).</li>
            <li> Full disclosure:  </li>
            <li> Now step 2, the whiting/polishing gel is a cool product.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest, I am to try the Crest Pro-Health HD for free!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest, I was able to try Crest Pro-Health HD two-step toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> My mouth feels super clean after I use it.  </li>
            <li> Full disclosure</li>
            <li> Love this produce and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> (that is if you are brushing your teeth for a full 2 minutes like you&#x27;re supposed to)  </li>
            <li> I loved the flavor and especially knowing that I was doing something proactive to improve the health of my teeth/mouth.</li>
            <li> I received a full sized sample of the Crest Pro-Health HD two-step system.  </li>
            <li> I feel confident that I will continue to use Crest Pro-Health HD, since it does the job and does it really well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see much whitening , but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a BzzAgent and got a full size CrestPro Health HD to try and report on.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest and BzzAgent for allowing me to try this product for free!</li>
            <li> The polishing tube has somewhat of a metallic taste, but like I mentioned, my teeth felt super clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> The super clean feeling lasts all day too.</li>
            <li> Could all the hype I’d read about this Crest product really be true ??  </li>
            <li> Add step-2 to your brush and continue to brush all surfaces of your teeth a additional full minute.</li>
            <li> However my review is true and unbiased.</li>
            <li> However my review is true and unbiased.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have always loved having white teeth.</li>
            <li> The taste is fresh--like baking soda, nothing too cloying or sweet.</li>
            <li> brushing alone helped some, but I still didn&#x27;t always feel like my mouth felt super clean.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look necessarily whiter, but they feel good.</li>
            <li> Before I used this product, I really didn&#x27;t believe it would do what it claims - and more.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how much whitening gel to use.</li>
            <li> Overall, this was easier to use than strips and saved time with good results.</li>
            <li> According to my dentist my teeth are in good shape and they are marble white; however I wanted to try this product in order to make them whiter as advertise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest for giving me the opportunity to try this product for free!</li>
            <li> Super Clean, no plague, even after overnight, and</li>
            <li> It seems effective so far</li>
            <li> This rushing led to me to stick with the tried and true 1 step brushing process.  </li>
            <li> As far as the taste goes the step 1 paste was a nice minty flavor</li>
            <li> &gt; - Super clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Crest also uses real plastic specs...polyethylene in many of their toothpastes that get embedded in gums.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s where the toothpaste may be worth the money, my teeth are so smooth and stay that way all day.</li>
            <li> I would say that I have seen several shades improvement, which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Summary: Overall, I think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Summary: Overall, I think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Good overall product.  </li>
            <li> I also feel that the 2 step process helps to force me to brush for a full 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I loved that both the tubes had different color to avoid confusion (like the step 1 one had</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using the two-step system for about a week, I cannot say for sure that it has whitened my teeth, as I did not take a before photo or intensely study the color of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> and I think that my teeth feel super clean and have dramatically whitened.  </li>
            <li> Sweet tea and coffee are a must have, but they cause a lot of staining.</li>
            <li> That way you get the full whitening effect.</li>
            <li> So far I am thrilled with the purifying stage</li>
            <li> However my review is true and unbiased.</li>
            <li> I love the 2 step process and how it really made a difference in the way my mouth feels.  </li>
            <li> I do not Smoke, drink Coffee or tea, so m teeth are ussually in good shape, but sometimes need freshened up a bit on the white factor regardless.</li>
            <li> (I probably used to cut corners and not brush for the full 1-2 minutes a dentist recommends.)</li>
            <li> Minty, fresh, and smooth.</li>
            <li> Since my teeth are already white and in good condition, I probably would not purchase this product once I use this up.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest for letting me try this for free!</li>
            <li> My teeth were definitely cleaner, and looked good to me.</li>
            <li> So I just go the full 2mins for each step.</li>
            <li> item truly deserves full 5 stars and serves up to the expectations.</li>
            <li> The time requirements (a min for step 1 and then for step 2) could be a bit tricky as most people don&#x27;t really have a timer for their teeth brushing.</li>
            <li> After using the product for a couple of days the two step process was not bad at all</li>
            <li> It is not nearly as bad as the whitening strips or anything that I have received from the dentist, so I am not too worried about using it.</li>
            <li> Not bad, just noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> The taste of the toothpaste and the gel are not bad.</li>
            <li> but it is not a bad tasting toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> The 2 step process is not bad at all.</li>
            <li> The whitening gel has a peroxide flavor, but is not bad.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are not really bad stained</li>
            <li> But I found myself being very diligent to make sure I was brushing with each product for a full minute.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not bad though...</li>
            <li> The other thing that I want to brag about this toothpaste is the clean feeling that I have experienced all day, even around my permanent retainers and after meals.</li>
            <li> Leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean, not to mention my family and friends around me have noticed my brighter smile!</li>
            <li> , it’s a quick and easy process and whitens and brightens my smile and makes my mouth feel fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> I could totally tell a difference after the very first time I used this product, I honestly felt like I just walked out of the dentist office, my teeth were squeaky clean!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing - way easier to use than whitening trays and so so easy to incorporate into my daily brushing routine.  </li>
            <li> Easy way to get a whiter smile and a fresh feeling</li>
            <li> It lasts more than a month and a half, which is good for the money.</li>
            <li> This is a nice change from trays and strips for whitening and easy to work into your daily routine.</li>
            <li> it was eye catching and extremely easy to open.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t turn them super white which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> The product came in a nice and easy to open package.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try Crest Pro-Health HD Daily as a free sample from Crest and it is unique and effective.</li>
            <li> my most recent dental exam was the first of many with zero cavities!</li>
            <li> is that the first tube has a flip top and the second one you use has a twist top!</li>
            <li> With crest pro-Heath HD I noticed a significant difference after the first 2 minute treatment !</li>
            <li> best part, no sensitivity like whiteness in the past!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m even consistently brushing twice a day (in the spirit of full disclosure, I didn&#x27;t always do)!</li>
            <li> My mouth also felt fresh afterwards which again was a HUGE win for me over other products.</li>
            <li> I quickly filled them in on Crest Pro-Health HD and  couple of them ran right out to get their own.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my teeth never feel smooth like they do right after a dental cleaning when my teeth are polished, until now.  </li>
            <li> they feel smooth and feel VERY clean after using this vs normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t want to have a clean and bright smile with white teeth?  </li>
            <li> Want some really clean teeth along with a bright white smile to match?</li>
            <li> The mint flavor in both pastes is sweet and mild and I found the 2 step process novel and</li>
            <li> The instructions were so simple and the best part is that it promises not only to clean the teeth and freshen breath</li>
            <li> The kit is really easy to use just brush with the first tube for 1 minute.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and fast results!</li>
            <li> I will say that this system is pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy and fast!</li>
            <li> One is a flip (the first) and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> So I was pretty excited when I had the opportunity to try it out for free from Crest.  </li>
            <li> Neither were as refreshing as a normal mint paste or gel, so I was excited to rinse after step 2.  </li>
            <li> quite surprisingly my teeth were actually whiter after the very first use.  </li>
            <li> After the very first brushing, my teeth felt like I had just left the dentists&#x27; office ( the good feel).</li>
            <li> I had no sensitivity during or after use, and the product should last for more than one month, so it is a good deal if you want better than average whitening, and you want to keep your gums healthy.  </li>
            <li> Although I initially received this product for free (thanks, BuzzAgent), I have since purchased this using my own money because I am so pleased with the results from using this product.</li>
            <li> (I compare my first time to getting my braces removed- so smooth and clean feeling</li>
            <li> I noticed from the first time I used it how smooth and clean my teeth felt.  </li>
            <li> Your teeth are smooth and clean and your teeth really look whiter!</li>
            <li> When I received the product, I was not very impressed with the flimsy packaging, but though hey it was free I best give it a try.</li>
            <li> My teeth are much whiter and feel very clean.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any sensitivity as I had with other whitening products.</li>
            <li> Step 1 is a sort of blue toothpaste to first clean off all of the plaque and bacteria in your mouth, and had a pleasant minty taste and texture.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced that with any other oral hygiene product and for someone who loves oral hygiene</li>
            <li> I was initially not very confident on the outcome but after trying it I was simply impressed.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the first step, the toothpaste seemed somehow better than regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This 2 tube combination has greatly improved the whiteness of my teeth unlike any other product I have tried unsuccessfully.</li>
            <li> My smile is a bit brighter but not as significant as the packaging claims.</li>
            <li> From the first time using the easy two-step process, my mouth felt so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> While some other whitening toothpastes are too harsh/strong for me and irritate my gums/mouth, I am happy to say that this product did not.</li>
            <li> They looked pretty good and the whole experience was much easier than wearing whitening strips or going to the dentist.  </li>
            <li> I am so pleased they came out with this new product, and I can&#x27;t wait to see my smile in a week!  </li>
            <li> I love my new smile!</li>
            <li> I am more confident while smiling and love it, but there is a down side.</li>
            <li> I am a great person to test products as I am truthful and hard to impress.</li>
            <li> Maybe a shade whiter, but not significant enough for me to consider this a &amp;#34;whitening product.&amp;#34; Still, I love the clean feeling and the taste, so I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> Love this new paste!</li>
            <li> But the results are certainly there!!</li>

            <li> teeth felt “fresh from the dentist” clean after two minutes, instead of 30 minutes in the dental hygienist chair.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with whitening products making my teeth super sensitive, but I have not noticed any sensitive teeth issues with this product which is great.  </li>
            <li> It made my mouth feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> although it keeps my mouth fresh n clean all day</li>
            <li> The 1st gel  cleans my teeth and gives me fresh breath and the clean feeling I like from a toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the 2 steps combined that give you that clean, fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> When we first tried the product we assumed it would be around 50 and that price would be fine with us also</li>
            <li> Now I will agree that my mouth felt fresh, and that my teeth looked a felt clean.  </li>

            <li> Even after I ate a bowl of chili for lunch my teeth and breath felt clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> but they feel clean and fresh all day.</li>
            <li> You know that fresh and clean feeling you get after the dentist?</li>
            <li> my brushing habit tends to be quick in the morning.</li>
            <li> I really believe Crest Pro-Health HD makes my smile better.</li>
            <li> what I like most about the whole process with this product is that it&#x27;s actually FUN to brush with one product for a minute, followed by another for a minute.</li>
            <li> nothing in my experience works that quickly.</li>
            <li> quickly overcame my skepticism after brushing.  </li>
            <li> Love the product and can already see an improvement in the coloring of my teeth, funny taste to get used to at first though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest Pro Health® HD for about a week now, thanks to a fantastic free sample I receive in the mail from Bzz Agent.  </li>
            <li> The two-step toothpaste is an inexpensive, efficient way to get your bright smile back.</li>
            <li> quickly overcame my skepticism after brushing.</li>
            <li> I almost felt like I used a mild sand paper to buff out my teeth</li>
            <li> This a quick alternative to whitening strips.  </li>
            <li> I recently switched to a sonicare electric toothbrush from a regular toothbrush and this toothpaste system seems to be perfect for it.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m doubly happy and we are both smiling a lot more lately.</li>
            <li> However, both of these concern quickly became a non-issue.  </li>
            <li> I got to try this out for free from Crest through BzzAgent, and so far I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This is a quick, 2-step process.  </li>
            <li> I had been wanting to do my annual Crest White Strips, but I was low on cash and hoped that HD would be just as awesome.</li>
            <li> I am a long-time Crest customer and am loyal to the brand.</li>
            <li> I was suprised at the quick results.</li>
            <li> I now use it 1 week a month just to help keep my teeth from getting super stained and I like it for that purpose.  </li>
            <li> I like my routine to be quick.</li>
            <li> But quickly goes away once</li>
            <li> However, using this product quickly changed my mind.  </li>
            <li> (Never thought I&#x27;d say that being a loyal Colgate user)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this is a great product, but would caution those with sensitive teeth since they might not be able to use and enjoy it as much as others.  </li>
            <li> i can only expect that with more prolonged use, more whitening will occur.  </li>
            <li> My smile is so bright and white from the Crest Pro-Health HD.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from the improved whiteness of my test, Crest Pro Health HD has made a tremendous difference in the way my teeth feel.</li>
            <li> You will notice a difference quickly with this Two Step Toothpaste.</li>
            <li> but I quickly got used to it once my mouth and teeth started to feel cleaner and look whiter.</li>
            <li> nothing in my experience works that quickly.</li>
            <li> This product works for whiting and it also made my mouth feel overall more healthy.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health DH Daily Two-Step Toothpaste to try for free, and then I am to give my honest opinion about the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it over a week and really like that my smile seems brighter, but without any of the sensitivity associated with many whitening products.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s quickly smoothed away during Step 2.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, the Crest Pro-Health HD kit is more affordable than the whitening strips or a professional whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , you get decent value out of the kit since you would end up paying much more money by buying a separate toothpaste and whitening strips.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take me any more time than regular teeth brushing. :)</li>
            <li> I was not sure what to think or expect when I signed up to try this product through BzzAgent, but it was a pleasant surprise!  </li>
            <li> Luckily I use a Sonicare that counts off minutes</li>
            <li> I had some whiteness on my gums that went away quickly and the packaging does warn you about this.</li>
            <li> I always sing a song in my head for each minute of brushing and the time passes by quickly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have super yellowed teeth or anything</li>
            <li> I was lucky to receive this product to try and review for Crest Pro Health.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m super picky about chemicals I put into my mouth</li>
            <li> and I have seen a tremendous difference.</li>
            <li> so I am thrilled to have a complete smile of healthier, whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> However, it would have been nice to have received a tooth color chart to really know how much the whitening is progressing.</li>
            <li> and I noticed that the surface stains were gone rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> -I got over this quickly</li>
            <li> I would challenge them to try this product out as it left me feeling more confident that I did not have morning breath.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from the improved whiteness of my test, Crest Pro Health HD has made a tremendous difference in the way my teeth feel.</li>
            <li> Whitening is evident when used consistently, but I am not so sure about the &amp;#34;6x&amp;#34; claim.  </li>
            <li> But I quickly got used to that and didn&#x27;t find it bothersome.  </li>
            <li> Sure, sure I can open it before I get started and close it after I am all done, but that&#x27;s not how I operate and</li>
            <li> Adequate toothbrushing may prevent these stains which are not harmful or permanent and may be removed by your dentist.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a pretty interesting product in that it is the first time</li>
            <li> Crest was kind enough to furnish me a free sample to try and it is a rarity.</li>
            <li> The whiting formula works quickly also.</li>
            <li> As part of a promotion from Crest I was able to receive CREST PRO HEALTH® HD™ for free and all I can say is wow.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this two step tooth paste for anybody that is looking to get rid of some stains and actually have a healthy feeling smiles through most of the day.  </li>
            <li> I would brush my teeth straight after breakfast and most days depending on what I was eating or drink, i.e. not too much dairy, I had the smooth clean feeling until I got to dinner at 6-7 pm at night.  </li>
            <li> Here is a quick list of the pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> It is a metallic taste that doesn&#x27;t dissipate quickly.</li>
            <li> 4 stars, because I don&#x27;t think the two tubes is super convenient for travel</li>
            <li> My spouse even noticed immediately and was impressed with the whitening power in such a short time!  </li>
            <li> Could not believe how quickly it whitened my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Quick results.</li>
            <li> quickly overcame my skepticism after brushing.</li>
            <li> Super easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I had to keep sneaking in a quick glance in the mirror to believe it.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great product and I highly recommend using it!</li>
            <li> Using Crest Pro Health HD daily removes the surface stains and keeps my smile bright.</li>
            <li> My teeth not only look better but they feel better.</li>
            <li> Best part is, not only does the feeling last all day, it also noticeably whitens your teeth as well!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t notice super noticeable results for whitening</li>
            <li> As the days went on, it only got better and better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regarding the whitening claims, before I started using the product I had noticed some mild yellowing along the bottom row.  </li>
            <li> I felt that the product cleared that up fairly quickly, within a couple of days of use.  </li>
            <li> It is a quick 2 step system, rather than an overnight or 30 minute whitening strip.</li>
            <li> , how could they fix that so quickly?</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Crest Pro Health HD whitening toothpaste for free to use and review from Crest via Bzzagent, and have only presented my honest opinions on the product as a consumer..</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Crest Pro Health HD whitening toothpaste for free to use and review from Crest via Bzzagent, and have only presented my honest opinions on the product as a consumer.</li>
            <li> but I will definitely buy it on my own when my free sample runs out.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ll bet much brighter or not, but it was easy, works well, and that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky</li>
            <li> Also, because you brush one minute first with the ProHealth tube and then brush for one minute with the whitening/polishing gel, you are making sure that you&#x27;re brushing as much as your dentist recommends!</li>
            <li> I was quickly shown the difference:  </li>
            <li> So much easier and because of that I have been using this product regularly and getting great results.  </li>
            <li> I did receive this product free from the brand as part of a promotion, but I will definitely be repurchasing with my own money and recommending to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> Crest was nice enough to send me this for free.</li>
            <li> It feels really clean and fresh and my teeth were noticeably whiter and quickly too.  </li>
            <li> I was lucky to receive a promotional sample of this product.</li>
            <li> but now that I&#x27;m getting older and drinking more coffee, I can see some yellowing myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super picky about how my toothpaste tastes, so I&#x27;ve always been a Colgate girl -</li>
            <li> The main thing, I think, is just to make sure you don&#x27;t rinse in between.</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised by this two step process, as it was very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It is not messy and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> All the steps are clearly written on both  tubes which is  very easy to understand.</li>
            <li> &gt; The instructions for use are clearly printed on each tube and are very easy to follow.</li>
            <li> I still give it 5 stars because of the clean feeling and overall healthy feeling of my mouth since using this product!</li>
            <li> I know that many others have high reviews of this product so perhaps I&#x27;m just the outlier</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for anyone trying to better their smiles.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy it very much.  </li>
            <li> I really like the clean feeling, and it lasts ALL day, even after eating and drinking!</li>
            <li> Brushing with the first tube is pleasant enough.  </li>
            <li> Also, I have sensitive teeth and had been using a special toothpaste for sensitive teeth, so I was a bit worried about using this because I was concerned that my teeth would become more sensitive, but I&#x27;m happy to say that they didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My husband had to try it right when we got it, and he also said he hasn&#x27;t felt his teeth feel so clean except</li>
            <li> , I could feel the clean difference right away.  </li>
            <li> The new toothpaste surely made my teeth feel clean and my mouth feel fresh for a longer time than usual.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the very first use, I noticed a very clean, fresh from the dentist feel throughout my whole mouth.  </li>
            <li> After the first use, I saw a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li> I saw results after the first use on day two there was a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference in the whiteness of my teeth, but I did feel like I had a much cleaner mouth after each brush!</li>
            <li> After the first time using Crest Pro Health® HD™, I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I found that my teeth sparkled from the very first use.</li>
            <li> Was excited because, &amp;#34;hey, free toothpaste!&amp;#34; but didn&#x27;t really have any expectations for it.</li>
            <li> I was/am very pleased with the total product - from the packaging to the tube to the product inside.</li>
            <li> I first tried this when I received a free product sample as part of the BzzAgent program and after three days of use</li>
            <li> White teeth is important to me but my enamel is more important.</li>
            <li> First, I would say that I received a trial of this product free from Crest as a buzzagent.</li>
            <li> In reality, I should probably be taking that long to brush my teeth normally, so maybe this is a good thing!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying this free thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li> This is the first whitening product I have ever used to.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> I am a Bzzagent and got this to try for free, thanks to Crest!  </li>
            <li> I received this toothpaste to try for free (thanks, Crest!)</li>
            <li> I tried this product for free - thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li> Gels work faster but are more intrusive to your normal brushing routine.</li>
            <li> but I have to say I noticed whiter teeth after the very first brushing.  </li>
            <li> I received my first box free from BzzAgents.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to get to try the Crest Pro Health HD system for free thanks to Crest.  </li>
            <li> It polished my teeth, and they were SO smooth after the first use.</li>
            <li> Happily, I liked this product and will probably use it more often, perhaps every other toothpaste purchase.  </li>
            <li> So for me to be able to get the same level of whitening to the crest strips in a much easier process is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for FREE thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li> I was also glad that it did not cause tooth sensitivity, which normally whiters do for me.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say morning breath is nonexistent when I wake up, but it is definitely much better than normal.</li>
            <li> When I receive a Free Crest Pro-Health HD Kit  in the mail from Crest (thanks Crest!)</li>
            <li> The very first time I tried Crest Pro Health® HD</li>
            <li> Got it free to try thanks to crest and  bzzagent!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t require anything more than just brushing normally</li>
            <li> First off let me say that I did receive this product as a free sample from BzzAgent, but this is my opinion.  </li>
            <li> First of all, let me tell you that i received this product free to try from Crest.  </li>
            <li> From the very first brush, I felt like I had just been to the dentist.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very satisfied with my results.  </li>
            <li> The first night I tried after I received it for free from Crest</li>
            <li> As the other reviewers state - the wintergreen taste of tube one is nice and the gel taste in tube 2 is okay.</li>
            <li> From the first time I used this my teeth felt smooth</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I would say 6x, but its better than normal whitening</li>
            <li> I found after a few days that my top teeth were noticeably whiter than my bottom row but was able to correct this with more focuses brushing.</li>
            <li> I found after a few days that my top teeth were noticeably whiter than my bottom row but was able to correct this with more focuses brushing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying it free thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li> I have tried other whiteners before and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li> The toothpaste for step 1 is more abrasive than normal toothpaste and creates a cleaner feeling.</li>
            <li> And even though no one has complimented my white teeth I feel more confident in my smile and my teeth.</li>
            <li> I noticed after the first use that my teeth felt cleaner...very smooth.</li>
            <li> I am a BzzAgent and got the product for free -- thanks Crest and BzzAgent!  </li>
            <li> It will be interesting to monitor if there are any whiteness benefits to my permanently stained teeth, but if so, I will also have mixed feelings of happiness and worry about the product being too good to be true, without some sort of negative effect.</li>
            <li> I has visibly whiter teeth after the very first use.  </li>
            <li> First and foremost I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> I appreciate Smiley360 for the free sample and would most definitely try it again for free.</li>
            <li> #Bzzagent Tried it for free thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li> When I first got the product for free as part of a promotion to try it out</li>
            <li> Also, I got to try this product free thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li> From the very first brush, I felt like I had just been to the dentist.</li>
            <li> From the very first use my teeth felt cleaner like I had just walked out of the dentist office.</li>
            <li> bit.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I tried this for free thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li> I noticed this polished feeling after my very first use.  </li>
            <li> However, this step does really smooth out your teeth after the first step cleans it, which I suppose is the &amp;#34;polishing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> From the very first use on Crest Pro-Health HD, I noticed a difference in the look and feel of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed a decrease in the bleeding of my gums and that was on the very first use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fresh, cool, and invigorating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is not unpleasant, although my husband did not care for the texture.  </li>
            <li> What was really cool is that I  recieved compliments on how  fresh my breath smelled.</li>
            <li> I guess its good for the packaging, but strange after you take it out of the package.</li>
            <li> I recently received a free full size sample of Crest Pro Health HD to try,  and although I wasn&#x27;t expecting to, I love the feeling of my clean teeth after the 2 step process of Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Hello confident white smile!!  </li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think it was possible for my mouth to feel this clean just from brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think it was possible for my mouth to feel this clean just from brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> but I think the fresh, clean results are worth it.  </li>
            <li> When I used as directed my teeth felt incredibly clean even hours later, which I liked a lot.</li>
            <li> The formula of Step 1 also does an amazing job making my teeth feel extra clean.  </li>
            <li> Using this amazing toothpaste has prolonged the after-the-dentist clean look to my teeth and has even brightened my test since that last polish by my hygienist!</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think it was possible for my mouth to feel this clean just from brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Using this amazing toothpaste has prolonged the after-the-dentist clean look to my teeth and has even brightened my test since that last polish by my hygienist!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this to those who are looking for an easy option to maintain a bright healthy white smile.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think it was possible for my mouth to feel this clean just from brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> I really look forward to brushing my teeth because of how clean and smooth this makes my mouth feel.  </li>
            <li> The toothpaste definitely gets your teeth feeling nice and clean.</li>
            <li> It is quick, easy, and you get fast results.</li>
            <li> The first step is a pleasant taste, while the second is definitely a flouride taste - so it is good that the first step is there.  </li>
            <li> I received a free full product sample from Crest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for about a week, I certainly notice a whitening effect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Package is very nice and futuristic, the colors of the tubes are silver and blue respectively and advertise that I would feel a difference after a week usage and that my teeth would be whiter since the two processes brushing is intend to isolate ingredients for better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will gladly continue to take two minutes twice a day to have such clean teeth!</li>
            <li> Am pleasantly surprised at how smooth and clean my mouth feels throughout the day!  </li>
            <li> I also noticed fresh breath which is very important to me when I use a new toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Overall, the taste is good, not quite as minty as some other flavors, but still good.  </li>
            <li> This is my new favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I think this two part system is my favorite new Crest whitening system.</li>
            <li> Totally a new favorite and will buy again after I finish these pack is finished.</li>
            <li> The new approach to brushing makes the morning and evening routine a bit more</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure if this new toothpaste was the culprit or not.  </li>
            <li> I had already found the toothbrush of my dreams and was looking for a better toothpaste when as a Buzz Agent I had an opportunity to try the new Crest Pro-Health HD via a promotion from Crest.  </li>
            <li> I love trying new things.</li>
            <li> I have been brushing with this toothpaste for 7 weeks now and it really is my new healthy obsession.</li>
            <li> This new duo has become my favorite part of the day.</li>
            <li> I found my new favorite</li>
            <li> My teeth are as white as the snow outside, which is great given that my skin is already so pale, it&#x27;s really impressive if my teeth are whiter than my skin (according to my dentist uncle.  </li>
            <li> After just 4 weeks, the Crest Pro Heath HD toothpaste had lightened my smile very effectively, it was back to normal!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by this Pretty Amazing Stuff.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel great and cleaner than with my previous toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I realize this is because of the whitening agents, but while brushing it doesn&#x27;t taste great and has an odd drying feeling in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro-Health HD for several weeks now thanks to BzzAgent, and I have had amazing results!  </li>
            <li> This system is really easy to follow and works very well.</li>
            <li> The best part is Crest Pro Health HD is much cheaper than the whitening strips I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> The flavor isn&#x27;t as minty as many toothpastes, but it definitely leaves your mouth feeling clean, smooth, shiny, &amp; visibly whiter.</li>
            <li> It is so easy and makes my teeth feel really well-cleaned afterwards.</li>
            <li> this is my honest and true opinion and i will be purchasing this product regularly</li>
            <li> It does the job of a regular toothpaste in keeping your teeth fresh and clean but it also does an effective job in whitening it.</li>
            <li> I think the price for these two products is pretty fair, so I&#x27;d definitely consider using it as a part of my oral health longer-term.</li>
            <li> Within 2 uses I could see my teeth becoming more white.</li>
            <li> Overall I think it works pretty good.</li>
            <li> (I kept rinsing after the first step), but it is a really good product, overall.  </li>
            <li> I loved the simple and exact directions on the products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it is fast and easy.</li>
            <li> I saw pretty impressive results within a couple of weeks of using this (twice per day at least).</li>
            <li> While the toothpaste seemed to work really well, the taste was way too strong</li>
            <li> I am a big coffee drinker and this has helped me, so much so others have told me how nice my teeth are!</li>
            <li> This product is fast, easy, and does not hurt my teeth.  </li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t even phase me that there are two steps because they&#x27;re so easy to do.  </li>
            <li> I was among some of the lucky to receive this complimentary during a promotion.</li>
            <li> read the claims first- super clean mouth, reduction of morning breath, whiter teeth...</li>
            <li> Best of all, the whole procedure doesn&#x27;t take any longer than your usual brushing time.</li>
            <li> The first step scrubs your teeth super clean.  </li>
            <li> Step 2 is a bleaching gel and doesn&#x27;t taste very good, the strong flavor of step 1 helps mask the poor taste.  </li>
            <li> but I have actually switched from Sensodyne to Crest Pro-Health as I really was impressed with how clean and white the toothpaste made my teeth.</li>
            <li> Brush with the first stage for a minute, then spit (don&#x27;t rinse!)</li>
            <li> First, let me say Thank You Crest and BuzzAgent for letting me try this product!  </li>
            <li> My teeth look whiter and feel much cleaner!!  </li>
            <li> I recently received a sample of Crest Pro Health® HD™, compliments of Crest, and love the results after just 1 week of using it!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m quiet satisfied with it!</li>
            <li> I felt as if my mouth was more fresh when I awoke in the morning and that the fresh feeling lasted longer into the day than with my normal Colgate toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I received this recently from Bzz Agent and Crest for trial, and honestly I love it!</li>
            <li> After the first seven days I noticed significant whitenting on the surface of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Your first 2-minute brush could convert you too!</li>
            <li> Had no gum sensitivity issues at all and noticed results after the first use!  </li>
            <li> I also want white teeth to better my appearance!</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
            <li> /&gt;In general, the brushing with each step for two minutes twice daily seems to be an appropriate time for good results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now that is pretty exciting!</li>
            <li> so I just pause my brushing after the first step - spit and load the brush with Step 2 (remember - no rinsing after Step 1!) and finish the cycle.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel that the process of having to use two different toothpaste affected my morning routine by more than 30 seconds!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel this product whitens significantly the first time you use it or even after using it for awhile.  </li>
            <li> First you apply the purifying cleanser for one minute - do NOT rinse with water afterwards!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, not perfect but pretty good.</li>
            <li> Thank You so much!!</li>
            <li> I saw a difference after the first use!  </li>
            <li> That wasn&#x27;t pleasent only because rinsing is my favorite part!  </li>
            <li> You literally get that fresh from the dentist feel after the very first use, and with each day that passes my teeth have gotten noticeably whiter and just feel healthier.  </li>
            <li> I first received this from Crest to try and I was hooked!</li>
            <li> I just kept forgetting to not rinse my mouth after the first step out of habit!  </li>
            <li> I have used other whitening products successfully.  </li>
            <li> so I knew which to grab first!</li>
            <li> I will never use another toothpaste willingly again!</li>
            <li> After the first use, I did not experience any irritation at all!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> When offered this Crest Pro-Health HD campaign I was eager to start it and excited to try it the first time,, 3 days ago.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely loooooove it!!  </li>
            <li> I personally would elect to continue using Crest Pro Health HD to see if over the long term I could get more improvement regarding whitening.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first received the Crest Pro-Health HD toothpaste, I was very excited, but also very skeptical.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In just 2 weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed how much whiter my teeth are (&amp; so have my coworkers!)!</li>
            <li> I like the original Crest ProHealth and was interested in getting whiter teeth without the aggravation  of using whitening strips or trays.</li>
            <li> I got this as part of a promotion from the brand and was pretty excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> Other than that I really liked it!</li>
            <li> I received the new Crest Pro Health 2 step whitening system  free from Bzz Agent to sample for free.  </li>
            <li> Overall,  I am happy with this new product.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is amazing because it not only leaves your mouth feeling very fresh and clean, but it also whitens your teeth really well.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this easy cleaning system to anybody that wants a brighter smile without a ton of effort.</li>
            <li> The packaging is the coolest part of this product and I love that the tubes are different allowing me to easily distinguish between the two steps.</li>
            <li> The kit contains two tubes of paste, and after some quick reading, I was thrilled to learn that it&#x27;d only take about a minute of brushing with both pastes.</li>
            <li> It was so simple and easy to use, it wasn&#x27;t any more work at all to use a 2 step process.  </li>
            <li> And my teeth are starting to look more whiter than before, The 2 step process is not time consuming and easy to follow, 2 minutes 2 times a day.</li>
            <li> and you will get a super fresh breath and whiter smile.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and does not take any more time than using your standard toothpaste,  </li>
            <li> I am able to complete the process quickly and see results.</li>
            <li> But I am satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;The two step process is easy and it works well enough that I can see whiter teeth when I look in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am trying this product free thanks to Crest, my daughter and myself have been using this and have seen tremendous results.</li>
            <li> , this felt more &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; and therefore less effective (but could again all be in my head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to really get my teeth clean and leaves them feeling clean throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m getting closer to a dentist&#x27;s office clean than I was with my original toothpaste, and think that this is keeping my teeth in better shape (aesthetically and actually) in between office visits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very surprised that Crest Pro Health HD did not have the powerful minty taste that most toothpastes leave afterward.</li>
            <li> I have been a Crest Vivid White and then 3D White toothpaste user for several years now as I&#x27;ve found it to be the best whitening toothpaste with a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li> I will use all of the Crest Pro Health HD system until it&#x27;s gone, but after that I will likely return to the single step Crest Pro Health Whitening paste that I like best.</li>
            <li> So, I tried a new Crest Pro Health product through BzzAgent, and if you are looking to have a super clean mouth, you should try it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Crest Pro Health® HD is a fantastic product that is so easy to use, takes practically no time at all, with such fantastic results.  </li>
            <li> with this clean feeling, I did not notice a difference in the first 2 or 3 days.</li>
            <li> Plus, my teeth FELT clean after the first use.  </li>
            <li> After the first day, my teeth felt clean, just like I had got a cleaning at the dentist.  </li>
            <li> and I both said after we used the system the first time was our teeth felt squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> The first step is to clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li> The gel didn&#x27;t have much of a taste to it, which was fine.</li>
            <li> It gives me the dentist clean feeling even after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean for the whole day!</li>
            <li> from the first time i used it, my mouth felt so clean and my teeth</li>
            <li> From first brush, my teeth felt clean and my mouth refreshed.</li>
            <li> I was so amazed how clean my teeth feel after using Crest Pro-Health HD, and its not difficult at all to use the two step process.  </li>
            <li> The two step process doesn&#x27;t really take any more time that how I would typically brush which is good.  </li>
            <li> I started off using the product twice a day (morning and night) and the biggest thing I noticed first how clean my teeth were feeling and</li>
            <li> The first step is basically like a toothpaste to cleanse your teeth and buff them clean.</li>
            <li> So clean that it you will have a 6X cleaner and whiter within the first week of use.</li>
            <li> After using Crest Pro Health® HD(tm) for the first time my mouth felt clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first try, my mouth felt as clean as a dentist&#x27;s visit.</li>
            <li> The first is a tradional toothpaste meant to clean the teeth.</li>
            <li> and  My teeth felt so clean after the first time using this system.</li>
            <li> The first is a tradional toothpaste meant to clean the teeth.</li>
            <li> The first is a tradional toothpaste meant to clean the teeth.</li>
            <li> After the first use, I noticed just how clean my mouth felt.</li>
            <li> With my regular toothpaste my teeth felt smoothly clean but with this system they felt more roughly clean if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> It gives you that just visited the dentist clean feeling after the first use.  </li>
            <li> First thing I noticed after using the product is that my teeth felt extremely clean.  </li>
            <li> The first step uses Stannous Fluoride to clean away plaque you use for 1 minute.</li>
            <li> THe first day my teeth felt squeeky clean,</li>
            <li> The first step makes your teeth feel squeaky clean and prepped.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this 2-step process, my teeth felt just as clean as the week before when I walked out of the dentist office for my 6-month cleaning.  </li>
            <li> The first toothpaste leaves your teeth feelithg so clean.  </li>
            <li> The first toothpaste is  to clean teeth, gums, add fluoride, reduces plaque and reduces gingivitis.  </li>
            <li> First you clean then you polish and whitten</li>
            <li> After completing this first step, my mouth felt so clean -</li>
            <li> My teeth were shiny and felt clean after the first brush and by day 2, I can notice the glossy look.</li>
            <li> As for whitening, I found it does work (a little), but the whitening effect on my teeth was that great over the 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Plus, this stuff is a little pricey, so I think this is a great way to get the product benefits but without having to buy it as often.</li>
            <li> Plus, this stuff is a little pricey, so I think this is a great way to get the product benefits but without having to buy it as often.</li>
            <li> drawback was that we experienced a little sensitivity after we started using it.</li>
            <li> One very important thing for me to utilize toothpaste is that it has to taste OK and not be too strong and this program was just like the other Crest products and tasted very well.  </li>
            <li> I usually use Colgate, but this is a great toothpaste and makes my mouth feel completely clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> My smile is whiter and my teeth feel so clean after brushing, which I noticed after the first time.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste itself is very thick but does an excellent job scrubbing your teeth.  </li>
            <li> This product also states that it will whiten teeth, and it does to a certain extent and would probably work better if I did not drink so much coffee which just restains</li>
            <li> Special thanks to Crest for hooking me up!</li>
            <li> The first time I used Crest PH Advanced toothpaste, I found it very gentle.</li>
            <li> First step reminded me of my regular toothpaste,  with a nice foam and clean fresh taste and feel.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of Crest brand toothpaste, so I was pretty confident that trying this new product would turn into a positive experience (and having the chance to try it free was a bonus), and I was correct.  </li>
            <li> a reasonable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t really have a taste; the formulation of this is so light that it feels like I&#x27;m brushing my teeth with no product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest Pro Health HD for a couple of weeks, thanks to a free kit from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it (free, thanks to a promotion) for two weeks</li>

            <li> Thanks to Crest and Bzzagent, I got to try this product for free.</li>
            <li> I got to try this product for free thanks to Crest</li>
            <li> The two-step process isn&#x27;t time consuming at all, takes almost the same amount of time to be honest.</li>
            <li> Worth the $12 I paid.</li>
            <li> I think my dentist will be pleasantly surprised:)</li>
            <li> but it does help with a better-looking smile.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> That being said however, the results are totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> it makes my teeth have that fresh--</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve experienced no sensitivity issues, especially with the whitening gel portion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen some whitening so far, although I haven&#x27;t been using it the recommended twice a day, so I&#x27;m sure it could improve.  </li>
            <li> Note that Crest offers a pre-paid card in the amount of your purchase if you aren&#x27;t satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Now this won&#x27;t give you the same whitening as having the procedure done at the dentist, but it&#x27;s a good, much cheaper alternative.  </li>
            <li> But, I’m a self-professed fresh breath junkie</li>
            <li> As part of the Crest Pro Health HD Bzzagent campaign I received a complimentary package of this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a full week at first</li>
            <li> My family and friends have noticed how white my teeth are (and I&#x27;m a 2-3 cups of coffee a day kind of gal).  </li>
            <li> I have a really nice electric toothbrush with a pulsing timer that let&#x27;s me know when each 30 second increment is up and</li>
            <li> Fresh taste.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> I gave it a good go for the first week to see if it has results, but now I end up just using the first step and not the second.  </li>
            <li> I was asked to try the toothpaste and simply share my honest reaction.</li>
            <li> I noticed a whiter smile 3 days into using it.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner and my smile is brighter.</li>
            <li> My smile did get brighter even though I&#x27;m a coffee drinker.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is the easiest way to get a brighter, whiter smile without going to the dentist and spending hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li> My teeth always feel freshly polished</li>
            <li> must have if you are looking to brighten your smile</li>
            <li> When I first heard about Crest Pro Health HD, it sounded cool</li>
            <li> So far I am really pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I have tried a lot of whitening products and they either didnt work at all or made my teeth so sensitive I couldn&#x27;t eat or drink anything without suffering.</li>
            <li> Also, keep in mind I am still smoking, drinking coffee and wine, and this paste just keeps on helping to maintain the whitest smile</li>
            <li> I and I do notice a whiter smile.</li>
            <li> I have tried maby over the counter products to help whiten my smile and this one</li>
            <li> and I can already see a visibly whiter smile.  </li>
            <li> The colorful packaging claimed to make my teeth healthier and whiter in a week, so I decided to take up the challenge and see for myself if this was true.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This clear gel has more of a peppermint smell to it and after one minute of use you are suppose to rinse and spit it out.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> My teeth may feel cleaner , but I feel more self conscious with my breath because the toothpaste needs to be a bit stronger in the mint department for my preferences.  </li>
            <li> My teeth may feel cleaner , but I feel more self conscious with my breath because the toothpaste needs to be a bit stronger in the mint department for my preferences.  </li>
            <li> As far as whitening capabilities I have mostly crowns in the front of my mouth</li>
            <li> What I really like about it though is that you get whitening without having to do much more that you have done your whole life.</li>
            <li> Two steps means more on the bathroom counter (or to pack in a travel case), more time spent brushing one&#x27;s teeth</li>
            <li> Two steps means more on the bathroom counter (or to pack in a travel case), more time spent brushing one&#x27;s teeth</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> and my mouth still feels dentist fresh,</li>
            <li> And honestly, it does last through the day.</li>
            <li> I am loving the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste System!</li>
            <li> - my mouth feels fresh after I use this.</li>
            <li> I was trying desperately not to gag on all the stuff in my mouth.</li>
            <li> My teeth seem whiter and my fresh always feel fresher; however, it comes with two tubes - and we as a society have been trained to use one.</li>
            <li> Friends have commented on the whiter smile after two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> It does the job it is supposed to do....whiten your teeth and freshen your smile.</li>
            <li> It has been well worth it.</li>
            <li> However, after using the products for a couple of weeks I realized the results are worth the labor.</li>
            <li> My breath was minty-fresh, and I noticed a whiter, brighter smile within a week.  </li>
            <li> For 2 minutes a day, this is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> My smile is whiter and brighter and my mouth feels cleaner than ever before.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone looking to boost the whiteness of their smile without doing anything drastic.</li>
            <li> Who knew that you could have a smile in HD?</li>
            <li> This is a product worth recommending to others.</li>
            <li> I will most likely only continue using this toothpaste if the results are beyond good.</li>
            <li> The second step, however, kind of negates this super-fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two Step Toothpaste System from Crest as part of a promotional campaign to test the product and give my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> and my mouth felt fresh.</li>
            <li> #34;dentist-clean&amp;#34; to start a whitening program, but this product proves otherwise.  </li>
            <li> Step 2 left some kind of film feeling on my teeth</li>
            <li> In just one week, my teeth were one shade lighter, they felt cleaner, and my breath has never felt so fresh.  </li>
            <li> I received  Crest Pro Health HD as a complimentary trial from Crest by being a BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth giving a try.</li>
            <li> I wish I could say that I liked the Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System...</li>
            <li> Honestly, while using it, you feel like your entire mouth is being stripped of everything that has ever lived there.</li>
            <li> I felt throughout the day like my mouth was still fresh and had a lingering minty taste.</li>
            <li> I honestly felt every time I brushed</li>
            <li> BUT I do not drink coffee, smoke cigarettes, drink soda and RARELY drink tea</li>
            <li> I found that it made my gums even more sensitive</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li> The two tubes work separately yet together to create a dynamite smile.</li>
            <li> And the results are so worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Crest claims to give you a 6x healthier mouth and 6x brighter smile after using the system for one week.</li>
            <li> And my mouth still feels fresh when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> In no time, Your teeth will look brighter, it will be cleaner and your breath will be fresh.  </li>
            <li> Its comparable to going to the dentist and having a fresh mouth after cleaning.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;ve been completely, pleasantly surprised by the effectiveness of this great</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a nice whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> but my breath and mouth was definitely fresh;  just not minty.  </li>
            <li> The change has not been earth shattering, and I wasn’t expecting it to be, but I am pleased with the improvement I have seen in the color of the teeth so far.  </li>
            <li> The second tube is a polishing paste which kind of deflates the foam and polishes your teeth</li>
            <li> I find it kind of a hassle to have to use two different two pastes every time I brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Have used a lot of products to try to whiten my teeth without much success.</li>
            <li> am not crazy about the flavor.  </li>
            <li> I prefer a fresh minty flavor that I didn&#x27;t get with Crest.  </li>
            <li> He enjoys his whiter smile while still indulging in his morning and afternoon coffee addictions.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my smile.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I was very satisfied with my first experience of using the Crest Pro Health HD.  </li>
            <li> The value is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Prior to this great BzzCampaign of Crest Pro Health HD, our family purchased tooth paste that was normally sensitive and/or lacking the whitening aspect.</li>
            <li> Overall I liked it and didn’t mind the two steps.</li>
            <li> If you are thinking of purchasing go ahead because it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t want a fresh breath with whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth the results.</li>
            <li> I imagine this is rare and</li>
            <li> This is so much better than other whitening toothpaste; it really makes my teeth whiter, cleaner and more polished!</li>
            <li> but my smile seems brighter.</li>
            <li> I think I will continue to hold off only using once a day, but the results thus far have been great.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health HD promises a brighter smile in 6 days.</li>
            <li> Another downside worth noting is that you need to switch out tooth paste 1/2 way through the routine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also another benefit that i think this product is good for sensitive teeth because I have sensitive teeth and have no problem using this product.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying to whiten my smile for what seems like forever.  </li>
            <li> I think it will help get my money&#x27;s worth by maintaining the whitening.</li>
            <li> The most important thing about the toothpaste though is that I definitely notice my teeth are whiter now.  </li>
            <li> The best part for me is really the polished feeling, and I look forward to my next dentist visit next month to see if they notice any difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly worth a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly worth a try.</li>
            <li> thing is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I even notice that my smile seems brighter</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase this product on my own following this campaign through BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> You laugh, but I had college housemate who used to eat his toothpaste gel thinking it gave him fresher breath.</li>
            <li> However, it hasn&#x27;t made my teeth more sensitive at all</li>
            <li> After two weeks my wife started to notice a brighter smile.  </li>
            <li> If you are dedicated and prepared to put in some time to whiten your smile, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that a two-tube system is kinda fun, but it&#x27;s decidedly just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a week, I do have a whiter smile.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try if you are on the fence.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s nice to find a product that I can use daily to help combat</li>
            <li> The breath was fresh and the teeth whiter with just a day of using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> have been using this toothpaste for several weeks now and to be honest</li>
            <li> I would give it a go for a couple of more weeks and then will decide if I will switch or stay with my old toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I love the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Crest claims to give you a 6x healthier mouth and 6x brighter smile after using the system for one week.</li>
            <li> my smile was/</li>
            <li> * Tastes nice (but no different from anything else, really)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums have never felt cleaner and this leaves my mouth feeling fresh all day.</li>
            <li> I do not like the ingredients as I would like to see more natural ingredients included.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You aren&#x27;t going to finish brushing with this product and feel kissably fresh.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;perfecting gel&amp;#34; reminded me of the kind of fluoride treatment you could formerly only receive at the dentist.</li>
            <li> However, I kept using it and within about 2 weeks I started to notice a whiter smile.</li>
            <li> I do not feel that it has helped with morning breath nor does it give me a fresh mint/clean taste after brushing.  </li>
            <li> I do not feel that it has helped with morning breath nor does it give me a fresh mint/clean taste after brushing.  </li>
            <li> It has a fresh peppermint taste and gives your gums a tingling feel.</li>
            <li> This also has a fresh mint taste.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s worth it for the results.</li>
            <li> It has not made my mouth sensitive (which whitening products do), and I love the flavor.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a whiter smile, although its not 6 shades whiter.  </li>
            <li> The paste made my breath fresh</li>
            <li> It was minty and fresh.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have the brightest n whitest smile ever, and I have tried almost all of whitening toothpaste and strips out there.</li>
            <li> So far, I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I liked that it just replaced my current toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My breath is fresh.  </li>
            <li> and i am loving how white my teeth look!</li>
            <li> Overall, effective, and I like the way it makes &#x27;my&#x27; mouth feel.  </li>
            <li> Provided a noticeably whiter smile after just 2 weeks of using twice a day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Needless to say my rinse after step 2 is WAY more thorough than my old brushing routine</li>
            <li> /&gt;Needless to say my rinse after step 2 is WAY more thorough than my old brushing routine was.</li>
            <li> But the two-step process isn&#x27;t fun when you are in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this product and figured I would give it an honest shot for a week and then go back to my trusty Arm &amp; Hammer routine.</li>
            <li> I feel that my teeth are whiter and my smile is healthier.</li>
            <li> Having white, beautiful teeth is important to me because I have a big smile that&#x27;s one of the first things people notice about me.</li>
            <li> The above opinion is my own.</li>
            <li> Well worth</li>
            <li> but it was totally worth it.</li>
            <li> but you have never felt so fresh.  </li>
            <li> This gel is mostly flavorless as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> I no longer smile with</li>
            <li> either so I was hoping for some improvement in my smile.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I say it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> I am someone always looking for a safe, healthy and fast way to keep my teeth white.  </li>
            <li> I was given this package complimentary to try and review online through Crest and BzzAgent.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mouth feels fresh.</li>
            <li> I truly saw a whiter smile after a week of using this product.  </li>
            <li> but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for that fresh minty taste in your mouth after brushing your teeth, you won&#x27;t find it with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This gel is mostly flavorless as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> a pricey product, but when considering what you get out of it, the price is totally worth it to me.  </li>
            <li> My mouth feels so fresh after using this product.</li>
            <li> The taste of the toothpaste is fresh and minty, not medicinal at all.</li>
            <li> Overall, I liked using it.</li>
            <li> Overall quite a nice product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> and I feel that I am noticing a whiter smile.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t use it when I&#x27;m in a rush, but it&#x27;s really a powerful tool for ultra-clean teeth.</li>
            <li> Reading the package and Crest&#x27;s claims who wouldn&#x27;t want to see if you did in fact have the tools in hand to get a smile that was 6X whiter and mouth that was 6X healthier than before.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product from BzzAgent, and I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like this toothpaste, knowing that I had multiple steps to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> I felt it was just one more step added to an already busy routine.</li>
            <li> I loved Crest Pro Heath HD toothpaste so much that I&#x27;m considering replacing my current toothpaste with it permanently!  </li>
            <li> It is always an exciting day when the BzzAgent box arrives in the mail.  </li>
            <li> but I find it&#x27;s worth the &amp;#34;trouble.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> .it was not harsh on my gums as most products, which contains whitening agents.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Well worth the effort.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your teeth whiter, your mouth healthier, and breath minty fresh.</li>
            <li> But it is definitely worth it in the end.  </li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> But I did miss the minty refreshing taste I get from my old toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Except honestly- the only change I&#x27;d make was switching toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> But the freshening aftertaste is worth the momentary inconvenience.</li>
            <li> This two part product is well worth the two part process.</li>
            <li> and I do notice a whiter smile, even my mom noticed and asked if I had been whitening my teeth.  </li>
            <li> This system is fun though, even my wife is trying it.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in two steps.</li>
            <li> The cleaning step, which is a minty fresh tooth paste that cleans your teeth, and then you brush again with the whitening gel.</li>
            <li> That almost gritty feeling that makes you feel like you are really giving your teeth a good scrubbing.  </li>
            <li> It was time to brighten my smile so the Crest Pro Health® HD™ Toothpaste came just in time.  </li>
            <li> If a product is only so-so, I will say so honestly and pass that info onto friends &amp; family.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m quite pleased with the toothpaste part so far.  </li>
            <li> It does indeed whiten and brighten my smile, yet it does not feel abrasive and leaves me with a fresh-from-the-dentist feeling every time I brush.</li>
            <li> but if you are looking for something that will leave your mouth fresh then this is not the toothpaste for you.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health was fresh tasting and even being two steps was not time consuming.</li>
            <li> This product is actually worth the money and the time.</li>
            <li> It was all worth it.&lt;br /&gt;The product comes in two bottles (1 is the purifying cleanser and 1 is the perfecting gel).</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my smile.</li>
            <li> And if I floss after my gums are more sensitive.  </li>
            <li> but it is simple and so, so effective.  </li>
            <li> It has a fresh taste but step one has a sticky-spongy texture.  </li>
            <li> it is worth the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving the addition of the pro-health HG two step process and would definitely recommend you try for yourself.</li>
            <li> Most importantly the feeling of freshness even lasted after I ate and several hours later.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most importantly the feeling of freshness even lasted after I ate and several hours later.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall nice product.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free, but I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again when mine runs out.</li>
            <li> The flavors are minty and fresh.  </li>
            <li> Even though this is not a real negative but had these been in 1 product it would have worked better.</li>
            <li> and I can see a differents in my smile</li>
            <li> I feel that it made my teeth somewhat sensitive (as do many whitening products).</li>
            <li> My teeth have whitened noticably and I will definitely be buying more when my free sample runs out.</li>
            <li> I found this to be significantly better than the old whitestrips.  </li>
            <li> Would it even be worth it?</li>
            <li> It was also surprisingly nice that Crest Pro Heath HD did not bother my usually sensitive teeth the way most regular toothpastes do.  </li>
            <li> It is worth the hassle.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit I didn&#x27;t think a whitening toothpaste would make my teeth whiter, healthier and NOT make them more sensitive.  </li>
            <li> After just a week, I noticed a visibly whiter smile.  </li>
            <li> and I am loving the results.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of a traditional toothpaste</li>
            <li> and I noticed a sparkling smile and also a cleaner mouth.  </li>
            <li> So far I am in love.</li>
            <li> I expected it would be good</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> , I can honestly say I will be purchasing it in the future.</li>
            <li> 1 is a sparkling and blue tinted gel that has a nice minty toothpaste taste.</li>
            <li> Step 2 seals and polishes, while keeping breath fresh.</li>
            <li> It whitens your teeth, freshen your breaths and leaves you with a sparkling smile.  </li>
            <li> The toothpaste tastes fresh and the whitening gel is tolerable.</li>
            <li> but take my money, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;The two-step part was nice in that it keeps me focused on the duration of my brushing and a proper rinsing procedure.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s well worth the extended time.</li>
            <li> I do notice that my breath also stays fresh longer.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel like they have a layer of slime on them and my breath is not as fresh as it was before after returning to the toothpaste I used before the HD!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The first step is a pop top tube that you brush with like normal, but you don&#x27;t rinse.</li>
            <li> &gt; - Whiter smile.</li>
            <li> /&gt; - While I was able to sample for free from Crest, I have seen it in my local shops and</li>
            <li> I like to smile and</li>
            <li> The one drawback is my breath doesn&#x27;t feel quite as fresh in the morning</li>
            <li> Is it worth the money and having to do the 2 step process?</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s certainly worth a try though.</li>
            <li> Did NOT make my teeth more sensitive</li>
            <li> In fact that is the only kind I get from the store.  </li>
            <li> The most important change for me is every time I&#x27;ve brushed my teeth</li>
            <li> I have been putting off writing this review in hopes to have something exciting to report.</li>
            <li> The end result is worth it though.</li>
            <li> but once you add the second paste it foams and bubbles up nicely.</li>
            <li> I will have to say that I would have never seen this item in the store and purchased it because I would feel like it wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li> My teeth appear whiter and it looks more natural.</li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> That is until I posted a rare selfie on Instagram from an anniversary outing with my husband.  </li>
            <li> It does take 2 minute longer to brush my teeth twice, but the result is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Also, after brushing my mouth felt cleaner and fresh.</li>
            <li> I found this product to leave my mouth and breath exceptionally fresh, even for hours afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that after using CPH HD most of my teeth (with the exception of some back molars) feel smooth and plaque-less all day.</li>
            <li> maybe about 2-3x, which I&#x27;d still consider a success (hence my 4 star rating).</li>
            <li> maybe about 2-3x, which I&#x27;d still consider a success (hence my 4 star rating).</li>
            <li> this honestly probably increased my total brush time by ~30 seconds twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a hint of fresh mint.</li>
            <li> However, I should state that I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth are mildly more sensitive.</li>
            <li> The system at the store cost 14.99, so it is an economical way to take care of your teeth and look whiter and fresher.</li>
            <li> After just brushing my teeth for a week with it, my teeth felt healthier and my smile looked brighter.  </li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro Health HD complimentary from BzzAgent for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it now for a couple of weeks and am satisfied, but its not meant to completely whiten your teeth</li>
            <li> I was able to try this system free from BzzAgent, but now I purchase it regularly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d go full bore for a week or two when you first buy this, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d go full bore for a week or two when you first buy this, though.</li>
            <li> An unexpected benefit of the two tube system is that it makes the two minutes you&#x27;re supposed to brush your teeth go by a lot faster because you have more to do during that time.</li>
            <li> It gives that fresh out of the dentist feeling every time you brush</li>
            <li> The following are my own opinions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t leave my breath fresh</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive about the two step process of the Crest Pro Health® HD™, but after receiving a sample box and a couple of uses I&#x27;ve fallen into a steady and easy routine with it.</li>
            <li> It has a nice touch of mint, blue/green color and a consistency of a regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth really well, my mouth feels super clean after using.</li>
            <li> My teeth were whiter and my morning breath was under control, but it wasn&#x27;t worth the pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the consistency of the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I did notice my teeth were slightly more sensitive during the time I used this</li>
            <li> --- incredible results within the first few times of using --- really, truly whiter!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now (all whilst drinking coffee!) and continue to maintain a whiter smile.</li>
            <li> smile is brighter and my truth have never felt cleaner-</li>
            <li> think that at this 13.00 price point you get your money&#x27;s worth when it comes to the whitening.</li>
            <li> That may make the toothpaste worth it just on that</li>
            <li> You get used to it (ish) - but still worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> Yes, its another step in the brushing process, but the results make it worth it.</li>
            <li> This 2-step toothpaste is a great to add into my daily routine with no additional time considering my busy schedule.  </li>
            <li> I am not one to consider myself having sensitive teeth and/or gums, but I couldn&#x27;t use this as directed for more than 3 days.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste feels high quality and is not too strong but cleans thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to those looking to quickly whiten their teeth at a very reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> First, there has been a slight whitening to my teeth and they feel nice which I love.  </li>
            <li> First, I have to say I love how easy this is to use especially on a regular basis although you do have to get used to not rinsing between the two step process.  </li>
            <li> So fast, I was able to add this to my normal routine!</li>
            <li> Second, it leaves your teeth feeling very smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> When first opening the package of the new Crest Pro Health HD, it may seem like the process will be an overwhelming and daunting task.</li>
            <li> /&gt;From the very first use, I was pleasantly surprised at how clean my teeth felt!</li>
            <li> will definitely continue to use this product as long as I feel my mouth is staying and becoming more clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> It is fast and easy to use with visibly noticeable results just after the first use.  </li>
            <li> Yes, its that easy, and within the first cleaning you feel your mouth is much fresher and cleaner, then within days you can see that your teeth are getting</li>
            <li> I give this product points for very easy instructions and not a long time commitment to use.</li>
            <li> My teeth really feel very clean and are getting slightly more white.  </li>
            <li> a healthy white smile and fresh clean breath.</li>
            <li> My breath felt cool and fresh for several hours, which is very important to me.  </li>
            <li> After using the product my teeth are smooth and feel very clean, especially when used with my Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I love white teeth, fresh breath, and clean feeling mouths.</li>
            <li> I love to have white teeth and fresh breath, and this product does both!  </li>
            <li> I am so excited to finally have a pain free whitening product!</li>
            <li> is that my mouth feels so much fresher for a lot longer than I&#x27;ve ever experienced with other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> The actual whitening results are noticeable which is why overall it is a good product!</li>
            <li> Tube 1 is your normal toothpaste, but it has a very mild mint flavor.</li>
            <li> This whitening gel is sort of warm in the mouth and not the most pleasant feeling, but certainly not as awfully tedious and uncomfortable as whitening strips for 20+ minutes!  </li>
            <li> Actually its the most unique of all its competitors.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that we are able to whiten as we brush, eliminating the need to wear strips or use any other products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so really glad to find it here on Amazon, and with a coupon no less.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get your teeth that &amp;#34;glow in the dark&amp;#34; white, but if you want a natural-looking, clean, healthy-looking white, this 2-step system works great.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d recommend Crest Pro Health HD because while it may not make magic in your mouth, it does make it feel clean and fresh all day with an added polish.</li>
            <li> I received a free kit from BzzAgent and was so excited to try this, however I have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> At first, I did not like the 2 minute requirement, but quickly got used to it.  </li>
            <li> I also get to rinse at the end, so the lingering taste of step 2 is pretty mild.  </li>
            <li> I got used to it pretty quickly, using an electric toothpaste with built in timer made keeping track of the time easy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The two step process really works to get deep clean and then a nice polish.  </li>
            <li> The first step is a toothpaste that is mild and doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> I certainly can attest to a clean feeling after the 2-step brushing.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent, I was able to try the New Crest Pro Health HD!  </li>
            <li> I received a free sample to try and have quickly gotten use to my new two step routine.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use, it&#x27;s not hard to brush one minute with each tube.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to that too much, as it is not a problem for me, but it claims to be six times more effective than conventional toothpaste for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves your mouth SO fresh and clean, and it really did whiten my teeth in one week.  </li>
            <li> Your teeth and gums will feel much slicker and smoother, and your tongue will have a clean, fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> What I noticed most about this two step toothpaste was how clean my teeth felt after only one use.</li>
            <li> Also, they love that same dentist clean feeling that got me hooked.  </li>
            <li> I was thinking Step 1 would be more of a classic toothpaste and 2 would be the whitening step, but I think you really do need to use both every time.  </li>
            <li> do believe that any toothpaste would work better if used for two minutes so that may factor into the extra clean feeling.</li>
            <li> It tastes good, my mouth felt clean, and I noticed whiter teeth after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> Third, I love how clean my teeth feel after I use this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed dramatic whitening changes, but do feel like my teeth look nice and bright after use.  </li>
            <li> I might continue using this product based on how clean my teeth feel but would like it better if there was only one step, or if it whitened better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also left my teeth feeling much more clean and shiny.  </li>
            <li> If want clean, healthy, white teeth</li>
            <li> Brushing my teeth twice was not my favorite idea, but my teeth definitely felt clean.</li>
            <li> My whole mouth , teeth and gums feel incredibily clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> My teeth haven&#x27;t felt this clean since my last dentist cleaning and I love that I get this feeling after brushing every morning &amp; evening.</li>
            <li> I feel like the soft bristle tooth brush just doesn&#x27;t get my teeth as smooth and clean as I would like.  </li>
            <li> My teeth were so clean, I was sure I&#x27;d just left the dentist office!</li>
            <li> I use it every morning and night and it leaves my teeth and mouth feeling like its fresh and clean and its really going to improve my mouth hygiene I feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big arm and hammer baking soda fan and love the clean feeling I get with their toothpaste.</li>
            <li> But, keeping stains away and giving me that clean mouth feeling that befor now, only came from paying for a dental visit twice a year, more than offsets the price.</li>
            <li> The 2 step process really isn&#x27;t a big deal but make sure you brush for 1 minute with step 1 to clean, spit without rinsing, then brush for another minute with step 2 to polish, then rinse.</li>
            <li> It gives my mouth an unbelievably fresh and clean feeling that really lasts.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for about a week and love the deep clean feel that it gives my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I have no sensitivity issues, it just feels like a coarse sandpaper to clean the teeth, then when the teeth are more exposed, brush a whitener on the teeth.</li>
            <li> Then I decided to try another toothpaste from a competitor and not only was able to see results but my teeth feel clean.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it whiten it leaves your teeth feeling clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> Another aspect that I liked about this kit in particular is that the whitener was not harsh in any way.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used long enough to see significant whitening, although I think some progress is being made !!!!  </li>
            <li> After using Crest PH HD, my teeth felt very clean, almost like having a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product that does not make my sensitive teeth too sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I had no issues with this program and have nothing but good things to say about it.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I &amp;#34;ugh&#x27;d&amp;#34; at the thought of adding another step to my routine, but my teeth and mouth felt cleaner after the very first use, and the whitening was clearly evident.  </li>
            <li> I have always found Crest products to be superior to other brands.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest Pro HD, I am not embarrassed to smile in pictures!</li>
            <li> I agree with other users that I brush longer which is probably a good thing.</li>
            <li> After switching back a couple days to crest paste toothpaste, my teeth felt grimy by the end of the day where the HD clean lasts!!  </li>
            <li> I had been previously using a whitening pen/UV light combo that works, but is so much more time consuming!</li>
            <li> To be fair, my teeth were already pretty white and clean as I just had a cleaning about a week prior to receiving this product to try for free from a Bzz campaign.</li>
            <li> I cannot see that my teeth are six times whiter as promised after one week (but I use a good electronic toothbrush that usually removes stains and plaque pretty well) - but my mouth feels clean and healthy without the hassle of whitening strips and normal time involvement as I always brush for two minutes.</li>
            <li> I was lucky to get this toothpaste to try for free from BzzAgent and Crest, but the retail price is pretty high for toothpaste.</li>
            <li> When I peeled back the top cover, the two tubes were situated in their special spot.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a struggle to find the right things I can use.  </li>
            <li> I noticed whitening results right away which</li>
            <li> It just wasn&#x27;t right for me.</li>
            <li> That feeling right when you leave your dentist after having your teeth cleaned.</li>
            <li> Right off the bat</li>
            <li> ; your toothbrush with Step 2.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that my teeth looked whiter within a week.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I had a dentist appointment right before I tried this product, so I can&#x27;t speak to how it helped with plaque.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Using the step 2 gel, you can feel it working right away with the hydrogen peroxide in it.</li>
            <li> Two things I noticed right away with this method.</li>
            <li> I think Crest has the right idea with this product but advertising 6x whiter teeth seems like a bit of a stretch.  </li>
            <li> My husband notice a difference right away</li>
            <li> Who doesn’t want have whiter teeth, right?</li>
            <li> I saw improvements in about 4 or 5 days and my mouth felt cleaner right away.</li>
            <li> I dislike how you spit step 1 out and CAN NOT rinse but follow with step 2 right away .&lt;br</li>
            <li> right after visiting the dentist.</li>
            <li> That feeling right when you leave your dentist after having your teeth cleaned.  </li>
            <li> and when I did I never felt like I was doing it right</li>
            <li> THE WHITENING WAS JUST RIGHT.</li>
            <li> You just put it on your toothbrush right after using the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Who doesn’t want have whiter teeth, right?</li>
            <li> when I didn&#x27;t see results right away I hesitated to use again.</li>
            <li> I feel like I need to have a piece of gum right after brushing.</li>
            <li> and he&#x27;s right.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week so far, but having that fresh clean feeling is well worth it!</li>
            <li> I received a free trial from crest for this new toothpaste and whitener to try!</li>
            <li> And, I have to say, that maintaining the &#x27;right from the dentist&#x27; clean teeth feeling has been much easier with the help of this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> But if you are spending the money to get a brand new bright white smile, I&#x27;d consider calling your dentist instead.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for new ways to lighten and brighten my teeth, and was thrilled to receive the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two Step Toothpaste free from Crest.  </li>
            <li> After two weeks of use, I am seeing positive results!</li>
            <li> I have also started carrying this in my bag because it is perfect for those sudden photo ops, such as a new identification badge at work, or after my morning coffee(s).  </li>
            <li> The effects improve over time, but it&#x27;s nice to get that initial boost right off the bat, so if you&#x27;re heading out for a date or something, this will give you some impact just the first time.</li>
            <li> but that is a small price to pay for a great smile.</li>
            <li> I have received more compliments on my beautiful white smile than I have in a long time, and I have even used professional level whitening kits from the dentist.  </li>
            <li> After using step one, I did not feel like I had that minty fresh breath; however, it did leave my teeth feeling clean, almost as clean as after a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> But in the long run, a healthier mouth is more important to me than whiter teeth, and so it gets four stars.</li>
            <li> I received Crest HD free from Crest as a BzzAgent, and was very unsure about it at first.  </li>
            <li> Would have rated higher except whitening effect not as good as expected.</li>
            <li> I used it for the full two minutes each time because I love the way it left my mouth feeling.</li>
            <li> but I feel my teeths clean whole day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and you will really have dental hygienist clean teeth.</li>
            <li> Happy to be white but not as refreshing as my previous paste.</li>
            <li> I would say that the polishing gel makes my whole mouth feel so clean.  </li>
            <li> my mouth really feels clean, almost like when you leave the dentist.  </li>
            <li> What I personally have been loving though, is that it makes it so much easier to brush my teeth for the recommended 2 minutes!  </li>
            <li> I have been actively looking for a good toothpaste for a while.</li>
            <li> I love tea and Cola which definitely diminishes a smile quickly.</li>
            <li> I brush routinely twice a day and find this product really helped with a cleaner mouth and amazingly clean teeth.  </li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health HD does offer a clean feeling, but I didn&#x27;t notice much whitening over 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I think my teeth are looking pretty nice and white, too.  </li>
            <li> I actually do take the full 2 minutes (most times) and I even felt the 2 step thing grind on my nerves a bit.</li>
            <li> Step 1 - the purifying Cleanser, is way too intense of a clean.  </li>
            <li> very good:&lt;br /&gt;After the hour of discomfort has passed, my mouth feels clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> As mentioned the true test will come when I have my next appointment but for now I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> Step 1 of this product really did leave my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> , I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the whiteness of my teeth, but the clean feeling will keep me using this product.</li>
            <li> so I could get the whole mouth clean feeling</li>
            <li> and you will really have dental hygienist clean teeth.</li>
            <li> Step 1 is a cleansing step, its a more gritty type of taste to really scrub the teeth clean but the taste is not bad at all as you would tend to expect from a cleanser.</li>
            <li> I also really like how clean and polished my teeth and mouth feels after using this product.  </li>
            <li> My whole mouth just feels to clean and polished when I am done.  </li>
            <li> That being said, this really did make my teeth feel clean.  </li>
            <li> My mouth feels really fresh and clean after using this system and I really did notice a difference in the brightness of my smile after just the first use.</li>
            <li> What I really like about the process is how clean it leaves your mouth feeling.</li>
            <li> also really enjoyed the cool mint flavor, and found that it made my mouth feel cleaner than traditional toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health HD has a pleasant taste, just less so than I prefer.</li>
            <li> When you get done brushing with Step 2, your mouth is VERY minty because it is literally so clean.</li>
            <li> The first toothpaste is used to get rid of bacteria and plaque while the second one is a nice whitening polish.</li>
            <li> After many years of coffee and some less than intelligent years of smoking, my teeth are actually whiter.</li>
            <li> The first step makes them feel so nice and polished, and the second step has brought them to their brightest.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely amazed at how clean my teeth felt after using this system.</li>
            <li> , on the flip side, once you are done and rinse our your mouth, it really does feel clean and fresh.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like how clean my teeth feel after I brush - almost like the feeling you get when you leave the dentist&#x27;s office and</li>
            <li> I really felt like it got my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Cleaning - when it comes to cleaning it does clean your teeth very well.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> My whole mouth feels clean after brushing with this.</li>
            <li> but wasn&#x27;t really feeling like my teeth were clean;</li>
            <li> I will keep using it for sure but be aware if you already have issues with sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> First, the first step leaves my mouth feelings like i just put a spoon full of cinnamon in my mouth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear gel that you put on top of the residual first step to polish and whiten.</li>
            <li> Although after receiving my free sample from the brand, I was pleased to discover that although it was a two-step process it does not take twice as long.</li>
            <li> I have tried many whitening gels/toothpastes/strips and all made my teeth ultra sensitive to pretty</li>
            <li> I used this product the first time and really liked how simple it is to use.  </li>
            <li> Plus I really like how clean my mouth felt afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Before I wrote this review, I wanted to be sure that I used it for a solid week in order to determine if the claims being made were true.</li>
            <li> Step 1 is supposed to clean your teeth really well.  </li>
            <li> His whitening results were even more dramatic than mine and he is now a very enthusiastic convert to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> His whitening results were even more dramatic than mine and he is now a very enthusiastic convert to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The directions are very clear and easy to understand.</li>
            <li> The two step process is very easy to use, and it does not add any additional time to my daily routine.  </li>
            <li> &gt; The system is very easy to use, and takes no longer than my regular routine.</li>
            <li> While brushing with the 2nd tube,  I noticed a very strong tingling mint flavor in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> The directions on the reverse of the package were very easy to follow and so simple.</li>
            <li> The step two gel was just the opposite: very easy to squeeze...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy and simple to use and look forward to the continued use of the product.</li>
            <li> At first I thought, really!, two steps!  </li>
            <li> It came in easy to understand packaging, both tubes of toothpaste are easy to squeeze and come out easy without having a mess when it is time to close the cap.</li>
            <li> I have definitely noticed my teeth becoming whiter as well!</li>
            <li> I admit at first I thought 2 minutes was a lot, but after the first brushing, I could feel a difference, and after 3 weeks, I can see a difference in the whiteness of my teeth!</li>
            <li> Step one makes me teeth feel very clean, a just back from the dentist clean.</li>
            <li> I receive a free sample via bzzz agent to try and had high hopes.</li>
            <li> One star off for the high levels of fluoride (I use fluoride free toothpaste),</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to people who wanted a multi-purpose, affordable way to whiten their teeth while at the same time having more effective cleaning.th each step for a minute, you really have to make a conscious effort to reach all surfaces of your teeth in both steps.</li>
            <li> This system offers that, but more importantly, it offers healthy teeth and gum benefits from a very trusted brand.</li>
            <li> This system offers that, but more importantly, it offers healthy teeth and gum benefits from a very trusted brand.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, that&#x27;s not the main thing I&#x27;m looking for and this toothpaste gets it right with the fresh, clean feeling</li>
            <li> The biggest difference seems to be at the gum where it seems to be able to clean better than my usual toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Also, this means I can have white teeth and enjoy my sweets (with my sweet tooth!)</li>
            <li> For someone who is conscious of clean teeth, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this product out!</li>
            <li> I normally use Crest 3D White and that toothpaste leaves a nice minty clean feeling in my mouth way longer than the HD did.  </li>
            <li> I was able to try this new product out thanks to Crest</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this new toothpaste.</li>
            <li> So far, I have really liked using the new Crest Pro Health HD.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seems like a very smart way to make</li>
            <li> So I think Crest really got it right with this set!</li>
            <li> Third, and perhaps most importantly, the toothpaste has given me two large canker sores in my mouth.</li>
            <li> really nothing special.</li>
            <li> As a Bzzagent I was sent a free sample by Crest and couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to use and how white my teeth looked after just four days of use.  </li>
            <li> With crest pro health it was easy to use and comfortable because it was like part of my regular mouth hygiene routine, you just brush with each.</li>
            <li> mouth feels clean after brushing, the polishing action of tube 2 makes my teeth feel just dentist clean.  </li>
            <li> Initially, I was reluctant to try a two step process, but I quickly realized it didn&#x27;t take me any more time than brushing my teeth</li>
            <li> I just love the feeling of super, deep cleaned teeth.  </li>
            <li> That paste was pleasantly minty, a bit thick, and had smooth consistency.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get the chance to try out the Crest Pro Health® HD™ 2 step system for free!</li>
            <li> However, four hours later after I had eaten lunch I did a quick glance in the mirror to make sure I didn&#x27;t have any food stuck in my teeth.</li>
            <li> This is actually a lot more pleasant than other comparable products.</li>
            <li> I was excited when the Pro-health HD was released and I was lucky enough to recieve it for free to try and review as a BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li> I was not disappointed and in fact, was pleasantly surprised at how quickly I noticed a brighter and whiter smile.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth, so I can&#x27;t really use many of the whitening products on the market.</li>
            <li> My teeth looked whiter from day one but most of all my teeth and mouth felt fresh and clean all day long!</li>
            <li> You aren&#x27;t going to wax your car without really getting it clean first, right?</li>
            <li> , I noticed right from the first time brushing that the flavor was great, and it left my mouth feeling really clean for quite a long time afterward.</li>
            <li> The Crest HD peppermint toothpaste gel made my mouth incredibly fresh even while brushing, foamed very well so that I didn&#x27;t lose any in the sink, and made my teeth feel cleaner than at the dentist!</li>
            <li> My teeth always feel and look extremely clean and smooth and super white.  </li>
            <li> The polishing agent has made my teeth nice and white and I extremely in love with this product and would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is cheaper than the strips too, which is a bonus, and you can whiten during your normal toothbrushing routine which is important when every minute counts during the morning and evening crunch time.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much difference in the whitening itself, but the packaging said to use it for 30 days for the full effect.</li>
            <li> I liked how step 2 actually did help make my teeth more white as well.  </li>
            <li> My mouth felt noticeably cleaner with these two steps than with my usual tooth paste (Sensodyne).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Crest Pro Health for this paste month, I have experienced no increase in tooth sensitivity, but I also have not seen any increase in whiteness.</li>
            <li> This is a good alternate if you don&#x27;t enjoy white strips!</li>
            <li> And by the time I had been using it a full week, I started noticing that my teeth are, in fact, much whiter.</li>
            <li> Crest HD smile is exactly what</li>
            <li> Crest sent me this full-sized system to review for free as a member of Bzz Agent, but I love it so much that I visited the toothpaste aisle of my local Target</li>
            <li> was able to try Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste for free thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li> Additionally, it is generally cheaper than most of the whitening systems out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was able to try Crest Pro Health HD Daily two step toothpaste for free thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since the first use I could feel my mouth fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;After one week my teeth are whiter.</li>
            <li> I will say that I have used Crest whitening strips in the past and had great results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a great product and is worth the extra $$ compared to regular toothpaste</li>
            <li> Yes, it works, but it doesn&#x27;t work any more effectively than my regular toothpaste, which costs about a third of what this system does.</li>
            <li> I do have to say that I am not crazy about the flavor of the first step of the process.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve had success with a whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My breath is pretty fresh after every use too.</li>
            <li> My smile is much brighter!</li>
            <li> The first step consists of a kind of a gritty (but gentle!)</li>
            <li> I have been a bit concerned about my teeth being whiter, and the second step toothpaste works great to leave you with a shiny white smile.  </li>
            <li> pros to this toothpaste system are that I noticed a whiter smile after the first use.</li>
            <li> I did switch back to my natural toothpaste as I&#x27;m trying to get rid of my fluoride consumption as much as possible, but use the Crest Pro health HD atleast 2 times a week as maintenance and it seems to be working brilliantly this way!</li>
            <li> So even though I only partially experienced its claims for teeth whitening, I felt it did improve my overall oral health, making it worth buying.ous about lingering morning breath).</li>
            <li> So even though I only partially experienced its claims for teeth whitening, I felt it did improve my overall oral health, making it worth buying.</li>
            <li> It makes my mouth feel like I have had a professional cleaning, and it is amazing to know I can get those results in a few minutes from the comfort of my own home.  </li>
            <li> product is worth trying if you are willing to use a two step dental care system.</li>
            <li> Knowing that the 2 formulas work together to create a healthy (step one), brighter (step 2) smile made the extra step worth it.</li>
            <li> how it makes my teeth feel, but I honestly was expecting my teeth to be whiter after using it for this long.  </li>
            <li> I recently had the opportunity to test and review this toothpaste system, thanks to Crest and BzzAgent, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, has simple and clear directions, is well labeled and the products are very easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> I received a free set to test and review from Crest, and it seemed like the best opportunity as I had already thrown out my other, older whitening products without realising that natural toothpastes, baking soda and white vinegar aren&#x27;t the quickest methods in brightening your smile!</li>
            <li> It only takes two minutes and it is worth every second for the clean bright feeling</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think this is a nice product to use a few times a week or on special occasions for an quick and noticeable whitening effect.</li>
            <li> I am prone to sensitive teeth and have not had a major reaction to this product, which is good, but I am only using once a day just to be safe.  </li>
            <li> mouth feels fresh and clean which lasts for hours compared to my normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li> the first step really leaves your teeth feeling clean......</li>
            <li> I would absolutely use it just for the great clean feeling if it only did not make my teeth sensitive and have such a strong &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; burn.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about it and how easy it truly is to get fresher brighter teeth and mouth with this!</li>
            <li> Two simple steps that take around two minutes make the brushing routine easy!</li>
            <li> This is such an easy way to get a cleaner, healthier mouth, just brush your teeth twice a day!</li>
            <li> This is a good in between, and for the prize on Amazon it is worth picking up, just realize it is going to take a little time.</li>
            <li> only downside that I found was that this stuff is STRONG!  </li>
            <li> I was originally hesitant to try this product as I have switched to mainly Tom&#x27;s of Maine or Trader Joe&#x27;s brand toothpaste without Fluoride (upon recommendation of my dentist and endocrinologist).  </li>
            <li> I really like the intensity of the first cleaning step, it does kind of dry out my mouth but leaves a stron clean feeling as well.</li>
            <li> My teeth look a little whiter, but they feel clean and thats the most important part.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel healthy and strong, unlike all of the other whitening products and pastes that I have tried over the years.  </li>
            <li> I am so excited to see how much whiter my teeth can get, and I love that I have no sensitivity like when I use white strips.  </li>
            <li> I got to try out the new 2-step program for free through a promotion.</li>
            <li> I received my free bzzkit through Bzzagent of the new Crest HD pro health 2 step brushing system with two pastes.</li>
            <li> I was given for free theCrest ProHealth HD the new 2 step teeth cleaning kit, by bzzagent</li>
            <li> One week ago I set aside my long-term toothpaste of choice (Tom’s) for the newly received free Crest Pro-Health [HD} Bzz Kit.</li>
            <li> so I would keep getting new products for free, but, well, I&#x27;m just not that type of gal.  </li>
            <li> Tried this new toothpaste through a free sample from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I got to try out the new Crest Pro Health HD free from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I received this kit free from BzzAgent, so thank you Crest and BzzAgent for the opportunity to try this new product.  </li>
            <li> I got to try this fantastic new product through bzzagent</li>
            <li> I received the new crest health pro hd to review for free,  the opinions after 2 weeks are</li>
            <li> I have been trying it free from Crest through their new BzzAgent Campaign  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy this new Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I received a free package of the new Crest ProHealth HD as a BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> love the clean no-plaque feeling that this toothpaste leaves me with all day long!</li>
            <li> They were certainly whiter!</li>
            <li> /&gt;That being said I would recommend this product for people who are looking to try something new, want the lickety clean  teeth, and could use a smile tune up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In addition, I also LOVE the taste that it&#x27;s not too strong and your teeth feel clean and soft ALL day long!  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to anyone who would like whiter teeth and fresh breath in no time!</li>
            <li> My teeth not only feel clean they look really bright and white.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t tell you how many shades whiter my teeth are, but the results are ok, not fabulous</li>
            <li> /&gt;The whitener (Step 2) is great because of the obvious results I got---whiter teeth at last!</li>
            <li> Crest PH HD is a great product to use on a daily basis to not only strengthen your enamal but also to whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li> would say I get that &#x27;fresh from the dentist&#x27; feel from it much more that just regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, great product - just be careful if you have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> I drink a good amount of coffee everyday and after a couple weeks with this product, my employees were even noticing my smile whitening.  </li>
            <li> I do not think my breath got any more fresh with this toothpaste than with regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This is a two-step process, and the two tubes are clearly labeled and are easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love having to use two different steps in the brushing process but for such great results it&#x27;s worth the extra step!</li>
            <li> Whitening paste works very well and you can quickly see a difference.</li>
            <li> kind of dry-</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to someone looking to whiten their teeth while achieving a healthy smile.</li>
            <li> It definitely gave me more confidence to smile all the time.</li>
            <li> It also tackles the job of giving all the teeth a good treatment vs just the front that strips typically do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a convenient, cheap, and effective way to whiten your teeth while doing an everyday task that we all (hopefully) do anyway.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say the only thing that looks pulled together is his cute smile and mine ;</li>
            <li> It is super fast to use.  </li>
            <li> me, my teeth look whiter and my mouth sure does feel fresh after I brush with Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how easy this 2 step brushing system was.  </li>
            <li> May be too strong for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> general, I would recommend the product because immediately after the first use, I was amazed to notice that my teeth felt and looked smooth and polished like they do after a visit to my dentist!</li>
            <li> I guess I just expected to have these brilliant white teeth after using the product.  </li>
            <li> They need to be CLEAN, white, and strong.</li>
            <li> Well, because I noticed myself getting a mild headache after using it two times a day for two weeks straight.</li>
            <li> The directions were clearly written and easy to understand the two separate steps.</li>
            <li> For the size of the tubes you are getting and for the job that this set does, you are definitely getting more than your money&#x27;s worth with this product.  </li>
            <li> I really like this system far better than the yucky whitening strips.  </li>
            <li> 2 minutes to a healthy, white smile.</li>
            <li> But so far, at least the toothpaste is awesome!!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth, so most whitening products hurt too much to use.  </li>
            <li> It is strong, but not harsh.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use tubes are clearly labeled step 1 and step 2 .</li>
            <li> It took me a couple of tries to get the directions correct &#x3D;) , but after that it was smooth sailing.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are whiter, smoother, and my breath is more fresh since starting this product.  </li>
            <li> Initially I wasn&#x27;t so sure the process was worth it.  </li>
            <li> It was intense, like that feeling you get from that super powered stuff you get at the dentist or one of those breath strips.</li>
            <li> The package was simple and straight to the point which I liked.</li>
            <li> .) packing -&lt;br /&gt;It contains two pieces with clear and easy to understand instructions.</li>
            <li> I went into this not expecting a lot from this product and a few days into it, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Normally, I am not a huge fan of Crest products, but this one was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> I have a new addiction and it is Crest Pro Health HD!!!  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to have fresh breath, clean teeth and a brighter smile.  </li>
            <li> The very first time I used this product my teeth felt so much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever left the dentist wondering why your teeth can&#x27;t feel that clean every day, I would strongly consider giving this toothpaste a try, because somehow it manages to do exactly</li>
            <li> I saw results within the first few uses, and simple to use with great outcomes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the white strips and these are more effective and not nearly as time consuming.  </li>
            <li> I was interested to see exactly how a two step toothpaste works and how it fit into my normal brushing routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had to use white strips in the past, and I&#x27;ve been drinking more coffee now with baby #2, so I&#x27;m happy to say this has kept all the staining to a minimum.</li>
            <li> First of all I love that it has the everyday toothpaste that cleans and keeps mouth healthy.  </li>
            <li> I would normally be turned off by the two step process, but the results are totally worth it!</li>
            <li> i got this product as a free sample, thanks to Crest , and now i am going to make this part of my normal routine!</li>
            <li> Two things that automatically stuck out to me after the first night were that I had no sensitivity like I do with most whitening products and my teeth still felt fresh when I woke up the next morning.</li>
            <li> I liked my hard bristle tooth brush, because my teeth were always very clean &amp;</li>
            <li> So I was super excited to try the new Crest Pro Health HD that I was hearing so much about.</li>
            <li> Despite this issue, if you are willing to go for a very thorough rinse and deal with a mild film thereafter which does fade.  </li>
            <li> While consuming more water is not a bad thing, having a dry mouth is.</li>
            <li> I am happy that it makes me slow down and do a good job brushing my teeth with the two step process.</li>
            <li> The first time you apply a toothpaste and brush for one minute this is super fluoride treated and cleans your teeth very well.  </li>
            <li> I got to try out this cool new 2 Step Toothpaste system!</li>
            <li> The appearance is 5 star, a very modern and up to date flare.</li>
            <li> With not having to worry about my breath and yellow teeth is an very important thing to me and by having the opportunity to try Crest Prohealth HD,</li>
            <li> I also like it because it is very gentle on my gums.</li>
            <li> Very very affordable.</li>
            <li> Like whiter teeth isn&#x27;t enough, my mouth also feels cleaner and my teeth feel very smooth.</li>
            <li> I brush twice a day, and floss daily (Dentists love me), but my teeth have never felt better, or looked better since I started the Crest Pro Health HD routine a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like that my daily brushing can help provide great results for a healthier and whiter smile.</li>
            <li> It, of course, is very straight forward.  </li>
            <li> It does what it says it will do and at a very reasonable cost.  </li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t as gritty and were very smooth.</li>
            <li> but it really was no big deal, though your mouth feels kind of funny and dries out with the first step.  </li>
            <li> tubes stand upright and steady on the bathroom vanity, with not only good sized and easy to read labeling but with an obvious difference between the two containers so likelihood of mixing up the steps is</li>
            <li> although I was willing to try this, I certainly wouldn&#x27;t be repurchasing if it wasn&#x27;t superior to the other products I use.  </li>
            <li> Totally fresh breath, very clean when I run my tongue over my teeth, some improvement on whitening, simple to use.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Crest 3D White toothpaste for a quite a while, so I was excited to try a free sample of Crest Pro-Health HD toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> My sensitive teeth were just fine.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel amazingly clean and the process took no longer than normal tooth brushing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The most noticeable difference after brushing that I can tell (vs other toothpaste) is the smooth, polished feel.</li>
            <li> ended up really liking this toothpaste, my main concern of tooth sensitivity was not an issue and my mouth has felt clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro Health toothpastes for several years, so I was excited to get a free sample of Crest Pro Health HD from Crest (as part of a BzzAgent campaign) and try it out.</li>
            <li> The increased sensitivity of my teeth which weren&#x27;t that sensitive before offset the benefits significantly, to the point where I had to debate if it was worth using the product.</li>
            <li> Your teeth are super clean and super white.  </li>
            <li> The first step left my mouth feeling very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I do spend a little longer brushing my teeth than I used to, but that is probably good for getting out any food particles and plaque anyway.</li>
            <li> I do think my teeth look a little whiter which is good</li>
            <li> I was excited to be selected to receive a free set of this from Crest through BzzAgent because I had seen it in the store and advertised and was interested in if it would actually work.</li>
            <li> My teeth looked much whiter after the first use!</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I won&#x27;t likely use it every brushing, I will likely cycle between normal tooth paste and Crest Pro Health HD in the future to keep my teeth feeling wonderful and my smile nice and white.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this toothpaste for all those fortunate enough not to have sensitivity issues as it made my teeth very clean, healthy and white.</li>
            <li> and I was excited to try this new product.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try out this new product.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this new toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to add something new to my routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was excited to try the new Crest Pro Health HD kit</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this new product.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to try the new Crest HD product.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive and test the new Crest Pro Health HD system from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try out this new product.</li>
            <li> Product is pleasant-tasting and left my teeth feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Running my tongue over my teeth, they feel so smooth and clean and looking in the mirror - SO WHITE!  </li>
            <li> The product left my teeth feeling clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I felt fine at first, but after repeated use, my teeth and gums did start to feel quite sensitive.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste left my tooth feeling extremely clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> definitely makes your teeth feel clean and smooth</li>
            <li> and I feel like those actually are easier to use and keep teeth more visibly white, so I&#x27;m not convinced that this is a better system, but for someone who wants the convenience of just brushing teeth rather than using strips, this could work really well.that this is a better system, but for someone who wants the convenience of just brushing teeth rather than using strips, this could work really well.</li>
            <li> After using this for a month, I can definitely tell my teeth and gums feel  clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> It left my mouth clean and my teeth feeling fresh-from-the-dentist smooth.</li>
            <li> Secondly i do notice that the smooth clean feeling of my teeth begins to fade about 1/2 way through the day.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> My teeth were clean, white and smooth.</li>
            <li> I did not see any improvement in the whiting in my teeth and my teeth never really felt all that clean no matter how many times I tried.</li>
            <li> Once open, the process was super easy.</li>
            <li> Instructions are simple and easy to follow - two quick steps but</li>
            <li> It was super easy to incorporate into my daily routine.</li>
            <li> As soon as I figured this out though, I&#x27;ve been able to adjust by brushing more lightly and carefully - I actually pay attention to what I&#x27;m doing while I&#x27;m brushing my teeth now instead of doing it automatically while thinking of a thousand other things.</li>
            <li> After receiving this product as a sample for free from Crest, I was excited to see if it really was worth buying in the future.  </li>
            <li> Reading the instructions (which are very clearly stated), I first felt that the two step routine would be cumbersome, but it immediately gave me the feeling that the product truly addresses both of the aspects most important to me for daily dental care – a healthy mouth and white teeth.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are smooth, and clean, and seem to be whiter than normal, although nobody mentioned anything to me directly or seemed to notice.  </li>
            <li> Also how does Crest expect for someone to really use 2 toothpastes, when most people barely even use one!</li>
            <li> Toothpaste is very high quality and leaves your mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> so I was pretty excited to try out the new Crest Pro-Health HD.</li>
            <li> I have been a Crest user my entire life and was looking forward to trying this new product with the added bonus of better mouth health and whiter teeth!</li>
            <li> The two-step process is super easy and it isn&#x27;t any more time consuming than my regular daily routine.</li>
            <li> It is normal toothpaste with refreshing flavor that actually left my teeth feeling pretty clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to brush a little more gently, because I really love Crest</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of whitening strips, painting-on whiteners, or having to use a special light.  </li>
            <li> It also makes your breathe very fresh and the clean feeling last all day.</li>
            <li> After using Crest HD for just a couple of days, I noticed my mouth felt very fresh and clean, cleaner than just brushing with regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I do have sensitive teeth so any product that whitens my teeth leaves me with a huge headache the day after.</li>
            <li> The two steps are simple and they do make a HUGE difference in how my teeth look and how my mouth feels!  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest for providing me a free sample, it gave me a chance to try something I normally wouldn&#x27;t buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since starting to use the Crest Pro Health HD I have noticed a HUGE change in the sensitivity of my gums!</li>
            <li> The cost comparison to a professional whitening is huge.</li>
            <li> Cant wait to see how much more white they become.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Invisalign for the last year which creates stains on my teeth faster than usual, so this toothpaste has been awesome at preventing that.</li>
            <li> But I cannot stress enough how healthy your mouth will feel.</li>
            <li> but I did notice my teeth were whiter after the first day.</li>
            <li> Despite the higher price I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The first part is a regular toothpaste it seems except with more scrubbing power.</li>
            <li> The 2-step process of Crest Pro-Health HD is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> It kind of felt like I loaded my mouth with Orajel (minus the numbness factor).</li>
            <li> First off, let me say I was pretty skeptical about a product that wanted me to brush once and then brush again, but I&#x27;m very happy that I had the opportunity to try this sample from Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> The first step reminds me a lot of Pepsodent.  </li>
            <li> There are two steps, you first brush with the toothpaste and then the polishing paste.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Crest!</li>
            <li> Of course, I didn&#x27;t notice anything different in color immediately but at the end of a week, I did notice the tea stains mostly gone from my teeth.</li>
            <li> Thanks Crest!</li>
            <li> Though, come to think of, &amp;#34;six shades&amp;#34; is a pretty subjective metric, perhaps by design?</li>
            <li> I have used Crest Pro Health HD for the last week (free courtesy of Crest!)</li>
            <li> It just makes logical sense to me.</li>
            <li> So far, I enjoy it.</li>
            <li> The second stage is where it gets interesting.</li>
            <li> First you brush with the purifying cleanser.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are so much whiter now!  </li>
            <li> and I’m willing to try anything touted as “the biggest breakthrough in toothpaste since fluoride” if it will give me a whiter</li>
            <li> The first week I did not notice a change in the color of my teeth and was beginning to think the product was not working for me.  </li>
            <li> my teeth were so much whiter than when I started!  </li>
            <li> First off the toothpaste worked.</li>
            <li> and I felt like I had visited the dentist after the first brush.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite things about this toothpaste, that I echo others in, is that after brushing I feel like I literally just left the dentist chair</li>
            <li> So many times after step one I started rinsing my mouth and not just spitting before starting step 2.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Crest!</li>
            <li> In general I am pleased with the product and thanks</li>
            <li> Immediately after brushing for the first time, my teeth felt noticeably smoother and cleaner.</li>
            <li> The polish does have a better taste, though it doesn&#x27;t seem to still make me feel like I just brushed my teeth.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t like the products because after using since last so many days now my gums have started giving me burning sensation</li>
            <li> At first I thought Step 1 was too &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I used this toothpaste exactly as directed.</li>
            <li> Really pleased and will definitely continue to purchase!  </li>
            <li> It adds in gentle whitening and sparkle to my smile.</li>
            <li> In addition to that, my teeth because noticeably whiter over the course of the first week.</li>
            <li> It may seem intimidating at first</li>
            <li> See result within first time using.</li>
            <li> Much better than using white strips!</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference from the first use:</li>
            <li> I was amazed after the first time I used this 2 step system for cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I love that Crest Pro - Health HD Daily does not make my teeth hurt or my gums sore</li>
            <li> My wife, who never comments on such things, even noticed and said how much better (whiter, brighter, cleaner)</li>
            <li> Overall, I love the product.</li>
            <li> First you brush with the paste for a minute, spit but not rinse, and then use the gel for one minute and then rinse.</li>
            <li> The first tube of paste was pretty minty.</li>
            <li> first step (brushing for 1 minute with gray tube) feels like a tooth/gum exfoliation treatment.</li>
            <li> At first thought the two steps would be a pain</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes after the first time i used it.</li>
            <li> They also looked whiter after the first use.</li>
            <li> First, the system:  there are 2 tubes.  </li>
            <li> And then you put the second paste on your toothbrush, and brush for one more minute with this one.  </li>
            <li> but it is better than using white strips or a whitening gel kit.  </li>
            <li> I could notice a difference the first time I used Crest Pro Health HD.</li>
            <li> First, it is a PAIN to travel with.</li>
            <li> first I just didn&#x27;t like this.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, I felt that my teeth were cleaner that ever.</li>
            <li> My teeth are more noticeably white.</li>
            <li> combines exactly what I am looking for in a</li>
            <li> The first tube is used for one minute and cleans plaque from the teeth.</li>
            <li> Better than regular tooth</li>
            <li> Each steps makes me feel more involved in dental care than just standing around brushing for 2 minutes as I&#x27;ve done for decades and what is traditionally recommended.</li>
            <li> first time I used it I followed the instructions to bruch with one toothpaste for a minute and then use the whitening gel for another minute.</li>
            <li> so I can be sure that the results are lasting and that I indeed see results.</li>
            <li> I gave it a try as my smile is much brighter.</li>
            <li> am recommending this product to anyone looking for healthy and white teeth without sensitivity.</li>
            <li> The first step cleans away plaque and the polish...</li>
            <li> This left my teeth plaque free all day!</li>
            <li> Make sure you only spit after this first step without rinsing because you need to move on to step two.</li>
            <li> After the first use my teeth felt smoother and cleaner.</li>
            <li> So, first off, did Crest Pro Health HD make my teeth whiter?  </li>
            <li> 4 minutes of tooth brushing is pretty</li>
            <li> DO appear, but I wasn&#x27;t alarmed at all since I&#x27;m well aware of how hydrogen peroxide operates.  </li>
            <li> My teenage daughters have also used it and love it.</li>
            <li> I was&#x27;t sure how to write this review, because it&#x27;s a highly personal thing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now, and I am enjoying it overall.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve always wanted that movie star white but haven&#x27;t been able to attain it.</li>
            <li> Confident that as I continue to use this system they will only get whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the way my entire mouth tastes and feels after I brush.</li>
            <li> Much more effect than white strips, trays, rinses, etc.</li>
            <li> i consistently forget to not wash out my mouth after the first tube, so it ends up defeating the purpose</li>
            <li> It is not terrible but it just doesn&#x27;t have that same texture as&amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The Crest Pro-Health HD toothpaste works really well!</li>
            <li> I saw some lightening after the first time using it!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> and he was amazed with the first brush to.  </li>
            <li> Buying this when it first came out was just an impulse buy</li>
            <li> First, (the silver Step 1 tube) you brush for one minute with a fluoride-based gel.</li>
            <li> From the first brush I am now hooked.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe the difference in my teeth from the time of my first review until now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Colgate Total for a long time and happy with it.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference with the first use.</li>
            <li> I could see and feel a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> first night I followed the instructions exactly.  </li>
            <li> You first brush with step 1 then spit then</li>
            <li> This stuff does exactly what you&#x27;d want it.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like using two different tubes to brush.</li>
            <li> First you use the cleanser to brush your teeth for one minute, followed by another minute with the perfecting gel.</li>
            <li> The second application of gel, tastes just okay, but it whitens your teeth.  </li>
            <li> first comment my husband</li>
            <li> Although this is a two-step process, it does not take any more time than regular brushing, and within a week, the difference is being noticed.</li>
            <li> The results are MUCH more gradual than white strips but that&#x27;s ok for me since this is supposed to become part of your daily routine.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying more, especially now that my husband is hooked too!</li>
            <li> I received the Crest Pro Health® HD™ Daily 2-Step System free from BzzAgent and Crest (thank you!).</li>
            <li> I truly believe I have a whiter smile thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> BUT after a visit to my dentist, I was ecstatic that for the first time EVER</li>
            <li> It definitely promotes brushing your teeth more and longer however I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now, twice a day, and have not noticed any changes in whiteness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;d asked me during my first two weeks of use if I would recommend it</li>
            <li> Although it is humiliating to admit, my teeth have really paid the price!</li>
            <li> Overall my mouth felt cleaner and my teeth were whiter, there was a noticeable difference for sure.</li>
            <li> So I first tried step one.  </li>
            <li> The first step is cleaning your teeth with this system.</li>
            <li> Cleaner and whiter teeth for an overall healthy mouth.</li>
            <li> Thanks for sending this to me Crest!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see how healthy and white my teeth (and gums)</li>
            <li> I did have a bit of discomfort with Step 2 at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting married this September and will continue to use this product</li>
            <li> I felt it the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> I do believe my mouth feels cleaner and smoother...even more than my Colgate total.</li>
            <li> The first bottle cleans your teeth with a grainy textured material.</li>
            <li> I noticed the feeling of cleaner teeth after the first brushing.  </li>
            <li> and I find that when I use this consistently, it does aggravate my sensitivities.  </li>
            <li> And, while I have always used Crest and been satisfied with their products, I was not a big fan of the whitening strips.</li>
            <li> i really love this product and definitely recommend it!  </li>
            <li> Since I started using it, I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on how white my teeth are.</li>
            <li> I felt like this product worked exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> I was sent this exact kit by Crest through BzzAgent to review.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m sure the product still worked in whitening, it&#x27;s more of a maintenance thing after that since you won&#x27;t see such a big difference anymore</li>
            <li> compared to the first time.</li>
            <li> I am IN LOVE with this tooth paste and will never go back.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from Crest, and have been surprised at how well Crest Pro-Health HD works.  </li>
            <li> From the first time I used it, I immediately felt a difference.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really describe the taste; it&#x27;s not at all minty but is sort of fresh.  </li>
            <li> There were many places on my gums (I&#x27;m embarrassed to say) where it bubbled up white as peroxide does on an infected wound.  </li>
            <li> The first is that there is no minty taste which I am used to with toothpaste</li>
            <li> The first step came in a tube with a flip off cap.  </li>
            <li> The first step came in a tube with a flip off cap.  </li>
            <li> I am not sorry I tried this product.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste is different than most in that it comes in two tubes.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not that noticeable in my opinion, and I used it exactly as prescribed.</li>
            <li> The first step is to brush with the cleaning toothpaste, which tastes just like crest toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The second step is to brush again with the whitening toothpaste, which also tastes a bit like crest toothpaste, and a bit more jelly</li>
            <li> First time I used this two step process</li>
            <li> The first step is a purifying cleanser aka anti cavity fluoride toothpaste, that after you brush for one min, you spit but do NOT rinse.</li>
            <li> First impressions:  </li>
            <li> After just one use it felt like I just got out of the dentist and the just brushed feeling stuck with me most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Today is day 4 for me of using this product and I am really liking it!</li>
            <li> The brushing experience was exactly what you would expect.</li>
            <li> Many people have also mentioned that your teeth feel as if you just left the dentist.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> It goes away once you are able to rinse after the second phase</li>
            <li> They all do an okay job at tackling my surface stains, but I&#x27;ve never gotten results as white as those pictured on the packages before.  </li>
            <li> The first is a purifying cleanser that “helps strip away plaque.”</li>
            <li> I went for my first appointment for a crown and told the dentist and his assistant that I was going to try this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> but I could feel a difference from the first use.</li>
            <li> I first tried the Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste about a month ago.  </li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend Crest Pro Health HD to all my friends, family, coworkers and even strangers in the toothpaste aisle at the store!</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to get to try it for free thanks to Crest and Bzzagent.com.  </li>
            <li> Yet, I went to the hygienist and tried this that same night and was pleased I had no issues.</li>
            <li> I must sayI love having white teeth.</li>
            <li> Sure you have to use two different products</li>
            <li> I felt a cleaner, healthier mouth immediately with the first use.</li>
            <li> It is nothing more than simply brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> After the first day, I could tell my teeth were whiter.  </li>
            <li> It feels like with this system the first toothpaste helps coat your teeth to prevent the sensitivity.</li>
            <li> First you use step 1 to brush your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I think the first step gets the plaque off of your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of whitening toothpastes and strips -they worked ok, but the brightness always was temporary, never lasting the promised months of whiteness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This makes me pay more attention to my brushing time, so I think I actually brush longer when I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely better than regular whitening toothpastes!</li>
            <li> but I found I was willing to perform the two steps.</li>
            <li> First, it does work.</li>
            <li> My mouth felt cleaner after the first use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll post the first two photos so you can see the difference.  </li>
            <li> We will use this again for sure and it can only get better after another week based on what we saw after only one week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a 2 step process, the first tube they say is what brushes away plaque and cleans your teeth.</li>
            <li> first tube is your &amp;#34;plaque stripping&amp;#34; paste...</li>
            <li> first brush your teeth with  step one  </li>
            <li> Used exactly as recommended for three weeks.</li>
            <li> (I really wish I took before pictures!)</li>
            <li> My wife made a comment on the first day itself that my teeth are brighter and whiter.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and definitely prefer it to whiten my teeth over whitening strips.</li>
            <li> But I was satisfied with this product overall.</li>
            <li> Thanks crest and Bzzagent for the freebie!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first two-step product I have tried.  </li>
            <li> First you brush and &amp;#34;exfoliate&amp;#34; your teeth then don&#x27;t rinse and use the whitening toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Crest for letting me try this out!</li>
            <li> After the first use I felt and saw a difference</li>
            <li> and I have really been liking it!  </li>
            <li> But it worked really well!</li>
            <li> I never saw much of a difference with just toothpaste, but I could feel and see a difference with this!</li>
            <li> When I first received this product, I was hesitant as this was a two step process.  </li>
            <li> The first part of the Crest Pro-Health HD Toothpaste kit is a cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Began using this the first day I received it.  </li>
            <li> 2 weeks later, I&#x27;m completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> (although you can also pick it up at your local Walgreen’s, or Wal-mart store, too) just to make sure I can get my hands on it when I run out.  </li>
            <li> first I was unsure about adding another step to my morning brushing routine.</li>
            <li> I did have a tad bit of sensitivity in the first week, but that went away week 2.</li>
            <li> It is a feeling like when you first leave the dentist&#x27;s office after having a thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li> but you get use to it after the first week.  </li>
            <li> It took about a month to notice my brighter smile, but you will notice your teeth feeling smoother much sooner.  </li>
            <li> You just spit (but don&#x27;t rinse) after using the first product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes</li>
            <li> When I compare this to whitening systems, the costs seem much better and I will definitely keep using it for that reason.</li>
            <li> Overall my mouth feels cleaner, healthier and better.  </li>
            <li> but a consistent level of whiteness that matched where I started.</li>
            <li> So all I needed to do was add two more minutes to my current routine (one minute per morning &amp; evening brushing).</li>
            <li> … I went three better and gave it TEN days and… Nuthin.&#x27;</li>
            <li> I love the flavor of this toothpaste, especially the first step.  </li>
            <li> Felt like I could tell a difference with the first week, no sensitivity issues like whitening products can sometimes cause.</li>
            <li> First brush with tube 1 for 60 seconds, spit, brush with tube 2 for 60 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First thing after the birth I had to cancel my dentist appointment :</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take any extra time to brush, just one more step in the process.  </li>
            <li> While I must admit, the Step 1 paste isn&#x27;t my personal favorite for flavor</li>
            <li> I love it and would definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> I will say that when I first started using this kit my gums did hurt after I was finished brushing them.</li>
            <li> I will most definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> Works exactly as mentioned.</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference from the first use:</li>
            <li> Thanks Crest for the pretty smile.</li>
            <li> My husband will more than likely be switching to this brand since you can&#x27;t beat the feeling of just having your mouth cleaned by dentist every time you brush with it!</li>
            <li> I felt sensitivity after my first use, but none at all since then, and I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks.</li>
            <li> There is a definite difference, but I was hoping for more.</li>
            <li> I am an avid coffee drinker</li>
            <li> but I was willing to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I LOVE crest products and have used the 3D tooth paste and white strips for years.  </li>
            <li> opened the first tube which is step</li>
            <li> However, that is where the similarity ended because after the first minute ended</li>
            <li> Only criticism is that it seemed to have more of Step 2 than Step 1 product.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my teeth were whiter after the first use.</li>
            <li> did give it more of a trial, just in case my initial reactions were incorrect, but nothing changed.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit, I have healthy and white teeth, and always have.  </li>
            <li> One thing that takes some getting used to is that you are not supposed to spit after using the first step.  </li>
            <li> And, while I have always used Crest and been satisfied with their products, I was not a big fan of the whitening strips.</li>
            <li> Only time will tell how much more whitening will take place</li>
            <li> The first step paste tastes like the diet gum from the 80’s with a hint of candy cigarettes.  </li>
            <li> The first step with flouride that strips away plaque feels like going to the dentist.</li>
            <li> First, there are two separate bottles.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a noticeable difference on the first use or on the mid-point either.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s safe to say Crest has won me back.</li>
            <li> From the first use of this two-step system, I saw a noticeable difference in my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of Crest whitening strips and have received many compliments on my &amp;#34;glowing white teeth&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> While it is slightly more work to use Step 2 than to just brush with one toothpaste, it only adds about 15 seconds to the process which is not too strenuous.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First off.  </li>
            <li> AS an avid smoker</li>
            <li> i was pretty interested in trying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Received this free to test through Bzzagent &amp; have used for a month so far.</li>
            <li> Not 100% sure that this is related to the toothpaste</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s more of a symbol that it&#x27;s actually working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First, my mouth and teeth have never felt cleaner than they do after brushing with this product.</li>
            <li> I used this system for exactly one month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received the toothpaste complimentary thanks to Crest</li>
            <li> Continuous use really is needed to keep up the brightness, but it&#x27;s well worth the time and effort.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a 2 step process first step</li>
            <li> As background, I am avid about flossing every day and brushing as well.  </li>
            <li> This is the first product that does what it advertises.  </li>
            <li> My dad is a dentist, so I am pretty picky with my toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I did not notice a difference after my first use in regards to whiter teeth, but after a week or so, my teeth did appear whiter.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel like they have been professionally cleaned and stay glassy smooth through the day.</li>
            <li> I love the taste of the deep cleaning toothpaste though!</li>
            <li> The first time using a whitening product and did not find any improvement in the color of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this system for about two weeks now and my teeth really are whiter!</li>
            <li> It was a refreshing mint flavor and the paste was not gritty at all.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty much the smile that I always wanted.</li>
            <li> I did experience some sensitivity in the first week but haven&#x27;t had any problems since.  </li>
            <li> First time it&#x27;s happened without increased sensitivity.</li>
            <li> At first I thought doing two brushings would be inconvienient, but at all.</li>
            <li> The first step is about 2 min of brushing and the tube is 1 minute of brushing.  </li>
            <li> I used it the first day</li>
            <li> My husband has also tried it and noticed a difference after the first try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first tube contains a paste that is recognizable as a Crest paste.  </li>
            <li> Since this was my first try with this combo</li>
            <li> This is the first time I tried Crest Pro-Health tooth paste.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt much cleaner after just 1 use!</li>
            <li> Step 1 has a flip top which is simple to use.  </li>
            <li> Step 2 however has an oval twist top which is a bit cumbersome since this is being done in the middle of the brushing.  </li>
            <li> : so I brush, rinse, fluoride, waterpick, multiple dental cleaning just to stay on top of it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to try a two step process, twice a day, and stick to it.  </li>
            <li> teeth looked whiter in the first week.&lt;br</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> You brush with step one first, then you brush with the step two paste.</li>
            <li> This product adds a step, since you brush first with step 1, then with step 2, one minute each.</li>
            <li> All I had to do was brush with the first step for one minute.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it was at night.  </li>
            <li> I have the products that I use and love, so I don&#x27;t usually branch out, but I received this Crest ProHealth HD product as a BzzzAgent, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> My mouth felt noticeably cleaner after the first use and felt cleaner overnight.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I saw immediate results after the first brushing when using this.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Crest!</li>
            <li> I followed the exact process for seven days.</li>
            <li> The first step is brushing for one minute with the purifying cleanser which I found to have a refreshing flavor, then, without rinsing, the second step is brushing for an additional minute with the perfecting gel which, although not as “tasty” as the first step, I did not find objectionable at all.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product in hopes that the whitening process continues and because I love the healthy mouth feeling that it leaves (although I am not exactly sure how to assess if its use results in a “6x healthier mouth” as the packaging claims).</li>
            <li> From the first use I felt a difference it gave</li>
            <li> I also see a difference my teeth looked whiter from the first use.</li>
            <li> The taste for the first step was okay, the second step tasted like peroxide.</li>
            <li> Thanks Crest!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at first.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t care for the taste of step 2, wasn&#x27;t minty</li>
            <li> First, you apply Step 1, a purifying cleanser, and brush for one minute.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely sold on this product!</li>
            <li> promotion from the brand, and that is why I wasn&#x27;t worried about the price at first.</li>
            <li> The second step was the most troublesome with this issue and would just sit in one spot, requiring some fancy maneuvering to get it around.  </li>
            <li> I also had issues with the toothpaste peeling the top layer of skin from the inside of my cheeks and lips after each use- gross!</li>
            <li> I immediately saw a difference in my teeth after the first use.</li>
            <li> At first I was worried the kit comes with 2 separate tubes of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> First you purifying cleanser for one minute then without rinsing you add the polishing gel  and brush your teeth for an additional minute before rinsing.</li>
            <li> Its not terribly distracting, but definitely a place for improvement.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Crest!</li>
            <li> I received this toothpaste from BzzAgent and Crest for review and my first thoughts before trying it was &amp;#34;oh another toothpaste&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> kit itself consists of 2 steps which is definitely more work than using a regular toothpaste</li>
            <li> I am really interested in finding whitening toothpaste that works.</li>
            <li> Overall, I was expecting more</li>
            <li> But after using this product, I started noticing a change after the first couple of times using it.  </li>
            <li> I noticed whitening the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I recived this profuct as a promotional item, so I was glad to find out it sells for about $12 at a local retailer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You first brush for 1 minute with tube 1 - the cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I would highly reccommend!!</li>
            <li> the first time I used Crest HD, I felt like I just came from my dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I particularly love the second step of the system.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Crest!</li>
            <li> I can only imagine how well the system works with one of the more high-tech brushes (sonic) applying the pastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so we could make sure that we were following the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> First impressions, I didn&#x27;t care for the flavor of either tube.</li>
            <li> I was glad to go back to a one tube sensitivity Crest</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in the color of my teeth after the first use, and it has only gotten better from there.  </li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Crest Pro Health HD from Crest through BzzAgent and I am loving the results.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of a traditional toothpaste, this is 2-part product which will replace brushing &amp; using white strips.</li>
            <li> First, you brush for 1 minute with the step 1 purifying cleanser, then spit that out, and brush for an additional minute with the step 2 purifying gel.</li>
            <li> The gel makes your teeth whiter the first use.</li>
            <li> They are whiter, but overall I think that crest whitestrips do a better job whitening.</li>
            <li> You brush your teeth with this first for 1 minute, and spit but do not rinse with water.  </li>
            <li> You brush with this second step for 1 minute, spit (but don&#x27;t rinse), and brush for 1 minute more.  </li>
            <li> After I had been using the Crest Pro Health HD for a couple weeks, my mom came into town and one of the first things she said to me was to ask if I had had my teeth whitened.  </li>
            <li> At first I was hesitant to try a 2-step system for a toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The step 1 fluoride is exactly what I need - removes plaque and reduces gingivitis.</li>
            <li> I personally just like a stronger, more pungent flavor.</li>
            <li> any case, I will say that I was really glad I got this opportunity because my teeth definitely look whiter.</li>
            <li> Answer that, and I&#x27;ll be a willing customer to give it</li>
            <li> Until then, use your favorite toothpaste, and try the next Crest product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always felt like they might have been preventing my teeth from yellowing more than they were actually whitening my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I use my regular 1 step toothpaste when I&#x27;m in a hurry and use this one at night when I have a bit more time.</li>
            <li> Thanks CREST!</li>
            <li> After the first time, I immediately noticed a difference in the color and appearance of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I really noticed a difference in my teeth in just 2 days even though they guarantee results in 6!</li>
            <li> My friends have definitely noticed me smiling more, and even though my teeth were already pretty white, I feel better knowing that the most recent coffee and tea stains have been cleared.</li>
            <li> I have been using crest whitening products for over a year now and crest hd really gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Will most definitely be purchasing this product again!</li>
            <li> I do want to advise using an electric toothbrush since it does breakdown plaque and superficial stains faster and better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> it really doesn&#x27;t take up any additional time at all!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for real!</li>
            <li> I noticed after the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> Overall I think this toothpaste is ok.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please note on the image I did use natural light for both shots.</li>
            <li> The only negatives to this product is the extra time and effort it will add to your morning/evening routine and the fact that the second toothpaste does not have the best flavor.</li>
            <li> Only step 1 is flip top while step 2 is a twist off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I truly believe that using Crest Pro Health HD really improved my dental hygiene too (and yes, just after a week!).</li>
            <li> I truly believe that using Crest Pro Health HD really improved my dental hygiene too (and yes, just after a week!).</li>
            <li> I saw results in the first three days.</li>
            <li> I told them I use the Crest Pro-Health, much cheaper than professional whitening and for me worked much better with absolute no pain.</li>
            <li> However, after my first week I began to tell a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> I am an avid coffee drinker</li>
            <li> so I am glad to get rid of that yellow tint.  </li>
            <li> I have to literally take my phone to time myself, two minutes total, to make sure I do one minute for each step.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely buy this again! :)</li>
            <li> The consistency of the first tube is more like regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I first began using the products I did experience some sensitivity to my gums.  </li>
            <li> am a pretty faithful Crest consumer.  </li>
            <li> Another issue that I had when using this was the instructions that tell you not to rinse after the first product is used.  </li>
            <li> I wasn’t sure if my teeth actually looked whiter until I went to the dentist about a week in to using Crest HD and</li>
            <li> first you brush with a mint flavored paste and then brush again with a gel that polishes the teeth.</li>
            <li> The Polishing treatment is more satisfyingly gritty compared to the HD Perfecting Gel that is paired with this Purifying Cleanser.</li>
            <li> I see a much whiter and brighter smile in my mirror in just days.</li>
            <li> &amp; I can&#x27;t believe how much it has helped whiten my teeth!</li>
            <li> Well, the Crest Pro-Health HD toothpaste &amp; whitening gel combo gave me that exact feeling too.</li>
            <li> Well, the Crest Pro-Health HD toothpaste &amp; whitening gel combo gave me that exact feeling too.</li>
            <li> I even stopped using sensodyne, which was my go to toothpaste, whenever I ate ice-cream or  drink something hot.</li>
            <li> I tried it and from the first brushing itself I knew that product works well.</li>
            <li> Step one is supposed to strip away plaque and that&#x27;s exactly what I felt it did.</li>
            <li> overall I&#x27;m satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> and my teeth are so much whiter!</li>
            <li> I love the way my teeth feel immediately after brushing and four the next 10ish hours.  </li>
            <li> I really love crest pro health HD daily !</li>
            <li> I received my package yesterday and couldn&#x27;t wait to try my first cleaning.  </li>
            <li> My first application was at night</li>
            <li> First, (the silver Step 1 tube) you brush for one minute with a fluoride-based gel.  </li>
            <li> it happens even when we brush our teeth consistently.</li>
            <li> You will feel a difference the first time you use it.  </li>
            <li> By the end of the first week, my teeth were noticeably whiter, even as a tea and coffee drinker.</li>
            <li> But I still think the toothpaste works better for cleaning teeth than regular toothpaste and would recommend it for that.  </li>
            <li> I love Crest pro-health Hd daily two step toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed, however, if my teeth are whiter, so I might give the product more time to see if I can notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;One last note, which may be nitpicky.</li>
            <li> but it takes longer than that for me to make sure that all of my teeth have been adequately brushed</li>
            <li> I figured a 2-step process would be time consuming or more work than it actually was.</li>
            <li> My first concern was (A)</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what advantages there were over stannous fluoride, but according to Crests website it differs from sodium fluoride in that it not only helps with cavity protection but also protects against plaque, gingivitis and tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> My only criticism is that step 2, the tube should have been a flip top like step 1.</li>
            <li> You use the first tube -- toothpaste -- for one minute.</li>
            <li> And I swear they were shinier and maybe a tad whiter after the first use.</li>
            <li> hopefully more white as I keep using it!</li>
            <li> I received crest pro-health Hd tooth paste through bzzagent thanks to Crest !</li>
            <li> At first I thought it would be a pain to use a two step system</li>
            <li> What I like most about it is your teeth feel like you have just left the dentist after each brush.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give this a try first.  </li>
            <li> At best, I was skeptical that the system would do all it promised.</li>
            <li> The two step process is fun, and makes me feel super efficient in getting that deep clean feeling.</li>
            <li> At first I felt like the 2 pastes were going to be a pain, but I feel like I can tell which part</li>
            <li> After the first use, I could tell a difference.</li>
            <li> The first part, paste #1, is like having an scrub on your teeth.</li>
            <li> I use this with my Sonicare tooth brush and it works pretty well</li>
            <li> In the first step, you brush with the toothpaste for a minute.  </li>
            <li> All I can say was I didn&#x27;t believe the hype until after the first brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier than whitening strips!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any immediate difference in the whiteness of my teeth after the first use.</li>
            <li> Whiter teeth after first use.</li>
            <li> I am an avid coffee and tea drinker</li>
            <li> First, the instructions to brush using each tube for one minute means I&#x27;m spending two minutes at a time on my teeth twice a day, rather than the one  minute that I too hastily have been doing.</li>
            <li> I thought I was imagining it when I noticed it at the end of the first day</li>
            <li> The second part was more of a whiting gel but made my teeth feel cleaner and whiter after I was done.</li>
            <li> I received my Crest Pro Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> Since the Crest white strips have to be on your teeth for ~30 minutes, I wasn&#x27;t sure this would work considering you rinse after about 2-3 minutes</li>
            <li> It works and it is MUCH easier than the whitening strips and mouth wash!</li>
            <li> I saw the first day I tried it.</li>
            <li> fact it feels better after doing the two steps, mouth feels fresher and gives the protection to your teeth that regular toothpaste gives you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the first use of Crest Pro Health HD, I could detect no difference on my &amp;#34;senior&amp;#34; teeth.</li>
            <li> I recently was able to try this product through BZZ AGent.  </li>
            <li> first step is to brush your teeth with the step one product then just spit it out ...</li>
            <li> The second paste is more like a gel.  </li>
            <li> By isolating toothpaste ingredients,I felt the difference first time I used.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t use it for the full 2 minutes, I just brush my teeth until satisfied, and my teeth are brighter and it has helped me keep my pink gums.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was a skeptic at first</li>
            <li> and I am sure that the extra brushing will pay off at my bi-annual trip to the dentist.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for over a month</li>
            <li> After the first use my mouth felt noticeably cleaner and the freshness lasted longer.</li>
            <li> At first I did not see any whitening effect</li>
            <li> Pretty comparable in terms of results though.</li>
            <li> First one tastes like mint toothpaste</li>
            <li> The first is considered a purifying cleanser designed to strip away plaque.  </li>
            <li> At first I was like ugh</li>
            <li> instead you add the second step which immediately makes your mouth feel better.  </li>
            <li> One one hand it works really well!</li>
            <li> The toothpaste (step 1) tastes exactly like their Pro Health toothpaste.</li>
            <li> my teeth are not only super-slick, but my gums are noticeably better too.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> To use, you first brush with the &#x27;paste&#x27; for 1 minute, then add the whitening &#x27;gel&#x27; and brush for another minute.</li>
            <li> First, having to use 2 separate tubes of &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; during a morning and evening routine is a bit cumbersome.  </li>
            <li> I seen results in the first week.</li>
            <li> I do think that those with straighter teeth will likely have better results than I have had.</li>
            <li> Then the second tube, is a screw top which is a pain in the butt.</li>
            <li> But, like I said, it&#x27;s probably a better option for people who regularly whiten.</li>
            <li> &gt; - Didn&#x27;t see results as white as promised but still better than average&lt;br</li>
            <li> They could look more white, so I wouldn&#x27;t use this as just a whitener, but the shine is noticeable.</li>
            <li> followed the directions exactly- brushing in two steps with a minute each.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t take much longer!</li>
            <li> From the first time I used it my teeth</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and will be sticking with this toothpaste from now on!!  </li>
            <li> I got many comments on my white teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more likely to use it that way.  </li>
            <li> At first i thought it would be a pain</li>
            <li> Better than strips that only touch the front surfaces.</li>
            <li> I noticed results after the first time I used it on my tea-stained teeth.</li>
            <li> and I will be purchasing more in the future!</li>
            <li> then you brush again with the whitening gel at first</li>
            <li> My teeth are generally whiter, which is good since I drink coffee and soda regularly.  </li>
            <li> and I love how white my teeth are looking.</li>
            <li> Having just had a baby this past year, I wasn&#x27;t doing the best I could to take care of my teeth, then I got the opportunity to sample the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free and loooove it!</li>
            <li> BUT, my breath stayed so fresh for the whole day AND the whitening step didn&#x27;t sting my gums like others have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not notice a difference after my first use in regards to whiter teeth, but after a week or so, my teeth did appear whiter.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that the whitening portion left marks on my gums where there was damage, and as time passed by, these spots improved and many disappeared.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend Crest Pro Health® HD™ to anyone looking to whiten their smile and get a healthier mouth.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to thoroughly verify this, but I do know that I don&#x27;t have any cavities or issues at present.</li>
            <li> The results are real and I am a believer!</li>
            <li> At first I was thinking why brush my teeth twice.  </li>
            <li> But I was open minded and tried the product and was so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it would be too time consuming with my hectic life</li>
            <li> You’ll feel the difference from the first use and have a 6x healthier mouth and 6x whiter teeth in one</li>
            <li> first step involves a &amp;#34;not-too-abrasive cleaner.&amp;#34; (I&#x27;ve tried a lot worse.)&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Cleans well, lightened well, the only thing I did not like about it is I wish it had more flavor (mint).  </li>
            <li> Overall, it was ok but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty ambivalent about.  </li>
            <li> Let me first talk about the packaging because it what we see first.</li>
            <li> I had to use the step one first .Step 1</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that with my first month of using Crest Pro Health HD.</li>
            <li> I tried it out, and within the first 2 days I dramatically saw the difference.  </li>
            <li> now that I&#x27;ve actually been using Pro Health HD, I&#x27;m really glad I signed up.</li>
            <li> For the first couple of weeks trying this product, I used it exclusively.</li>
            <li> For the first couple of weeks trying this product, I used it exclusively.</li>
            <li> My fresh breath lasts longer and my mouth feels much cleaner.</li>
            <li> The first step cleans my mouth well</li>
            <li> After the first use, I did notice some results.  </li>
            <li> My teeth did appear to be whiter but not six times whiter since it was the first use.  </li>
            <li> It works exactly as it says it will.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too harsh, and it tastes pretty good too.</li>
            <li> Using 2 separate pastes/gels seemed like it may be a hassle at first, but once I tried the product, I was hooked.</li>
            <li> brands because this really made a difference!  </li>
            <li> The dreaded &amp;#34;hydrogen peroxide&amp;#34; feel/taste of white strips and whitening mouthwash is avoided while getting way better</li>
            <li> They may cause temporary sensitivity, but the results are immediate and you, most likely, won&#x27;t have bleeding gums.</li>
            <li> but when you rush in the morning you don&#x27;t want to guess which one you have to use first.</li>
            <li> Since my gums are healthy and white already, I didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> much more so than my regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> So quickly more white that the rest of the family wanted to use the product I have bought some for all of them to use.  </li>
            <li> After three days of use, I noticed that my teeth were more sensitive than normal.  </li>
            <li> but they bother my gums so I was interested to try this.</li>
            <li> When I first saw the package I thought that there was no way that I would like it, the package can make the two step process look like it’s going to be cumbersome and time consuming.  </li>
            <li> The first time I put this in my mouth, I immediately wanted to spit it out.</li>
            <li> I drink a lot of coffee, especially during the colder months, and I was glad to see some of the superficial coffee stains were removed.  </li>
            <li> The first is that the two step process takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s something to be aware of.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product I was amazed.</li>
            <li> I (and my fianc&amp;eacute;) have noticed a difference in</li>
            <li> The first three days I used it in the morning and in the evening.</li>
            <li> I brush with the first step until my toothbrush stops after a minute, and then I add the gel and brush for another minute.</li>
            <li> So far it has done a good job of making my teeth feel clean, and my teeth are slightly brighter.</li>
            <li> I loved the product and noticed a difference in how my teeth felt and looked within a few days.</li>
            <li> I would easily give this 5 stars, if the taste of Step-2 was a little more pleasing.</li>
            <li> My teeth was a nice shiny shade of white and not dull beige,  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised that my teeth were noticeably whiter/lighter and felt as clean as when I just come from the dentist.</li>
            <li> I actually got my Crest Pro Health HD free through a BzzAgent Campaign, but I&#x27;m seriously thinking this is my family&#x27;s new toothpaste regimen! :D</li>
            <li> It not only made my mouth feel clean, but made my smile whiter!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel dentist clean after this product, but I don&#x27;t know if that is due to me spending more time brushing or what.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been a &amp;#34;Crest Kid&amp;#34; my whole life but had never really strayed beyond just their typical toothpastes as I&#x27;ve always been happy with them - mostly the whitening and baking soda &amp; peroxide.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only a couple of weeks, but so far it leaves my mouth feeling super fresh and healthy with no adverse affects.</li>
            <li> I was kind of put of at first  by the 2 step brushing process of Crest Pro Health HD,  however I got over it quite quickly after using a few times.  </li>
            <li> What a pleasant surprise - the first step is a minty winter green flavor with a very minute amount of grit in it.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest for the free sample and for getting me hooked on a new toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Crest sent me their new product ( Crest Pro HealthÂ® HDâ„¢) to try out and to give my honest feed back.</li>
            <li> Thanks Crest for letting me try your new product free.</li>
            <li> The second step polishes your teeth, and leaves them feeling super clean and smooth, almost like you just had a professional teeth cleaning!</li>
            <li> 2- a Hydrogen Peroxide Whitening Gel- is a clear substance with a very fresh smell.</li>
            <li> Since you apply the second step fairly quickly the two step process does not seem as involved as it might sound.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was lucky enough to receive this product for free from Crest.  </li>
            <li> but they definitely gleam with a shiny sparkle and feel super smooth and polished though out the day.  </li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to try this paste out for free..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually a fresh minty taste after you brush your teeth but with this toothpaste it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s more of a dry mouth feeling.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to sample this product for free via BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get to try this for free through bzzagent.</li>
            <li> And after using this toothpaste for a few days I found that I easily adjusted to the taste and didn&#x27;t notice it any more.  </li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get a free sample to try out</li>
            <li> It was easy to use, fast and steps were clearly marked.  </li>
            <li> Finally, I like my mouth to feel minty fresh and this product doesn&#x27;t have a strong taste.  </li>
            <li> First, true to Crest Pro Health reputation, the toothpaste cleans better than any other on the market.</li>
            <li> So, when I was given the opportunity to try this product I was very excited but apprehensive at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The step 2 in this system was nice and gentle, so I would use it a few times a week for about 5 minutes and probably see significantly whiter teeth in about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth spending a few extra bucks on a good toothpaste system!</li>
            <li> The minty taste left my mouth feeling fresh and clean (not as minty as mouthwash, but a fresh taste) and my teeth were noticeably shinier and whiter after the first use.</li>
            <li> Right off the bat, I noticed my teeth really sparkled after the two-step process of cleaning then polishing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right amount and size so that you don&#x27;t have that sandy feeling when you&#x27;re ready for Step 2&#x27;s</li>
            <li> My mouth feels more clean and that feeling stays with me throughout most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;The only down side</li>
            <li> In addition to silky smooth, white teeth, I feel  like my whole mouth feels clean.</li>
            <li> The whitening gel is typical of most gels of its type--but used in combination with the toothpaste it worked quickly to brighten and whiten my smile.</li>
            <li> After using this product daily, my mouth is bright, my gums are pink and do not bleed and my teeth feel squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> The other thing I liked was that after the first day I already noticed that my teeth were whiter.  </li>
            <li> I received product free as a BZZ Agent #sponsored, I&#x27;ve tried products for healthy teeth and whitening separately and have not stuck with any of them mainly because they didn&#x27;t work as expected.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist strongly advised me to stop using the whitening gel due to the fine grit which with prolonged use could damage the enamel on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have used the teeth whitening strips, but have never been able to use it for a full week due to my teeth sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> If Crest is trying to differentiate the two tubes so as to not get confused in the dark, it would make more sense to me to switch them and have the twist top for step 1 and the more manageable flip top for step 2.  </li>
            <li> Because the taste of Step One was pleasant, I did not feel rushed or anxious to get to Step</li>
            <li> Because the taste of Step One was pleasant, I did not feel rushed or anxious to get to Step</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying this product free from Crest but plan to purchase this again in the future due to all the benefits I have experienced so far!</li>
            <li> I think the biggest difference came from me being very careful to time myself when brushing my teeth to make sure I was spending a full 60 seconds on each step...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to see it down to $9.99, that would make it more accessible for a broader range of people.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience any sensitivity issues, which was a pleasant surprise compared to other whitening products I&#x27;ve tried, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t live up the the claims of a six times improvement.</li>
            <li> either way, it is more of a hassle, and I&#x27;d personally rather just use the old whitening strips so that I was setting aside special time for teeth whitening.</li>
            <li> Was a little put off at first by having to spend a bit more time brushing my teeth with a 2-step process, but it was really fast and easy</li>
            <li> , it just allows you to attack your teeth to achieve true freshness and that ultimate clean feeling.</li>
            <li> It is a quick and easy 2 minute process and the freshness lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Positive first</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about three weeks now and have found that my teeth not only feel very clean but have gotten noticeably whiter as well.</li>
            <li> It left my mouth feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> I definitely feel like my teeth were very clean after using this product.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are not really yellow anyway, but they are certainly brighter and have a better hue after using this product for a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s two steps, which I feel is fairly cumbersome for something as simple as brushing your teeth and the first step contains Stannous Fluoride which can actually stain your teeth versus whitening them.</li>
            <li> also liked that this product did not cause the sensitivity issues I have had with other whitening products.</li>
            <li> The 2 step process is unique, and I did have whiter teeth after about a week, but then they got fairly sensitive</li>
            <li> I am so excited to see my dentist again who was recommending for professional whitening.</li>
            <li> I also liked that it had a whitening component that was not as time consuming as other products.</li>
            <li> I wish the taste was bit more refreshing if this is to take the place of normal everyday brushing.  </li>
            <li> It was nice when other people noticed it even my clients at work noticed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using now for about two weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed a significant improvement as far as whitening goes.</li>
            <li> Thanks Crest HD for my new smile!</li>
            <li> The flavor is a mild mint and the gel has minimal flavor but the end result is a very clean brush.</li>
            <li> , this product is fantastic, when you Finish brushing with it your mouth and teeth feel just as clean and smooth as when you get a professional cleaning, after a minute you must spit but not rinse, because you must apply the second product now and brush for an additional minute, this is the whitener, but it is more difficult to apply because it tends to fall of the  brush, the flavor of booth products is pleasant and as I said before your teeth feel amazing, I haven&#x27;t seen a radical change in the color of my teeth, but my husband has, maybe my teeth can only get this white!</li>
            <li> The best part about this is that your teeth are whitened without experiencing any of the tooth sensitivity that people typically report after using other whitening products.</li>
            <li> We are super excited to take pictures on our cruise not being embarrassed by the yellow that used to linger on our teeth!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this new product from Crest through BzzAgent, because, honestly, I haven&#x27;t enjoyed the last few Crest toothpastes that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Also, I would love it if they made they product more minty and somehow made the fresh breath last longer like other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I love the toothpaste, it will be a bit pricey when I go back for more, but because I am not a huge fan of flossing it is totally worth it!  </li>
            <li> When Bzz Agent a word of mouth marketing company asked if I wanted to try a new Crest product I quickly agreed.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to use this two-step system, but for the most part it&#x27;s not a major inconvenience.</li>
            <li> but I definitely think it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
            <li> Recently I noticed my teeth were not as bright or white anymore.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to see that my teeth did, infact look whiter,  and they felt amazing after the deep cleansing toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My teeth, gums and mouth felt so clean after using the product but my gums had become sore and sensitive and even burned somewhat.  </li>
            <li> I was also pleasantly surprised by how clean my mouth felt.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean and polished after the instructed one minute brushing, almost like leaving the dentist&#x27;s office after a professional brushing/polishing.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how clean this product made my teeth and mouth feel.  </li>
            <li> This is simply the easiest way to get a white smile that is truly clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> After just a couple days I immediately noticed a difference in the clean feeling compared to my old toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Another reviewer wrote that this system gives you a &amp;#34;dentist clean feeling&amp;#34; and I completely agree.</li>
            <li> Liking the clean feeling so far and freshness after using it in the morning and evening.</li>
            <li> and I was honestly really surprised at how clean my teeth felt after I used the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how clean my teeth were using this tooth paste.</li>
            <li> every day I&#x27;m surprised how clean my teeth feel.  </li>
            <li> but I prefer the super minty toothpaste that makes me feel extra clean and</li>
            <li> Step one does not seem to foam very well to distribute through your entire mouth, it seems like you have to use more product to spread out to cover all your teeth.</li>
            <li> thing I like the most about this toothpaste is the feeling that it leaves your mouth with - it really does feel like you just left the dentist - every day!  </li>
            <li> The sparkly blue paste (step 1) removes plaque and makes your teeth feel super clean.</li>
            <li> So thanks for sending me the sample Crest, you more than likely have a customer for life.</li>
            <li> My mouth felt incredibly fresh and my teeth felt smooth and actually looked glossier!</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I have slightly sensitive gums/teeth, and they did seem more sensitive as the week went on using Crest</li>
            <li> and it really didn&#x27;t take much more time that regular brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - i definitely have noticed a difference, but to really make sure</li>
            <li> Step 2 is actually what makes my mouth feel super clean.</li>
            <li> Thanks Crest for coming out not only with my favorite toothpaste (Crest with Scope),</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find that it takes much more time than regular brushing, but it really does make my teeth feel polished.</li>
            <li> I will say my only issue is I really wish step 2 was a flip top cap like 1.</li>
            <li> I am a heavy coffee drinker so maintaining my teeth healthy and white is important and a good toothpaste is necessary.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t hurt or feel harsh at all.</li>
            <li> The 2nd gel -- the whitening gel -- definitely gives my teeth superior whitening and sparkle.  </li>
            <li> This is something that many folks who use whitening products report, but this seems to be fairly gentle on the teeth overall while still providing some whitening.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I have used many whitening toothpastes in the paste and find that they don&#x27;t whiten so much as prevent further yellowing.</li>
            <li> I have used many whitening toothpastes in the paste and find that they don&#x27;t whiten so much as prevent further yellowing.</li>
            <li> I have used many whitening toothpastes in the paste and find that they don&#x27;t whiten so much as prevent further yellowing.</li>
            <li> I actually let it sit for an additional 30 seconds after brushing because I love the self cleaning feeling that is actually intense.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I would change is the instructions don&#x27;t specify how much whitening agent to use for step 2 and it takes up more space in the bathroom to store since there are 2 tubes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I loved the results so much after a few days</li>
            <li> Overall, I would say that this product is an innovative whitening alternative but that it may be too much of a hassle for some people.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would say that this product is an innovative whitening alternative but that it may be too much of a hassle for some people.</li>
            <li> After just a few days of using this product, I found that yes, this kit whitens as good as about 2-3 whitestrips, and yes, my mouth felt much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I am heavy tea and coffee drinker, so I really needed good whitening product.</li>
            <li> Even the next morning when I woke up, I still had that super clean feeling that makes you run your tongue over your teeth?  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really speak to the efficacy of the whitening aspect, however, overall, I enjoyed the product.</li>
            <li> This two-step process also makes you aware of how long you brush your teeth so 2 minutes in the morning and 2 minutes at night makes your teeth and mouth feel refreshingly brighter and healthier.</li>
            <li> In complete transparency, I am trying this product for free thanks to Crest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used Crest as a kid and quite frankly as soon as I was old enough to choose my own toothpaste I abandoned it for sexier dental care</li>
            <li> My teeth definitely felt super clean</li>
            <li> I have had dental work done on one of my top front teeth and that one didn&#x27;t whiten as much as the others, but overall I can see a difference.</li>
            <li> I can enjoy my drinks AND have a white smile.</li>
            <li> Second, my teeth instantly felt cleaner, they got a good scrubbing and polishing.</li>
            <li> Personally, I thought of the pain as a good sign that the whitening part was actually working!  </li>
            <li> Personally, I thought of the pain as a good sign that the whitening part was actually working!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a drastic enough improvement in the whiteness of my teeth to tell people they HAVE to try this product, or that it is worth the money (although I got it free from the company as a BzzAgent).</li>
            <li> In just a couple of quick steps, my teeth feel squeaky clean and white.  </li>
            <li> While the two step process didn&#x27;t take much longer than regular brushing, I just wasn&#x27;t sure I was seeing the results in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> The paste left my mouth almost burning from the intense mint, but it was refreshing.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt smooth through the entire day and really fresh as well.  </li>
            <li> Good teeth do not run in my family, and I struggle with teeth that are not as white as I would like and the occasional bout of halitosis.</li>
            <li> It is pretty much pure hydrodgen peroxide which is used to whiten teeth.  </li>
            <li> And even though my sample was free the price that the product is listed at is VERY reasonable compared to the other products that offer similar results with considerably more hassle!  </li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants super clean, just out of the dentist, feeling teeth with the bonus natural whitening.</li>
            <li> I am not sure whether it whitened any more than other whiteners, since it seems like most toothpaste nowadays does that, but my teeth felt clean and smooth, and my wife likes how I taste, so a winner in my book.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh smell of the toothpaste, and it did some work the first week, then it just like other toothpastes....</li>
            <li> know there are other whitening products out there, but I thought this was especially easy because it&#x27;s easily incorporated into my usual brushing routine.</li>
            <li> Brushing my teeth can seem like a pain, despite being a very important health routine, and I was even more skeptical about my free sample of Crest Pro Health® HD™when I saw it was a two step process.</li>
            <li> If you looking for a method to enhance your brushing habit that I highly recommend this - it&#x27;s definitely worth a shot.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using this product if you want whiter teeth and a healthier smile.</li>
            <li> But for the cost, I would think it&#x27;s worth it but don&#x27;t put your hope too high..</li>
            <li> The process is very easy to brush with the first and then switch to the other tube for the whitener.  </li>
            <li> No, especially as I&#x27;ve already seen some whitening results from it and my teeth feel really clean!</li>
            <li> White teeth and a clean mouth feeling!</li>
            <li> It has been two weeks, and I am not sure that my teeth are whiter, but I do love the clean, fresh feeling I have after every use.</li>
            <li> It definitely leaves a clean, just from the dentist office feel and my teeth are whiter and brighter!</li>
            <li> I could instantly feel that my teeth felt polished, my breath was fresher and my mouth felt clean!</li>
            <li> I am excited to see if continued use will lighten my teeth a little more.</li>
            <li> I would probably use this before a special occasion, but definitely not as my everyday toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Only available on amazon and at CVS right now</li>
            <li> Step two: at first, I was thinking, this is going to get old really quick.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest and BzzAgent for allowing me this opportunity to document my experience with this product and help share my comments with others who are trying to reach the same ultimate goal of a healthy, clean and fresh mouth.  </li>
            <li> The first couple of days my gums were also sensitive, but that resolved fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> This system has two steps, the first is a toothpaste (that I wish tasted better and didn&#x27;t leave my mouth feeling so dry)</li>
            <li> It tastes slightly sweet and more or less like the gel in Crest Whitestrips.</li>
            <li> What I really love about this product is that it is 2 easy steps and takes no more time than just brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li> After the first use, it was easy to remember only to &amp;#34;spit&amp;#34; and not rinse between part 1 and part 2.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The first step is a purifying cleanser and the second step is a perfecting gel that polishes and whitens, easy to use and add into my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> The texture is a bit gooey in a positive way though so u can finish brushing your teeth without adding additional toothpaste.</li>
            <li> - I am no way compensated for my review, positive or negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expect results and a positive user experience.</li>
            <li> Positive Aspects:&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received one as well from Crest, but in no way was I asked to write a positive review.</li>
            <li> The clean feeling (similar to the sensation of getting your braces off for the first time) lasted practically all day!  </li>

            <li> The clean feeling (similar to the sensation of getting your braces off for the first time) lasted practically all day!</li>
            <li> But, even more important that that, this toothpaste really did whiten my teeth in just a few days.</li>
            <li> I got this toothpaste for free but I will definitely purchase it in the future because I love it.</li>
            <li> At first I was using it twice a day, and I think it was a bit too much for my gums.</li>
            <li> At first, it felt like there was a film on my teeth after you use Step 1, and I found the taste of Step 2 to be very minty (almost too minty).  </li>
            <li> My first thought was it would take too much time</li>
            <li> When I first saw this product I was hesitant to try it and didn&#x27;t expect much.  </li>
            <li> but with HD I really saw that my teeth were whiter within the first week.</li>
            <li> The first one is the actual cleaner -- it&#x27;s minty and tastes like normal toothpaste -- not quite as minty as the Crest Scope, but it still is refreshing.  </li>
            <li> First of all, the taste of the paste and gel leave much to be desired.  </li>
            <li> First, the paste tastes really chalky in your mouth when you&#x27;re brushing.</li>
            <li> Step 1 is a refreshing paste with tiny microbeads, that leaves a fresh minty taste and helps to fight plaque from forming step 2 is a clear gel.</li>
            <li> On the first day, I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in the whiteness of my teeth</li>
            <li> At first it seems like too much to add to your routine.  </li>
            <li> Step 1 of the process is no different than any other toothpaste and tastes great.  </li>
            <li> This agent didn&#x27;t foam as much as the first.</li>
            <li> You really do notice a difference within the first use.</li>
            <li> My husband and I couldn&#x27;t believe how much whiter our teeth were after using it the first time.</li>
            <li> I can absolutely tell you that your teeth will feel cleaner after your first use.  </li>
            <li> as I was pretty much fed up with strips, gel&#x27;s and so on.....  </li>
            <li> It really promotes brushing teeth longer than 30 seconds which in my opinion  is much needed!</li>
            <li> The first day my teeth were so much whiter.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed that after the first couple days I really saw an improvement.</li>
            <li> but the first toothpaste is very foamy and minty</li>
            <li> I know this toothpaste cost more (about 4x what I was paying for the other Crest toothpaste), but it might just be worth it if it saves me time in the dentist chair and not having to use whitening strips anymore.  </li>
            <li> After first use I realized that it did not add much time to my routine.</li>
            <li> Upon first use my teeth felt much cleaner, and are now noticeably whiter.</li>
            <li> price, again I believe there are other toothpastes out there that work better for me, but for ~13.00 maybe this one will work for you and it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> After the first couple of uses my teeth really started to feel cleaner and look whiter.</li>
            <li> I did notice that my mouth felt more fresh in comparison to other toothpastes I have used.</li>
            <li> I did notice that my mouth felt more fresh in comparison to other toothpastes I have used.</li>
            <li> have tried lots of whitening products and had pretty much given up, but this one really works and is not expensive at all.</li>
            <li> What really blew me away is that my teeth were noticeably whiter in the first week.  </li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health HD successfully made them at least two shades</li>
            <li> The first step has a very grimy texture and makes my mouth feel like cotton.</li>
            <li> At first I really didn&#x27;t think it would make a difference considering I&#x27;m a coffee drinker</li>
            <li> I really started to notice results after the first week of use.  </li>
            <li> After the first use, I noticed a much cleaner and smoother feel to my teeth and</li>
            <li> I realized from the first day on that my teeth appeared much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> but I followed the two step process, and already I can see how much whiter my teeth are, thanks to Step two!</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t even have to watch the clock to make sure I am brushing as long as I need too -</li>
            <li> The usage is pretty straight forward-</li>
            <li> so much so that I over squeezed the first time and it fell into the sink.</li>
            <li> every time I use this, although I do wonder how safe this is to use long term.</li>
            <li> It really wasn&#x27;t a big deal to add another step into my morning routine (one more minute of brushing really hasn&#x27;t ruined my day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I could get the fresh breath that I get from my normal toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> With this whitening system I had no sensitivity problems at all and see just as good results if not better than when I used the strips.</li>
            <li> I loved this toothpaste/whitener system because my teeth not only look whiter, but they really do feel healthier, and I&#x27;ve only been using it 3 days!  </li>
            <li> I was even more surprised to see a noticeable whitening in my smile after only 7 days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So many times I rush through brushing and this really made me aware of how long I should be doing it for.  </li>
            <li> I love that neither toothpaste has a weird taste and my breath smells nice and fresh after using them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited until the full 6 days were complete before posting anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had fresh breath longer than with just brushing with normal tooth paste.</li>
            <li> I have used other whitening products before and they all require you to put aside a good amount of time to use them, and they leave your teeth feeling so sensitive.</li>
            <li> The results were good but not striking.</li>
            <li> Not that different than my normal routine, I frequently have to add more paste to my brush to get a really clean mouth feel anyway.  </li>
            <li> I use this system twice daily, I love using the first tube (purifying cleanser) because it leaves your teeth feeling refreshed and extra clean</li>
            <li> I definitely do think the first step gives a better clean than a regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> then a brighter smile (considering my teeth are not horribly dull).  </li>
            <li> Although it did not &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34; as much as my conventional toothpaste, it had a similar pleasant fresh taste.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel nice and clean from the minute I brush until late at night after dinner.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;d like to clean up during your daily toothbrushing routine, it might be worth a try.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;d like to clean up during your daily toothbrushing routine, it might be worth a try.  </li>
            <li> The best part is that my teeth are noticeably less dingy and less beige.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, the clean feeling I have after I brush with Crest Pro-Health HD is worth the extra cost compared to &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel fresh from the dentist clean and are several shades whiter.  </li>
            <li> like the fresh and clean feeling but have mixed reviews about the whitening.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I would suggest this product to anyone wanting a clean fresh mouth and whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> After using the product, my teeth definitely feel fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> The taste was fresh and left my mouth feeling clean; however, I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in tooth whiteness.</li>
            <li> My teeth were left feeing clean and my mouth fresh.</li>
            <li> After following the direction accordingly my teeth feel clean and my breath feels fresh.</li>
            <li> You will then be left with a clean, fresh mouth for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a fresh clean feeling after brushing their teeth.</li>
            <li> It leaves your teeth feeling clean and your breath so fresh that you don&#x27;t want to eat or drink anything after you&#x27;ve brushed!</li>
            <li> Not only does this toothpaste leave my teeth feeling clean and fresh</li>
            <li> But taking an extra 60 seconds twice a day is nothing compared to how clean and fresh my mouth feels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to try the new toothpaste for the past three weeks and have been more than pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> Previously, I used Colgate Total and was pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> The flavor was a little more astringent, but not bad.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try the new toothpaste as I have tooth sensitivity and had before this toothpaste found a toothpaste that worked really well with my sensitive teeth, made my mouth feel clean and gave me fresh breath.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I would have purchased it on my own, since adding more steps to my daily routine wasn&#x27;t something I was originally interested in doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my teeth do yellow and require standard whitening, but although this is MUCH more convenient than things like the Crest White Strips I&#x27;ve used before, I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend it because it didn&#x27;t seem effective.</li>
            <li> The second tube is more of the polishing finisher; kind of adds that last minute touch of white and clean!!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> This is definitely more than just regular toothpaste and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this 2 step system and am incredibly pleased to have discovered it and incorporated it into my daily health care.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and am sure this is going to be my regular \\&quot;toothpaste\\&quot; from now on.</li>
            <li> You use the first part, brush normally, then spit (don&#x27;t rinse!).</li>
            <li> It has a little bit of a grittiness to it that I honestly love!</li>
            <li> With Crest Pro-Health HD 2-step toothpaste system, Crest ushers in new era of toothpaste for a healthier mouth and whiter smile.</li>
            <li> My smile truly is like new.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone looking for a new way to enhance their smile.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive a free trial of this new toothpaste through BzzAgent</li>
            <li> I have not noticed a huge difference in the whiteness of my teeth, but my teeth were pretty white already.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, after 6 days, I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference, but my teeth are already pretty white.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Dislikes: My teeth were pretty white to start with, so I haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference.</li>
            <li> You simply brush for a minute with step 1 and then spit, put step 2 on the toothbrush and brush for another minute, its that easy.</li>
            <li> I suffer from super sensitive teeth when I try to whiten them</li>
            <li> That proved easy enough</li>
            <li> I would venture to say that perhaps my teeth lightened a shade but it may also be simply because I kept staring at them and took more notice than normal.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use and make a daily part of your lifestyle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently trying this product free thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and only takes 4 minutes if you use it 2 times a day.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak on the health aspect as I historically have had very healthy teeth from regular brushing, flossing, and cleanings.</li>
            <li> The two step system is easy to use and provides lasting effects.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as easy as regular teeth brushing yet MAKES</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just easy to do while your brushing you are cleaning your teeth and whiten them at the same time.</li>
            <li> Easy, 2 step process that definitely results in whiter, brighter teeth.</li>
            <li> Tube 1 easily flips open for minute 1.  </li>
            <li> They also made my teeth super sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dentist, and I have always been a very loyal Colgate total user.</li>
            <li> but it was easy and the two minutes actually flew by.</li>
            <li> I am a believer in this teeth-whitening system because it&#x27;s easy to use - replacing my regular toothpaste with Crest Pro Health HD</li>
            <li> If you buy white strips and toothpaste you will add time and money to your routine so why not just get this easy kits that in three minutes you can be done?</li>
            <li> Brush with step one for one minute, then brush with step two for an additional minute, easy enough.  </li>
            <li> What I like about Crest Pro Health® HD™ is that it is an easy two step system that only takes two minutes (vs. some of the whitening strips that you have to leave on for 30 minutes).</li>
            <li> once you resist your initial instinct to rinse after Step 1) and was easy to integrate into my already two-times-a-day brushing .</li>
            <li> The system is a two step process which is easy enough to use.  </li>
            <li> I received it free from Crest via Bzz Agent to try and review and this might be the first time I actually continue using the product after my sample is used up.</li>
            <li> The 2 steps are easy to follow and results are obvious.</li>
            <li> My only criticism would be that I wish both of the tooth pastes could be combined into one easy step.</li>
            <li> What it did do was make my gums super sensitive</li>
            <li> The two step toothpaste is easy to use and to me doesn&#x27;t take extra time.</li>
            <li> Make sure to rinse well or peroxide will make your mouth dry.  </li>
            <li> The application is easy, essentially brushing your teeth twice with the two step process.</li>
            <li> I am a believer in this teeth-whitening system because it&#x27;s easy to use - replacing my regular toothpaste with Crest Pro Health HD</li>
            <li> The first step/tube has a slightly gritty texture and a light mint taste.  </li>
            <li> I find my mouth to be extremely dry at this point and would love a drink, but have resisted to allow the paste to work as it is intended.  </li>
            <li> This is such an easy product to use, brush for 1 minute with step 1, then brush for 1 minute with step 2.</li>
            <li> (they were less than thrilled...).  </li>
            <li> Step 1 is a flip cap that is easy to open.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t make your teeth super sensitive like whitening strips or trays do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This 2 step process is easy and once you get use to it it becomes 2nd nature.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple, easy, and it works.</li>
            <li> Some surface stains were less noticeable which is nice surprise.</li>
            <li> It easily peeled back !</li>
            <li> However, after using Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste for about one week now, I can say that it does not add any time to my routine and has been an easy switch to make.</li>
            <li> I am super conscious about morning breath and after using this system, I feel like that&#x27;s no longer an issue--</li>
            <li> but my teeth were pretty white and stain free before I started.  </li>
            <li> This 2 step daily toothpaste leaves a fresh clean straight from the dentist feeling after using it.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the products, I noticed that my teeth felt gritty after step one, and then smooth again after step two.</li>
            <li> It was nice and had a slight minty flavor.</li>
            <li> so it is easy enough to brush my teeth for the required 1 minute</li>
            <li> so the timing is easy for me, however I can see some people struggle with timing of the different minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> one is an easy flip open tube that can be done with one hand and</li>
            <li> I was REALLY happy that it didn&#x27;t make my teeth painfully sensitive like whitening strips have done in the past.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give all 5 stars is because of how easy it is to forget that it&#x27;s a two step process.</li>
            <li> My results with this kit were MUCH better than the strips and took only 1 week of just brushing my teeth like I normally do.  </li>
            <li> I liked just Step One alone and would buy that for half the price</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is simple to use, just two things to use as you would normal toothpaste</li>
            <li> I also feel like my teeth possibly feel smoother, but I would credit that more to brushing longer when using two steps than I normally did with one toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Works, doesn&#x27;t hurt, and is easy and pleasurable to use daily.</li>
            <li> I can easily see the difference when I use the system vs regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Step 1 is a flip cap that is easy to open.</li>
            <li> Brushing 1 minute with each of the 2 toothpastes is easy enough.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving this product, I noticed the easy instructions to following that are printed on the box and on each of the two tubes.  </li>
            <li> I plan to continue to use this system as it not only seems to work well, but it is easy.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and only takes 2 minutes, twice a day.  </li>
            <li> It kind of irritated/burned my mouth the first few days, but that did go away.</li>
            <li> After a week of use, I have noticed some improvement in whiteness, but not a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> The initial taste may seem strong, it did to me, but after a couple brushings, it was no longer noticeable.</li>
            <li> My teeth got second chance to be strong and shine again.</li>
            <li> Only reason why I gave it 4 vs 5 stars is that the mint is almost too strong, but not a showstopper.</li>
            <li> As I could only use it for 4 days before the sensation got too strong, I did not see a noticeable difference in teeth whitening.</li>
            <li> They even felt super clean ALL DAY  LONG.</li>
            <li> Not a bad thing necessarily, but worth noting.</li>
            <li> and it is an opaque white gel that has a strong mint flavor.</li>
            <li> A little free toothpaste.&amp;#34; However I will be buying and strongly recommending this stuff.</li>
            <li> I do like the Crest line because it is a minty flavor that is more subtle than some other brands that I have found to be overly strong that they kind of burn my tongue and a bit</li>
            <li> There is no other toothpaste on the market that leaves your teeth feeling sparkly clean every time you brush your teeth like this.</li>
            <li> It is certainly dentist quality</li>
            <li> certainly would not go out of my way to recommend the Crest Pro-Health HD kit.</li>
            <li> so made certain to follow the directions given.</li>
            <li> The results compound over time when it comes to the whitening but stop when you hit a certain point.</li>
            <li> Also certain lipsticks make them look yellower at times.</li>
            <li> This is purely my opinion on the matter, as I have no official answers to relay.&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say they were 2X whiter, but certainly whiter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I certainly felt that</li>
            <li> and I did not notice a large difference in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li> but I would certainly pay for it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 20 days of use, the feel of my teeth and mouth is certainly cleaner.</li>
            <li> So, purely reviewing this product on it&#x27;s principal claim of whitening teeth,I have to give it a 1 star  rating.</li>
            <li> It certainly saves time as well.</li>
            <li> Well, they certainly are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had noticeably whiter teeth, and my mouth certainly FELT healthier 2)</li>
            <li> One of the things that I did have a question about was the large difference in tube size for Step1 and Step 2.</li>
            <li> One of the things that I did have a question about was the large difference in tube size for Step1 and Step 2.</li>
            <li> It certainly met me expectations on that.</li>
            <li> I received this as part of a promotional product review, but I can certainly see buying this once I&#x27;m out of the promotional amount to keep up with the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another perk to this system is that is forces me to actually brush for a full 2 minutes -- as opposed to just a quick brush -- it makes me more conscious of using the 1st tube for about a minute, and then the second part.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy to move from one to the other - with no rinsing in between brushings.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a  positive side note : as a brand-new mom to a two-month-old let&#x27;s be real</li>
            <li> The first step, which reminds me of the gritty toothpaste the dentist uses to polish at a cleaning, is pretty normal and feels fine.</li>
            <li> &quot; My breath was fine (as confirmed by my wife) and seemed fine throughout the day, but I got less of a feel after I brushed my teeth of like breathing in a minty cloud.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> I did note that the tooth paste is more of a gel in terms of density, so be careful when first opening and using so you do not squeeze too much of the product out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read reviews saying that the two steps take too long or that it&#x27;s too much, but I haven&#x27;t really minded the two steps since, and have actually really enjoyed having them separated.</li>
            <li> The two steps surprisingly took about the same time as normal brushing, so that wasn&#x27;t a big deal either, like I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> First of all i love slick and cool looking packaging.</li>
            <li> It left quite a nice shine, and while it didn&#x27;t make my teeth spectacularly white on the first try, it did make my teeth look polished.</li>
            <li> I tried the product exactly as directed on the box, one minute for the first product and one minute for the second and after a week I had mouth full of sore gums.</li>
            <li> The texture, especially Step 2, is different than normal toothpaste, but in a good way.  </li>
            <li> The first tube is most like a toothpaste, and the second tube is a clear gel.  </li>
            <li> my teeth stay pretty white on their own with regular brushing.</li>
            <li> I gave it a try for a few weeks and love the results!  </li>
            <li> Love the new Crest HD Daily Two-Step toothpaste!</li>
            <li> With this new system, I’m more mindful of cleaning each tooth during the cleaning phases and polishing during the last phase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> are regular Crest users and are pleased with what we&#x27;ve seen from this new product.  </li>
            <li> I love trying new products and white teeth</li>
            <li> The set does live up to what it promises on every account- a brighter smile, fresher breath etc, but the taste really gets to me.</li>
            <li> I noticed a slight improvement in whitening instantly, but after using the toothpaste twice a day for a week I noticed a great improvement.</li>
            <li> Tastes great &amp; I notice a difference, slightly whiter teeth after a couple weeks use twice daily</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy , fast, and priced very low!</li>
            <li> Overall it was easy to use, it saves whitening time and it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much longer than my previous brushing regime, and it&#x27;s nice to have a reminder to brush for a longer amount of time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really feel like the mint is strong enough to freshen my breath.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try at first, because of the 2 step process and because so many products claim to offer amazing results that don&#x27;t really deliver...</li>
            <li> I really like the way the Crest Pro-Health makes my teeth feel cleaner for much longer than my regular toothpaste, and a huge benefit is that my teeth are much whiter!  </li>
            <li> Thanks to the folks at BzzAgent, I&#x27;ve been able to try the new Crest Pro-Health HD for the last 6 weeks or so!  </li>
            <li> It took me a few days to get used to the two-step process, but I think I actually spend more time brushing my teeth as I am more aware of how much time I spend on each step.  </li>
            <li> While my teeth did not become significantly whiter (I am an avid coffee drinker, so my teeth are not as white as they could be),  I noticed an improvement in color.  </li>
            <li> The first phase freshens your breath more than any other paste I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really see a whiter smile, better breath, cleaner mouth feel when using this as opposed to the stuff I previously used.</li>
            <li> my teeth are so white with just using this &amp; no white strips - LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This is my review first my first brush...and WOW!  </li>
            <li> My mouth definitely felt fresh and clean after brushing which was much better than some other toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Definitely read the fine print.  </li>
            <li> I have done a few teeth whitening regimens and this one was by far the most easy and convenient.  </li>
            <li> The toothpaste feels like regular Crest toothpaste and tastes fine.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe the hype at first about it whiten your teeth in 6 days but rest assured if that&#x27;s the main reason</li>
            <li> Second, it is quick!  </li>
            <li> the taste and mouth feel (particularly of the first step)</li>
            <li> And step two is foamy and tastes pretty decent too.  </li>
            <li> And step two is foamy and tastes pretty decent too.  </li>
            <li> However, if it actually gives good results than I the slight inconvenience is worth it.</li>
            <li> So overall I think the set is worth a shot because it&#x27;s simple to use, but I didn&#x27;t personally notice anything special about it to make it worth spending more than you would for just a toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I very highly recommend this product to anyone looking to change up their routine.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to try the new Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step toothpaste as apart of the BzzAgent.com campaign.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive tooth right now</li>
            <li> It is important to me to keep my teeth as healthy as possible and I can live with the flavor if that is what Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste will do for me.</li>
            <li> Overall, this product left my mouth feeling clean and my teeth feeling ultra polished and clean!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Following the instructions, brushing with the purifying cleanser first - the taste is good, very similar to other Crest Pro Health® toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> The flavor of the part 1 of the toothpaste i liked, but the flavor of the part 2 was a little off-putting.</li>
            <li> If an 11 year old wants it and says it works what does that tell you?!?!??</li>
            <li> It left my teeth feeling clean and they did look whiter even after the first use.  </li>
            <li> that is it two steps, the first step gets your teeth clean and the second step is just for whitening.  </li>
            <li> The crest pro-health leaves my teeth with a fresh clean feeling all day long.  </li>
            <li> It leaves you with that after the dentist feeling where you feel the clean teeth more than usual.  </li>
            <li> The first tube feels gritty in my mouth, like it is scraping my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> After my first use, I felt like I could actually feel the clean.</li>
            <li> After using in the first time, my teeth felt as clean as if I had just left the dentist!</li>
            <li> My teeth felt clean and refreshed and beautifully white after the first use.  </li>
            <li> The first step gets your teeth extra clean.  </li>
            <li> My teeth felt sparkling clean after both of these steps, but I was in the bathroom for about 10 minutes when all was said and done :) I think the price is slightly high for a toothpaste, especially if you just buy a standard one with baking soda.</li>
            <li> Either way, you get positive results and the clean feeling is a really positive bonus - enough to deal with 2 steps in the end.</li>
            <li> At first, brushing my teeth with 2 steps seemed high maintenance.</li>
            <li> The products were nice tasting too..not too much and not too little.</li>
            <li> You brush your teeth for one minute using the toothpaste, which is a little bit &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34; like so that it kind of polishes your teeth and gets them ready for the whitening gel.</li>
            <li> Within the first few days of using it, I noticed a huge improvement in how clean my teeth felt.  </li>
            <li> The two step process took a little more time, but the rewards were well worth it.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t imagine going back to that ordinary clean after having my mouth feel this good.  </li>
            <li> Just brush like you normally would in your daily routine and get dentist-office clean!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for anyone that wants an easy way to whiten your smile without jumping through the hoops other products want you to do.</li>
            <li> Normally, whenever using a type of &amp;#34;whitening product&amp;#34; my teeth and gums get very sensitive and bother me, not this time!!!</li>
            <li> I like the new Crest ProHealth HD, because I feel like it has caused my teeth to get extra clean, become smoother, and helped me have a shiny smile.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I have been using this paste and I will say that from a whitening perspective, we can definitely see a huge difference in his teeth-</li>
            <li> As a bzz agent I recently received this as a free trial thanks to Crest.  </li>
            <li> After using the second tube, my teeth felt smooth, much like leaving from my six month dental</li>
            <li> Human nature also wants to continue getting free things.  </li>
            <li> I recently received this product for free thanks to Crest</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t personally noticed a huge difference in whiteness</li>
            <li> Got the opportunity to try this for free with BzzAgent and felt free to offer my feedback- good or bad.  </li>
            <li> I received this whitening system for free thanks to crest for testing purposes only.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a _huge_ difference, but there was definitely some whitening going on.</li>
            <li> (Now I&#x27;m wishing I had taken photos as evidence but don&#x27;t really feel comfortable getting that up close and personal with my phone.)</li>
            <li> I got this product free as a buzzagent and was concerned that it really wouldn&#x27;t perform as advertised but it definitely does.  </li>
            <li> I am really self conscious about my smile.</li>
            <li> I drink coffee everyday so this is a great way for me to feel like my teeth can still be white despite the coffee.  </li>
            <li> Not only am I so happy with my results after just a few weeks of uses...</li>
            <li> As far as that HD whitening smile, I didn&#x27;t notice much difference.</li>
            <li> and I can tell a huge difference from using regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Crest HD Pro-Health Daily 2 step System for free thanks to BzzzAgent but all opinions 100% mine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Crest HD Pro-Health Daily 2 step System for free thanks to Crest but all opinions 100% mine.</li>
            <li> , i didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in terms of how white my teeth were, but i did notice that my teeth feel like i just came from the dentist!</li>
            <li> They want you to spend so much money on a product that doesn&#x27;t do what it says it should.  </li>
            <li> I really like this two step toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s get one thing straight: it&#x27;s not a whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve been using it for weeks, two weeks straight and then 3x /week night and day WITH A WHITENING TOOTHPASTE</li>
            <li> and I really doubt it&#x27;s six shades.  </li>
            <li> They feel very slippery</li>
            <li> I can really tell a difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Even though they couldn&#x27;t have been whitened with one brushing, they sparkled so much that they looked whiter.</li>
            <li> I have just started to use this product, so I am still indecisive as to how well it really works.</li>
            <li> This product is an absolute life changer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready to show it off in high definition!</li>
            <li> I really works.  </li>
            <li> I was very intrigued about the concept and the claims written on the package.</li>
            <li> really done.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> or it is not doing much to whiten my teeth, so the whitening claim is still up for debate for me.  </li>
            <li> Although it claims 6x whitening, I can&#x27;t really comment on that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done some looking around and this system seems to be a minimum of $12 on one website that I found, and up to as much as $38 on another.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried whitening toothpastes many times and they never really give noticeable results.  </li>
            <li> my teeth feel so much cleaner and are noticeably whiter.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants whiter teeth without paying the cost of the dentist office procedure.</li>
            <li> I received the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste System as a free promotion from BzzAgent, in return for my unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really like this system</li>
            <li> I was so surprised when I caught a reflection of my smile in the mirror-</li>
            <li> I really like the way this toothpaste made my mouth and teeth feel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are two things I really like about this product: the way it makes my teeth feel and how it whitened my teeth.  </li>
            <li> After a week, I noticed that my teeth are much whiter and shinier.  </li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t fit the second step into my routine.  </li>
            <li> Makes the process go much faster for me.</li>
            <li> There really is a difference between this product and others.</li>
            <li> The kit has the toothpaste and a perfecting gel in it, the perfecting gel sounded promising.</li>
            <li> It also does whiten teeth although not as much as six shades.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much whitening, but I didn&#x27;t take a before and after picture to really compare.</li>
            <li> You must do a two step process which really isn&#x27;t that time consuming (1 minute cleaning with each tube).</li>
            <li> so I was hesitant to use much.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have as much staining as perhaps others</li>
            <li> Although the routine takes some time to get used to, it is much easier than using my whitening trays from the dentist.</li>
            <li> It is important to following the directions and do not rinse after step one.</li>
            <li> After using step 2, you can finally rinse and enjoy the results.</li>
            <li> that even if they work there is too much of a hassle.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to test Crest Pro-Healthy HD Daily two-Step Toothpaste for free and jumped at the chance.  </li>
            <li> Since I have more crowns than natural teeth - I don&#x27;t get much of the whitening effect from this toothpaste (obviously), however!</li>
            <li> I was given Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Tw0-Step Toothpaste to try for free from Crest.  </li>
            <li> they are much closer than they were before I began using this.  </li>
            <li> makes this really work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health HD has really worked well for me.  </li>
            <li> It was gentle on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> and I can tell you that this really works.  </li>
            <li> I have also tried the Crest Pro Health toothpaste and didn&#x27;t find that it cleaned my teeth very well.</li>
            <li> In step 1 which is the cleaning part, it really does what it says.</li>
            <li> and it has really helped with stains(coffee, tea etc.)</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m very concerned that it&#x27;s ingredient list includes hydrogen  peroxide</li>
            <li> but I really do think it is working.</li>
            <li> I like it so much</li>
            <li> do like the freshness this product gives, but after a week I didn&#x27;t really notice any whitening benefits.</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy this product, though I was provided a free sample to review.</li>
            <li> I had heard about whitening products, but thought they were either too pricey or took too much time to use.  </li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t let that fool you, this product really works.</li>
            <li> My teeth are noticeably whiter, so much so that my wife has even commented.</li>
            <li> I tried it even though the thought of having so much fluoride was a bit intimidating since I know that there are health concerns in the alternative health field</li>
            <li> I tried this product for two weeks straight hoping for a decrease in sensitivity.</li>
            <li> you are looking for an over the counter whitener and can purchase it for a reasonable price</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest</li>
            <li> I will have to wait to see how much the whiteness is improved.</li>
            <li> but I can really see a change in my teeth.  </li>
            <li> He also noticed that his teeth are much whiter.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> all honesty, this toothpaste pushed me to brush for the two whole minutes one is supposed to brush.</li>
            <li> oh my, it really feels like you just got out of the dentist&#x27;s chair after a cleaning.  </li>
            <li> did it for five days, every night before I went to bed and by the fifth day, my gums really hurt.</li>
            <li> so I am very in touch with how my mouth and teeth feel.  </li>
            <li> did receive this product free as part of a Bzz Agent campaign, but I will be adding it to my regular grocery list when it is depleted.</li>
            <li> I would definetly recommend this product to anyone who wants a cleaner feeling that lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this too</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> My teeth are whiter and I feel it is much safer.  </li>
            <li> Not so much.</li>
            <li> After that, though, I started having sensitivity along my gum line that was a bit too much for me to just ignore.  </li>
            <li> To that, the taste didn&#x27;t bother me that much, but I could see where some might.  </li>
            <li> t bother me that much, but I could see where some might.  </li>
            <li> but my mouth looks and feels so much</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re ready to spit it out and move on to step 2.</li>
            <li> As for the whitening, I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference yet.  </li>
            <li> I just really like this two step system.</li>
            <li> I have been using the two step system for about 2 months now, thanks to Crest and BzzzAgent.</li>
            <li> From a design standpoint, that really bothers me.</li>
            <li> for the negatives, well, I really don&#x27;t think my teeth are 6 times whiter.  </li>
            <li> It cleans well, but would I really want to pay over $10 whenever I need toothpaste?  </li>
            <li> It cleans well, but would I really want to pay over $10 whenever I need toothpaste?  </li>
            <li> I am really liking the way that the Crest HD 2 step system is making my mouth feel.</li>
            <li> The combo of the steps works really well to whiten and brighten my teeth.</li>
            <li> It is definitely no worse than what i was using in terms of effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I do like the concept of the two step process, so each part can be formulated to really focus on either the cleaning aspect or the polishing/whitening aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was sent this toothpaste to try as part of a BzzAgent campaign, and as much as I really wanted to like it, it hurt my teeth.  </li>
            <li> and I really like the results.</li>
            <li> My husband tried it too and he really likes it.</li>
            <li> I find it much easier to convince myself to brush one minute with step 1 and one minute with step 2.</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste for about 2 1/2 weeks now, and I am really liking it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was interested to try it when it said that it’s formulated for deep cleaning and advanced whitening that goes beyond your normal toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Worked very well</li>
            <li> Take note, this step has a much thinner gel</li>
            <li> so don’t squeeze the tube much at all unless you want to be covered in tooth paste.  </li>
            <li> I got a package of Crest Pro-Health Daily Two-Step Toothpaste from Crest for free to try it out.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Bzzagent.com</li>
            <li> It is extremely gentle and an asset to anyone&#x27;s brushing routine.</li>
            <li> I may just be too much to overcome.</li>
            <li> It really does leave you with a &amp;#34;fresh from the dentist&amp;#34; feel.</li>
            <li> My first couple of brushings, I was expecting more action, but I started out using smaller amounts than I might normally.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t necessarily enjoy having TWO steps to complete with each brushing, but it&#x27;s definitely been worth it for the results.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> A one-step process would be much easier.</li>
            <li> and I really like this system.</li>
            <li> Overall, I enjoy using Crest Pro Health® HD, would buy it and use it again, and would recommend Crest Pro Health® HD to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually very painless.</li>
            <li> , I thought I should really make an effort to use it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> At times, I thought my teeth were whiter, but then looking at pictures from before I started using the product, I didn&#x27;t really see a difference.  </li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t think it freshened my breath, however my husband had no complaints.</li>
            <li> I have used the whitening strips before, I basically need to stand in front of the sink the whole time to prevent dripping.</li>
            <li> Thank you, Crest (and BuzzAgent) for the free sample - will definitely be buying this!</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> We can put a man on the moon, but I need to brush my teeth with 2 different pastes to get a healthy smile and white teeth?</li>
            <li> I really like about this</li>
            <li> Luck for me I got to try it through a free promotion, but will be using this on the regular moving forward.</li>
            <li> It left my teeth feeling incredibly smooth, like after going to the dentist.</li>
            <li> I notice that my teeth feel much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that my husband&#x27;s teeth are much whiter after using this product too.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I really feel a difference with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The stuff that really cleans the teeth.</li>
            <li> So you really aren&#x27;t going to get whitening from any toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I tried the product out for 2 weeks straight...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really know how well this compares.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product by Crest!</li>
            <li> I am very picky when it comes to toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased to say that the two step Crest Pro Health HD is simple, effective,and delivers fresh breath that last for days, whiter teeth without sensitivity or grayling my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have always been self conscious about my smile.  </li>
            <li> It is also much easier to use than I imagined.</li>
            <li> applying Step Two to the brush, I learned to use caution when squeezing from the tube because the substance comes out from the tube much quicker and easier than with Step One.</li>
            <li> I absolutely feel like my mouth is healthier with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I absolutely feel like my mouth is healthier with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The first step removes plaque and has the flavor of a normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t think there was much of a difference in the whiteness of my teeth, but I took a pic and compared it to a pic I took 6 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I can really see the difference, no issues with sensitivity and no tale-tell sign of whiting along on the edges of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have to start by saying that I was not expecting much out of this product.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel much cleaner, and I&#x27;ll probably continue to buy this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll see a difference in whiteness after just one use but really start noticing the difference after about 10 days of brushing 2X day.</li>
            <li> This product works really well.  </li>
            <li> The second tube or step two polishes my teeth and leaves them feeling smooth and squeaky</li>
            <li> This toothpaste works really well for me and my husband.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to like this as much as I do.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It appears that this product is OK at whitening your teeth some, and perfect for maintaining already white teeth, at the expensive just one extra minute each time you brush.</li>
            <li> ; Really??</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Anything to whiten my teeth at such a cheap price (compared to going to dentist) is always good!&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I really like about this product is that it gets ALL of your teeth.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste free from Crest and Bzzagent for testing purposes.  </li>
            <li> I got Crest Pro Health HD free to try from BzzAgent, but I have already gone out and purchased another one and have made it a part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> did not experience any sensitivity and my mouth felt very clean.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> With the polish, I can really taste the peroxide even after rinsing</li>
            <li> The results were better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> A noticeable change in my teeth much whiter and brighter</li>
            <li> I received the Pro-Health HD Daily kit for free through BzzAgent to try.</li>
            <li> Absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> However, this system by Crest really does the job it promises to do.</li>
            <li> is that it really dries out your mouth while you are using it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t add that much time to your brushing routine, but it is something you have to get used to.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner and they look much whiter.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so much cleaner and fresher after I use this</li>
            <li> but after a couple weeks, I really noticed the difference.  </li>
            <li> This gel does not taste very chemically to me.</li>
            <li> He felt the product really cleaned the plaque from his teeth.  </li>
            <li> I really like the way my mouth feels after step 1.  </li>
            <li> and I will definitely continue to use this after my free sample is all used up.</li>
            <li> The gel also comes out fast</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t spend much longer brushing than I used to.  </li>
            <li> I received Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free as a promo from Bzz Agent.  </li>
            <li> so this is a much cheaper option.  </li>
            <li> I know I really should be brushing longer</li>
            <li> I recently received a free trial of Crest Pro-Health HD two step toothpaste from BzzAgent on behalf of Crest.</li>
            <li> It works really well.  </li>
            <li> You really should give it a try</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive teeth and have never had success with whitening strips or the trays that you leave in you mouth for 30 minutes at a time because they always hurt my teeth.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much for &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> teeth but the real stuff -</li>
            <li> This gel produces no foam, it&#x27;s just gently spread over your teeth.</li>
            <li> (besides the possibility of leaving white spots) would be that I experienced increased sensitivity in my teeth after the 2nd or 3rd time using it.</li>
            <li> (besides the possibility of leaving white spots) would be that I experienced increased sensitivity in my teeth after the 2nd or 3rd time using it.</li>
            <li> I have not seen much of a change in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I also find this system much quicker and easier and just as effective.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> I actually really like it.  </li>
            <li> but Crest HD really does.  </li>
            <li> have no clue if it makes all that much of a difference</li>
            <li> Alone the brush works really well, combine it with this toothpaste and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> No matter how much I brush my teeth, I still wind up with plaque and calcium build-up on and around my teeth.</li>
            <li> (though much cheaper that whitening strips).</li>
            <li> I also did not think I saw much difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Too much hassel for the results.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really see a difference after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t work jack much, despicable now</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent and Crest</li>
            <li> I really wish i took a before picture.  </li>
            <li> me that silky smooth run your tongue over your teeth feeling after brushing my teeth with a regular toothbrush not even my sonic brush</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice much color change to my teeth.</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> In just two minutes, I have a much cleaner mouth and teeth that feel polished, and the added bonus of a hint of whitening.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give up on the product because it really provided my teeth protection.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really see any difference</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two Step Toothpaste System from Crest and have tried it and</li>
            <li> do wish that there was a way they could have had one packaging, much like a two part epoxy that you squeeze the plunger separately to expel the paste.</li>
            <li> This system really does work.</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro-Health HD Daily for free because I am a BzzAgent and have the opportunity to review some products.  </li>
            <li> I am happy to report that over my time using this product I have not experienced any increased tooth sensitivity.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was one warning on the label that I found ironic.</li>
            <li> Part 2 is the polishing gel that really helps to whiten the teeth.</li>
            <li> Under five minutes per day to make teeth whiter and brighter seems reasonable to me.</li>
            <li> Not to mention how much whiter my teeth are after using the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> You use it much like a toothpaste although of course it doesn&#x27;t foam.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve really noticed much of a difference in my teeth.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I first used the products is that neither of them have a harsh taste like many toothpastes have.</li>
            <li> I drink so much coffee</li>
            <li> that tells me that it really is removing any plaque buildup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am doing a trial of Chest Pro-Health HD thanks to Crest and bzzagent.  </li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try Crest ProHealth HD free recently...</li>
            <li> Since you can&#x27;t rinse after step one, it would make it easier since you tend to only have one hand free when brushing.</li>
            <li> Although I am not a coffee drinker, I do enjoy drinking tea, and I could always use extra whitening power.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro-Health HD for about three weeks thanks to a promotion from Crest.  </li>
            <li> and they really don&#x27;t work, but crest pro hd really works.</li>
            <li> applying Step Two to the brush, I learned to use caution when squeezing from the tube because the substance comes out from the tube much quicker and easier than with Step One.</li>
            <li> I absolutely feel like my mouth is healthier with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I absolutely feel like my mouth is healthier with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I tried the CrestPro Health HD Toothpaste from bzzagent.com and was surprised how fresh my mouth felt.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had much of a sensitivity to it either.</li>
            <li> I really felt like it was powering through the plaque, as well as remaining bits and pieces of dinner</li>
            <li> Plus, my gums and teeth are looking and feeling much healthier.</li>
            <li> Plus, my gums and teeth are looking and feeling much healthier.</li>
            <li> , I tried this product thanks to Crest.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser really feels like it&#x27;s getting work done</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the week was up, I took an &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; picture, and I could really notice a difference in my teeth&#x27;s whiteness.</li>
            <li> All in all, I really do think this product is working</li>
            <li> So while this is more expensive than regular toothpaste or even whitening toothpaste, it does last for quite a while and has excellent results.</li>
            <li> I am trying out the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste as part of a free trial from Crest.</li>
            <li> Stage two is very tasty.  </li>
            <li> I give it 3 out of 5 starts because I feel like the toothpaste really wanted to whiten my teeth</li>
            <li> That said, I do really like this product.  </li>
            <li> My mouth feels so much cleaner</li>
            <li> and my breath feels much fresher and stays that way for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> really start to develop.</li>
            <li> The second tube or step two polishes my teeth and leaves them feeling smooth and squeaky</li>
            <li> Step 2 is where the Pro Health HD really differentiates itself, though.</li>
            <li> however, it really works well.  </li>
            <li> Of all of the teeth whitening products I&#x27;ve used, this is absolutely the easiest.</li>
            <li> However, the real kicker for me is the taste of the product.  </li>
            <li> However, the real kicker for me is the taste of the product.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to @crest and bzzagent</li>
            <li> You can tell it is really cleansing.</li>
            <li> I really like how my teeth look whiter, but the taste is not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I saw results within the two week trail period which was promising.</li>
            <li> and I feel like my whole mouth became brighter.</li>
            <li> The dual toothpaste - one that is a purifying cleaner and another for buffing and whitening - really gets the job done well.  </li>
            <li> I gave it four out of five stars because I don&#x27;t think it really helped with morning breath and the freshness</li>
            <li> Crest was generous enough to give me the Crest Pro Health HD kit to try for free through a Bzz Agent campaign.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t really a product for me.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels healthier and looks much whiter than when I started using this over a week ago.</li>
            <li> My teeth really did look whiter after just one week.</li>
            <li> I found that it cleaned my teeth very well</li>
            <li> But thanks to BzzAgent when I got the invite for Crest HD campaign , I thought &#x27;what the heck</li>
            <li> and I will say that my teeth feel much cleaner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really exited to see what my teeth look after a week.  </li>
            <li> really don&#x27;t like the taste of &amp;#34;Step 2&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Not too much excitement or change.  </li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t take any longer and you can really feel the difference from a one step brushing.</li>
            <li> Received it as a sample from thanks to Crest and Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> There has been no negative impact on the cap, something I&#x27;ve always been a bit nervous about damaging, and the rest of the teeth have lightened up a bit, but not startlingly</li>
            <li> I really like this set.</li>
            <li> I really recommend getting this</li>
            <li> I received the Pro-Health HD daily system free from Crest</li>
            <li> I would highly recommended this product to friends &amp; family!</li>
            <li> and it really makes my mouth feel cleaner and</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> they work really well.  </li>
            <li> To start I really like the abrasiveness of the step 1 toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It really feels like you just went to the dentist.</li>
            <li> This two step process really works and you can see and feel the difference between the two.  </li>
            <li> really want to give this product 5 stars, but I can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Since that is the primary use of the toothpaste I will probably not purchase it and just stick with the regular Crest that I use since I also like the way that it makes my teeth feel.</li>
            <li> I received the Crest Pro-Health Daily Two-Step Toothpaste for free as part of being a Bzz Agent.  </li>
            <li> The Crest Pro Health HD really does whiten and get your teeth cleaner within one week.</li>
            <li> I was really geeked that I got to try this product for</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t think it would really work.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in the whitening of my teethe yet, but I have noticed it in my husbands teeth.  </li>
            <li> and over all I really like it.</li>
            <li> Plus it works FAST.</li>
            <li> Really works.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying more after these tubes are empty.</li>
            <li> While I did receive the the product free as a promotion from Crest, I would definitely recommend this product and purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of toothpastes, I don&#x27;t really have a go to brand</li>
            <li> After using the product for a couple weeks, I don&#x27;t really see any difference in the whiteness.</li>
            <li> Overall, I do enjoy the Crest Pro-Health HD.</li>
            <li> and  I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I was already using a whitening toothpaste (Arm&amp;Hammer Advanced White), so this could be why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I am not in a rush while getting ready, I don&#x27;t mind using the two step system</li>
            <li> step 1 works really really well.</li>
            <li> I got to try this for free through BzzAgent and Crest, but definitely plan to continue to purchase it for myself.</li>
            <li> My whole mouth feels healthier.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the taste and texture of both pastes, I&#x27;m big on texture!</li>
            <li> My mom asked me about the product and wants to try it.</li>
            <li> I really like this system.</li>
            <li> and it really bothers her.</li>
            <li> After the first day I could tell my teeth were cleaner than normal.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t take any longer and you can really feel the difference from a one step.</li>
            <li> My teeth are much whiter than they have ever been.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t whiten as fast as the strips or trays do.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that I really do like it.  </li>
            <li> I really does make teeth whiter</li>
            <li> so if that&#x27;s important to you, and you&#x27;re dedicated, and use it all the time, you WILL see a big difference!!</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health HD worked so fast</li>
            <li> I had used whitening toothpastes before without much difference</li>
            <li> and I really did not want to keep brushing for two minutes</li>
            <li> I was really wanting to like this product, truly I was.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste really works.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I really suggest you go out and try it.  </li>
            <li> My teeth felt smooth (similar to the feeling you get from a dental cleaning).</li>
            <li> After trying this product for free from Crest through BzzAgent, I would definitely buy this product again!</li>
            <li> I  got to try Crest Pro- Health HD Daily for free, this was part of a promotion from the brand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> must say that this toothpaste is absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> She is very diligent about brushing for 2 minutes, so the Crest Pro Health HD is the reason for a non-slimy mouth.</li>
            <li> Had a check up today and my dentist was very pleased, as I have had gum and plaque issues in the past.</li>
            <li> Received the Crest Pro-Healthy HD daily two-step as a promo from Crest for free.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really just 1.  </li>
            <li> Too much time?  </li>
            <li> has really worked for me.</li>
            <li> Everyone notices my smile and people ask me if I had my teeth professionally whitened.</li>
            <li> feels grainy so it really feels like I&#x27;m cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I trust Crest Products, I received a package of Crest Pro Health® HD™ Daily Two-Step Toothpaste to try for FREE from Crest and BzzAgent.com.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise I really like using Crest Pro Health HD Toothpaste.</li>
            <li> views are real though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I drink coffee and tea, eat red meat and enjoy saucy foods</li>
            <li> I really like the feeling the toothpaste</li>
            <li> leaves.best way to whiten your teeth if you really desire that.  </li>
            <li> I really like the feeling the toothpaste leaves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Really ??</li>
            <li> I was glad I carefully read them before using the product as you don&#x27;t rinse between using the tubes.</li>
            <li> the whole hygiene routine will take about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> That much burned by tongue and gums.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are so much brighter and whiter since using Crest Pro-Heath and getting compliments.</li>
            <li> The idea behind it is great</li>
            <li> BUT the texture of these two gels really dries out my mouth</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much in the whitening aspect, but hope to over time.  </li>
            <li> I thought that this dual system would take up too much time</li>
            <li> very refreshed!&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth look and feel so much</li>
            <li> My husband also wants to try it out.</li>
            <li> It was much whiter</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The whole day after you brush makes you feel like you just got your teeth cleaned.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li> and I can definitely tell a difference in how smooth and polished my teeth are after a week of using this product.  </li>
            <li> As a working mom with my three youngest being 8, 3 and 18 months, my mornings are very hectic</li>
            <li> Who wants to fiddle with whitening strips and trays, when life could be so much simpler.  </li>
            <li> Who wants to fiddle with whitening strips and trays, when life could be so much simpler.  </li>
            <li> so I can see how much whiter my teeth can get.</li>
            <li> This one though, I really like.</li>
            <li> so I trusted the brand, but I really didn&#x27;t expect to see results</li>
            <li> (Yes, I don&#x27;t get out much)</li>
            <li> 12-14 hours which is really a plus.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> Noticed results fast.</li>
            <li> - Purifying Cleanser (light blue paste) cleans and removes plaque.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Works very well with electric brushes with timers</li>
            <li> The second thing I really enjoy is that you brush with Step 1 for 1 minute and then Step 2 for 1 minute also.</li>
            <li> It breaks up the monotony of brushing for 2 straight minutes with one toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> What I found out by using this product is that it really didn&#x27;t take much time.  </li>
            <li> I really like the taste</li>
            <li> I was just getting ready to try a whitening kit I purchased online from a dentist.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much simpler and faster than the gel bleach.  </li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste as a free sample to try.</li>
            <li> First you use the purifying cleanser, which basically tastes like normal toothpaste, after one minute of brushing you spit but DONT rinse, and then you start brushing with the perfecting Gel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a free sample and started using this about 2 weeks ago and instantly noticed that my teeth felt cleaner.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really have much to compare, but I&#x27;m happier with how my teeth look.</li>
            <li> and my teeth were really stained.</li>
            <li> I found I really like this system.  </li>
            <li> After using my free Crest Pro Health HD as part of a promotion for a week, I have mixed feelings.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much whitening</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much from Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Process when I received it from Crest to try for free.</li>
            <li> I received the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste for free from BzzAgent to try and review.</li>
            <li> Thanks to bzzagent.com</li>
            <li> I was curious to see how brushing for two minutes with two different pastes could be more effective than brushing for two minutes with my regular paste, but I was amazed by the difference!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel like they have just been polished, and after 1 week, they look so much brighter!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I did this treatment, but it&#x27;s for real.</li>
            <li> You can spit but do not rinse, I had to stop myself with the rinse part and go straight to part two.</li>
            <li> It is VERY VEERY hydrogen peroxide tasting.  </li>
            <li> but I will continue to use to see if the claims are real.</li>
            <li> So I was very nervous that it would stain my teeth.</li>
            <li> My whole mouth just felt cleaner, fresher.  </li>
            <li> I tried the crest strips, thinking that wouldn&#x27;t be so much hassle than whitening trays.</li>
            <li> No sweets since I don&#x27;t like sugar that much.</li>
            <li> really didn&#x27;t see any changes on the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li> The only reason that I did not give 5 stars is because of the cost, (though I got mine as a free trial, the price would discourage me from purchasing.)</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve put up with the taste though because I really like the results.</li>
            <li> Step 1 really grinds away the guck and plaque without damaging the enamel.</li>
            <li> but once I saw it in the store; I realized it is very pricey.  </li>
            <li> Who wants to brush their teeth twice in one cleaning while switching products?</li>
            <li> I was very dissappointed.</li>
            <li> I recently tried out the Crest Pro Health HD system for free through Crest for the purpose of my review.  </li>
            <li> is it seems to really work.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest</li>
            <li> Very noticeable change in color...</li>
            <li> My teeth are so much whiter now.</li>
            <li> My mouth has never felt fresher, my teeth are only this shiny and smooth after a dental cleaning...</li>
            <li> But I also didn&#x27;t notice any whitening effects, which defeats the whole purpose.</li>
            <li> and I felt like it really got my teeth cleaned.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend giving this system a try!</li>
            <li> I then immediately brush with the second tube for 1 minute which contains a translucent colorless smooth gel with the consistency of hair conditioner.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, it is very cumbersome to use if you use a electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I receive  Crest Pro Health HD for free from Crest to evaluate and have used it for two weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed any change in how white my teeth are.</li>
            <li> so i can&#x27;t really comment on if my mouth is 6x healthier, but I am hoping that it is.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in the whitening, which was what I was really looking for.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li> I like the fact it will be much cheaper than the dentist office whitening.</li>
            <li> I see a very silght difference in my teeth color.</li>
            <li> I have been using the system now for about 2 weeks and my teeth look much brighter</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I can also say that the whole thing is a bit of a process.</li>
            <li> Also, step 2 really tastes just like your brushing with gel hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product whitens teeth very well.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this from #BzzAgent and tried it for 3 weeks brushing twice a day following packaged instructions.  </li>
            <li> Thanks crest for letting me try it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference with that</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> my much everything I ate.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy the 2 different pastes.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to sample Crest Pro-health HD Daily for free thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day for two weeks straight.</li>
            <li> The two step process really cleans your teeth</li>
            <li> That aspect of the product really does work.</li>
            <li> I gave it four out of five stars because I don&#x27;t think it really helped with morning breath and the freshness</li>
            <li> the results where real.  </li>
            <li> But the primary advantage I feel of this is the the extra plaque removal and gingivitis protection.  </li>
            <li> I received the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste to try for free compliments of Crest (and my being a Bzz agent).  </li>
            <li> I really like the taste of this product.</li>
            <li> But in reality, it really wasn&#x27;t that much of a hassle.</li>
            <li> The perfecting gel used in step 2 doesn&#x27;t really seem to have a flavor to it (unless it&#x27;s masked by the mint of step 1 which isn&#x27;t rinsed out before you use step 2).</li>
            <li> I am really liking the results.</li>
            <li> However, I haven&#x27;t really seen a difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I got this product called Crest Pro-health HD Daily Two Step Toothpaste to try it for free through a Marketing Company.</li>
            <li> and it is very runny</li>
            <li> and it is very runny</li>
            <li> But the effort seems to be working and looks to be worth it so far.  </li>
            <li> I really like that the whitening gel is hydrogen peroxide based.</li>
            <li> but my mouth feels much cleaner and healthier after using it.</li>
            <li> I really noticed that this product eliminates plaque build-up.  </li>
            <li> retail cost for this product is around $13.00, which seems a bit much for toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very benign in my view</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very picky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did overall make my mouth feel and look healthier and my teeth felt smooth and polished.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep using it to see how much whiter my teeth get.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as much work as wearing the strips and waiting around for those to work then removing them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend​ this system to anyone who cares about their teeth health and looking for some pearly whites in the process!</li>
            <li> In the morning rush when I need to get out of the door FAST?</li>
            <li> I actually received this product for FREE through BzzAgent.com as part of a promotion.</li>
            <li> Maybe I hadn&#x27;t drank as much coffee that day?</li>
            <li> My teeth were absolutely whiter and my gums looked a lot healthier.</li>
            <li> Truthfully, I noticed minimal difference after using it for three weeks ...</li>
            <li> and I can really tell a difference.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t overpowering like a lot of really minty toothpastes and didn&#x27;t burn.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that my teeth were  much brighter in about four days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m really picky about my toothpaste - taste, feel, flavor in my mouth after brushing, etc.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very fond of the Wintergreen but has grown on me a bit.  </li>
            <li> although, only if it is on sale or I have a coupon available.  </li>
            <li> The retail price is just too much for toothpaste.</li>
            <li> There is really something to this two step deal.  </li>
            <li> I really wish it had been one step.  </li>
            <li> I really do recommend this toothpaste if you can get your hands on it.</li>
            <li> My teeth were much whiter.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see it making much difference.</li>
            <li> I started doing both steps without even really having to think about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, I did not fall in love with this product as I expected.  </li>
            <li> The whole process of using two toothpastes really did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> I would say 6x whiter is no joke it really worked for me</li>
            <li> Thanks, Crest and BzzAgent for giving me the opportunity to try and review this product.</li>
            <li> Again we didn&#x27;t experience it much</li>
            <li> While I received the toothpaste for free as I mentioned above, the toothpaste is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> Plus, it is so much easier than trays, strips, or brush on whitening products.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t eat or drink anything for an hour because it heightened my sensitivity so much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really need to spit in between the two steps like the directions</li>
            <li> When I saw the opportunity to try this out thanks to BzzAgent, I couldn&#x27;t wait.</li>
            <li> I liked that this also allowed me to have white teeth without having to use white strips which often times</li>
            <li> I saw some reviews where people complained about the way it felt in their mouth or tasted, but I really felt like it did a good job cleaning and didn&#x27;t have any issues with the texture or taste.</li>
            <li> I pretty much replaced my normal toothpaste with this</li>
            <li> I would most likely continue to use the product alternating between this and a sensitive tooth paste.</li>
            <li> The second  step toothpaste is the hydrogen peroxide toothpaste which is more of a clear gel.  </li>
            <li> A full minute with whitening gel isn;t going to happen, I barely make 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> and then you add the 2nd step (the clear gel) and continue brushing for 1 more minute.</li>
            <li> and then you add the 2nd step (the clear gel) and continue brushing for 1 more minute.</li>
            <li> It does definitely make your teeth whiter, however I have noticed my teeth/gums are a bit more sensitive since using it.</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older my teeth have become super sensitive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it now for 4 weeks total and my teeth are still looking nice and white!</li>
            <li> saw whitening improvement after about a week, and my hypersensitive teeth have not become any more sensitive, even after a month of using this product daily.</li>
            <li> I was using crest complete extra whitening +scope for more than a year now, n</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of Crest ProHealth 3D, and I am surprised how much I like it so far.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste provides the effective whitening agents without the harsh side effects on my mouth.</li>
            <li> I liked the packaging of the product, especially that each tube was colored differently</li>
            <li> But, after using it for a few weeks now, I can honestly say that my skepticism has been set aside.  </li>
            <li> But this particular product is sooooo easy to use and my teeth felt like I just left the dentist.  </li>
            <li> I love it so far for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> nice thing is it only takes two minutes for the entire &amp;#34;system&amp;#34; of cleaning and whitening your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have replaced my current toothpaste with the Crest Pro Health HD set for several weeks now, and I must say the step one toothpaste is quite nice.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would purchase with my own money but only on sale or with a coupon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on this for several weeks and so far i have seen notable brightness in my teeth.</li>
            <li> I liked it far better than the 3D Vivid White toothpastes and other whitening products I&#x27;ve used over the years.  </li>
            <li> My mouth feels so fresh after brushing and still feels fresh the next morning.  </li>
            <li> that it is something I can use daily and my teeth are not even more sensitive like with some whitening methods.</li>
            <li> I also feel like it is a good toothpaste for sensitive teeth; it isn&#x27;t harsh at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The taste is good and I like the foaminess of step one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downsides: My gums might be sensitive, but I feel like the product is a bit harsh.</li>
            <li> so while willing to try a new kind, I was also a little reluctant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Normally, I don&#x27;t pay this much for toothpaste, so if it wasn&#x27;t going to work for me, I wouldn&#x27;t want to plunk down that kind of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product as it helps the teeth with fluoride, gums with anti gingivitis, and your smile with the quick white teeth/</li>
            <li> At first, I noticed actually more irritation and bleeding to my gums - but quickly learned it was because I was brushing too hard with it.</li>
            <li> It works better than any other at home whitening paste I have tried and I will certainly be continuing to use it.</li>
            <li> My teeth look amazing, and I still have half tubes of each step!  </li>
            <li> I have been using Crest products for a long time but this product is really a new innovative way of cleaning and whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> This product though is WOW!!!  </li>
            <li> I want to see if is worth taking the extra time for the two steps brushing and the price, as of right now I will give the product a three....to be continue</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m left with a very fresh, minty mouth afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using this toothpaste daily leaves a very fresh taste in the mouth.</li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey but at the same time last longer and worth the extra for a better clean mouth.</li>
            <li> What I found was a system that was surprisingly easy to use, just brush your teeth as normal, then follow up with the gel for another minute, simple as that.</li>
            <li> The flavor is pretty mild on step 1 and definitely freshens on step 2.  </li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t care for adding an extra step during my brushing routine but, because this program requires it for the desired results, I quickly became accustomed to it.</li>
            <li> Today, I wore a bold color of lipstick and for the first time in years I wasn&#x27;t self-conscious about it because it didn&#x27;t make my teeth look yellow.</li>
            <li> and I was very excited to try Crest Pro Health HD and was curious to know if this tag-team option would work for me.</li>
            <li> was really nervous about this whole 2 step process, but I actually love it, and you can&#x27;t just do one step or the other.</li>
            <li> And as I&#x27;ve kept using Crest Pro Health HD, my teeth have continued to look as good, if not better!</li>
            <li> /&gt;#Sponsored #GotItFree #BzzAgentinued to look as good, if not better!</li>
            <li> I was initially unsure about the 2-step process but it&#x27;s super easy and really doesn&#x27;t take that much extra time.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t tell anyone that I was using something new</li>
            <li> When I first heard Crest was coming out with something new and revolutionary</li>
            <li> I am always willing to try new things to get my teeth whiter.  </li>
            <li> From the first time I used the new toothpaste, me teeth had never felt cleaner.</li>
            <li> BUT... the new Crest HD 2-step definitely gave me a new healthy habit.</li>
            <li> After being an avid Crest toothpaste user since my childhood, and hearing there was a new 2-part system for cleaning your teeth that would make them whiter and healthier, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this was just my mouth getting used to a new toothpaste, but after a month or so of using it, my mouth still tends to feel cleaner than it did before using this.</li>
            <li> This feels more seamless and more subtle.</li>
            <li> it is easy to figure how long we had been brushing.</li>
            <li> It made my mouth feel clean, made my teeth f eel fresh and white and did not leave my teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews mentioned the additional brushing step, but I did not mind the extra minute spent keeping my teeth and mouth healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> The two part system is much easier than whitening strips and works better and faster than any other whitening toothpaste that I have tried.</li>
            <li> My teeth have definitely been staying nice and white, and it really doesn&#x27;t take me much longer to brush my teeth using this over my normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The flavor on this toothpaste isn&#x27;t as sweet as other Crest toothpastes, but now that I&#x27;m used to it, those taste TOO sweet.  </li>
            <li> It consisted of a two step process that was super easy and no different than the daily process of brushing your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely picky about my teeth, and would not recommend a product that didn&#x27;t leave my teeth feeling super clean.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are significantly whiter, the filling matches my natural teeth, and they never became sensitive.</li>

            <li> By the end of the first week, I saw a very marked difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The whole point of using this kind of product is to start seeing results, but unfortunately if not used on a daily basis I do not think whiter teeth are to be expected.</li>
            <li> The front of the package said I’d experience a healthier mouth; reducing gingivitis 6 times more than regular toothpaste and much whiter teeth; 6 times more than ordinary toothpaste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The whole point of using this kind of product is to start seeing results, but unfortunately if not used on a daily basis I do not think whiter teeth are to be expected.</li>
            <li> The first two days were torture, as my gums were very sensitive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much like regular toothpaste, leaving my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel really clean, but I do not see any whitening action so far.</li>
            <li> After a week of use I haven&#x27;t noticed any real whitening of my teeth, but they do feel really clean - even the back of my front, lower teeth which are the plaque catches in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Overall I really like how clean my teeth feel after using this.</li>
            <li> Finishing off with a much needed rinse, this product left my teeth feeling literally squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> I really like how clean my mouth feels for HOURS after using this product, especially if I use it at night!</li>
            <li> It leaves my teeth feeling dentist clean, and the feeling lasts so much longer than regular toothpaste!</li>
            <li> So much so that I sometimes drop the flossing from my routine on certain nights when I am normally a floss</li>
            <li> The two steps, although a different way to brush, are very easy -- just a minute for each -- especially if have an electric toothbrush which already has timer.  </li>
            <li> Step 1 is pretty much like normal toothpaste and is very nice and minty tasting, but does leave my mouth feeling a little dry.</li>
            <li> and you will instantly have a brighter smile!</li>
            <li> 2 minutes of brushing my teeth has whitened better than any other toothpaste I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Much better than using strips or other whitening products.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product if you are looking for a brighter and whiter smile!</li>
            <li> The directions were simple and straightforward.</li>
            <li> Overall I am pretty satisfied with the product, and would recommend it to anyone who wanted a toothpaste that actually whitens!!</li>
            <li> For me other whitening methods work much better.</li>
            <li> As a Bzz Agent, I was excited to try the toothpaste as I have been using Crest Whitestrips for several years.  </li>
            <li> It was a bit different at first with two steps, but it turns out that they are worth it as the product preformed very well.</li>
            <li> It is easier than strips or other forms of whitening methods and more cost efficient.  </li>
            <li> and I definitely was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited about using this product but after the fourth use I noticed some yellow-brownish stains on a couple of teeth.  </li>
            <li> spit, and then rinsed my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed this regimen for 1 week, and really liked the results I achieved with so little effort and variation from my normal routine.  </li>
            <li> The smell and taste were fresh but not overpowering and the two-step process really didn&#x27;t take any more time than my usual brushing routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a regular Crest customer, so when the company asked me to try and review Crest Pro Health HD, I was so excited.</li>
            <li> I can definitely notice a whiter and brighter smile!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the fence about whether or not I&#x27;ll continue using it regularly or just as a spot-use here and there, but it is definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li> I do agree with other reviewer that I wish the step 2 tube will be better if the lid is flip instead of screw.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a whiter smile!</li>
            <li> All I have to do is brush my teeth like a normally do with one additional step and my teeth will be whiter!  </li>
            <li> I have used other over the counter whitening systems with much better results.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to receive the Crest Pro-Health Daily Two-Step Toothpaste from Bzz Agent to try and review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using it a few days I noticed I had developed a healthy brushing routine (brushing the full 2 minutes), and I was looking forward to brushing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten him many other teeth whiteners</li>
            <li> I was floored after only 3 times I saw and significant change in color</li>
            <li> Most of this is due to the 2 minutes required to brush for the Crest Pro-Health HD Toothpaste kit to work.  </li>
            <li> like I normally do and wait to be blinded by my pearlies in just one week!</li>
            <li> but I will say that it doesn&#x27;t hurt to use (which I find many other whitening products do) and</li>
            <li> /&gt;After two weeks of use, I definitely see an improvement in the whiteness of my smile!</li>
            <li> Best of all, there&#x27;s no sensitivity like I experience with other extreme whitening products - no white spots on gums, no tooth pain, etc.  </li>
            <li> When I initially received this package from BzzAgent, I was excited to try it out because I&#x27;d never tried a two step system before.</li>
            <li> This would not be a big deal if I found that it significantly whitened my teeth</li>
            <li> At first I was hesitant of having to do a two step process, but it only takes two minutes and is not any more time consuming than a regular one step process.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this toothpaste to see if I could help eliminate some of the yellowing and maybe brighten my teeth overall.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product, but will try to stick to every other day to avoid any more sores.</li>
            <li> I was thinking - this looks like more work and will probably make my teeth hurt like of the other products out there on the market.  </li>
            <li> Due to the cost of the product I would like see if there is another product which would give me get better teeth whitening results.</li>
            <li> but I did not see any significant changes in the whiteness of my teeth after several weeks.</li>
            <li> I also enjoyed the sharp mint taste.</li>
            <li> so you can store the tubes back in the original case if you choose.</li>
            <li> My teeth actually still feel fresh at the end of the day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to keep using it and see how white they get!</li>
            <li> Nevertheless I&#x27;m going to continue to use it - it&#x27;s supposed to have many other benefits.  </li>
            <li> Sodium fluoride is the ingredient found in most other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> &amp; Details:&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to write a report after the first day; therefore I waited more than a week in order to write my comments to see if in fact there are any changes.&lt;br /&gt;During 8 days I ate different types of foods that included: Meat (read &amp; white), vegetables, fruits, grains, dairy &amp; coffee.</li>
            <li> the other one, the whitening gel comes in a screw top cap.</li>
            <li> I agree with what many others are saying about the &amp;#34;fresh from the dentist feeling.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve noticed this feeling lasts all through the day and even after eating, which isn&#x27;t something I could say about any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
            <li> When I finish the routine my teeth feel cleaner than they do with most other toothpastes and I can see the whitening occurring over continual use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think it would be a big deal, but when I actually tried to watch the clock to be sure I used each tube for a minute</li>
            <li> After I use it, my teeth feel cleaner for many hours longer than other brands of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I did.&lt;br /&gt;I am a Crest Pro-Health HD convert, see my white smile!</li>
            <li> This product is definitely one worth trying!</li>
            <li> The first step of the paste tastes like a regular mint toothpaste and the second step is more of a peroxide taste- keep it off of your tongue and on your teeth</li>
            <li> After almost two weeks there was a significant difference and by brushing essentially twice each time, I brush longer and my gums seem healthier too!</li>
            <li> The two-step process is really not a big deal to me and SO worth it!  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t speak to the whitening power of this toothpaste system, which it make work much better than other toothpastes out there.</li>
            <li> I was excited to open it and start this trial.</li>
            <li> a bit different to get used to but &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; is it worth it!  </li>
            <li> Overall, though, I think that for the price and the fact that I don&#x27;t really need to whiten my teeth on a daily basis, I will continue to use the original Crest Pro Health that I was using before I tried their new HD product, but I really appreciate being given this to try out for free from BzzAgent and Crest.</li>
            <li> I certainly would buy it again and highly recommend it to others in giving it a try.</li>
            <li> I am a BZZ agent and thanks to Crest, I was lucky enough to be one who got the entire Crest HD system for free.</li>
            <li> teeth do feel very clean and look as white as they did previously if not a bit whiter.</li>
            <li> the withening toothpaste its pretty nice flavor... not to hard on</li>
            <li> I am very selective about the toothpastes and other oral products I purchase so, although I was willing to try this, I certainly wouldn&#x27;t be repurchasing if it wasn&#x27;t superior to the other products I use.</li>
            <li> mouth feels fresh and clean much longer than with any other toothpaste I have used before.  </li>
            <li> I drink a lot of tea and have some stains on my teeth from it, but thanks to this new product, those stains are gone!  </li>
            <li> The second tube cuts the wintergreen taste almost immediately, so that helped, and the fresh feeling it left lingered after finally being able to rinse!</li>
            <li> It whitens so much faster than other toothpastes and leaves your mouth feeling very clean.  </li>
            <li> It actually felt post dental cleaning but not sore clean.</li>
            <li> It actually keeps your mouth clean</li>
            <li> But Crest Pro Health HD is the first toothpaste I have used that actually made a difference in the brightness of my smile.  </li>
            <li> Step 1  left my teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> This dual system makes for an extra clean teeth brushing experience.</li>
            <li> I also forgot to brush my teeth 1 morning before work and my mouth and teeth stayed looking and feeling extremely clean all day until I brushed that night!  </li>
            <li> You mouth does indeed feel clean once you&#x27;ve used the product, but I get the same clean feething when using Theives essential oils</li>
            <li> but I would prefer to go back to my normal chemical free cleanse.</li>
            <li> , I noticed both extra clean teeth</li>
            <li> Despite it&#x27;s significantly higher cost, I will be purchasing it in the future, as it is worth the investment.</li>
            <li> My teeth actually felt cleaner - you know, that feeling you get when you leave the dentist, where your teeth are squeaky clean?</li>
            <li> But I did like the extra clean</li>
            <li> The clean feeling seems to last longer with this toothpaste than with others and I feel like my teeth do look whiter, although no one has commented on it yet.</li>
            <li> my teeth feel as clean as if I just brushed them or just came from the dentist office.  </li>
            <li> , my teeth felt really clean and people always ask what I do to keep my teeth white.</li>
            <li> The second step tastes a smidge salty, but makes your teeth feel really clean (like after going to the hygenist) -</li>
            <li> It left my mouth feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> , how clean my teeth feel afterwards, and the overall feel.  </li>
            <li> My teeth felt clean like I&#x27;d just left the dentist office.</li>
            <li> -- it&#x27;s definitely a dentist clean feeling.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt really clean when I was done, like just coming back from the dentist.</li>
            <li> It makes my teeth feel really clean and definitely whitens them.  </li>
            <li> It makes them feel extra clean and polished.</li>
            <li> White strips would definitely give better results if your only goal is whiter teeth, however if you just want a healthier-looking smile and fresh breath</li>
            <li> and you entire mouth feels clean all day.</li>
            <li> With the paste and gel I feel like I am getting my entire mouth clean.</li>
            <li> I do like how clean my teeth felt, but I can&#x27;t say I saw any big difference in whitening.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of the paste the dentist uses to clean your teeth and your mouth feels very similar to that after step 1.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced similar problems in the past with whitening strips, so I would say that if you&#x27;ve also had problems with whitening products that this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> and once I was finished, my teeth/mouth had that &#x27;just left the dentist&#x27; clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> but it did feel extra clean.</li>
            <li> Especially the fresh feeling you get after the first use.</li>
            <li> only thing that kept me from giving this the full 5 stars is that I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference with whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, like with most whitening strips, the first few times I used it</li>
            <li> In fact, as I&#x27;m writing this, it&#x27;s been 9 hours and 2 meals since I brushed this morning, and my teeth still feel clean.  </li>
            <li> like the flavor of both and definitely leaves my mouth (and teeth) feeling clean and refreshed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it makes my teeth  feel clean and does help whiten even after only a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> My teeth definitely felt squeaky clean, the way they do when you leave the dental office after a cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> The second step, the Perfecting gel, had the whitening power that felt clean on my gums.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re interested as my teeth were whiter after only a week of using.</li>
            <li> By the third day my teeth felt as clean as when I get done at the dentist office.</li>
            <li> It was easy brushing with both, only adds a minute to brushing and if it actually whitens it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> The next morning my mouth still felt clean.  </li>
            <li> Not only does this product clean my teeth like that of a dentist cleaning</li>
            <li> When I used my regular toothpaste my mouth didn&#x27;t feel clean at all</li>
            <li> At first I thought of it as a free product I would use with not much intention of buying b/c</li>
            <li> all this said, if you are looking for extra clean feeling mouth, this is your product.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m unsure if it would give the same clean feeling that I receive with my sonicare.</li>
            <li> I keep using it and definitely see my teeth getting whiter while leaving them sparkling clean.</li>
            <li> the Sonicare diamond clean system to help improve my chances of being in and out as quickly as possible.</li>
            <li> and I feel like I am getting my mouth extra clean from the double-brushing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in how clean my teeth feel, a reduction in gross morning breath, and whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> mouth did feel clean, but I did not like the aftertaste or the sensation left by the bleaching agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Step one is a simple 1 minute brush to clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li> However, I feel Crest Pro Health HD had a bigger impact on the clean feeling than additional brushing</li>
            <li> The one thing I immediately noticed was that my teeth didn&#x27;t have the same clean feeling.</li>
            <li> For anyone looking for a simple system to clean and whiten your teeth, I would recommend this.  </li>
            <li> The first step is a fresh tasting white paste that foams up a bit.  </li>
            <li> the same clean you feel after leaving the dentist office.</li>
            <li> Simple process and made my teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> and I woke with a clean feeling mouth the next morning.  </li>
            <li> This left my mouth feeling incredibly clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean for the entire day.</li>
            <li> My teeth as clean as if I just got back from the dentist.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean and look whiter after only a week of using the product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks now and it has made my mouth feel clean and have eliminated my need for white strips 1-2 per week.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to use my regular toothpaste after using this one to get that clean minty feeling.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean and do look white.</li>
            <li> Step one gets rid of plaque, tartar and gives me that &#x27;clean enough to sweep my tongue over my teeth&#x27; kinda feeling!</li>
            <li> Step 1 a traditional toothpaste to clean your teeth to be used for one minute.</li>
            <li> it did its duty keeping my entire mouth clean.</li>
            <li> You really do not spend any more time doing this then you would normally to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> My mouth did feel clean, but I did not like the aftertaste or the sensation left by the bleaching agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so not only do I have clean teeth, they&#x27;re whiter.</li>
            <li> My mouth/teeth feel extra clean after using it.</li>
            <li> The purifying cleanser step definitely gave my mouth a squeaky clean feel that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I could feel the difference in my teeth on how clean and white they were.</li>
            <li> After using the toothpaste for about a week, I was very pleasently surprised with the noticeable difference in my tooth color, much whiter!</li>
            <li> 2 Steps, 1 minute each step - white and clean, polished feeling teeth.</li>
            <li> Anything you missed in step one is annihilated, and the peroxide reacts with the baking soda to deep clean and polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anything you missed in step one is annihilated, and the peroxide reacts with the baking soda to deep clean and polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth didn&#x27;t feel as clean as they do with my regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I ended up using both this system and my regular toothpaste to ensure my teeth were totally clean</li>
            <li> That clean feeling lasts the entire day.</li>
            <li> one left my teeth squeaky clean, and step two caused some sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this toothpaste to anyone who is serious about taking good care of their teeth.</li>
            <li> but this is subtle which I loved.  </li>
            <li> I was a skeptic at first since this was a two step system thinking it was going to take more time than I wanted to add to my routing but realized it actually didn&#x27;t take much time at all to not only protect your teeth the way you normally wood with toothpaste but to also whiten with the gel.  </li>
            <li> First, you brush with what is basically a &amp;#34;cleanser,&amp;#34; and then without rinsing, you brush with a &amp;#34;whitener.&amp;#34; I am not a huge fan of the Crest &amp;#34;flavor.&amp;#34; This product has an okay flavor....</li>
            <li> I am not a huge mint person, it actually makes me stomach churn when I smell it, so it&#x27;s nice for a toothpaste to have a change in taste and flavor!</li>
            <li> Overall I am pretty satisfied with the product, and would recommend it to anyone who wanted a toothpaste that actually does a decent job whitening.</li>
            <li> Overall I am pretty satisfied with the product, and would recommend it to anyone who wanted a toothpaste that actually does a decent job whitening.</li>
            <li> Overall I am pretty satisfied with the product, and would recommend it to anyone who wanted a toothpaste that actually does a decent job whitening.</li>
            <li> In addition to the clean feeling I get from Step 1 and the polished feeling I get from Step 2 (which pretty much lasts throughout the day), I&#x27;ve noticed that my breath is indeed fresher (especially in the morning - I am no longer self conscious about lingering morning breath).</li>
            <li> But it is also a moderate to mild flavor that certainly wasn&#x27;t a deal</li>
            <li> Initially my gums were very sensitive after using it however since I lightened up on the pressure when brushing it&#x27;s been fine.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this system to anyone who wants clean white teeth.</li>
            <li> This is such a simple and easy way to whiten and brush your teeth at once!</li>
            <li> It did not leave me breath like ninja kickin&#x27; clean and fresh like other crest toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long-term Crest user and enjoy the Crest Pro-Health brand, but truthfully, I could not see the point of buying what was probably just a more expensive product in the brand to do the same thing.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it and hope it helps you as much it has helped me.</li>
            <li> The first step gets my teeth clean, and the second step (the whitening) is far easier and quicker than either strips or trays.</li>
            <li> I got the new Crest Pro Health HD daily two-step system free from Bzzagent as a part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> and I do feel that the second gel tub adds a special layer of protection</li>
            <li> This is the most effective whitening toothpaste that I&#x27;ve tried before, and in just a little over a week, my teeth are a few shades lighter.</li>
            <li> I found that I spent more time brushing my teeth due to the two steps, which is not a bad thing!</li>
            <li> It left a kind of dry chalky feeling in your mouth.</li>
            <li> It does give an odd sensation while using the product that I was not used to, but overall the product is good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not great, but I don&#x27;t really expect toothpaste or teeth whiteners to have a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li> While not cheap per se compared to plain toothpaste this is definitely superb and well worth the extra cost for cleaner brighter smiles.</li>
            <li> By the time I went back to get the other half of my mouth cleaned, the hygienist was really impressed with &amp;#</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming &amp;#34;medicine-y/peroxide&amp;#34; taste, but it also isn&#x27;t as refreshing as other toothpastes I typically use.  </li>
            <li> I saw a commercial for Crest Pro Health HD Toothpaste recently and was super excited when I received the product as part of a promotion to try and then review it.  </li>
            <li> Considering other whitening products require much more than 1-2 minutes to complete, it is pretty ingenious of Crest to just sneak it into a slightly longer brushing</li>
            <li> The whitening gel is pretty potent (most are) and for those of us with hard enamel and sensitive gums, twice a day really isn&#x27;t possible, aminly because they want you to brush a full minute with each tube, 2 minutes total.</li>
            <li> The step 1 cleanser leaves a great refreshing taste and eliminates bad breath completely.</li>
            <li> The tubes are clearly labeled so there is no concern about mixing up which tube goes first and two minutes is the recommended brushing time.</li>
            <li> Also Step 2 had a strange taste to it that I didn&#x27;t enjoy.</li>
            <li> I was also initially worried about the two step process required with this toothpaste and wether or not that would fit into my morning routine as a busy working mom!  </li>
            <li> It is clearly labeled on the tube so there is no need to need to remember which tube to use first.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The primary innovation of this toothpaste seems to be that, as it has two steps, it causes me to brush for twice as long as I otherwise would.</li>
            <li> ,  now the meh:&lt;br /&gt;I experienced some tooth sensitivity to hot and cold the first week of use&lt;</li>
            <li> But my gums can get pretty sensitive.</li>
            <li> The product did not make my teeth sensitive nad did not have a funny taste.</li>
            <li> Sometimes a full two minutes of teeth brushing is not possible!</li>
            <li> It is not a miracle cure, but it is better than your average whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The second tube lists full ingredients of Water, Glycerin, Hydrogen Peroxide, Carbomer, Disodium Pryophosphate, Flavor, Sucralose, Sodium Hydroxide.  </li>
            <li> So I took a full day off and used my regular toothpaste and the sensitivity went away.</li>
            <li> The first step cleans your teeth and removes old plaque.</li>
            <li> However, after using it for the first time yesterday, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I would have done the same if I had paid full price for it.  </li>
            <li> I say on and off because I have pretty sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> i first received it, i was surprised on having two tubes, i couldn&#x27;t understand, why this couldn&#x27;t be one tube.</li>
            <li> The second step toothpaste doesn&#x27;t really have any flavor to it at all, and therefore you don&#x27;t really get that fresh minty feeling when you are all finished with the brushing process.  </li>
            <li> These teeth have to last me my whole life and to keep them healthy and white is what matters to me, and this is stuff is the bomb.  </li>
            <li> Before trying the Crest Pro Health HD; my teeth were quite yellow to the point I didn&#x27;t really like to smile that much.</li>
            <li> I normally wouldn&#x27;t spend this much on toothpaste</li>
            <li> I like how it gets me to actually brush my teeth for a full two minutes since I am paying attention to the two steps</li>
            <li> you get a full money back guarantee if you do not like it.</li>
            <li> The reason I didn&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars is that if I brushed for 2 minutes using ANY toothpaste, my teeth would be cleaner, my breath fresher.  </li>
            <li> I am definite going to continue using this system, as I finally found a way to whiten my smile and keep my mouth comfortable.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, the taste and texture completely turned me off.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Crest Pro Health® HD™ for one full week, twice a day, following the instructions.</li>
            <li> There is a big baking soda after taste that I feel is left if you don&#x27;t do a good job rinsing your mouth, however, I do think it helps with my overall mouth freshness.</li>
            <li> enamel but pretty good overall i would recommend it for people with small stains in the teth otherwise</li>
            <li> The bubbly second step kept me brushing for the full 2 minutes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried any sort of professional or at-home whitening kits or toothpastes before, so this was my first go around with any sort of product.</li>
            <li> They were sensitive at first, but now I don&#x27;t even notice any sensitivity at all.</li>
            <li> My mouth doesn&#x27;t have as much of that morningy &#x27;funk&#x27; each morning as it normally does.  </li>
            <li> I think it feels like it really cleans my teeth and has a normal mint flavor.</li>
            <li> My teeth also feel cleaner, which may have to do with actually brushing my teeth for the full recommended two minutes.  </li>
            <li> One tip that&#x27;s worked for me is using my electric toothbrush which beeps after each 30 second interval to ensure I go a full minute with each step.</li>
            <li> I like the two steps also because it helps me to brush for the full two minutes, since it&#x27;s only one minute per tube.</li>
            <li> I did notice that it made my teeth sensitive the first couple of days, but it eventually passed.</li>
            <li> It actually keeps me brushing for the full two minutes</li>
            <li> Simply place step-1 on tooth brush and brush all surfaces of your teeth for 1 full minute.</li>
            <li> I brushed for the full minute and spit.</li>
            <li> WOW I was literally blown away after the first brushing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The second tube lists full ingredients of Water, Glycerin, Hydrogen Peroxide, Carbomer, Disodium Pryophosphate, Flavor, Sucralose, Sodium Hydroxide.</li>
            <li> you use the tube marked 1 like a regular toothpaste (though this one contains Stannous fluoride which is better against plaque) and brush for 2 minutes, spit it out and without rinsing your mouth or the brush, apply the tube marked 2 on the brush which is the whitening gel and brush for another minute.</li>
            <li> Step 2 doesn&#x27;t look or taste or feel much like normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li> That way you get the full whitening effect.are complementary, not the same product twice.</li>
            <li> The first tube of paste is clearly marked Step 1.</li>
            <li> I recently received a full size PR Sample of this product.  </li>
            <li> The first paste feels like a mini professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week, and so far, I&#x27;m really liking the product!</li>
            <li> The sensitivity was gone the second day, although I noticed that I couldn&#x27;t rinse my mouth out with cool water without my tongue feeling like it was on fire.</li>
            <li> Overall not bad, just not my preference.</li>
            <li> noticed that the 1st step product did feel grittier than toothpaste I am used to, but it was not bad, just different.</li>
            <li> overall, not a product I&#x27;m going to go out and purchase myself but not a bad score from BzzAgent.eling.  </li>
            <li> overall, not a product I&#x27;m going to go out and purchase myself but not a bad score from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, just different.</li>
            <li> Love that the toothpastes are strong enough to make a difference but not too strong that I feel that weird tingling sensation on them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall Crest Pro Health® HD™ is a very good toothpaste system that gets done what it says it will do, as long as you don&#x27;t mind a slight bit of extra effort going through the two steps.</li>
            <li> To be honest that happens a little here too, but overall I was very pleased by how this toothpaste turned out even despite a few drawbacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more licking all the grit from the toothpaste off for hours, just clean, smooth, whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> I felt like it cut down on the plaque and whitened my teeth even more.  </li>
            <li> The packaging could have slimmed down a bit, but it still wasn&#x27;t overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are 2 steps, first you brush for one minute with the toothpaste which has a nice subtle flavor.</li>
            <li> I assumed it would be the same ingredients, but more concentrated, which would mean a more severe reaction.</li>
            <li> the second one is a little more unique taste......</li>
            <li> The only drawback that I can see so far is the fact that this kit involves two steps but its worth the extra time for the clean that you get from it!  </li>
            <li> I received a brand new full size Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste set last week thanks to Crest</li>
            <li> 2-step toothpaste system requires more effort than simply applying White Strips, but I feel like the extra time and effort is worth it because not only does your teeth get whiter with each use, your mouth is also left feeling clean and fresh, which I appreciate!</li>
            <li> It seems like the &amp;#34;whiter teeth&amp;#34; claims on toothpastes and strips are just a little out of hand, and there&#x27;s no way to tell which one is good enough for you.</li>
            <li> I think I have found my new tooth paste!</li>
            <li> We have found our new toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always preferred Crest products, and now this will be my new toothpaste of choice!</li>
            <li> until today I spotted a brand new display of this product and snagged one!</li>
            <li> Ta da - New Product!</li>
            <li> This is my new toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Crest Pro Health HD system religiously for about 6 weeks and honestly, I can&#x27;t say that I really see any noticeable difference over using my regular Crest products (Generally a Crest Pro-Health w/Senstivity user).  </li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like the second step very much.</li>
            <li> Also, I have pretty sensitive teeth after having braces 2x in my life, one in Jr. High, and another time in college (because I don&#x27;t follow directions and wear my retainers), but this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> By far I would recommend this two step process that is looking for a long lasting healthy smile.  </li>
            <li> Although step 2 had a little bit of a funky taste initially, I was pleased with how clean my teeth felt after using these 2 products.</li>
            <li> The process doesn&#x27;t really take any more time than normal brushing, you just have to do 2 different processes, one right after the other.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a whiter and cleaner smile that last for a long time!!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> I feel like a whole new person with this</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest and BzzAgent, I have been using the new Crest Pro Health® HD whitening system for about 4 weeks now.</li>
            <li> At the very get go would like to mention that after using the new Crest Pro Heath toothpaste duo, my  teeth do feel whiter and fresher.</li>
            <li> They look whiter and feel healthier thanks to Crest&#x27;s new 2 step system.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve started using this new Crest HD 2 step product I&#x27;ve been very impressed/happy.</li>
            <li> For only a total of 4 minutes of time per day, it makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li> Yes, I would tend to say that step one cleans better than a typical Crest product.</li>
            <li> However, it does seem to be performing just as well or better than anything I previously tried.</li>
            <li> I do think the HD has slightly whitened my teeth and probably could do so more with longer use</li>
            <li> Over the last 3 or so weeks, I&#x27;ve tried to go back to twice per day, but it still seems to irritate my gums so I will stick with once per day to get that fresh from the dentist clean feeling and keep my teeth a bit whiter than without.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully this product truly is doing what it feels like it&#x27;s doing and eliminating more plaque than my previous paste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I still like the product and would consider using it again in the future since it gives me a fresh and clean feeling and is not gritty or lingering in my mouth all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as dramatic as whitening strips, but it definitely the most effective whitening I&#x27;ve ever seen from a tooth paste.</li>
            <li> I did have previous concerns about the long-term effect on my teeth as well, but they&#x27;ve been greatly alleviated after some online reading.  </li>
            <li> I typically use my custom trays and 20% hydrogen peroxide gel for whitening; I haven&#x27;t found anything to whiten better than they do.  </li>
            <li> I drink black tea most of the day, so my teeth do have some staining on them.  </li>
            <li> because I am not a heavy coffee or tea drinker, so I don&#x27;t really notice staining on my teeth too much.  </li>
            <li> It does not whiten as well as it claims but it does do a decent job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a busy Mom with 1 on the way and before I received the Crest Pro-Health HD free in the mail from Crest, my gums were bleeding daily.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste due gave my mouth the same feeling, but with a better taste and easier cleaning regimen!  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased two more sets for my personal &amp;#34;stockpile.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> as a child I never had super white teeth and no one in my family</li>
            <li> Therefore I know this product will whiten teeth because of its main ingredient for step 2.</li>
            <li> My mouth definitely felt fresher after a week and my teeth physically felt smoother and more polished.</li>
            <li> TOTALLY harmless, and disappears quickly--</li>
            <li> for the main feature, the whitening..  </li>
            <li> Nobody commented on my teeth looking exceptionally white as many people do when I use the Crest White Strips. :</li>
            <li> Finally a product that really makes a diffence in your smile.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to admit, many of my teeth brushing sessions prior to using this product did not last the recommended 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Step 1 is a fairly mild flavor, I assume to not offend different tastes.  </li>
            <li> the questions of does this actually work, I have to say most definitely.  </li>
            <li> It also subconsciously makes me brush longer instead of quickly getting through the brushing process to speed up my morning routine.</li>
            <li> I think its a decent toothpaste</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m older, my teeth are older...</li>
            <li> Most people don&#x27;t even take the necessary 2 minutes you&#x27;re supposed to spend on your teeth, so adding an extra step is a real-life deterrent.</li>
            <li> Most recently, I was using Crest 3D but stopped after my dental hygienist commented on the plastic beads in gums at my last appointment.  </li>
            <li> will most likely use step 1 twice daily, and use step 2 just once, to assure my gums are not overly irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> will most likely use step 1 twice daily, and use step 2 just once, to assure my gums are not overly irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only con is that I don&#x27;t find the toothpaste as refreshing as my regular product.  </li>
            <li> The main difference for me is how my teeth feel.</li>
            <li> I though the product was decent for what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There were a couple of things I was not crazy about which were pretty minor.  </li>
            <li> I started noticing a difference in the brightness of my teeth within a couple days and it only got better over the following weeks.</li>
            <li> There are just too many mornings where I don&#x27;t have that extra minute to brush, essentially, twice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an older person with some tooth discoloration that I thought I would just have to life</li>
            <li> It only takes a fraction of the time as white strips and you still get much better results.</li>
            <li> Yes, I would love white teeth, because everyone knows that their teeth could use a bit of whitening, especially mine.</li>
            <li> Although the two step process isn&#x27;t as convenient, it is worth it; especially since this is much easier than putting a tray of gel on your teeth or even using whitening strips.  </li>
            <li> Although the two step process isn&#x27;t as convenient, it is worth it; especially since this is much easier than putting a tray of gel on your teeth or even using whitening strips.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is this toothpaste does seem to make my gums bleed more than regular toothpaste, but I&#x27;ve also read that that means it&#x27;s working on healing them</li>
            <li> It may be that I need to continue this process for a few more weeks to see the real benefit.  </li>
            <li> The total length of brushing doesn&#x27;t change, you just take a quick spit halfway and add the step 2 gel to your brush and continue brushing for another minute.  </li>
            <li> Its mild enough like sensodyne.</li>
            <li> After the initial cleaning of toothpaste you can tell the grime is off of your teeth and to further top that off with a polisher and whitener</li>
            <li> But this particular product didn&#x27;t knock my socks off.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased two more sets for my personal &amp;#34;stockpile.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this product on behalf of Crest and  Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> It is a decent cost for what you get.</li>
            <li> But luckily step 2 was only seconds</li>
            <li> Overall, I have enjoyed the product and would definitely consider purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at best prior to trying this product.</li>
            <li> so I was sceptical that Crest HD would be any different, however after receiving a free sample of Crest for being a bzzagent I gave it a try and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend that people try it for themselves, especially if they have problems with keeping their teeth healthy.</li>
            <li> The second step leaves more of a \\&quot;just back from the dentist\\&quot; feel rather than</li>
            <li> I personally don’t mind the 2-step process because this ensures I’m giving my teeth adequate brushing time.</li>
            <li> It is very simple and I thought it would take more time than regular brushing</li>
            <li> The 2nd tube contains a clear smooth gel that  polishes and whitens the teeth.</li>
            <li> The texture or the first paste is a bit funny, but gets fully dissolved by the second paste.</li>
            <li> Based on my experience with just the toothpaste, I am definitely more likely to purchase a Crest toothpaste product in the future.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use the product as instructed since the process is simple and quick and my teeth do feel cleaner after use.  </li>
            <li> I definitely would recommend trying Crest Pro-health 2 step for a healthy alternative  to regular toothpaste</li>
            <li> In the week before my dentist visit, I definitely noticed the product gave my teeth more polish, similar to how they looked after a dentist visit - not 100% of the polish of a dentist cleaning, but maybe 50%.  </li>
            <li> I think this toothpaste works, although my teeth are not heavily stained and I’m not a coffee or tea drinker nor do I smoke, I did notice improvement in the light discoloration I do have after just a short period of time.</li>
            <li> So I was hesitant about step 2, since it contains peroxide as a main ingredient.</li>
            <li> The whitening/polishing gel is potent and can irritate your gums and (temporarily) turn them white if left on for too long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did stick it out, however I had to cut back to using this product only once a day until my mouth was able to adjust.  </li>
            <li> I did stick it out, however I had to cut back to using this product only once a day until my mouth was able to adjust.  </li>
            <li> In addition, I found this product on the shelf at a local store and it costs more than the price of 2 toothpaste tubes, so it is not low cost but is cheaper than a whitening procedure at the dentist.</li>
            <li> Although my husband already thinks I have super white teeth to begin with.</li>
            <li> As far as the taste of the toothpaste, it&#x27;s not as minty fresh as Crest Complete Scope.</li>
            <li> 2 more months until my next regular dental check-in</li>
            <li> will definitely continue to use Crest Pro-Health HD until the containers are empty, but I haven’t decided yet if I will purchase it on my own afterward.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive Crest Pro Health® HD complementary via bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I recently received a sample of crest pro healthy HD daily two step toothpaste to try.  </li>
            <li> My main concern was that my patients might not want to do the two step process</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and I&#x27;m definitely thinking about replacing my current toothpaste for it.</li>
            <li> I started using this only at night and after 3 days, the pain subsided to a mild discomfort.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to try Crest Pro-health HD through BuzzAgent!!!</li>
            <li> The taste of this toothpaste is, like most whitening pastes, not great; the second step in particular tastes very strongly of peroxide.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was a little hesitant at first, since it has 2 steps, but it is super easy and not a big deal at all.  </li>
            <li> The taste was a little strong at first</li>
            <li> Years ago, I had tried the whitening strips and my teeth became very sensitive after using that, so I am much happier with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The single tooth seems plaque free.</li>
            <li> Definitely a must try that I highly recommend and will continue to use for a long time - a true two in one product!!  </li>
            <li> The toothpaste left my teeth feeling extra clean and while I didn&#x27;t notice a whitening difference right away</li>
            <li> The best part for me was that in the past when I used whiteners my teeth became sensitive to cold very easily and after just a couple of uses of the product.  </li>
            <li> As a once a day, HUGE cup of hot tea drinker, as I inch towards 50, I have noticed that the tea stains are starting to remain on my once white teeth!</li>
            <li> So you finish the first step, and your toothbrush (and maybe your had) is wet, and now you need to hands to hold the 2nd tube and twist the top off.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the second step as much as the first because it doesn&#x27;t taste as much and looks like glue.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t really noticed too much of a difference in the feeling and look of my teeth after using Crest Pro Health® HD™, but prior to this I was already using a higher end toothpaste with whitening.</li>
            <li> From the very first use I could tell that this tooth whitening paste was different from all of the rest I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I found that it really helped me with sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health® HD has made a VERY visible difference on the whiteness of my teeth and I am so surprised!</li>
            <li> After the very first use I could see the stains diminishing, n after only 3 uses</li>
            <li> From the very first use, it makes your teeth feel just like you left the dentist office after a cleaning.</li>
            <li> It takes just two minutes just like my routine which is great because I&#x27;m usually on the go most mornings and tired at night.</li>
            <li> The price is higher than regular toothpaste, however that would be expected given that this is more than just a toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Because of the products I always use, I really did not notice much in the way of whiter teeth from this product, but my teeth are pretty white as it is.  </li>
            <li> They are super clean and they last that way all day long, seriously.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Given the cost of this treatment, certainly more than half of what you&#x27;re paying for is the gel, which as far as I can tell, is not sold alone - and is better than any other whitening treatment I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a young baby and a super busy life, adding an extra step to my daily routine is not always easy.</li>
            <li> The only down fall is that I don&#x27;t really love the taste, it feels not as fresh as I like and has a bit of a chalky effect.  </li>
            <li> Its pretty mild - not really much flavor.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it give my mouth that fresh feeling for hours after brushing, it also whitens better than any other toothpaste product I&#x27;ve tried, in my opinion!</li>
            <li> This is so much more easy to do and to use than the whitening strips or other whitening systems because you don&#x27;t have to wait half an hour or longer to see the results.</li>

            <li> I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li> I will have to decide if these qualities outweigh the high cost, which in my opinion is the biggest downside to Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had high hopes, but the results have been so-</li>
            <li> Since the product claims teeth will be 6x whiter after 1 week, I will give it a few more days to see if I see more dramatic results.&lt;br /&gt;- 2 step system easy to use:</li>

            <li> Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that my mouth feels fresh and clean, and my teeth seem a little whiter.  </li>
            <li> It definitely has left my mouth feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> I feel like my teeth stay clean all day long.</li>
            <li> That clean feeling lasted for a long time as well (throughout the day and into the evening) .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe, but when I run tongue over them they feel really smooth and clean, almost like</li>
            <li> Step 1 looks like that familiar blue gel, and it is kinda minty, but Step 2 is a clear, goopy gel that tastes like peroxide.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean all day long.  </li>
            <li> but the feel clean all day long and even in the morning.  </li>
            <li> And my teeth felt clean all day long.  </li>
            <li> The clean feel lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> My teeth haven&#x27;t felt this clean in a long time.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt so clean for so long with an at home product.  </li>
            <li> I was also pleasantly surprised that the price was lower than many other whitening products out there.</li>
            <li> I spend a decent amount (7-8.00) on toothpaste normally and do not see the results that I saw in a DAY with Crest Pro-Health HD.</li>
            <li> We are completely and utterly floored with how fresh this product leaves our mouth!  </li>
            <li> Unlike many other teeth whitened, the crest HD system does not leave your teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li> Bye bye old regular toothpaste, hello crest pro-health HD and hello to a healthier, cleaner, whiter smile!</li>
            <li> Produces a very smooth slick finish and it just feels like your teeth are much cleaner than ever.</li>
            <li> I have used this for six days and so far, I haven&#x27;t noticed a sensitivity issue!!</li>
            <li> I prefer  my toothpastes to have a little more flavor and a little more foam.</li>
            <li> The two step process takes a little more time but my teeth feel cleaner after brushing.  </li>
            <li> is.&lt;br /&gt;My gums seem to be a little better as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike most toothpastes it requires a little effort to use.</li>
            <li> That said, this is a little bit of magic in two tubes.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste actually works as advertised in the first application!</li>
            <li> After opening the package, I was immediately overwhelmed by the minty scent and was therefore a little worried about whether or not I would be able to use the toothpaste as I&#x27;m not a fan of overly minty toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I wished the gel was a little bit more minty -</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant since it was a toothpaste and most toothpaste promote to whiten your teeth</li>
            <li> adds the little boost to make all your mouth super-clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> and ---- WOW !!</li>
            <li> (it felt a little cheap), but it&#x27;s not about the packaging - it&#x27;s about the product!</li>
            <li> the price is a bit steep, i saw it on sale at a drugstore for $13 which is a little more</li>
            <li> I wish the taste was a little bit better</li>
            <li> Especially since my teeth were much noticeably whiter!!  </li>
            <li> The taste takes a little getting used to but it is not horrible.</li>
            <li> I wish it tasted a little better.</li>
            <li> I have never enjoyed brushing my teeth, but after this toothpaste my teeth actually feel like I just left the dentist - in a good way!</li>
            <li> The results are noticeable within just a few days, but the clean fresh feeling is immediate.</li>
            <li> My gums no longer feel sensitive and my entire mouth feels clean.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised about the lack of sensitivity, but I was blown away by how clean my teeth actually felt hours after brushing.</li>
            <li> was really surprised as to just how clean my teeth felt and how white they had gotten after even one brushing!</li>
            <li> i really enjoy this product and feel that it gives me a deep, down, complete clean- more than my other toothpaste products.</li>
            <li> Usually it takes weeks to get a beautiful white smile from whitestrips and other whitening toothpastes, but with Crest Pro Health HD I noticed a difference immediately.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser (first step) is also not my favorite, I found the feel of it in my mouth and the aftertaste to be very strange, almost dry and chalky.</li>
            <li> This paste has been very easy as I&#x27;ve just substituted it for my normal past when brushing.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a little more sensitivity in the area around my crown, but I think that is normal with any teeth-whitening product.</li>
            <li> two step system is sooooo easy to follow, and due to no wait time in between, it makes brushing your teeth</li>
            <li> It was really hard to find a toothpaste that I really liked.  </li>
            <li> I feel that the product is not as &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; or strong compared to other brands, but i still get that &amp;#34;just cleaned&amp;#34; feeling everytime i use it.</li>
            <li> And you can only do so much without professional whitening, but this does live up to its claims and works adequately.</li>
            <li> One of the things I was not a fan of was how dry the first tooth paste made my mouth feel, but after using the second that feeling goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I wish that they used the same style cap for each tube to help simplify the routine but don’t let the packaging deter you from missing out on this amazing new product!!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest who gave me Crest Pro Health HD for Free to try a little over a week ago I am a much happier man.  </li>
            <li> I know this costs a little more than regular toothpaste, but it is worth is.  </li>
            <li> The only reason this product didn&#x27;t get 5 stars was because it made our gums super sensitive!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Crest whitening products before with a mild sensitivity, but my results from the Pro-Health HD were pretty severe.  </li>
            <li> The extra step takes a little more time than normal, but after you see the results it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> , I feel extra clean after 2 min , doesn&#x27;t feel like its that clean with other toothpaste .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, it took very little time to get adjusted to using two different tubes of toothpaste instead of one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gentle enough product for sensitive teeth, provides a good clean feeling, and is as simple as switching up your toothpaste - none of those extra strips or mouth pieces to fool with.s as simple as switching up your toothpaste - none of those extra strips or mouth pieces to fool with.</li>
            <li> saw a difference within the first 2 days itself of using this set twice a day as usual and in a week&#x27;s time I had the whitest teeth I&#x27;ve ever had, including a fresh breath and overall clean feeling in my mouth!</li>
            <li> It is simple and easy to use and the extra bit of time that it takes to complete the entire process is totally worth it for the results!  </li>
            <li> the clean feeling lasted a very long time.</li>
            <li> I must admit that I am really bad at flossing, but my hygienist commented that I had the best gums he’d seen that week.</li>
            <li> I must admit that I am really bad at flossing, but my hygienist commented that I had the best gums he’d seen that week.</li>
            <li> when 2 minutes are complete so this toothpaste really complements what I was doing to start with.</li>
            <li> was happy that I never experienced any tooth sensitivity!</li>
            <li> I think the second step does a great job at whitening already after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> Are my teeth bright white after a month, absolutely not, but Crest Pro Health HD definitely has them whiter than they were before.</li>
            <li> As I applied the first step to my brush, I observed that the thickness of the paste made it susceptible to clogging of the tube and general messiness.</li>
            <li> Lastly, I really like the fact that Crest offers a 60- day satisfaction guarantee with this product.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of using this system, my teeth are no longer sensitive, are SO shiny, and much whiter.  </li>
            <li> More of a medicinal taste, which is kind of unfortunate since it&#x27;s the last taste you have in your mouth as Step 2.  </li>
            <li> Happy to prove them wrong.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised and really like the way my mouth feels after using the two-step product.</li>
            <li> And I was surprised at how much cleaner my teeth feel after using it.</li>
            <li> As far as the whitening goes, I have not noticed much difference.</li>
            <li> I have never used a toothpaste that did so much all at once, and it even made my teeth look shinier and whiter, without making my gums feel sensitive.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from it, but was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> but if it works, the system is much cheaper and convenient than using whitening strips or getting your teeth professionally</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have overly sensitive teeth, however, this toothpaste really did a number on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the product, step 2 left an after taste, but maybe I just used too much.</li>
            <li> However, Crest Pro-Health HD two-product system encourages me to brush longer than I  normally would.</li>
            <li> Similar to how it feels after you&#x27;ve just used a powerful mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> Immediately upon first use I felt my teeth were much cleaner than with my normal generic brand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m someone who really carefully considers what chemicals I expose myself and my family to and as such, I want to really look more closely into the dangers (if there are any) of stannous fluoride, before I would continue using Crest HD.  </li>
            <li> I brushed with the “purifying cleanser,” a gentle plaque-blaster, first.</li>
            <li> The Aquafresh actually didn&#x27;t feel fresh at all and even after using it a while, my teeth looked no whiter.</li>
            <li> It left my mouth feeling fresh, even until I woke in the morning.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels dentist fresh after every brush and stays that way longer than with my regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> normally does.  </li>
            <li> The First one cleaned well while the second one really freshened up and felt like it whitened.</li>
            <li> I would prefer if the step 1 toothpaste could be used last, to leave the fresh taste in my mouth</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this product to k people my white smile, this product is a</li>
            <li> After one week of using this product, not only have I noticed a whiter smile, but my family has as well.</li>
            <li> It feels normal having two separate tubes instead of one tube to use to brush my teeth with.</li>
            <li> The mint isn&#x27;t over powering, but you definitely feel fresh.  </li>
            <li> me the biggest value is in giving me a night white smile without the headache.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much the same thing in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I say it&#x27;s worth a try--and you can see the pictures of my results below.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I say it&#x27;s worth a try--and you can see the pictures of my results below.  </li>
            <li> Although it takes a couple of times to get used to using two different toothpastes, it was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I also supplement with Crest white strips every 6 months or so to keep my smile at its brightest.</li>
            <li> Using these two simple tools will help advance and whiten your smile beyond belief.</li>
            <li> Next you apply the (perfecting gel) and it helps to whiten and brighten your smile.</li>
            <li> After this supply of the toothpaste runs out, I&#x27;ll probably return to regular paste for awhile, but as soon as I need a whiter smile, Crest Pro-Health HD will be my choice.</li>
            <li> and I feel they were whiter than normal.  </li>
            <li> My wife likes it even more than I do and commented on it after just a few days of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Probably worth 5 stars, but since the whiteness didn&#x27;t necessarily help me, I deducted a star.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a way to brighten your smile and improve the overall health of your mouth, this is the way to go!</li>
            <li> You normally brush your teeth twice per day, so this is not a inconvenience at all.</li>
            <li> Which normal toothpaste covers.</li>
            <li> Be sure to follow the directions and only leave it on as long as noted.</li>
            <li> For only 2 minutes in the morning and at night I&#x27;m getting a healthier brighter smile.</li>
            <li> Just adds one step - the whitening gel after your normal brushing.</li>
            <li> that you would normally.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with the results of this after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> and I really feel like it cleaned my teeth better than my usual</li>
            <li> I was surprised that I noticed a marked improvement in the first week.  </li>
            <li> The process takes no longer than normal tooth brushing.</li>
            <li> The substance looks a lot like a normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li> than usual, I applied the whitening gel without rinsing, and I can honestly say I am thrilled with the results after only a few days.</li>
            <li> It is definitely a product worth purchasing.  </li>
            <li> I used the first step, white tube, made sure not to rinse and then finally finished with the second step.  </li>
            <li> If that sounds like an extra step, it is, but it is well worth the minute effort.  </li>
            <li> I would absolutely use this, but realistically, I now know I won&#x27;t be diligent enough to use both steps consistently to get the benefits.</li>
            <li> I recieved the toothpaste as a part of a promotion from crest, but I plan on making this my normal routine.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s that the second gel doesn&#x27;t leave a minty fresh taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the time it takes to do that extra step.</li>
            <li> However, since using this product, I have definitely noticed a whiter smile.</li>
            <li> Yes, 2 minutes of brushing, twice daily, can be daunting, but it&#x27;s totally worth the time.</li>
            <li> Pretty much the same.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t use crest but since I was sent this to try by Crest and Buzzagent</li>
            <li> I can say with out a doubt that my smile has whitened in the last couple of weeks</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a big deal and SO worth the results.</li>
            <li> the product is worth the extra effort.</li>
            <li> The first paste really cleans and the second gel whitens.</li>
            <li> I am a heavy tea and coffee drinker so it may take a bit more time to see any change.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I brushed for too long or something, because I am sure that it could be prevented.</li>
            <li> Not only did I notice my breath felt fresh and</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, this two step toothpaste really is worth the extra effort and cost.</li>
            <li> I normally use Crest Whitestrips once a year</li>
            <li> It is more like an overall week long cleaning of your teeth.  </li>
            <li> , just brush like normal but twice.  </li>
            <li> and I can already see a difference not only in the color of my teeth, but also how fresh my mouth feels for extended periods of time.  </li>
            <li> I am used to having a fresh, minty mouth after brushing my teeth, but Step 2 seems to eliminate the initial burst of freshness that Step 1 leaves.  </li>
            <li> The substance looks a lot like a normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li> After years of one-squeeze-brush-and-go, using a two part system is different but well worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only takes a dab of each for a fresh and white smile.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought the two step process was extra work brushing (who wants to brush twice?)</li>
            <li> Within a few days of use the top of the step one tube came apart, releasing toothpaste and causing the tube to be unsealed.</li>
            <li> Not only is my smile whiter</li>
            <li> The first step, the Purifying cleanser, really clung to my teeth and had just a touch of grit that left my teeth with a polished feel.</li>
            <li> Long story short, you&#x27;re not adding any more time to your morning</li>
            <li> I never thought that a toothpaste product would be able to make the change that I have seen in just a few weeks of using it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m normally a fan of Crest products.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are already pretty white, so I didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference in terms of whiteness after using this product.</li>
            <li> Next I used the perfecting gel, I could notice a whiter smile after just one use.  </li>
            <li> I found that it actually diminished the fresh breath that I just got from brushing with the cleanser toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> So I pretty much gave up on having white teeth,</li>
            <li> In a brief 4 days of use I already see progress and a brighter smile.</li>
            <li> My smile begins with white teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether my gum health has improved since starting application, but they feel good</li>
            <li> I use an electric toothbrush and have found that it takes no longer than normal to use Crest HD.  </li>
            <li> Not only did I notice it&#x27;s powerful whitening effects</li>
            <li> The Step 1 tastes and feels just like a normal fluoride toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I am always looking to improve the shade of my smile and have tried various whitening products.</li>
            <li> I do not mind have to do 2 steps because I am so pleased with the results even after just a few times using this product.</li>
            <li> In only 2 minutes 2 times a day your mouth is cleaner, teeth whiter, and has fresh breath.  </li>
            <li> My wife can tell a total difference in the shade of my smile.</li>
            <li> and after a week my teeth looked pretty much the same.</li>
            <li> But for how white it makes my teeth, its worth switching over.</li>
            <li> to use and takes no longer than your normal teeth brushing routine</li>
            <li> For the price, and what I was able to attain using this for just a few weeks, I won&#x27;t try another whitening toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I totally think it&#x27;s worth the money and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> The only read success I had with whitening was with the whitening strips.</li>
            <li> like I normally like.  </li>
            <li> Use the first step then use the second step, couldn&#x27;t really be much easier.</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s worth the price tag too because I could actually use it.</li>
            <li> Considering the price of this product and the extra step involved when brushing your teeth, I do not feel this product is worth it.</li>
            <li> The only read success I had with whitening was with the whitening strips.</li>
            <li> First off I&#x27;ve never had much luck with tooth whitening products such as gels or strips</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t add any time to my normal brushing routine.</li>
            <li> There is a different taste to get used too, but I feel having a fresher feeling in my mouth when all is said and done is worth it.</li>
            <li> Second, I want a toothpaste that leaves a fresh feel and taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> It was actually quite fun</li>
            <li> I just use  this when I would normally brush.</li>
            <li> I thought a paste that I would normally brush and whitening my teeth was the way to go.</li>
            <li> I only wish I had taken a before and after pic of my smile.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is part of my normal brushing routine</li>
            <li> This product does just what it says it will do -- whiter teeth and a fresh breath unlike what you experience from regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Overall not a bad product as far as a whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed how sparkly they looked after a few uses too.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get an ultra white smile, as promised on the box.  </li>
            <li> WHITE - IT TAKES YEARS OFF MY SMILE</li>
            <li> Step 2 had a more harsh taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Step 2 had a more harsh taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Just brush as you normally would.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to have a cleaner mouth/teeth and brighter smile.</li>
            <li> I am giving it 3 stars because I do think it can be useful in removing day to day stains if you are a regular coffee or tea drinker.  </li>
            <li> As opposed to my regular toothpaste, I felt the Crest Pro Health® HD didn&#x27;t give me as much of \\&quot;fresh in the mouth</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth the extra effort.  </li>
            <li> He noticed a big difference in my smile and so have my friends and family</li>
            <li> Thank you to Crest for brightening up my smile on a daily basis!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing the 2-step routine twice a day for the past week, and my teeth look and feel as good as they did after my last dentist cleaning.  </li>
            <li> My smile is whiter after only a week</li>
            <li> I will say that it does indeed look like it is getting my teeth whiter than normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m looking to see how it is going in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait for my hygienist to see my smile next week!</li>
            <li> After a few days of getting used to the process and getting my gums used to getting a healthy scrub, my teeth began to whiten</li>
            <li> Then you brush with it and rinse like normal.</li>
            <li> , my smile is whiter and I am getting complements that I look YOUNGER !!!</li>
            <li> My mouth felt fresh for several hours.</li>
            <li> I also like using this product after a few weeks for just a couple days to make my teeth feel and look better.</li>
            <li> , the only thing I have tried to brighten my smile is a whitening toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I think I would buy this product every six months as a way to refresh my smile but probably not as my daily go to...for both time and dollars.</li>
            <li> Because the exciting part was how this could make your teeth 6x whiter, I diligently used this every time I brushed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After brushing with step 1 toothpaste , I felt a fuzzy feeling in my teeth that normally we get after eating spinach</li>
            <li> but I did notice a whiter appearance on a few teeth more than others</li>
            <li> than I normally would.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a daily coffee drinker, but every morning, I get a fresh white smile.</li>
            <li> so brushing for 2 minutes is no longer than I&#x27;d normally brush and is recommended.  </li>
            <li> After having used this for a few weeks, my teeth do look better</li>
            <li> I have to use a different toothpaste to get that minty fresh scent.</li>
            <li> You use it has your normal toothpaste routine.  </li>
            <li> Not a smooth feel, so it seems like you&#x27;re getting a better cling to yout teeth.</li>
            <li> After that, just show off your progressively whiter smile daily.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the past couple weeks (courtesy of free samples supplied by Crest) without a lot of success on the whitening side.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another good product from Crest, but not great.</li>
            <li> I did not realize how helpful a good toothpaste is until I tired this one.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s how I brush my teeth, but it seemed like the first tube foamed more than regular toothpaste, so I had it running down the toothbrush onto my hand.</li>
            <li> one - for me, it seems akin to every other minty toothpaste out there - same refreshing taste, same clean feeling after.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re looking for a new toothpaste, I highly recommend giving this a try.</li>
            <li> Whether its simple everyday activities, meeting new employees, or greeting vendors or Executives, your smile &amp; teeth are your most prized possession.</li>
            <li> I was confused at first, then quickly realized that my teeth were super clean and had that tiny gap between the front bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> was lucky enough to try this free as a Bzzagent, and I will definitely continue to purchase it in the future!</li>
            <li> I want to see if is worth taking the extra time for the two steps brushing and the price, as of right now I will give the product a three....to be continuereport and giving my final conclusion.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to remember not to rinse after step one, but otherwise a very easy way to brighten a smile!</li>
            <li> I had tried other regular whiteners and while I&#x27;m sure they do ok, they simply don&#x27;t seem to make a big impact on the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I thought the taste was fine compared to some other whiteners I&#x27;ve tried and</li>
            <li> both have used this new toothpaste for several weeks and agree that our mouths feel fresh and tingly after we brush.</li>
            <li> Got to try this product for free thanks to Crest, and I have to say it does make my teeth feel smoother and cleaner, and I noticed a slight whitening effect as well.</li>
            <li> I pick myself up off the couch, drag myself upstairs and just want to quickly brush my teeth before falling fast asleep.  </li>
            <li> The things that appealed to me about this product included the quick action whitening (with noticeable effects within a week), the emphasis on gingivitis reduction, and the relative ease of use.  </li>
            <li> I figured it sounded easy enough and since it requires brushing, it wasn&#x27;t anything extra</li>
            <li> The directions were simple enough, and easy to time because I have a Sonicare toothbrush that beeps every 30 seconds</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even safe for sensitive teeth and will not interfere with previous dental work, unlike some products.</li>
            <li> Crest ProHealth HD was really easy to use - brush with regular toothpaste and then brush with a second tube of whitening</li>
            <li> With the Crest Pro Health® HD easy to use 2 step system, my teeth are whiter than the more expensive systems out there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and minty and a slightly aqua or blue color like some mint gel toothpastes are.  </li>
            <li> This program is easy and simple and actually works.</li>
            <li> This routine seemed easy enough since I already use 2 minutes of brushing as my standard.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and only take a total of 2 mins, just twice a day</li>
            <li> and I guess that it warms up in our dry mouth and becomes further more</li>
            <li> and I guess that it warms up in our dry mouth and becomes further more</li>
            <li> After only a few uses, I saw a HUGE difference in the appearance of my teeth and the brightness of my smile!</li>
            <li> If for no other reason than the clean feeling you are left with after using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I limited my use to only once and made sure to rinse thoroughly after, the irritation went away.  </li>
            <li> Brush 1 minute with 1st tube labeled &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; and right after, without rinsing, brush 1 minute with 2nd tube labeled &amp;#34;2&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I can think is that my husband was right that it stripped my teeth during those two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I began using Crest Pro Health HD right after my last teeth cleaning at my dentist</li>
            <li> Picture on Right is before and picture on left is after one week of use.  </li>
            <li> I realize that there are a million products on the market right now that promise to whiten your teeth, and if you are like me you have not found anything that actually works!  </li>
            <li> I began using Crest Pro Health HD right after my last teeth cleaning at my dentist</li>
            <li> The 2nd time I used it was right before bed.</li>
            <li> I imagine every person will be different, maybe this product just wasn&#x27;t right for me.  </li>
            <li> She stopped using it right away, and scheduled her dental cleaning for next week.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.drugs.com</li>
            <li> Score a big plus for that feature right away and the package did not deform or rip apart</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t want white teeth right???</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, and that&#x27;s from the mouth of the husband of a professional dental hygienist!</li>
            <li> I liked the end result, but on a busy morning, it took a little bit too much time and effort to use two different products to get the job done.</li>
            <li> It has helped keep my clear brackets clean and my bands and such clear and not dingy and yellowish.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a dramatic change, but enough where I was left impressed.  </li>
            <li> I could see the difference the first few days, and was really excited.  </li>
            <li> The first is it takes about a minute or 2 longer than your normal brushing with having 2 pastes and also the first step leaves your mouth very dry.</li>
            <li> The combination of the two has a very strong taste, not very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first having to do a two part system, but I was very impressed by the cleanliness I felt afterwards.</li>
            <li> My teeth normally get very sensitive with whitening products, but I haven&#x27;t had any sensitivity with using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Seems simple enough - use the fluoride toothpaste for anti-cavity and anti-gingivitis, and then use the whitening gel to whiten your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except that the last thing I need in the morning is one more step to get ready.  </li>
            <li> The routine is bit different because you brush your teeth 2 different times for 1 minute with 2 different toothpastes, but in the end it really doesn&#x27;t take any more time.  </li>
            <li> My husband had a good bit of tartar build up on his teeth, and improvement was obvious after only the third or fourth day of using the product.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no waiting with gross gunk in my mouth that makes me gag.i have noticed my teeth look much better after only a few weeks and are definatly whiter.i recieved this free to try(with smiley360) and will definatly purchase again</li>
            <li> The 2 step process seemed a bit time consuming, (having 2 little ones, I&#x27;m lucky to get a quick brush in twice a day!), but it really didn&#x27;t take too long!</li>
            <li> I work in a very large office setting and attend several meetings throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> It tastes fine without tasting good or bad.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it will be just fine, but I learned it wasn&#x27;t for me since I&#x27;d prefer to keep my brushing routine the same.</li>
            <li> When I brushed with step 2, I knew exactly what the main ingredient was...</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive teeth, so the white strips/tray systems don’t work very well for me.  </li>
            <li> I received this as a free sample and,  due to the price,  </li>
            <li> In no way has receiving it free influenced my thoughts other than the product being something I would buy again.</li>
            <li> cheap compared to some other whiting toothpastes.</li>
            <li> The whole process only takes a couple minutes which isn&#x27;t much beyond what I normally do.  </li>
            <li> I will say that those with sensitive teeth/gums may nto like using this as the first step is very drying and gave me cotton mouth while the second step is peroxide based and can tingle or sting your gums if you are sensative.</li>
            <li> It does make your mouth feel a little sensitive, as do most whitening products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The first night I felt a little thrown by the lack of true mint flavor and swirled a bit of mouthwash after I was done brushing.</li>
            <li> It did make my gums a little sensitive but that seems to be getting better as I have continued to use it.</li>
            <li> I got to try this product out for free from Crest-Using two toothpastes is definitely weird at first, but after getting used to the two steps, I can say I am a huge fan of this new toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The hydrogen peroxide content is high because after the first two times I had white spots on my gums.</li>
            <li> However this is a whitening product and as such being cosmetic I would expect it to be a bit on the higher side, but not as high as Crest&#x27;s competitors pricing.</li>
            <li> I had pretty high expectations, and hoped I had a solution for whiter teeth that wouldn&#x27;t require those gross strips.  </li>
            <li> Gets kind of annoying to have to switch using different tubes of toothpaste, no major whitening noted, Step 2 doesn&#x27;t taste great and it may irritate your gum line w/ the peroxide, I ran out of Step 1 in exactly 30 days and still had plenty of Step 2</li>
            <li> So as a Bzz agent, when the opportunity arose for me to try Crest&#x27;s new Pro Heath HD 2 step toothpaste program, I jumped at it</li>
            <li> Being two steps, this is something new that I&#x27;d never considered before.  </li>
            <li> The new product Crest HD is a two step process of whitening your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the new Crest Pro Health HD for about a week now</li>
            <li> I tried the new crest HD system as part of a bzzcampaign.  </li>
            <li> new routine going forward.</li>
            <li> you have when you get out of the dentist office with your newly polished pearly whites...</li>
            <li> Crest has always been a leader in toothpaste and mouth care, and this new addition is an example why.</li>
            <li> I think I have found my new toothpaste system.</li>
            <li> Got to try this new toothpaste dou through BzzAgent</li>
            <li> It is my new go to toothpaste of choice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Crest has out done themselves with this new process.</li>
            <li> However, this new toothpaste and whitening gel combo did not cause any irritation.  </li>
            <li> We started with a day 1 photo and after another week, a new one.  </li>
            <li> I was invited to try the new crest HD toothpaste kid.</li>
            <li> I received a package of this thru Crest to try out and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this new Crest Pro Health HD system for a week and took pictures along the way to track if it truly whitened my teeth.</li>
            <li> This is totally my new #HealthyObsession for the day.</li>
            <li> Planing to make this my new staple toothpaste</li>
            <li> from BzzAgent was the new Crest Pro Health HD system.  </li>
            <li> I asked my fianc&amp;eacute; this morning how he was liking the new toothpaste</li>
            <li> and I was stoked to try out a new toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how beneficial using this new two step toothpaste could be compared to what I had been using.  </li>
            <li> applaud Crest for indulging somebody&#x27;s new idea.  </li>
            <li> Plus my new whiter teeth have gotten noticed by friends and family.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new go to toothpaste.</li>
            <li> In this box was the new Crest Pro Health HD.  </li>
            <li> But I can tell that they are whiter since I started using the new tooth paste.  </li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s nothing new I need to remember.</li>
            <li> For the record, he doesn&#x27;t even notice when I get a new haircut</li>
            <li> I like Crest products, but this didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I am two days into my new routine with Crest Pro Health HD</li>
            <li> received a sample from Bzz Agent, and now Crest Pro-Health HD is my new go to toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I am always up for trying new products and ones that will whiten my teeth.  </li>
            <li> However I can feel no plaque with this new toothpaste.</li>
            <li> However it does live up to whitening and cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li> I received the new Crest Pro Health toothpaste from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I am a new mom and feel like my teeth yellowed after baby.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a toothpaste that will make your teeth feel brand new</li>
            <li> I have found my new toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I like the feeling of newly cleaned teeth, and I think this toothpaste delivers that.</li>
            <li> I like this new toothpaste.</li>
            <li> applaud Crest for indulging somebody&#x27;s new idea.</li>
            <li> I have a new dental routine and for now</li>
            <li> I am always looking for something new to try</li>
            <li> They sent me the new Crest Pro-Health HD two-step toothpaste system to try.</li>
            <li> As a dental hygienist I&#x27;m always looking for new products that I can recommend to my patients to help them have a healthier mouth.</li>
            <li> Tried this new toothpaste through a sampling program with BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li> Even better - it really wasn&#x27;t hard to adjust my routine to include both steps.</li>
            <li> And other reviewers have said that it left their mouths feeling dentist visit fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> I think my teeth have whitened a little over the last 30 days, so I&#x27;m keeping it going for the next 6 months, and see how much improvement I see in my smile, and over all mouth healthy.</li>
            <li> so my teeth usually don&#x27;t remain bright and shiny too long after a visit to the dentist.  </li>
            <li> I got this product for free thanks to Crest and after a few weeks of testing it out all I have are words of praise.</li>
            <li> so my teeth usually don&#x27;t remain bright and shiny too long after a visit to the dentist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nursing mom and have to get up several times in the night to feed the baby, so not to have that gross taste in my mouth during those night feedings was a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, I am sure that the price may be less than the white strips and all, but it is still a bit too much for someone used to spending about $5 on a tube of toothpaste, and this is four times the amount for two tubes.  </li>
            <li> I never really felt like I had that clean mouth feel or freshness.</li>
            <li> I continued with using Crest Pro Health HD for a second week but really did not pay much attention to the color of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Crest HD solves both problems, and the toothpaste is the most thorough and flavorful paste I&#x27;ve tried in a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is important to remember not to rinse prior to the second toothpaste step.</li>
            <li> Would have been much easier to put the flip cap on the 2nd tube as well, which is much easier to do with one hand.</li>
            <li> I was sent a free trial of Crest Pro-Health HD through BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;After using the toothpaste for a few weeks now, I really like the 2 part system.&lt;br /&gt;Logically</li>
            <li> We recently picked up a free sample of the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two Step Toothpaste from our BZZagent status.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I tend to use products that use natural ingredients, and will probably revert back to a toothpaste that uses less man-made chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times so far, so if it seems to make a difference, it might be worth it.</li>
            <li> The first step is like a normal frothy toothpaste and the second step is a whitening gel used as a toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I had a 6x whiter smile, but there is no question my smile was/is a few shades whiter.</li>
            <li> I recently recieved a free trial product of Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two Step Toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Strips take too much time and don&#x27;t cover the entire mouth, and toothpaste really doesn&#x27;t work that well for me.</li>
            <li> And most whitening toothpastes don&#x27;t really whiten that much (at least not the ones that I have tried).</li>
            <li> far as the part two of the kit, although my teeth don&#x27;t feel exceptionally white, I will say I have noticed an increase in brightness in my smile.</li>
            <li> Please note that I received Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste from Crest via BzzAgent for free, and I am posting this review only after using this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I had a 6x whiter smile, but there is no question my smile was/is a few shades whiter.</li>
            <li> I recently received the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste from #bzzagent as a free trial.  </li>
            <li> I was sent a free trial of the Crest 3D white daily cleansing and whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> First, you brush with the white normal toothpaste, then you spit without rinsing and brush again with the gel step.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free through Bzz Agent and I finally found a toothpaste that actually whitens.  </li>
            <li> With this product, I was able to use it twice daily (morning and night) and experience absolutely no sensitivity.</li>
            <li> If I could I&#x27;d probably give it a 4.5 stars instead of a 5 overall, but I had a good experience with this toothpaste and do recommend that you at least give it a try.think</li>
            <li> If I could I&#x27;d probably give it a 4.5 stars instead of a 5 overall, but I had a good experience with this toothpaste and do recommend that you at least give it a try.</li>
            <li> After using Crest Pro Health HD for several weeks now, I do feel like my mouth is healthier, but since my teeth weren&#x27;t really in need of whitening before, I can&#x27;t really attest to its whitening abilities.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly abrasive, not overly strong flavored and cleans well.  </li>
            <li> Based on the results of the 21 year old&#x27;s experience, I can highly recommend this new product.</li>
            <li> Most likely fro the first step grit.&lt;br /&gt;I was going to continue a few more days, until I was warned by a dental hygienist that the active ingredient in step 2 could actually stain my teeth!  </li>
            <li> But I like how convenient and simple it is to able to just use these in lieu of your normal toothpaste everyday and how quick it is (only two minutes, one minute for brushing each step).</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive teeth and normally use toothpaste specialized for this, since I hadn&#x27;t used a different type of toothpaste for a long time I was willing to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I was very  surprised by this product</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth and have used gels from dentist offices before, and those have always brought out my sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> I found Step Two to taste very much like the same substance used with the Crest whitening strips.</li>
            <li> became very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I found Step Two to taste very much like the same substance used with the Crest whitening strips.</li>
            <li> I can see why they call this &amp;#34;HD&amp;#34;, because this offers a high resolution experience.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth and the preservatives always hurt my teeth.</li>
            <li> Step 1 was very much like regular tooth paste.</li>
            <li> I could not forget the fact, my teeth are very sensitive.</li>
            <li> two minutes actually goes by very fast-</li>
            <li> This could be also why my teeth felt very sensitive after using.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive teeth, and this product does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li> it is VERY reasonably priced compared to similar kits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that I can actually whiten my teeth without using strips or extra steps outside of my normal routine.</li>
            <li> I have a high tolerence for pain, but my teeth are sensitive.</li>
            <li> downside to this system is the cost, it is more than I would typically spend on toothpaste, but were I to replace some alternative whitening solution (such as strips), then I can see spending a little more to replace it.</li>
            <li> The first step removed plaque, and buildup on your teeth and then the second step applies a sealer to prevent new buildup.  </li>
            <li> The second bottle was definitely a polish that could make someone feel they are taking positive steps right away.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have generally sensitive teeth, but there are some spots that are responding a little more sensitively than I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Working this into my general morning routine was easy, truthfully minimal change from what I did before.  </li>
            <li> I am the first to admit that I am willing to try anything and even extra money to get my teeth white and Crest&#x27;s new Pro Health HD</li>
            <li> After brushing, my mouth feels very fresh and remains that way right up until my next meal, which is something I couldn&#x27;t say about previous products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> so you certainly feel like it&#x27;s more serious than that single-stage toothpaste the proletariate uses.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I feel like my teeth can be very sensitive when I first started using it.</li>
            <li> Despite the daily brushing of my teeth, the smile reflected back at me from my mirror was something I was less than pleased with.  </li>
            <li> When you have very little time for yourself due to work, kids and other obligations, this is a great way to pamper yourself!</li>
            <li> The product is good tasting, makes my mouth feel fresh, and I think has had a subtle but slightly noticeable whitening effect on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> With that being said, this is one of the most expensive and yet worth every penny toothpastes you&#x27;ll ever use!</li>
            <li> You will get a more naturally white look from this alone, but if you want pearly whites, use the other whitening products also.</li>
            <li> It is a 2-step process that starts with you first cleaning your teeth with the toothpaste (step 1) and then, without rinsing your mouth, you brush on the second substance, which is the whitening step.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product to test and at first I was hesitant of the 2 step process, thinking I don&#x27;t want to add any extra steps to my routine but after seeing and feeling the almost immediate results, I don&#x27;t mind a bit.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone that&#x27;s willing to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Crest would need to significantly reduce the price for me to continue using this on a regular basis, as it is a daily 2-step system.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit that at first it was an adjustment to use two different products when brushing my teeth; it took some getting used to.  </li>
            <li> Being an avid coffee drinker, I&#x27;ve always had &amp;#34;not so white teeth&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that super fake mint taste, just a clean fresh taste.</li>
            <li> I definitely saw results after the first three weeks of using this product.</li>
            <li> I only have so much time in the morning and at night!  </li>
            <li> I have been using the 3D white toothpastes for years, this is on another whole level!</li>
            <li> The first  is that it actually works.</li>
            <li> Oh and by the way, no more morning breath :)</li>
            <li> After my first use I definitely noticed a difference and after consecutive uses I was hooked.</li>
            <li> After the first use I could notice a difference, I felt like I had just left the dentist</li>
            <li> Thee first is that if it is a two part system shouldn&#x27;t both parts be the same amount?</li>
            <li> I doubted at first that it would whiten my teeth, and while they are not pearly white</li>
            <li> so my teeth were pretty white to start with.  </li>
            <li> The first step is a deep cleaning toothpaste that I would buy on</li>
            <li> I had to make sure not to go past the 1min.</li>
            <li> (it felt like the toothpaste was removing more &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; than usual), and a cleaner sensation in my mouth afterward.  </li>
            <li> Upon first use, my teeth felt immediatly cleaner than they do when I brush with traditional flavor.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more is that this second paste actually has a similar, if not identical taste that tooth whitening strips/paste have, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also really busy and rarely have time to complete a cycle of Crest White Strips.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would pay for more.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend trying it out and thanks for letting my try this product out Crest!</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been using it for weeks now and his teeth are looking white for the first time in his life.</li>
            <li> more white than any other whitening paste.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple process, used the paste first and then follow-up with the gel, without rinsing in between.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Really it doesn&#x27;t take any more time than my usual brushing</li>
            <li> Using it two times a day doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive!  </li>
            <li> There is a slight after taste that lasts for an hour or so but after that it&#x27;s fine and you no longer notice the taste.</li>
            <li> I have always been apprehensive about any sort of whitening program, fearing that I would either be stripping away important layers off my teeth, or that my teeth would end up glowing in the dark like Ross.</li>
            <li> It is a really simple two step system: first you brush your teeth with the step 1 toothpaste followed by step 2 by adding the whitening gel to your toothbrush and brush for about one minute.</li>
            <li> Normally those types of toothpastes will make my teeth sensitive.  </li>
            <li> In the past many whitening treatments that I hace used irritate my guns, however this gel did not cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> Personally I thought it performed pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem at first thought, until you are in the middle of brushing.  </li>
            <li> From the first time I used this 2-step process, I noticed a big difference!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to use it past a couple uses because of the pain, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first toothpaste is a cleanser that deep cleans, strips away plaque and helps reverse gingivitis while fighting cavities.</li>
            <li> I have used a few different kind of teeth whitening products before, this one by far is the easiest one to use.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s a pretty big bonus.</li>
            <li> However, when I did consistently use it, I noticed several people (including my dental hygienist!)</li>
            <li> I actually find I don&#x27;t rinse as much after finishing with the whitener like I do with regular toothpaste, my teeth/mouth feel fresh.  </li>
            <li> With just two minutes of brushing, youâ€™ll actually feel the difference from the first use.</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;m not sure why Step 1 has more in the tube</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately the second I put the first step in my mouth, I knew it was over.  </li>
            <li> You brush for one minute with the first step and then one minute with the next step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is pretty simple though it took some getting used to.</li>
            <li> I received it as a promotion and was able to try it for the past month.</li>
            <li> At first it did take some time to get used to, but after a couple of weeks it felt like second nature.  </li>
            <li> This time, however, since using Crest Pro Health HD, my teeth look as though they have been whitened professionally at the dentist&#x27;s office!</li>
            <li> Many people have commented on the brightness and whiteness of my teeth over the past month</li>
            <li> First you brush for a minute with the purifying cleanser and, without rinsing, follow that with the second step which is the perfecting gel.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Crest claims you may see, but my teeth were pretty white to start with;  I did see a noticeable change</li>
            <li> After brushing your teeth with the first paste for one minute, you spit it out (DO NOT RINSE per instruction) and brush with the second toothpaste.</li>
            <li> First, my initial use of Crest HD was provided by</li>
            <li> and I think its OK because I am already lazy to brush my teeth</li>
            <li> The toothpaste is a two-step process where you use the first paste for one minute then switch to the second paste for an additional minute.</li>
            <li> Exactly two weeks later, I went for my permanent crown and they said they could see a difference.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m willing to put up with the taste to have such a difference in my teeth.</li>
            <li> The first bottle cleans your teeth like the grainy stuff at the dentist and then the second bottle freshens and whitens!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro Health HD for the past week, and I love the results.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The two step process seemed like it might be a hassle at first, but it&#x27;s actually simple</li>
            <li> While the first step leaves your mouth feeling gritty</li>
            <li> Brush for one minute with the first step, another minute with the second.  </li>
            <li> first night that I brushed, I could feel a difference in the feeling of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I can definitely notice the difference in whitening from this toothpaste, even more so than other whitening toothpastes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much a basic toothpaste and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> and WOW!</li>
            <li> so they were looking pretty white before I started with this product.  </li>
            <li> At first it was a bit of a pain brushing with 2 different toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> Step 1 is the normal toothpaste looking product, while step 2 is a clear gel, which was unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The first tube is a toothpaste, and the second is a whitener.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a bit pricey for my usual toothpaste but even though I use a whitening toothpaste, this is much better.</li>
            <li> As for the whitening I noticed with in a few days that my teeth were becoming whiter</li>
            <li> promised, after a week, my teeth looked considerably whiter and shinier!</li>
            <li> By the end of the first week could already tell were white and shiny.</li>
            <li> I used it religiously for the first 2 weeks twice a day.</li>
            <li> first time I used the Crest Pro Health HD I actually thought I saw a difference in the whiteness of my teeth, but I could not tell if I was just seeing what I was led to believe.  </li>
            <li> I was both weary and excited to try this product as I have tried other teeth whitening products and strips before.</li>
            <li> first thing you should know about this product is that it does NOT taste like your regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This time, however, since using Crest Pro Health HD, my teeth look as though they have been whitened professionally at the dentist&#x27;s office!</li>
            <li> Many people have commented on the brightness and whiteness of my teeth over the past month</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know that I saw 6X the whitening in the first two weeks of me using this product, but I definitely noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> The directions state to brush with the first step for one minute and then spit out the toothpaste without rinsing with water before using the second step.  </li>
            <li> (My husband stopped using the second step after his first time brushing with it because of its taste.)  </li>
            <li> Pricier than what I would usually pay for toothpaste, but as a replacement for toothpaste + a whitening product, definitely more affordable.  </li>
            <li> Its a two step process which you brush with  very gritty tooth paste first,</li>
            <li> (I would post pictures but they look exactly the same).</li>
            <li> (my teeth are already pretty white)</li>
            <li> I received the Crest HD toothpaste system yesterday from BzzAgent as part of a promotion for the brand, and brushed with Crest HD for the first time this morning</li>
            <li> FINALLY ONE THAT REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The two tubes seemed intimidating at first - wondered if I would actually use it...</li>
            <li> The promised whitening effects are also noticeable even after a short period of use, as my teeth definitely look better than they did even a short time ago.  </li>
            <li> My husband went in for a second kiss the first morning I used it.</li>
            <li> I find that 1 minute for the first step is not enough time</li>
            <li> At first I was thinking that this is going to be one thing to add to my daily routine, but after trying I&#x27;m hooked.  </li>
            <li> I will say that Step 1 was a bit bubbly, and was not at all like the toothpaste I&#x27;m used to using, but once I got past that, I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using this product.  </li>
            <li> one minute for the first paste which cleans plaque away, and one minute for the second step which whitens teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Even the first time you use it, your teeth get noticeably whiter, but by the end of one week, my teeth are really white</li>
            <li> First- each step takes only a minute each to use-and combines together</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used a teeth whitener that actually worked.</li>
            <li> After the first week, my teeth were several shades whiter.</li>
            <li> I went back to using the paste regularly and sure enough, the numbness came back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about having two steps, but really it&#x27;s no more effort than what I was doing before.  </li>
            <li> Not too the level of the white strips, but more than any other toothpaste I have used.</li>
            <li> To get them whitened is a pretty big chore.</li>
            <li> This is a two step process the first step you brush your teeth and spit but don&#x27;t rinse and the second part is the polish.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy that this is no longer than regular brushing since I have 2 young children who don&#x27;t give me much personal time.</li>
            <li> My teeth are pretty white to begin with.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve noticed it both personally and in my patients with these products, including this one with the first step</li>
            <li> Not too the level of the white strips, but more than any other toothpaste I have used.</li>
            <li> The first part of brushing is the toothpaste and the second is the whitening.</li>
            <li> The first step is actually cleansing your teeth.</li>
            <li> I think that using two products helps me brush more thoroughly than I usually do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as stunning of a difference as I saw with some other people&#x27;s reviews, but I definitely noticed whiter teeth after using the Crest Pro Health® HD™ for 30 days.</li>
            <li> I found that my teeth were not as sensitive as they were using a normal tartar control, whiteneing toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The only thing that would make me rate this higher is if it could be combined into one product to use.</li>
            <li> Definitely noticed that my teeth were cleaner and felt fresher after the first use.  </li>
            <li> I tried Vivid and was so-so about it, but</li>
            <li> Now, I use my sensitive toothpaste in the morning and Crest Pro Health HD at night, and I&#x27;m no longer having sensitivity issues!</li>
            <li> I was completely surprised!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Just had to get used ti figuring out the exact middle on the Sonicare two minute toothbrush cycle.</li>
            <li> 1 minute for the first step and 1 minute for the second step.</li>
            <li> It is a simple, convenient process and I literally exclaimed &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; after the first use of this system.</li>
            <li> I use a small dot and that is better.  </li>
            <li> I also am not a fan of the sticky texture of the first step (like the flouride treatment you get at the dentist, or the taste of the second step).</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure it was going to work because I have tried other brands strips and tooth paste that gave me no results but after 6 days I noticed a big difference!</li>
            <li> The first step looks and tastes just like the regular Pro-Health toothpaste and the 2nd step is a clear gel similar to a whitening gel, with a light hydrogen peroxide/baking soda taste.  </li>
            <li> and it is a pain to have to monitor the time for one minute with the first toothpaste and then stop it and use the second tube of whitening gel on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a two-step process (obviously) but not a difficult one.</li>
            <li> You brush with the first tube for 1 minute, then, without rinsing, you use the second product for 1 minute.</li>
            <li> but in all fairness my teeth are pretty white to begin with.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty simple:  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I had enough time to try this toothpaste out for a couple weeks first.</li>
            <li> From the first time I used it I noticed a big difference.</li>
            <li> I only brush my teeth in the morning, so this 2-step system feels very lengthy!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth, so I wish there was a way to whiten that didn&#x27;t hurt this!  </li>
            <li> On the first day using the product I mentioned to my brothers and sister since they don&#x27;t see me daily and after a week I wanted to know if they had noticed any changes which they didn&#x27;t confirming what I had</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I use it instead of my regular toothpaste because it comes with a toothpaste as the first step.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I had some tooth pain when I started using this and after a week it&#x27;s completely gone!</li>
            <li> love to read reviews and usually do before buying anything.</li>
            <li> I have used white strips before and other whitening products that have done a better job.</li>
            <li> The first step looks and goes on like a super-thick regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure two tubes is better than one.  </li>
            <li> have attached a picture of my teeth after the first brushing and after the last brushing...</li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased with this product due to the whitening.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> First let me say I am one for WHITE teeth.</li>
            <li> It seemed like it might be a pain at first because there are two different tubes you have to use</li>
            <li> First it only takes 2 minutes, 1 minute to cleanse the teeth with the paste, then another minute to polish them with the gel.</li>
            <li> It fits in pretty easily to a regular brushing routine.</li>
            <li> first you brush with what seems like just a regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My breath was extremely fresh and my mouth felt much cleaner than with any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> You use the first tube for a minute, spit and then brush with the second tube for a minute, spit, brush and rinse.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and will be using this product from now on!</li>
            <li> First you spend 1 min brushing with what seems to be a traditional toothpaste</li>
            <li> I normally use and continue to like Crest Complete with Scope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You are supposed to use the first gel, spit it out but not rinse, then apply the second gel.</li>
            <li> My teeth are pretty white to begin with</li>
            <li> The 2 step process doesn&#x27;t take anymore time than my usual routine and is honestly refreshing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be interested to see if my dentist &amp; hygienist notice the difference at my next appointment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first step is a gritty toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> We both like the flavor of the first paste but don&#x27;t care for the flavor of the second.</li>
            <li> I actually notice my teeth getting whiter after the first use.  </li>
            <li> feelings were exactly the same as mine.  </li>
            <li> My teeth were already pretty white so after a couple weeks of use</li>
            <li> /&gt;The two step process does take a bit of getting used to, as does the gritty feel of the first step of the process.</li>
            <li> and I wonder if that is really necessary for the product to work or if it was something the marketing folks at crest thought would command a higher price when sold.  </li>
            <li> you get your teeth whitened?&amp;#34; Granted, my teeth have always been pretty white</li>
            <li> However, I was very pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> I often forgot the second tube or spit and rinsed after the first tube out of habit.  </li>
            <li> I eventually threw out the second tube and just used the first one.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this toothpaste, as it had a different texture than other ones I have used.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with a good white smile</li>
            <li> When I first received this kit I was a little nervous as I have super sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> My only gripes are that the whitening gel left white spots on my gums right after brushing with it, but those faded relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li> The product requires that you first brush with the paste to clean your teeth then spit NOT rinse, next open the second tube of whitening gel and polish and brush to whiten and polish your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I prefer strong mint flavors so this was something that took a little getting used to for me.</li>
            <li> My teeth were SQUEAKY clean, i brushed my finger against them and they actually squeaked.</li>
            <li> Step one, you brush your teeth with cleanser that is very similar to regular toothpaste for one minute to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> I like that it has two toothpastes you use back to back to help clean my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health® HD™ leaves your mouth feeling extra clean and your teeth looking polished and white.</li>
            <li> I thought teeth could only feel this clean when leaving the dentist, but after using this toothpaste, I feel as if I just left my dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> , this left a gritty feeling my teeth never felt truly clean.  </li>
            <li> and I can whiten and clean in the same step as brushing me teeth daily.  </li>
            <li> After several weeks use, I can say it does leave you with a clean mouth feeling, but as for the whitening effect, it falls short.  </li>
            <li> In fact I feel like I need to brush with regular toothpaste afterwards to get that clean feeling for my tongue and back of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean when using this product, but I have not noticed any difference in how white they are after 2 weeks of using it religiously.  </li>
            <li> It’s similar to that ‘dentist clean’ feeling on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> I will say that my teeth have never felt so clean, other than a dentist&#x27;s cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also, unlike other tooth pastes, I don&#x27;t get the crisps clean minty taste because it leaves a hydrogen peroxide foamy taste.</li>
            <li> It gets my teeth just as clean as the other Crest Pro-Health I was using before.</li>
            <li> I like that foamy bubbly feeling from my toothpaste that makes you feel like it&#x27;s getting your teeth really clean, and some of the other whitening toothpastes don&#x27;t do that.  </li>
            <li> I like that foamy bubbly feeling from my toothpaste that makes you feel like it&#x27;s getting your teeth really clean, and some of the other whitening toothpastes don&#x27;t do that.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean every time I brush but no more clean than my regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My teeth look noticeably whiter (even after one day), and my mouth FEELS clean for way longer than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have never felt my teeth this clean from my other toothpastes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cons are dry mouth when it&#x27;s first used, cost, and so far my teeth haven&#x27;t gotten much whiter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad that I can&#x27;t use it every day because I really do like how it works and how super clean and smooth it makes my teeth.  </li>
            <li> With that being said, I have noticed many positives and very few negatives.  </li>
            <li> Her only feedback was that she found Step One to be more dry or gritty than her toothpaste.a 6x whiter smile, but there is no question my smile was/is a few shades whiter.</li>
            <li> I love the hybrid nature of it, how it is like a cross between conventional toothpaste and whitening trays.</li>
            <li> The first step has a convenient flip top, but I have to open the gel before I start, otherwise I have to put my toothbrush down to open it.</li>
            <li> I was a bit concerned that my sensitive teeth would have a problem switching to a new toothpaste (I have used Sensodyne for over 10 years)</li>
            <li> my mouth felt incredibly clean and fresh, and morning breath is a thing of the past!  </li>
            <li> Eventually, I found myself with a long weekend morning with nothing pressing right after I woke up</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;A cleaning at the Dentist and using this for a month and a half should have your teeth extremely healthy, enough that you can live without it for a year.</li>
            <li> I recommend that everyone who wants a brighter smile for less money, try this new system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to be selected by Crest to try the new Cresh Pro-Health Daily Two Step Toothpaste Process.  </li>
            <li> It leaves you with a very clean feeling due to what I can only think to describe as the &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; in the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> After using it for less than a week you could see a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of is the texture of the step 2 gel; after using the step 1 paste the step 2 gel is a strange consistency</li>
            <li> Since this is a two step process, brushing will take twice as long as before, but I didn&#x27;t really notice this too much.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try this for free, and was hopeful but not sure but would make much difference.</li>
            <li> The second tube, that you use immediately after brushing with the first, contains a clear whitening gel.  </li>
            <li> Since this is a two step process, brushing will take twice as long as before, but I didn&#x27;t really notice this too much.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample to try a week and a half before my wedding, and while my fiance did a whitening gel, I stuck with the Crest Pro Health HD.</li>
            <li> She put a tiny bit of the first paste on a plate (sometimes for fun she mixed in a tiny bit of the flavored crest BE toothpaste, then she dipped her brush in...and using a soft bristled brush, began with the gums and brushed with NOT too much pressure, in a gentle arc.</li>
            <li> I am loving the results already after only a few days!</li>
            <li> After brushing, my teeth felt markedly cleaner and sleeker than with my regular toothpaste after just the first use.</li>
            <li> If you want true whitening you should see your dentist for bleach trays or use white strips like crest white</li>
            <li> It actually helped me ensure that I brushed for the full two minutes!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a loyal Aquafresh user, but when BuzzAgent gave me the change to try this out as part of a promotional campaign, I was curious.  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely not your average toothpaste...and the results are phenomenal!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I have noticed that they feel a bit more sensitive than usual.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the results were average at best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how effective it is since it&#x27;s only on your teeth for a minute, then you rinse it off.  </li>
            <li> The second step has a sweet taste to it and you can feel it working instantly.  </li>
            <li> For the first time in nearly 30 years, I actually look forward to brushing my teeth with this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have tried different whitening strips and whitening toothpastes in the past and have not been completely thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li> two Gel there was a bit of an aftertaste that went away shortly thereafter, not nearly as bad a generic toothpaste.</li>
            <li> After the first week and certainly after the 2nd week I could definitely see a difference in the color of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> My teeth aren&#x27;t ever very sensitive, so I can&#x27;t speak to how it feels on sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I would suggest using a very soft brush if you have a sensitive mouth.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have very sensitive teeth and every time we used a whitening toothpaste our teeth became painfully sensitive.</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive teeth and was worried that using a &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; gel would make my teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums are usually very sensitive to whitening products, but Crest Pro Health HD did not make my teeth hurt or overly sensitive.</li>
            <li> The two steps take some getting used to, especially since you are not supposed to rinse between them, but it takes no longer to brush than normal toothpaste and is now very normal.</li>
            <li> I have tried whitening strips in the past and due to my sensitive teeth I have never been able to get the full effect of the whitening.</li>
            <li> If i do use mouthwash its hard to even keep it in my mouth that long because of how minty my mouth is left after brushing (lol).</li>
            <li> It has actually been a positive experience with it.  </li>
            <li> Now let&#x27;s get on to the not so positive part of this product and for me there is only two:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another positive note is that I didn&#x27;t experience any of the possible side-effects mentioned on the packaging.  </li>
            <li> My husband as well as several of my friends are now using Crest Pro-Health after seeing my positive results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many whitening products in the past - bleach trays from the dentist, white strips, etc. - and always thought it was too much of a hassle.</li>
            <li> the really cool part, too, is that when i awoke the next morning  my teeth still felt smooth , not the least bit fuzzy like how they can feel sometimes.  </li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product from Crest and have been using it consistently for four weeks (missing an occasional morning in the rush to get out of the house).</li>
            <li> I have accidentally started with step 2 at least 5 times, because the colored tubes make more sense to me to use the blue one first</li>
            <li> After the first time I used it, my teeth had that smooth feeling you have after going to the dentist, and after a few uses I noticed a definite improvement in color.</li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;m a busy working mom of two young kids!)  </li>
            <li> Since using Pro-Health HD I have not had ANY bleeding with flossing and my sensitive tooth is no longer sensitive!</li>
            <li> My mouth is far from sensitive however I&#x27;ve found myself stopping the entire process and spitting out before the first minute is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use, gives good results quickly and is less expensive than some other whitening alternatives.  </li>
            <li> Our entire family absolutely LOVES this new product from CREST.  </li>
            <li> I am a sucker for all things new and improved, and more often than not I end up just being a sucker.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Our entire family absolutely LOVES this new product from CREST.</li>
            <li> The gel is a little strange texturally at the beginning but not bad and got used to it quickly.  </li>
            <li> And I did think my side teeth were more noticeably less yellow</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a two step process that is quite easy to use and takes no more time than normal brushing.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> less build-up, more white.  </li>
            <li> , the second step has an odd state but not horrible at all.</li>
            <li> Having to use two tubes is a bit of a hassle, the second tube doesn&#x27;t have a flip top which might have eased the annoyance slightly.</li>
            <li> The 2nd step does have more of a peroxide slightly salty taste, otherwise, this wasn&#x27;t an issue.  </li>
            <li> she&#x27;s going to verify what I already feel - less plaque buildup and healthy, white teeth!</li>
            <li> I can see quick results in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> only downfalls  would point out is that the second step tastes like hydrogen peroxide, but goes away quickly if you use mouthwash after.</li>
            <li> Its simple and quick to use, and only involves two steps.</li>
            <li> might think to use half the amount of toothpaste on each step, equaling a full amount you might normally.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it is a decent product for a decent price; however, I think I will stick to my whitening trays in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;i was lucky today and grabbed the last 2 boxes at my local drug store.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, considering it takes only 2 minutes total, I quickly got over my hesitancy.</li>
            <li> Whitens my teeth pretty quick, though I&#x27;m not sure I have seen six shades whiter yet.</li>
            <li> You get two tubes, the first one functions much like regular toothpaste the second is a clear gel that uses hydrogen peroxide and baking soda to whiten.  </li>
            <li> It forced me to brush longer than I normally would, left my mouth fresh and tarter free and my teeth were whiter in about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> The other MAJOR reason I like the product and will purchase it in the future is that I LOVE the way it made my teeth feel.</li>
            <li> No waiting around with something in your mouth for hours and no mess!</li>
            <li> The only real con I noticed was that the toothpaste made the corners of my mouth a little sore, dry and cracked, kind of like any type of whitening can do.</li>
            <li> The biggest positive to this product is the near instant and thus gratifying whiting.  </li>
            <li> Her only feedback was that she found Step One to be more dry or gritty than her toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This is so much easier than those strips I used to use that you had to wear for 5 minutes that left your teeth sensitive and slimy!</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I saw the price, (I received a complimentary package from BzzAgent), because it was much higher than I expected, but after doing some research, it seems like that&#x27;s pretty average for a whitening system.  </li>
            <li> Now I can wear my favorite bold shades of lipstick without feeling like my teeth will look dull or not white enough.  </li>
            <li> I never thought that I&#x27;d switch from the Crest  3D White toothpaste and accompanying Crest Brilliance polish that I&#x27;ve been using for the past year, but I did and am very pleased, as was my dentist who feels that this new approach is the wave of the future.  </li>
            <li> the second bottle of whitener and polish is a large twist off cap.  </li>
            <li> But I assure you, all my teeth got whiter - unlike the strips that only hit certain</li>
            <li> Since everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different, that warning may have to be there in case it applies to a certain segment of the population.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The combo works well, and the results certainly justify the extra minute of effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For now I will stick with Regular Crest 3D tooth paste but look forward to new Crest products!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have thought they&#x27;d be able to get it down to just one step, but apparently not.</li>
            <li> I am a little concerned that it may be wearing away my tooth enamel and plan to look into it, just because they now feel so smooth.  </li>
            <li> I think for someone looking for a little bit of brightening would enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Crest Pro Health HD as part of a promotion from Crest little over a week ago</li>
            <li> After using it for a little over 2 weeks, my teeth and mouth feel and look fabulous.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think it&#x27;s worth a shot, especially if you don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth &amp; can finish the tubes!</li>
            <li> And the taste of Crest Pro Health® HD™ is far superior than any other toothpastes that I had used in the past.</li>
            <li> Flavor wise this toothpaste is very weak.</li>
            <li> Flavor wise this toothpaste is very weak.</li>
            <li> The big difference for me is how clean my teeth feel ALL DAY long, even after eating.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the 2 step process, while adding a little bit of time, made a huge difference in how my teeth felt.  </li>
            <li> It turns out it does make your teeth a little bit more white.  </li>
            <li> We were both simply amazed at how white our teeth were after the first use!</li>
            <li> I do have dental work on my top front teeth, but not on the bottom and those teeth always looked a little darker, especially since I&#x27;m a coffee and tea drinker.</li>
            <li> Not sure that the extra clean feeling was worth the 2-step brushing process.</li>
            <li> I could instantly feel how clean my teeth felt all day and barely any plaque was present by the time I got home from work.</li>
            <li> It does a little.. but the white strips work a 1000x&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> The kit seemed far more serious than my normal tube of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not in love with the fact that you can&#x27;t rinse your mouth between pastes, that&#x27;s hard for me.</li>
            <li> The downside is, due to the product size, the product goes quickly.  </li>
            <li> The first few times you use it don&#x27;t be surprised if you find yourself feeling your teeth with your tongue several times a day just to marvel at how clean they feel.</li>
            <li> and I find it a little more trouble than it&#x27;s worth to have to use each tube for 1 minute twice a day.  </li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of the Crest Pro Health products already, and this didn&#x27;t let me down!</li>
            <li> The interesting part of the process is my lips and mouth do not feel dry after brushing as they sometimes do with other toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The same concept applies to Crest Pro-Health HD, if you put a little extra effort into taking care of your teeth, you&#x27;ll really appreciate the outcome even more.</li>
            <li> As someone who regularly uses White Strips for whitening my teeth, I was excited to try the new Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step toothpaste as apart of the BzzAgent.com</li>
            <li> The clean feeling is very long lasting as well.</li>
            <li> The flavor of the toothpaste tastes great as well, without having an artificial flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 2 step system is really convenient - there are no messy trays or gross tasting strips to let sit on your teeth.</li>
            <li> The fresh feeling when you are done brunching is great because I hate having the after taste of food lingering after I brush.</li>
            <li> The clear gel (step 2) brightens and polishes your teeth.</li>
            <li> I clearly don&#x27;t leave another time before work.</li>
            <li> This tube is a gel, clear, and it&#x27;s the whitener/polisher.  </li>
            <li> I typically use Crest Pro Health toothpaste, because I like how clean it makes my mouth feel.  </li>
            <li> Step 2 is a clear gel with peroxide to whiten the teeth.</li>
            <li> but I can clearly see the results.</li>
            <li> Step Two is the whitener, which is a clear substance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;re done with that you&#x27;ll use the perfecting gel which clearly is peroxide based as you can feel it bubbling in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> As far as it making your teeth 6 times whiter,  I have not seen that much difference in the shade of white that my teeth are.  </li>
            <li> It is a clear jell with from what I can tell no flavor.</li>
            <li> My gums became very irritated from the constant brushing, they were sensitive and would bleed.</li>
            <li> Step Two is the whitener, which is a clear substance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> DO NOT rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2 is the polish which is a clear gel.</li>
            <li> 2: again tube clearly labeled 2. put that on your non rinsed tooth brush and continuing brushing for an additional minute.</li>
            <li> I had a dental appointment about half way through using this product and my hygenist comentted on how clean my teeth were looking.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t rinse, then you apply the clear tooth polisher again you brush for another minute.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear from the product packaging that this is intended to be a results driven product...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear, somewhat runny or watery gel.  </li>
            <li> The instructions clearly state that you must brush with the toothpaste for 1 minute, spit but not rinse, then</li>
            <li> one tip I would give is that because you are only brushing with each step for a minute, you really have to make a conscious effort to reach all surfaces of your teeth in both steps.</li>
            <li> A clear gel like stuff</li>
            <li> - Perfecting Gel (clear gel) removes the stains and whitens the teeth.  </li>
            <li> step looks like a clear gel.</li>
            <li> As far as the whitening process goes, It took me until the 2nd week to really notice a difference.</li>
            <li> but it is in clear color</li>
            <li> but it is in clear color</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely clear, and less-viscous than toothpaste, and sort of absorbs into the bristles of your tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Then after a minute, I added tube 2, which is the clear gel</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried out different whitening products before; whitening strips and mouthwash make my teeth hurt and end up being sensitive for days, and whitening toothpaste doesn&#x27;t really seem to do anything.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t mind a two-step process; it kind of makes me want to brush my teeth for two minutes without getting bored.  </li>
            <li> , so I have stayed clear from them for awhile.</li>
            <li> I did have to switch to a sensitive tooth brush instead of soft as the product does tend to cause tender gums</li>
            <li> My teeth are just as white as before I used this product (a month straight).</li>
            <li> As a person with sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> And to be clear, I do not have sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> I do have sensitive teeth and gums though.  </li>
            <li> After the second week I really started to notice results.  </li>
            <li> Oddly enough, I&#x27;m looking forward to finishing this product off and seeing what it can really do over the course of a month or so....</li>
            <li> At first it seemed a bit strange to have to brush my teeth twice</li>
            <li> I would give the product 4 starts for now, just because I have not seen any whitening action on my teeth after a week.</li>
            <li> but then you move on to the second paste, like a gel, really, and the dryness goes away.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s too early to tell if my teeth are whiter, but they do feel cleaner</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem using whiting stuff because it hurts my gums or makes my teeth sensitive.  </li>
            <li> This product only takes two minutes, covers the whole mouth, and does not hurt at all.</li>
            <li> I really like the neutral taste of the second step, so</li>
            <li> all it works however the packaging needs work and old habits have to be broken.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Second, because it&#x27;s a timed two-step system, it really encourages me to be mindful about my brushing time, which I admit, I sometimes slack off on.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I was concerned that it would enhance my already sensitive teeth&#x27;s sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health HD completely blew it, and all others, away.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and had been using Sensodyne for years before this, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with increased sensitivity since switching.</li>
            <li> This helped with my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel professionally cleaned.</li>
            <li> So far this product has lived up to the description/advantages printed on both box and tube.</li>
            <li> teeth are sensitive in spots</li>
            <li> and she made a statement that surprised me.  </li>
            <li> I had nearly given up on my teeth being white(r).</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health® HD is a 2-step toothpaste system, each taking 1 minute to complete.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I could actually note the difference that my teeth were much whiter than they had been before.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health HD has been a breeze so far.</li>
            <li> you know that this product is the real deal made from the same stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, by the 7 or 8-day mark, there was a difference in the shade of my teeth (not astounding, but noticeable for sure), and now that I&#x27;ve been using this for close to a month, my teeth are even whiter still.</li>
            <li> so I i have a natural discoloration, something that I am embarrassed about.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have time for the whitening strips and they make my teeth sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I was worried about sensitivity, because I have sensitive teeth, but it has not bothered me at all.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth, and while this isn&#x27;t a toothpaste FOR sensitive teeth, it didn&#x27;t aggravate or bother my teeth or gums at all.</li>
            <li> I also like the polishing gel, since it hasn&#x27;t made my teeth sensitive, but I do feel like they look whiter.</li>
            <li> If you have issues with morning breath (don&#x27;t we all?), want whiter teeth, or have sensitive teeth and need a whitener that won&#x27;t cause pain, give Crest Pro Health HD a try.</li>
            <li> The gel used in Step 2 reminded me of the old gel fluoride treatments that dentists used to give after a cleaning.  </li>
            <li> For years, I paid for professional teeth whitening with my dentist.  </li>
            <li> I took a 3 day break and started again, and so far no pain.</li>
            <li> I use this two step kit every morning along with my Crest whitening toothpaste at night, and I could feel a whole lot of different in the cleanliness of my teeth!!!!</li>
            <li> It does not make my teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li> I may be allergic or otherwise sensitive to something in this product.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth or a sensitive mouth, you might want to avoid this one.</li>
            <li> Wow I have been a crest fan for years</li>
            <li> As a busy mom of two, I don&#x27;t have time to deal with that stuff.</li>
            <li> It did not make my teeth sensitive</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> but because you are applying the toothpaste and whitening solution directly to the teeth you don&#x27;t have to worry about that happening.</li>
            <li> The 2 step process is really simple, 1 minute for each item, 2x a day and the whitening effect is really noticeable.</li>
            <li> This product is much easier to use than whitening strips and you can just replace your current toothpaste with it.</li>
            <li> It also protects my sensitive teeth with the added</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s much faster than having to wear noticeable white strips for 30 minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> 2-step process is extremely simple and does not take too much additional time out of my daily morning routine (when crunch time really matters).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: I have now completely used my Crest Pro-Health HD Two-Step Toothpaste System.</li>
            <li> Perhaps my teeth are just too far gone...  </li>
            <li> The directions do say to use this toothpaste twice per day, but as I have sensitive teeth, I have been doing once a day, just in case.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using it as well, and he has noticed a considerable difference in his teeth, so</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised at the results.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised when I immediately saw results.</li>
            <li> and it works well on those teeth as well as my natural</li>
            <li> It is a bit wintergreeny - which is my least favorite flavor.</li>
            <li> routine!&lt;br /&gt;While the step 1 paste is a bit thicker and grittier than traditional toothpaste, I&#x27;ve felt that my mouth is much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I really really like this Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> so I have been using it for nearly a month.</li>
            <li> As part of a free trial pack, I received the Crest Pro Health HD pack a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> Makes you brush longer since you have two parts to complete which alone will get your teeth cleaner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> My mouth felt gummy and soft.</li>
            <li> routine!have just become a part of my natural routine.</li>
            <li> I felt like I just had a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li> than have the dentist do a professional whitening job and works</li>
            <li> It drys my mouth out completely and leaves a chemically taste.</li>
            <li> Whitening toothpastes don&#x27;t really whiten the internal part of your tooth.</li>
            <li> But if you do not have sensitive gums or gum recession, then I recommend trying this.  </li>
            <li> After nearly a week of use, my years of abuse (tea) appear to be disappearing.  </li>
            <li> At that point they are still sensitive, but it starts to subside.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My gums are generally sensitive, and this issue may not happen to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> my testing is complete, I plan to continue to use this product, providing my gum sensitivity</li>
            <li> my testing is complete, I plan to continue to use this product, providing my gum sensitivity</li>
            <li> This surprised me a bit because I brush longer than two minutes.</li>
            <li> Even though it is a 2-step process it really takes no longer than using regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> like i just got a professional cleaning from my dentist.  </li>
            <li> The real test was waking up the next morning to see how my mouth felt and smelled.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive gums and this toothpaste did not irriateate my gums.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone with sensitive gums looking for a whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> So far based on my experience</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a busy, working parent; there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d have time for that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> It is fantastic, but for everyday people, it&#x27;s a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> There is that old saying, &amp;#34;The</li>
            <li> it went away completely with Step 1.</li>
            <li> No waste here!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has also made my teeth a bit sensitive.</li>
            <li> I get canker sores on occasion and while using this toothpaste I have had much fewer which is definitely a pro for me.</li>
            <li> Wow, did I just get my teeth professionally cleaned??  </li>
            <li> It is actually not that much work and</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any whitening yet, but it is early yet.</li>
            <li> I am rarely surprised by products.</li>
            <li> I found that my gums were sensitive to the ingredients</li>
            <li> If some have sensitive teeth, I can see where this might be an issue.</li>
            <li> and I noticed there was considerably lest scraping involved.  </li>
            <li> If you get any on your chin, if you have sensitive skin, you&#x27;ll see some redness.</li>
            <li> However, my mouth feels much cleaner after using this product rather than regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I really like using Crest Pro-Health HD Daily.</li>
            <li> I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 as I have had my teeth professionally whitened at the dentist.  </li>
            <li> When I first received this product, I thought the two steps were going to be a pain or take too long</li>
            <li> I wish they made this in a sensitive formula.</li>
            <li> but  for the results I have been getting so far</li>
            <li> I have never had results like these unless I was using strips that made my sensitive teeth hurt.</li>
            <li> My teeth are sensitive, and I have had issues with whiting products before.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health two step far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Plus, I&#x27;ve been trained by dentists to realize that OTC whitening products will only help me so much.</li>
            <li> but he said this by far is the easiest.  </li>
            <li> have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth, but this product hasn&#x27;t bothered my teeth nor my gums at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have noticed some whitening effects but it is early days yet .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I was not sure what to expect when I first got the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste from Crest to try for free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier than the whitening strips, since  it doesn&#x27;t require you to do what you aren&#x27;t already doing by brushing your teeth daily.</li>
            <li> not for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I am not going to my old paste now.  </li>
            <li> However, I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I do appreciate that it also did not leave my teeth sensitive the way whitening strips do.  </li>
            <li> So far I have seen some difference in my teeth and gum lines.</li>
            <li> Even my 11 year old son keeps taking it upstairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a busy mom and at the thought of a two step process I was like</li>
            <li> Even my 12 year old who does not sugarcoat anything noticed and commented on my teeth now that&#x27;s saying something</li>
            <li> My teeth are too sensitive for whitening products like Whitestrips, but I have no adverse reaction to this system, so I will stick with it and see if with time it will have some whitening effects.</li>
            <li> Got compliments too, which was unexpected.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised how well this product works.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive at all.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that my teeth sensitivity did not worsen.</li>
            <li> I received this toothpaste as part of a BzzAgent campaign and have been using it for nearly a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After week 3, my teeth look like they were professionally whitened.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Previously I had been using a toothpaste specifically for sensitive teeth, so I was concerned going into this trial about an increase in sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that the Crest Pro Health HD whitening system that BzzAgent sent me did make a difference in the brightness and whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> After a couple of days, the routine sticks and becomes natural.</li>
            <li> I did not see professional strength whitening</li>
            <li> I am highly sensitive to Sodium Lauryl Sulfate.</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> i coudnt even keep them for a minute because i developed shooting pain in my teeth.</li>
            <li> I compare it to the feeling of just leaving the dentist office from having a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> teeth are sensitive in spots</li>
            <li> The two step-process does take some getting used to, but once I got a hang of it, I realized it was much faster than brushing with regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My teeth have felt much cleaner and healthier the last couple of days</li>
            <li> I even had to verify the results with my wife, and she was surprised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received several compliments on how much whiter my teeth are now.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see much progress even though I brushed my teeth twice a day.</li>
            <li> I was sent a sample by Bzzagent in order to complete this review.  </li>
            <li> This surprised me a bit because I brush longer than two minutes.</li>
            <li> After three weeks, my teeth still feel weirdly sensitive after every use.</li>
            <li> I was nervous that I would feel that 2 tubes of toothpaste would be too time consuming, but it didn&#x27;t take up as much time as I thought it would initially.</li>
            <li> And since the whole process only takes 2 minutes it&#x27;s tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That evening, I gave it a go, using a soft manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This product does almost completely eliminate morning-breath.  </li>
            <li> I really like how all of my teeth, including the backside, are white and not just the front ones as when using a whitening strip.  </li>
            <li> My teeth sometimes feel a tad bit sensitive after using both</li>
            <li> Like I said, I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now, but I am nowhere near done with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it about two weeks now, and although it hasn&#x27;t made much difference in the darkest stains on my teeth, it does seem to have improved the overall look of my teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome</li>
            <li> It only takes 2 minutes to complete the process, so it doesn&#x27;t take any longer than brushing your teeth with normal, ineffective toothpaste; I actually prefer the two step method because it breaks up the monotony or brushing your teeth for 2 consistent minutes.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent and Crest for the promo trial of this great product!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always skeptical of products that seem so simple but make big claims.</li>
            <li> Second, I did not see much of a whitening effect in the 1 week the label promised.</li>
            <li> Be sure to follow the directions and use at least 2x a day.</li>
            <li> it made them a bit sensitive</li>
            <li> There are no messy strips or trays and no tooth sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> I also cannot afford to get my teeth professionally whitened.</li>
            <li> It looks like I have been using professional whitening products.  </li>
            <li> I received the toothpaste yesterday and have so far used it twice yesterday and once today.</li>
            <li> AllI have to say is WOW.</li>
            <li> My husband is trying it too, and he has sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week so far</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> To my surprise the Crest HD system has so far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I feel like my teeth and breath are so much cleaner than using regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I plan to keep using daily to see how much whiter my teeth might get.</li>
            <li> The process is really quite simple.</li>
            <li> I am an early user</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re expecting miracles and celebrity-white teeth, consult a dentist for professional whitening products.</li>
            <li> my sensitive gums twice.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive</li>
            <li> Plus loses a star for the taste not my favorite but Definetly doable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with my old</li>
            <li> my teeth will become sensitive.</li>
            <li> I used once a day and then used a toothpaste for sensitive teeth at night to counteract the sensitivity caused by the Crest Pro Heath HD system.  </li>
            <li> rinse mouth until teeth are completely brushed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference early on, and I have had several people compliment me on my white smile.</li>
            <li> that reason, I&#x27;ve drastically cut back on how much I&#x27;m using it.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that I was surprised with how well it works.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s been a week</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t overly whiten your teeth to the point that they no longer look real, but it gives it a naturally white look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Prior to my trying out this product, I really didn&#x27;t have any stains on my teeth</li>
            <li> My teeth feel much cleaner using this system then regular paste.</li>
            <li> this product was not a waste</li>
            <li> Really, two weeks after my dental cleaning and my teeth still look like I just left the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I was was surprised in the difference.  </li>
            <li> And as far as I am concerned, I see no change in the color of my</li>
            <li> I was surprised with the results.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth, so used this in conjunction with my sensodyn.  </li>
            <li> This has been the simplest way to get whiter cleaner teeth so far.</li>
            <li> Do I have sensitive teeth?</li>
            <li> So I would say that this product is not recommended if you have sensitive teeth, so it is not a product for me!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> With today&#x27;s busy world, the thought of brushing my teeth and taking 2 steps to do this was not something I was looking forward to doing.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t completely sold on the idea of using two products to brush my teeth when I received samples of this line from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> It feels like a professional job.</li>
            <li> I told my 10 year old daughter about it.</li>
            <li> Crest spent more time with the technical requirements of the bleaching paste than they did the use of the entire system.  </li>
            <li> Dentists always said that I&#x27;d have to get my teeth professionally bleached (of course they did)</li>
            <li> I made sure to do everything as normally as possible - same toothbrush, same place, same time.</li>
            <li> I really wonder if I am the only one who has done this!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The pros by far outweigh the cons.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health HD comes with two tubes that are marked Step 1 and Step 2.  </li>
            <li> I also take exception to the amount of packaging that this toothpaste entails (I feel very wasteful) and I&#x27;m leery of stannous fluoride, which may actually stain the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You rinse after this step is complete.  </li>
            <li> I tend to be sensitive to whitening toothpastes, and my teeth didn&#x27;t tingle when using this step.</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised by this one considering the claims.  </li>
            <li> I am 40 yrs old with no cavities (knock on wood)</li>
            <li> And even though, stopping in the middle to reapply toothpaste is a bother, I really like the results.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels alive after using this paste.  </li>
            <li> I gave it the 4 stars only because  I really did not notice any whiten of my teeth after a month of use.</li>
            <li> The whole experience left my mouth feeling like it does after leaving the dentist office.</li>
            <li> My friends have all asked if I got them done professionally.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as convenience, yes, it is a two step process.</li>
            <li> Hey I&#x27;m old and I drink coffee ALL DAY</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth, and I notice no increased sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Plus, after just a week, my four year old daughter is commenting on my teeth being &amp;#34;shiny!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health HD comes with two tubes for a complete 2 step process.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used strips, whitening products, whitening pastes, professional whitening and nothing</li>
            <li> After about two days and tenderness disappeared completely.  </li>
            <li> I am very fond of their toothpastes and this one is no different.  </li>
            <li> like I&#x27;m actually brushing more carefully since I have to use the two different products.  </li>
            <li> It totally knocks out that morning coffee-breath and leaves my teeth and mouth ready for the day.  </li>
            <li> The sensitivity had become completely unbearable and I had to discontinue its use.</li>
            <li> I do, however, absolutely recommend the Crest Pro Health® toothpaste only as a stand alone product.  </li>
            <li> I do, however, absolutely recommend the Crest Pro Health® toothpaste only as a stand alone product.  </li>
            <li> -- I felt like I&#x27;d just had a professional dental cleaning.</li>
            <li> -- I felt like I&#x27;d just had a professional dental cleaning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to brushing my teeth for the complete 2 minutes (I have an electric toothbrush)</li>
            <li> I brushed longer and could really feel the effects of the two formulas working together to get rid of plaque.</li>
            <li> I would also like to see this made in a sensitive teeth formula and then all of my concerns would be covered.  </li>
            <li> My 16 yr old daughter has braces for 2 years  now causing stains on her teeth .</li>
            <li> Then complete Step 2 for 1 minute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within 5 days</li>
            <li> /&gt;As of this writing, however, my teeth are still far from tv-commercial brilliance.  </li>
            <li> THEM SEEM NATURALLY</li>
            <li> I think the second step doesn&#x27;t really taste like anything but its a gel which has improved the whiteness of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will post again after I&#x27;ve had a week to see how much whiter my teeth actually get.</li>
            <li> I even have sensitive gums and this did not irritate me in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to BzzAgent and Crest</li>
            <li> and this is by far the easiest system to use.  </li>
            <li> After a week it seems completely natural.</li>
            <li> These last six days have been a real change for me.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t for me so far.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is step 2 tasted very &amp;#34;medication like&amp;#34; to me...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take any longer to brush, but it leaves my teeth feeling so much cleaner than regular toothpaste!</li>
            <li> In my opinion it is the closest feeling of having a professional cleaning service at your dentist office.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised and completely distracted throughout the remainder of the afternoon</li>
            <li> I received everything I needed from the dentist to professionally whiten my teeth at home</li>
            <li> I expect that this toothpaste will extend the results of professional whitening.</li>
            <li> After using both of these, my teeth feel like they have had a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a fan of whitening strips because I have sensitive teeth and gums and,</li>
            <li> Your teeth are cleaner, whiter and you don&#x27;t have to shell out so much money for white strips!</li>
            <li> for those of you who also have periodontal disease, using this treatment according to instructions (and flossing) is likely to  be very therapeutic for your gums as well.</li>
            <li> for those of you who also have periodontal disease, using this treatment according to instructions (and flossing) is likely to  be very therapeutic for your gums as well.</li>
            <li> now I do notice a considerable difference.</li>
            <li> this routine you complete</li>
            <li> After using it my gums have been sensitive.</li>
            <li> I decided to try having my adult child try the Crest Pro Health HD.  </li>
            <li> But dang were my teeth sensitive as a result.  </li>
            <li> The Crest Pro Health HD products initially seem to work very well.  </li>
            <li> my teeth definitely felt much cleaner for longer.</li>
            <li> I am a professional blogger over at [...]</li>
            <li> Didn’t like the sensitive feeling</li>
            <li> The second step left my teeth smooth like I &amp;#34;just back from the dentist&amp;#34; feel rather than a &amp;#34;just</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth you should be a bit cautious.  </li>
            <li> It also made my teeth a bit mor sensitive after a couple of uses.  </li>
            <li> like I just had a professional cleaning at the dentist.</li>
            <li> Each step asks that you brush for 1 minute with each gel, step 1 for 1 minute, directly followed by step 2 for 1 minute.</li>
            <li> I feel you should use the paste, rinse and then complete the routine with the gel.  </li>
            <li> I like the flavor of the paste, and the 2nd step gel doesn&#x27;t really have a flavor at all.</li>
            <li> and like the results I&#x27;ve seen so far, so I&#x27;m going to stick with it for a while.</li>
            <li> Do I have sensitive teeth?</li>
            <li> So I would say that this product is not recommended if you have sensitive teeth, so it is not a product for me!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised-</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised again-</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a bit surprised at the look and feel of the packaging when it arrived</li>
            <li> I said, my teeth didn&#x27;t need a whole lot of whitening to begin with, but I have noticed that they look a bit brighter since starting this regimen.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums tend to be particularly sensitive to whitening products, so I probably won&#x27;t use it again for at least another 6-12 months to keep sensitivity at bay, but I have been quite pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a busy mom</li>
            <li> This product did not make my teeth feel sensitive.</li>
            <li> I noticed a marked difference in just one week</li>
            <li> On the off days, I use a non-fluoride natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li> or it&#x27;s just stubborn stains near my gums.  </li>
            <li> (Whitening strips do make my teeth terribly sensitive</li>
            <li> even the dentist was surprised that no cavities nor gum disease was appearing.</li>
            <li> Overall this product worked very well</li>
            <li> After receiving a free sample, I&#x27;ve been trying Crest Pro Health HD for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Overall I would highly highly recommended this product!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Sometimes, &amp;#34;two minutes&amp;#34; is probably more like 30 seconds when it&#x27;s late at night, and I&#x27;m a sleep</li>
            <li> and I felt plaque build up much quicker on my teeth throughout the day when using regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> and I felt plaque build up much quicker on my teeth throughout the day when using regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> However, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> but so far I have not noticed a change in my teeth so far in using this product.</li>
            <li> I like that 2 ingredients are marked Step 1 and 2</li>
            <li> I really like the idea of keeping it simple by just brushing your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Crest for finally making a product that works!</li>
            <li> I had been using my old toothpaste for years and never even wanted to try another one.</li>
            <li> It almost felt like I hadn&#x27;t rinsed my mouth completely.  </li>
            <li> I think the combination of left over paste residue and the improved taste of the whitening product has really helped.  </li>
            <li> You can feel the particles in action.</li>
            <li> By the third day, (I really wanted to stick with this...</li>
            <li> and my teeth have not been sensitive after using this 2 step process that takes about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> that 2 ingredients are marked Step 1 and Step 2.</li>
            <li> I did not notice a big change in \\&quot;morning breath\\&quot; but that is also not something I really think about.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very conscientious about following the instructions faithfully.  </li>
            <li> As a busy mom of 3 young kids, I consider it an achievement to wash my face, brush my teeth, and floss on some nights.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I&#x27;m reaching for my old toothpaste.</li>
            <li> /addition I could ask for would be one that includes the possibility of having sensitive teeth protection as well.</li>
            <li> I have always switched back-and-forth when choosing toothpaste each day between some days using my whitening toothpaste and some days using my husbands sensitive toothpaste.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to worry about sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> As far as the whitening, I did take before and after photos and did notice some lightening of the teeth.</li>
            <li> If you get your teeth cleaned professionally and want to keep them cleaned then use this product otherwise</li>
            <li> I recently had the opportunity to try This product thanks to Smiley360.</li>
            <li> I recently received the opportunity to try this product thanks to BzzAgent &amp; Crest.</li>
            <li> You can see my teeth are still somewhat dingy in the tell tale corners and crevices, but overall much brighter and whiter looking.</li>
            <li> FYI it does make your teeth sensitive</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> After every brush I feel like I just left the dentist and only after one week I could already see a whiter smile.</li>
            <li> While results are likely to vary, the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step system is worth trying.  </li>
            <li> The next day I saw a big difference in my smile.</li>
            <li> so it was worth a shot but after using I don&#x27;t see a reason to spent that type of money for toothpaste baking soda</li>
            <li> My teen son, we&#x27;ll let just say morning breath is a lot more tolerable and not an issue after a few days of continued use.</li>
            <li> However, if I only use it a few times a week, I&#x27;m okay.  </li>
            <li> Only four stars because I feel that the fresh breath feeling fades faster than regular toothpaste</li>
            <li> 1 tastes fresh and is similar to a regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It gives you a feeling of deep cleansing, being refreshed and a sparkling white smile.</li>
            <li> I am happier to smile wide now.  </li>
            <li> Even when taking picture, I would usually smile with my mouth closed.</li>
            <li> The extra step is only a minute &amp; for the result, well worth it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few friends ask how I keep my teeth so white, and I gladly recommend Crest Pro-Health HD.</li>
            <li> I am going to be purchasing this again before my vacation in a few months to make sure my teeth are as white as they can be!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about this product being able to produce the results promised, I did notice a difference in the brightness of my smile.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had the patience for white strips which I tried briefly without much success.</li>
            <li> The only downside to this product is the extra time and effort that is required for the two steps, but I do think it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> so suffice it to say that I&#x27;ve tried more than a few different toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> After using the Crest Pro Health HD system for a few weeks, I can safely say that my teeth and mouth do feel cleaner than regular toothpaste and for longer.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the extra money or the extra step that is required.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a lot of different brands and types of toothpastes over the last few years and tried to keep as good care of my teeth as possible.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s just enough to leave my mouth feeling fresh and just brushed after I finish brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This system works much more slowly</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about the claims of &amp;#34;whiter teeth in just one week.&amp;#34; Surprisingly, this product lives up to the hype.</li>
            <li> If budget is an issue (or this product is as expensive as the boxed packaging suggests), it might be a good alternative.</li>
            <li> flavor is good and isnt too minty and the gel isnt like some gels where they have a weird after taste.</li>
            <li> After the first step my mouth would feel a little dry but once finishing the second step I was able to rinse and refresh things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would have occasional bleeding with flossing and one tooth in particular that felt very sensitive when I flossed it.</li>
            <li> I did not get the squeaky clean and smooth feeling like other Crest toothpaste I used in the past.</li>
            <li> I would not normally purchase this product as I&#x27;m very particular about my dental hygene and following a pretty strick cleaning process.</li>
            <li> For the past several weeks, I have been trying the new crest Pro Health HD toothpaste thanks to crest for sending me a free sample of this product.</li>
            <li> However upon further inspection, the fine print states &amp;#34;than other leading brands&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My teeth are noticeably whiter (like I used a bleaching tray but without the weird spots) and they feel super clean!  </li>
            <li> only complaint would be the flavor - it is a strong wintergreen sort of flavor, which might be perfect for some but as someone who prefers a natural peppermint oil taste, seems very fake to me.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first (as I am with most new products I try).</li>
            <li> I noticed a cleaner feeling right away and a definite whiter smile in a few days.</li>
            <li> While I only noticed a slight difference in the whiteness of my teeth, my mouth felt healthier and this toothpaste had a great taste that lasted longer than usual.  </li>
            <li> have only been using 1 time a day (at night) and I have experienced no tooth sensitivity in the past week and a half.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to use the whitening gel right after the toothpaste, so if you don&#x27;t ration out the whitening gel correctly you&#x27;ll be left with extra toothpaste once you run out of whitening gel.</li>
            <li> Also, I have very sensitive and have never been able to use whiting strips or other products without stopping due to the pain.  </li>
            <li> As for the second step, I like it a little less because its taste is not as pleasant.</li>
            <li> With that potential con eliminated from the picture, I can only say positive things about this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> My teeth have definitely become whiter and the stains are becoming less noticeable.</li>
            <li> How lucky was I to get this opportunity with Crest after such a long year, I had to take advantage.  </li>
            <li> It has a small flavor of the typical whitening gels, but the flavor is also good.</li>
            <li> I was very nervous at first to try Crest Pro Health HD because previously I had used the Pro Health mouth rinse and it stained my teeth.</li>
            <li> I had some mild staining from the braces that I had as a teen long ago.  </li>
            <li> There are a lot of reasons to love this product, but the immediate gratification of no more morning breath is forefront in my mind!  </li>
            <li> - it is more medicinal/typical of other whitening products I have used, such as Crest White Strips -</li>
            <li> Something that simple to do that provides similar results to other products out there that involve much more time</li>
            <li> I have been hesitant about in office treatments and whitening strips because I feared it would not respond well to whitening (and potentially just stand out more), but this product gives me hope for further improvement because it has already brought it shades closer to the whiteness of my other teeth.</li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to a two-step process, but it was so worth it!</li>
            <li> This is certainly a good way to go about making your smile whiter and look cleaner compared to other expensive</li>
            <li> It is more expensive than regular toothpaste, but definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> It had a lot of foam which I personally like and will be replacing my normal Sensodyne with this product!</li>
            <li> (I have 3 young kids, so I sometimes feel lucky to manage the basics of personal hygiene), and the whole slight fizzing issue...  </li>
            <li> (I have 3 young kids, so I sometimes feel lucky to manage the basics of personal hygiene), and the whole slight fizzing issue...  </li>
            <li> and I was able to see difference in my teeth from Yellow to a very light yellow (but not super white like few others has posted).</li>
            <li> If you are looking for perceptible whiteness and your teeth are not very stained, this is probably not the right product.</li>
            <li> I used it right away, and put it in the center of the bathroom counter and encouraged my husband to try it too.</li>
            <li> I noticed some slight whitening the first few weeks but nothing very significant.  </li>
            <li> The whole process only takes two minutes total, and you don&#x27;t need to use very much of each product when compared to regular toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I had the chance to sample Crest Pro Health HD for free, I figured it would be about the same as all of the other whitening products out there.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my teeth, but I did notice that my mouth was extremely dry.</li>
            <li> is that it feels pretty dry, but after rinsing with water and mouthwash it goes</li>
            <li> I am a 39 year old mom with braces due to and accident and tend to hide my smile.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I usually share 1 tube of toothpaste in the master bathroom, and I feel like this would be gone very quickly if two people used it.  </li>
            <li> After step 1, it left my mouth feeling kind of dry and slightly sandy or grimy.</li>
            <li> I suppose for people who regularly use whitening products, it is probably easier and faster than whitening strips or other treatments that are available.</li>
            <li> The paste in step 1 leaves your mouth feeling dry but not uncomfortable.</li>

            <li> The two step process may be a little off-putting at first, and I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that it&#x27;s easy to forget not to rinse my mouth after step 1 when I am tired and getting ready for bed on autopilot, but the product works.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste that you use in step one has a very familiar feel to it, however the second step polish is different and took some getting used to due to the feel of the gel sitting on your teeth.</li>
            <li> Now I consider my teeth to be a pretty average white/off-white (however you consider it), so I didn&#x27;t need a major whitening, but I feel like I didn&#x27;t really see any whitening at all.  </li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t like the taste of traditional anti-sensitivity toothpastes, but more on taste of this toothpaste in a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> All in all, this product is inconvenient to use, and wasn&#x27;t very effective.</li>
            <li> so I have sampled a wide variety of toothpastes and I can honestly say this is the only toothpaste I have used that holds up to promises of long lasting freshness.</li>
            <li> I used to have very sensitive teeth and typically used sensitive toothpaste, but this works much better than Sensodyne or any other sensitive toothpaste I have used.</li>
            <li> but I did feel that my teeth were a little whiter and felt clean.</li>
            <li> teeth feel &amp;#34;fresh from the dentist&amp;#34; clean and a little whiter.</li>
            <li> It is a blue gel that I found was most similar to conventional toothpaste that I was used to.  </li>
            <li> It made my mouth super dry although this doesn&#x27;t last long&lt;</li>
            <li> I think that the whitening part of it might be slightly too strong for my mouth for regular use.  </li>
            <li> The first paste in the set didnt really provide the minty clean feeling that I expect from a toothpaste, and the second paste that you use is more like the peroxide toothpastes on the market, and left a bad aftertaste.  </li>
            <li> Squeeze a lot of toothpaste, also feel of the brush is not very good, after brushing the first branch and teeth feel very strange very afflictive, the second also need many squeeze enough, but have not seen the so-called whitening effect.</li>
            <li> The first step cleans your teeth, and you can really feel that every little piece of plaque is gone.</li>
            <li> The second tube, that you use immediately after brushing with the first, contains a clear gel meant to do the actual whitening.</li>
            <li> The second tube, that you use immediately after brushing with the first, contains a clear gel meant to do the actual whitening.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Daily Two-Step Toothpaste has shown great results for me over the past few months.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical - will this be better than all of the other whitening toothpastes out there, and will my mouth really feel much cleaner?  </li>
            <li> No mess and no lengthy process.</li>
            <li> Also I find it difficult to take the cap off of step 2 and screw it back on while I have a mouth full of toothpaste, the cap could be a bit easier if it was a flip top or something.&lt;br</li>
            <li> To avoid confusion of which bottle to use first, not only were the tubes in different colors, but they are marked as &amp;#34;STEP 1&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;STEP 2&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention the fact that the second step of the process tastes kind of gross and not refreshing like toothpaste should be.</li>
            <li> I have to say there are a few unique things about it</li>
            <li> There were no strips or mouth guards to wear and there was absolutely no mess.</li>
            <li> packaging of the Crest Pro Health HD seemed to be environmentally friendly with green recycled cardboard packaging.</li>
            <li> Just be aware that you may have unwanted side effects, such as white spots on your gums and sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> My teeth were already pretty white because of regular professional whitening treatments</li>
            <li> There were no strips to use and not mess.  </li>
            <li> I understand that having 2 steps is how the magic works, but after a long day, the last thing I have mental energy for is toothpaste.</li>
            <li> You use each tube for only 1 minute each so it really wasn&#x27;t any different than my normal routine.  </li>
            <li> and it really isn&#x27;t any more difficult than a normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The two step process takes a little bit longer than my normal routine, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I definitely had my doubts about how effective a whitening toothpaste could be, having tried other similar products in the past without much success.</li>
            <li> The flavor is pleasant, the process is simple and it&#x27;s really a matter of just switching out from regular toothpaste with no need for teeth guards or anything complicated.</li>
            <li> The taste wasn&#x27;t to bad and the whitening effects were pretty good.  </li>
            <li> The benefits of the two part system are that I definitely have a clean white smile and less sensitivity than I did using the 3D white product, however, I have not seen it reduce or eliminate my morning breath.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels clean, and my teeth do appear to be a bit whiter after a few weeks use.  </li>
            <li> It makes your teeth feel clean and whiter after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Most whitening toothpastes just keep your teeth from getting less white, while this stuff actually makes my teeth sparkling</li>
            <li> In the beginning, I was skeptical, as I had used whitening strips before that had left me less than impressed.  </li>
            <li> While I do think that the added clean feeling to my teeth and a subtle whitening effect may be worth it, it would be the one block towards regularly purchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that the added clean feeling to my teeth and a subtle whitening effect may be worth it, it would be the one block towards regularly purchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has that sort of gritty toothpaste texture, but in a refreshingly decent tasting way.</li>
            <li> My teeth seem to be slightly (not a lot) whiter</li>
            <li> I also have experienced pain in my gums, as if I had just taken a long flight (anyone travel and know that uncomfortable feeling?).</li>
            <li> Almost a gritty feeling to the first paste that you use prior to using the whitening gel.</li>
            <li> The first step is actually cleaning your teeth and preparing them for the 2nd step, which is the Whitening.  </li>
            <li> It was weird at first not being able to rinse after using the toothpaste but before using the polisher....</li>
            <li> First tube feels like regular toothpaste then without rinsing your brush or mouth switch to the second tube for the whitening and brush with that for a minute.  </li>
            <li> I actually enjoying using this two-step process because it feels like I&#x27;m making a difference with my teeth based on the small amount of extra effort that I&#x27;m putting in to brushing.</li>
            <li> I have pretty white teeth to start with, but I do drink diet soda and red wine.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I wasn&#x27;t sure about using a two step brushing process.</li>
            <li> I explained that you brush one minute with the first, spit but don&#x27;t rinse, then brush a second minute with the second step.</li>
            <li> The 2 step process is not any more cumbersome than the usual two minutes of time it takes to brush your teeth daily.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The first I used as a traditional paste and brushed with it for one minute.</li>
            <li> The first step does have a different feel and taste but the second step takes that all away.</li>
            <li> My teeth are a bit whiter (pretty stained from coffee and medications over the last 50+ years), but I&#x27;m only using it once a day, not the prescribed 2x per day.</li>
            <li> After the first week of regular brushing, twice a day, a lot of people started noticing how white my teeth</li>
            <li> You have to use the first step for one minute and then spit but don&#x27;t rinse and then use the second for the next minute.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I would recommend this product on a regular basis but I think to have even whiter teeth another product could be used first.  </li>
            <li> toothpaste definitely works, my teeth feel cleaner and whiter after only the first week of use.  </li>
            <li> The first is the regular paste and the second is whitening paste.</li>
            <li> first use, your mouth definitely feels different.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny and is lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny and is lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed this past week that my teeth are starting to shine more and the stains are diminishing.</li>
            <li> I have used different whiting products in the past, but was not as pleased as I had hoped I would be.</li>
            <li> This paste has a similar taste and even the same result after a first use, but none of those side effects.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t drink coffee or smoke, I have some moderate yellowing particularly on my canine teeth.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to use it for all that long and had to discontinue use after a few days becAuse of increased sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> I felt different from the first brush and within 2 weeks i could notice the longer lasting freshness, cleanliness was noticeable.</li>
            <li> It leaves my breathe fresh for a really long time and my teeth have definitely gotten whiter.</li>
            <li> I could barely taste the peroxide, so I had to wonder if it would actually whiten my teeth much.</li>
            <li> I used a toothpaste where the main ingredient was baking soda, prior to this.</li>
            <li> I am able to achieve that &#x27;just left the dentist&#x27; feeling everyday!</li>
            <li> Step 2 is a thin gel (not thick &amp; pasty like most gel toothpastes) that leaves the bristles squeaking over my teeth by the end of the minute you spend on Step 2.</li>
            <li> The first use I was unsure on the texture and sensations of step 1 because it left my mouth feeling different.  </li>
            <li> This is the first whitening product that actually turned my gums white.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using the product now for the past 8 days, I can say that my teeth are definitely whiter than they were (and would probably be even better if I didn&#x27;t drink coffee everyday).&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I could tell a big difference between this and regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I agree It is a little more expensive than regular toothpaste with whitener, but the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> The first paste leaves my mouth feeling very dry</li>
            <li> The first time you try Crest Pro Health® HD™ and that is that it leaves my mouth feeling very dry and that you want to grab a glass of water</li>
            <li> it is a remarkable option to the other pastes out there that have left icky grit in my mouth or even gave me sores on my tongue.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (My teeth are not extremely discolored and naturally towards the whiter end of the chart.)&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> I was also a little put off by the prospect of using two separate products, each for a full minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and also because the step two perfecting gel tastes a little too sweet for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I thought the two step-process was going to be hard get used to, but after a few days, it was very easy.  </li>
            <li> Compared to other brands it&#x27;s right on target.</li>
            <li> While I did notice whiter teeth without having to use the white strips (a huge plus), I found myself straying away from cold items and sweeter items as well because my teeth were suddenly much more sensitive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this product has multiple benefits: it from a brand that I trust, it&#x27;s a high quality/dental quality toothpaste, and it provides the added benefit of whitening your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Crest has set the bar high enough where others can&#x27;t compete.</li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase again and highly recommend this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and will be adding it to my regular purchase list.</li>
            <li> I also think the cost is a bit high and think that will keep me and others from purchasing it or using this regularly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s helping with whitening my teeth really, but the clean feeling is enough to keep me using it.</li>
            <li> I was not in the market for a new toothpaste at all, but I&#x27;m am completely and totally sold.  </li>
            <li> I always thought tooth whitening would make my teeth extra sensitive, so I never did it, but this doesn&#x27;t bother my teeth at all!!</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and only took a few minutes.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for is the strong after taste it left in my mouth, but I talked with other people who used Crest Pro Health HD and they didn&#x27;t have this problem so it could just be me.</li>
            <li> however, I traveled for a couple days and used whatever I had in a TSA-friendly little tube, and when I came home and went back to the HD, all was fine.  </li>
            <li> just a few days, my teeth had less of a dingy yellow tone, and really have a nice natural white glow to them.</li>
            <li> and I have mixed feelings but definitely will give it a positive review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For a short, 2 minute process this is simple and has positive effects.</li>
            <li> started seeing results in whiter teeth after just a few days use, and a week in my teeth feel very clean all day long.  </li>
            <li> Your teeth feel great after, and neither of the pastes/gels are unpleasant tasting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not unbearably unpleasant, but I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> This can&#x27;t be a bad thing as brushing longer is probably better for you, but not so great if you&#x27;re running late.</li>
            <li> I did not notice a huge difference from what I usually feel when I am done brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product because I generally use whitening products a few times per year to brighten and whiten my teeth.  </li>
            <li> You also don&#x27;t have to mess with brushing product on like nail polish or holding a blue light to your teeth</li>
            <li> Generally a smoother feel after I complete the process</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a Mentadent girl, but I was given a package of Crest Pro-Health HD for free from Crest to try, so I went for it.</li>
            <li> you know, that slick, smooth feeling you get when you run your tongue over your teeth.</li>
            <li> I am usually someone who just buys whatever toothpaste is on sale, but when I received and offer to try a free sample of this one, my wife convinced me to try it.  </li>
            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t do the whole system anymore, not nearly the whitening I was hoping for</li>
            <li> But those are pricey and don&#x27;t fit in my usually routine.</li>
            <li> But those are pricey and don&#x27;t fit in my usually routine.</li>
            <li> This Crest Pro-health HD really provide supreior cleansing experience which deserve my purchasing it a long way from China</li>
            <li> I have been using the Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste for the past week as part of the bzz campaign, where Crest provided a free product for me to use.  </li>
            <li> but really, it&#x27;s two minutes (that isn&#x27;t that long)</li>
            <li> I am a mother of three young children and I barely have time to brush my teeth twice a day</li>
            <li> I am not sure what price point this product will be because I was given this free to review</li>
            <li> I know that makes me sound incredibly lazy, but it is the truth.</li>
            <li> I used it for about 10 days and saw pretty minimal whitening.</li>
            <li> Step 1 (the cleanser) feels different from the normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I normally scrub my tongue at the end of the two minutes, but the whitening gel (obviously) isn&#x27;t meant for the tongue.  </li>
            <li> When I first received my package, I was curious.  </li>
            <li> A very simple substitution for your normal brushing routine, and you&#x27;re on your way to a whiter brighter future.dentist cleaning)</li>
            <li> I ended up using my normal toothpaste I use on a daily basis and then also step 2.  </li>
            <li> When adding the second step, the gel, it begins to feel a bit normal again.  </li>
            <li> being that the process is a 2 part brushing system, i was worried it might be kind of a pain, but it&#x27;s not at all - the hardest part about using this system is remembering not to wet the toothbrush before starting or inbetween steps 1 and 2 - after a few days, it wasn&#x27;t an issue at all.  </li>
            <li> One, it gets me to brush my teeth for the 2 minutes, like the dentist recommends and secondly, my teeth did not feel the whitening aspect which normally hurts my teeth.</li>
            <li> first I thought it would be a hassle of incorporate a two step process for brushing my teeth, but it&#x27;s really not that</li>
            <li> The cleaning paste is applied and you simple brush your teeth as normal for a minute.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to my normal toothpaste I&#x27;m not noticing a big difference</li>
            <li> I only use Crest Pro Health HD once a day, at night, and I stick to my normal toothpaste routine in the morning because it did cause some sensitivity with my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I normally use the Colgate Optic White toothpaste but got this via BzzAgent (Thank you!)</li>
            <li> In fact, I noticed while on vacation and using just normal toothpaste that I didn&#x27;t feel that my teeth were as white as they had been.</li>
            <li> Especially as a major coffee drinker, I wasn&#x27;t expecting to see the same result, but I have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This though, is just 2 tubes of toothpaste that you apply to all of your teeth the same way you would normally brush your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I normally use the Kirkland (Costco) version of Crest Pro-health and brush and floss twice daily</li>
            <li> Smaller size than normal toothpaste tube</li>
            <li> I am glad that I got this product for free because I would have otherwise been annoyed at the waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 2 steps take no longer than my normal brushing routine, but definitely feels like I gave my mouth a minty power-wash.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally have an issue with sensitivity but this tooth paste definitely gave me issues.  </li>
            <li> To my surprise it didn’t take any longer that normal brushing took, just it had an extra step in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to make for the other benefits this product offers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smile big enough for anyone to see any further than that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Could I get the same result just brushing my teeth twice with normal toothpaste?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received a full size kit in the mail a few weeks ago and immediately began using the products.  </li>
            <li> Overall though, I did feel like my teeth were clean after using the product, but I&#x27;m not sure the extra cost is justified by the limited additional benefits.</li>
            <li> I started to notice a change right away and over the time I&#x27;ve used it thus far (about a week and a half)</li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of the \\&quot;feel,\\&quot; the first step does feel a bit drying to the mouth, but the taste is a subtle mint not unlike many other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> The step two tastes a little funky, but I quickly got over that.</li>
            <li> This two part system is a little more inconvenient than normal toothpaste, but probably better than whitening trays.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not rough on teeth or anything, just a little more gritty than your regular toothpaste might be, again just in a way that preps your teeth for the whitening gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tubes are labeled with a large 1 and 2, and are different colors - one silver and one blue-</li>
            <li> I have a couple of sensitive teeth, so have recently tried sensitive tooth toothpaste to see if it helps and have had some luck with a couple of different brands, but never had any that also help with whitening or that give enough multiple benefits to be worth it.</li>
            <li> a thumbs up!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It is so easy to use and hardly changes your brushing routine.</li>
            <li> I suppose I should have been a little more careful</li>
            <li> The first step is a thick paste, and you can tell there is more involved with it than your typical gel paste.  </li>
            <li> The first toothpaste has a similar texture as any other and leaves a smooth, fresh feeling behind.  </li>
            <li> It is a little thick, but the flavor is good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I am (perhaps more than slightly) neurotic about using new products on/in my body, I did a little bit of research before trying this out.  </li>
            <li> This is an expensive product, but compared to facial care, it&#x27;s even more important for the long term.  </li>
            <li> I felt like the system was pretty abrasive on my teeth, so I switched back to my regular toothpaste for a few days, and the sensitivity cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;I would use this for a &#x27;refresher&#x27; for my smile, but</li>
            <li> Secondly, and this one is kind of random, as mentioned, you follow the first step immediately with the second step with no rinsing in between.  </li>
            <li> After the second use, on the first day, I had to rinse with warm water, because my teeth were sensitive to cold.</li>
            <li> I would however say that if you&#x27;re looking for a product to try, this one is significantly easier and less time consuming to use than white strips!rips!</li>
            <li> This part is hard to write anything about, because taste is one of the most personal things out there.  </li>
            <li> This part is hard to write anything about, because taste is one of the most personal things out there.  </li>
            <li> The first thing anyone will notice is that the Crest Pro Health HD is actually two tubes, one which has the cleaning paste (which is basically like normal toothpaste) and the other which is a polishing paste.</li>
            <li> but it takes as long as I would normally brush!  </li>
            <li> My gums got a little sensitive during the first few days of use, but it quickly went away, and it is was not nearly as bad as my gums typically hurt with whitening products.</li>
            <li> I only give this four stars, though, because as a new mom</li>
            <li> I think we have a new regular toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Believe it or not Crest Pro Health HD actually whitens my teeth with their new two step whitening process.</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase this product as my new, regular use toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then BzzAgent sent me a new product - Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste System.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am fairly critical when it comes to new products.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the only new thing that&#x27;s happening to my teeth</li>
            <li> I started to notice a difference after just 4 days, and after a week my teeth were definitely a new pearlier white.</li>
            <li> But overall the product is my new go to toothpaste and whitener.</li>
            <li> Every time I try a new whitening product, I forget to use it because it takes extra steps and time.  </li>
            <li> I had my doubts because I have tried a lot of different at home whitening products and nothing compares to the new crest pro health kit.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 3 weeks daily with my new Phillips a Electric diamond toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This will definitely be our family&#x27;s new go-to toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Now, two weeks later, I feel that I have found my new</li>
            <li> It is like getting them back to brand new when all the plaque is stripped away.</li>
            <li> As a BzzAgent I get to try new products occasionally as part of a promotion for the brand, and this was one of the products that was sent to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying the new Crest Pro-Health HD toothpaste and am starting to notice a difference.</li>
            <li> only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 out of 5 stars is because the whitening aspect of this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t live up to the 6X as advertised.</li>
            <li> I received the new Crest Pro- Health HD Daily Two Step Toothpaste through a BzzAgent campaign.  </li>
            <li> My husband had some big stains on his front teeth for years and after 2 weeks you could hardly notice them and now after 4 weeks they are pretty much gone!!</li>
            <li> It really does not take very long to do each day, literally four minutes per day, two minutes each time.</li>
            <li> I was at first a little bit skeptical to switch and try something new because I thought how much better can this new Crest HD really be compared to the regular toothpaste?  </li>
            <li> They either only focus on whitening and your teeth don&#x27;t feel so clean or they are so harsh that they leave your teeth so sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my teeth are so much cleaner because of the long brush time, or the product, but I like how clean it makes my teeth feel.  </li>
            <li> First I was slightly worried about using a two step process as I&#x27;ve been brushing my teeth the same way for 30 years, after the first couple of times it has become my only toothpaste, to the point where my wife is now using it also</li>
            <li> I am very conscience of how white my teeth are since I drink a lot of coffee and sometimes red wine both of which cause my teeth to be stained.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it to get whiter teeth that get slightly darkened from coffee.</li>
            <li> I drink coffee daily and had a few light stains.  </li>
            <li> Once you use Crest Pro Health HD, you only really need it once then you can continue using regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Not super fresh, but no morning breath...which is cray cray.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I still like to use a whitening toothpaste for maintenance when I&#x27;m not actively whitening my teeth with the dentist&#x27;s system and</li>
            <li> I have to say that I would never have thought any toothpaste product out there would be that different than the others (at least among the national, reputable brands).</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think it would be much different because I see him every day but seeing the difference after one week - oh yes, big difference.  </li>
            <li> I think it is necessary to have the second step because the hydrogen peroxide can stay by itself and not react with anything else until you are ready for it to do its job.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how healthy this is in the long run though.</li>
            <li> are that it&#x27;s much faster, only 2 minutes in the morning and 2 minutes in the evening, plus you can whiten your entire mouth, not just the front teeth where the strips are applied.</li>
            <li> Step 1 is a bit strange the first time i used it because of the gritty texture, but you get used to it  after a while.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are pretty white to start with, just minor coffee stains...</li>
            <li> I didn’t like having to stop brushing, open a second tube and start the whole process again.  </li>
            <li> My breath isn&#x27;t as fresh as it is with my previous toothpaste</li>
            <li> So after a week, I noticed a slightly brighter smile.</li>
            <li> Add in the fact that the whole process only takes 2 minutes and you&#x27;ve got a product that people will actually use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The first paste also has a strange gritty texture, but I got used to that.</li>
            <li> My first experience with this product was pretty negative.</li>
            <li> It really did not take much extra time and after a week I definitely noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> I didnt really like this toothpaste and will be going back to my regular Crest Pro Health toothpaste.</li>
            <li> In conclusion, if Crest Pro Health® HD can really decrease sensitivity, and increase the whiteness of my teeth with such a simple system, I am sold.</li>
            <li> In conclusion, if Crest Pro Health® HD can really decrease sensitivity, and increase the whiteness of my teeth with such a simple system, I am sold.</li>
            <li> I do wish both tubes had a flip top cap, not just the toothpaste, but that is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> At first it seemed like the 2 tubes would take twice as long, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> toothpaste was more liquid than other toothpastes, so this made brushing a mess.</li>
            <li> did notice a slightly brighter smile at the end of the week.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> The Crest Pro Health® HD is just  2 minutes a day and will quickly become a part of your everyday</li>
            <li> The best part is I didn&#x27;t even have to use strips or trays (which I hate using, but are the only things that ever seem to work).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and doesn&#x27;t spread easily when I go in to brush.</li>
            <li> I do keep using my old crest with whitening single tube of toothpaste and have to make a conscious effort to remember to use my new product.</li>
            <li> They look and feel extremely clean, and I think a little whiter!</li>
            <li> I also noticed that my teeth seemed a little sensitive right after brushing, but this eventually went away.</li>
            <li> I would have liked the product to have a little bit of a more \\&quot;minty\\&quot; flavor, but it was not an unpleasant taste, and this would not deter me from using it.</li>
            <li> He gets major plaque build up between dentist appointments, we started this regime prior to the last visit and it really helped to reduce it.  </li>
            <li> The process may seem a little strange but it is really easy.  </li>
            <li> The toothpaste squirts easily, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This has caused my gums to be very sensitive and my teeth to be very yellow.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was very surprised how polished my teeth felt after the second step.  </li>
            <li> only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that this paste made my teeth very sensitive.</li>
            <li> and the same problem always seemed to occur, they made my teeth VERY sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I would have stopped using this after the second day if I didn&#x27;t feel like it was actually protecting my teeth a little better than just using regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> However,  I was excited to use the product and it did not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1: It feels like a traditional toothpaste although it felt a little tart.  </li>
            <li> The whitening aspect works about as well as any other whitening toothpaste, though it does taste a little more like whitening gel (just Step 2).  </li>
            <li> The major issue I have with this product is the time investment.  </li>
            <li> first step toothpaste, the cleaning one, was like any other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I had some gum bleeding the first time due to that.</li>
            <li> I have receeding gums which leaves my the teeth area at the gumline exposed and causing major sensitivity with hot/cold products.</li>
            <li> Certainly no other person mentioned a difference in my teeth color.  </li>
            <li> and I have noticed a major difference.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not am major concern to me as my teeth don&#x27;t need major whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can see a significant difference in my teeth and there is the added bonus that it freshens my breath and makes my teeth healthier by destroying plaque!  </li>
            <li> No other flavors</li>
            <li> I am a major coffee drinker, and even that didn&#x27;t hinder performance.</li>
            <li> , you simply throw away your old toothpaste and replace it with Crest Pro Health HD, you brush your teeth twice a day for two minutes, using step one and step two!  </li>
            <li> Second, you teeth can be sensitive after brushing, so no drinking water for about 15 minutes after your brush!  </li>
            <li> However, after 3 days of using it morning &amp; night, I noticed a major difference in my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had the patience to consistently use any other whitening system.  </li>
            <li> healthier.&lt;br /&gt;However the one major drawback for me is the polish taste.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but I love the way it makes my teeth feel!</li>
            <li> I have tried several different brands of whitening toothpaste but this is the first one to actually work.  </li>
            <li> The first step tastes like any other toothpaste while Step 2 is full-on hydrogen peroxide smell.</li>
            <li> No other issues with use.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that my teeth became more sensitive to heat and cold, so I had to tread gingerly when having something too hot or too</li>
            <li> Because of this thin material, there&#x27;s a lot more toothpaste in the tube than what you would normally come to expect from a regular tube of toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> If anything, I started to like it because it forced me to be more conscious about how long I was brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> If you are dying for a product that will get rid of your stinky breath when you wake up, then this product may be a disappointment, but if you are just looking for a clean, healthy and white smile, then you will not be let down!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has now been a month, and I&#x27;ve found that the routine of simply brushing for one extra minute with the second tube of paste was quite easy compared to the other methods of having to use a mouth tray, or strips.</li>
            <li> It does take a little extra time to brush each day, but the time and process is SO simple and easy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The first step left my mouth seeming really dry.</li>
            <li> At first, it seemed potentially tedious with two steps, but as soon as we used it, we realized how easy it was.</li>
            <li> The first tube leaves my mouth dry and gritty</li>
            <li> The first agent tastes like wint-o-green lifesavers, and left my mouth feeling dry.  </li>
            <li> that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1 is a purifying cleanser, and it is a much more abrasive formula than your average, slightly chalky toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I have never felt as passionately about a new product ever!</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about what benefits the two step system would offer, but after just the first use I realized the second step was worth it.  </li>
            <li> Right when I thought this wasn&#x27;t working either I noticed a slight change.</li>
            <li> I drink tea everyday, so my teeth is a little yellowish and I was pretty excited when I got the package.</li>
            <li> I actually count down 60 seconds to make sure I&#x27;m brushing long enough.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think I would like this product because my teeth tend to be sensitive to other whitening products I have used.</li>
            <li> Once you get used to it, it feels clean and no more</li>
            <li> The 2-step process will clean then whiten your teeth after just a few usese!</li>
            <li> first tubes active ingredients are Stannous Fluoride 0.454%.  </li>
            <li> first tubes active ingredients are Stannous Fluoride 0.454%.</li>
            <li> The product really gets your mouth clean, however, I am skeptical if the aggressive cleaning power is realistic for every day use.</li>
            <li> Other than that, my mouth feels fresh after brushing and not gritty.</li>
            <li> The first step makes your mouth feel a bit dry and after the second step my teeth are sensitive when I rinse (similar to whitening strips).</li>
            <li> he toothpaste take a little getting used to, as does the idea of brushing twice, but the outcome is worth it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While it does take a little longer to use the 2 step process, the added effort is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Have you ever left the dentist office wishing your teeth could feel that clean everyday.</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for an enhancement to their everyday brushing, and to keep their teeth clean in between dental visits.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to try this HD system as part of a promotional subject from Crest through BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I noticed that one of the main ingredients is hydrogen peroxide, so it seems feasible that you may get similar results by rinsing regularly with that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, the Rembrandt strips DID have some slight effect, but far from Hollywood tooth-whiteness, and those whitening strips, at only about 2 1/2&amp;#34; long, left more than just the back teeth unaffected.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using the first step, your mouth is left very dry and watering.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the mint flavor or step on and it really isn&#x27;t hard to add in the process of step two.</li>
            <li> I was a little adamant at first before receiving this product through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I know that the price is high for toothpaste, but low if you consider the cost of white strips and toothpaste.</li>
            <li> At first i thought it would be like usual toothpaste with high claims</li>
            <li> Only potential downside is the two-step process, sometimes even the 2 minutes seems lengthy when I&#x27;m running late to work in the morning, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for a fantastic smile!!</li>
            <li> Also, my teeth were definitely noticeably whiter after about a week or so - definitely more noticeable than with other whitening toothpastes but with a lot less hassle than using things like whitening strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say how much whitening it has done for me, as my teeth are fairly white to begin with, but I do feel as if my smile is &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34;, if that makes any sense.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m with the other positive reviewers on this stuff.</li>
            <li> I was happy that it didn&#x27;t taste bad.</li>
            <li> Also, I cannot use any mouthwash after brushing (which is a huge negative for me) because the sensitivity is killer.  </li>
            <li> I know my teeth are cleaner in general.  </li>
            <li> I generally use a whitening toothpaste</li>
            <li> I in general feel cleaner with this product.</li>
            <li> My bleeding gums have drastically improved along with the general feel of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received this free from Crest, though, and decided to at least give it a try.</li>
            <li> After a minute, and without rinsing, I brushed again for another minute with the “perfecting gel,” a clear gel polish.</li>
            <li> People noticed I was smiling a lot more and showing off my teeth which I&#x27;m normally too shy to do.</li>
            <li> So, in sum, it definitely whitens your teeth, but if you get canker sores in your mouth, maybe steer clear.</li>
            <li> The second tube has a clear gel that has peroxide as one of its ingredients, and you see the bubblies on your teeth and between the teeth as you brush.</li>
            <li> The second step is a clear paste that helps whiten and polish the teeth, and when I&#x27;m brushing with this paste it feels like it&#x27;s doing what it needs to do.</li>
            <li> The 2 part process includes clearly labeled tubes, you use step one for a solid minute, that cleans your teeth and strips stains while leaving your enamel intact, then step two whitens and polishes your teeth.</li>
            <li> I read the instructions and it clearly said to use step one for 1 minute and step 2 for the same.</li>
            <li> I feel that in a hurry to pack for a vacation and only grab one of the tubes, thus leaving me with only a half clean mouth.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really take much longer than usual to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> The second tube has a clear gel that has peroxide as one of its ingredients, and you see the bubblies on your teeth and between the teeth as you brush.  </li>
            <li> Step 2 is a clear polish to help whiten your teeth to be added to your toothbrush for the 2nd minute of brushing (without rinsing in between).</li>
            <li> The only one minor caution I would have is that it does not leave your breath very minty.  </li>
            <li> The next step involves adding the clear perfecting gel to your toothbrush, and brushing for another minute or so to polish and whiten.</li>
            <li> It is clearly written on the package and tubes are made differently which eliminates any confusion.&lt;br /&gt;2.)</li>
            <li> Definitely makes your teeth feel cleaner, and there is a noticeable difference as far as whitening.</li>
            <li> Step 2: a barely noticeable taste, somewhat like baking soda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only issue is that my teeth and gums are rather sensitive and this irritated them after about four days of continuous use.</li>
            <li> but once I realized that each step requires only 1 minute and no rinse in between, my mind was at ease because my old routine took 2 minutes-</li>
            <li> On several occasions, I used Aquafresh ExtremeClean Whitening Action for a minute or so immediately BEFORE using the Crest HD and the difference is like night and day.</li>
            <li> The two tubes lasted much longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> The second step, the whitening gel, made my teeth and gums sensitive</li>
            <li> I personally wouldn&#x27;t spend the nearly $13 for this product.</li>
            <li> The one draw back is how sensitive my teeth are to this formula.  </li>
            <li> I know I have extra sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> would say that I won&#x27;t purchase this every time I buy toothpaste, but I probably will use it every other time to keep my teeth extra white and my mouth extra fresh!</li>
            <li> I feel as though I shouldn&#x27;t expect results this early (after only a week of use), though.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that, since I have sensitive teeth, that the toothpaste is starting to irritate them.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say they were to the level of professionally whitened, but a definite improvement.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The 2 step process is starting to get old -- I use an electronic tooth brush</li>
            <li> There is a plus with step 2, you don&#x27;t experience the foam action that you would with regular hydrogen peroxide, however I will probably stick to my cheaper alternative of just buying the $2 bottle of hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li> have made my teeth extra sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have received numerous comments from friends and family already asking if I got my teeth professionally whitened.</li>
            <li> I can turn it off early, but I would feel like I wasn&#x27;t cleaning my teeth properly.  </li>
            <li> The white spots one is warned of on the label on gums and soft tissue</li>
            <li> I had braces which ruined my enamel and white strips and all that make my teeth sensitive but not this stuff.</li>
            <li> The whitening really works with no real hassle.</li>
            <li> I have always used a sensitive tooth product without all those added goodies, now I can have all the extra benefits.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was at the dentist in January and had some early gingivitis following pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I felt like I just left the dentist chair after a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> I think it will get old using two different products each time I brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> I barely notice a difference.</li>
            <li> The only issue I had was sensitive teeth with the product.</li>
            <li> I used white strips, whitening mouth wash, toothpastes, and even some natural remedies and all of those do not compare to this product.</li>
            <li> The packaging reccomends getting a professional cleaning prior to</li>
            <li> so I was surprised to see actual results.)</li>
            <li> Whitens to a natural white removing surface stains, buildup etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It’s not much different than my old routine which was Crest Pro-Health for two minutes with an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I expected too much</li>
            <li> With my 3-nager I barely get to brush my teeth with 1 tube of toothpaste let alone trying to do 2 steps for 1 minute a piece.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;ve been very pleasantly surprised by this product.  </li>
            <li> I have a sensitive mouth that can&#x27;t handle whitening products, especially in toothpastes.</li>
            <li> in all, Crest Pro Health® HD™ delivered on it&#x27;s whitening promise, and if they ever do come out with a version for sensitive teeth, I&#x27;ll definitely give that one</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, product as expected</li>
            <li> The 2nd step has peroxide in it so if you have sensitive or bleeding gums it will sting.</li>
            <li> I understand that this is a system, so different steps are needed to complete the brushing and whitening process, I just wish they could combine it into one paste.</li>
            <li> I like it over the Crest 3D White Luxe Whitestrips Professional Effects which I did about a year ago.  </li>
            <li> The two main negatives that I have discovered is Step 1 leaves you with dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth or gums, but the whitening stage definitely irritated my gums.</li>
            <li> My dentist made me start using a soft bristle tooth brush a while back because I had some gum erosion.  </li>
            <li> Wow, I can feel &amp; see such a difference when I use this product.  </li>
            <li> but I have never really thought any home whitening product has really worked on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Really not that much else to say about it.  </li>
            <li> second thing of note: don&#x27;t use this if you are sensitive to whitening agents.</li>
            <li> far as the two-step process goes, it wasn&#x27;t as cumbersome as I initially thought it was.  </li>
            <li> I have relatively white teeth to begin with, but with age, I was getting yellowing near my gum line.</li>
            <li> (But I do have a sensitive mouth to lots of different toothpastes!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> The only con is my gums became sensitive after a week or so.</li>
            <li> Step 2 is the bonus step that only requires 60 seconds to complete.  </li>
            <li> different from sensitive teeth brand whitening toothpastes, it didn&#x27;t feel chalky or leave my teeth feeling coated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth, I would not likely recommend based off the warnings on the box.</li>
            <li> This time I didn&#x27;t notice any white spots on my gums, but my teeth were extremely sensitive when eating anything crunchy or chewy.  </li>
            <li> The ONLY downside is that this toothpaste made my sensitive teeth ache after two weeks.</li>
            <li> I used Crest Pro Health® HD™ toothpaste for 2 minutes 2x a day as instructed and I have to say I did not really notice much difference.  </li>
            <li> I am a busy mom of three, and sometimes it feels like I have to fight for five minutes to myself, even to do something as simple as brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> But this two step system has not only made my teeth sensitive</li>
            <li> This simple two step process take two minutes to complete which leaves your mouth feeling</li>
            <li> I am all about ease of use, especially on the early mornings when I am in a rush to get to work.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised, and after using it I will definitely buy it.</li>
            <li> I used Crest 3D white strips professional every six months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I will continue to regularly purchase the product because it is a bit pricey, but I will most likely purchase it every couple of months to maintain my white teeth.</li>
            <li> I had actually just made an appointment with my dentist to have my teeth professionally whitened when I received it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I have quite severe periodontal disease, my dentist had been recommending both Crest Pro Health toothpaste and mouthwash, which I&#x27;ve been using religiously for nearly a year now.</li>
            <li> the gel has barely any taste at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the gel has barely any taste at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I discovered a big difference between use of Crest Pro Health HD on my &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; teeth and my adult child&#x27;s &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34; teeth when it came to whitening.</li>
            <li> I also can&#x27;t tell a difference in the whiteness of my teeth, but maybe it&#x27;s too early to tell since I&#x27;ve only used it for a week and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me, if I brushed between 1 to 2 minutes my gums became sensitive.  </li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t noticed whiter teeth, but I haven&#x27;t been diligent to only use this toothpaste either.  </li>
            <li> I tried going back to my old toothpaste</li>
            <li> I was a bit surprised at the specificity of the use instructions, but they are simple.</li>
            <li> I am a mother of two young children and my mornings are already hectic as it is, but the process literally only takes two minutes.</li>
            <li> If I had to say something, I think I actually prefer my old toothpaste</li>
            <li> It takes about 2 minutes to complete both steps, so there isn&#x27;t additional wait time like there is with the whitening strips or similar</li>
            <li> I never really thought much about it.  </li>
            <li> Bare?</li>
            <li> have noticed that my teeth seem extra sensitive since I started using it, but this toothpaste has cavity protection and I have issues with sensitivity with any toothpaste that has cavity protection/tartar control/etc.  </li>
            <li> This may be just my experience or a combination of having lightly sensitive gums, and doing it for 4 minutes total.</li>
            <li> At the beginning of day 3, my mouth was so sensitive and all the product was doing was turning my gums white.</li>
            <li> on Amazon&#x27;s final price), would make me choke on my toothbrush if it were my normal daily toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> on Amazon&#x27;s final price), would make me choke on my toothbrush if it were my normal daily toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> A very simple substitution for your normal brushing routine, and you&#x27;re on your way to a whiter brighter future.</li>
            <li> big difference that I noticed was that my morning coffee didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; to my mouth and leave that gross feeling like it normally does.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend trying this product (even though it is a bit more expensive than normal toothpaste).</li>
            <li> It literally takes two minutes to use - which is how long you are supposed to brush normally.  </li>
            <li> In all honesty these two things are minimal and so worth dealing with because you get healthier and whiter teeth in such a simple way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> The two of us used up the tubes after just over 3 weeks and are ordering more today because we are not happy returning to the old tube we used before because the cleanliness is just not the same.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really had luck with other whitening toothpastes making any sort of significant difference in the look/color of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have even received a few compliments on my smile since I started the regimen.  </li>
            <li> Within a few days I could see results - brighter and whiter and the fresh taste in my mouth was an added bonus.</li>
            <li> I noticed results in just two days and everyday my smile is brighter and whiter.</li>
            <li> mostly tastes like the whitening strips that I have tried so not great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth are whiter, but it doesn&#x27;t work any better or worse than others with stains on bonded / capped teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not awful, but it&#x27;s not great either</li>
            <li> okay, not great.</li>
            <li> I will admit it was kind of weird.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take that long, but the gel doesn&#x27;t taste good and has an uncomfortable texture.</li>
            <li> Too little, and it loses the flavor quickly, but hitting the tipping point and it lasts for the full brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> I have only used this toothpaste for about a week and already noticed slight results, actually my husband noticed right away!</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to use the product, as often times, teeth-whitening products really hurt my teeth and make them very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have slight discoloration, and have tried other whitening products in the fast, but could never last more than a day due to sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> about half of both tubes still left to use which means it seems to last a long time and is worth the reasonable price to pay.</li>
            <li> about half of both tubes still left to use which means it seems to last a long time and is worth the reasonable price to pay.</li>
            <li> The whole process only takes two minutes (about as long as the first half of a Katy Perry song).</li>
            <li> I used to be less confident with my smile and was not really happy with my overall oral health.</li>
            <li> admit that it really does make your teeth whiter, but certainly not 6x whiter.  </li>
            <li> It just wasn&#x27;t worth it, so I just went back to using plain old toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I received this free as a BZZ Agent and boy was I skeptical as so many other products claim to do the same but fall short.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first paste you use is like a typical minty toothpaste, while the second one is a thinner clear gel with a peroxide scent.</li>
            <li> The system consists of 2 tubes: the first is like a typical toothpaste, and the 2nd is a clear whitening gel.  </li>
            <li> only problem I have is that the first step makes my mouth feel dry and gritty.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t say anything on the package about the whitening aspect, the package I received looked a little different, and I felt I saw results after the very first brushing..</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only negative things I can say are that they first step waters down very quickly.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything better from this new Crest product, despite it&#x27;s promises.  </li>
            <li> Now before using this product, my teeth were already very white and knowing the results now,  I should have taken a photo before starting the new toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this new product to others if you are concerned about any of the same dental issues as I am.</li>
            <li> , I was a bit skeptical about this product when I first tried it because other systems don&#x27;t seem to work, they just make my teeth more sensitive,  </li>
            <li> It is much smoother than other products I have used, and seems to last longer as well despite normal daily wear and tear.</li>
            <li> I found that the two step system left my gums feeling very sensitive after the first few uses, so I couldn&#x27;t use twice a day.  </li>
            <li> My mouth feels much cleaner, fresher and less sensitive.</li>
            <li> , it is easy and it actually makes me brush for at least 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> did notice a slightly whiter smile after one week, and continued to use it into a second week.  </li>
            <li> whitening gel is thick enough to stay on the toothbrush and is easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I also noted that there is a definite heavy peroxide after taste but quickly subsides after rinsing in step 2.</li>
            <li> I have tried other teeth whitening products before and have never seen such fast and clear results like I do with this product.</li>
            <li> Overall, the 2-steps aren&#x27;t a hassle, especially in comparison to the process required with other whitening products; the time required to do this is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> The product is a little more expensive than I would normally care to entertain for a toothpaste, but I actually do believe it is worth it - even if you use it for a month, take a month off, use it for another month, etc.</li>
            <li> I have several very sensitive areas and during my trial only had one issue of discomfort.</li>
            <li> I was hesistant at first because in the past, whitening toothpastes have made my teeth very sensitive and my gums hurt.  </li>
            <li> As you are brushing the color changes right before your eyes, quite a few shades.  </li>
            <li> This new Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste system really makes my mouth feel super-clean, and I have noticed a slight improvement in the whiteness of my teeth as well.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this toothpaste, assuming that my teeth are too great a mess for any store paste to make a difference.</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t completely understand as it makes my mouth feel much cleaner than other products with the exact same active ingredient at the same concentration...</li>
            <li> I noticed a slight lightening of coffee/wine staining within the first couple of days</li>
            <li> In the first step, you use is the Purifying Cleanser which I would desribe as your typical minty toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It is an odd feeling at first, but once you do step two it goes away.  </li>
            <li> Crest was the first toothpaste to use stannous flouride and it is estimated a half billion cavities have been avoided by using Crest.  </li>
            <li> The first tube is like a typical toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it claims to do, but feels odd as it is a two step toothbrushing process.</li>
            <li> The taste was pretty on target too as a typical Crest toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Brushing your teeth is a pretty mundane task.  </li>
            <li> also convinced my wife to be a trial subject because she is interested in teeth whitening and dental health.</li>
            <li> 2 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;the first week i used the toothpaste I did notice a slight difference in the color of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t attest to the whitening, but that may be due to the fact that my teeth are already pretty white from using the Crest whitening strips.</li>
            <li> Aware that I have not tried anything other than a basic whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels cleaner with just the first step than any other toothpaste, even the Crest Pro-Health regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> My wife is a seasoned dental hygienist and upon my most recent examination, she stated she could tell I was flossing daily when sadly, I still only floss once a week!  </li>
            <li> It is not a deal breaker because the product is better than other tooth paste I have used it the past</li>
            <li> My teeth did not show any significant change in color, and for a product that is not exactly inexpensive as compared to other toothpastes that claim also to whiten teeth, HD did not deliver to me.</li>
            <li> Other than only using it once per day, I followed the directions exactly as written and still saw no results after 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> so I usually have to brush teeth quickly, the fact that I have to  reload something else( step 2), seems like a time buster to me.  </li>
            <li> In the past I used whitening strips which made my teeth and gums super sensative</li>
            <li> The Crest Pro Health® HD is just  2 minutes a day and will quickly become a part of your everyday routine!</li>
            <li> and it foamed quickly, causing me to spit sooner than usual.</li>
            <li> I think that it could do a better job of whitening, but overall is a decent toothpaste that I would purchase if it was not too expensive.</li>
            <li> When I first used it, I was a little surprised by the taste of step #2 - you can definitely taste the peroxide.</li>
            <li> : I have extremely sensitive teeth - experienced the worst pain of my life during and after a Zoom session, the strips hurt me, and everything made for sensitive teeth hasn&#x27;t made much of a difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to like Crest Pro Health HD, I think I will be going back to my regular Crest Pro Health,  or at least until Crest can figure out a way to make a gel that leaves my mouth feeling fresh again.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to all the coffee drinkers, red wine drinkers, or anyone just needing that extra white gleam!</li>
            <li> I actually had to alternate the toothpaste  with my normal crest toothpaste for the first few weeks.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try it because who doesn&#x27;t want whiter teeth but was disappointed to find that it didn&#x27;t seem to make that much of a difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this product for only 3 weeks, I&#x27;ve seen major results!</li>
            <li> At first, this was a weird sensation, but now I like it because it contributes to how clean my mouth feels.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels really clean after brushing with a cool and slightly numb feeling.</li>
            <li> No dramatic results for me, but minimal objective whitening was achieved.</li>
            <li> While I have decent teeth already, the extra step in the morning when I&#x27;m already a mess getting ready for work after a couple extra snoozes, I&#x27;m not seeing the effects.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Crest!y while thinking of a thousand other things.</li>
            <li> The whole 2 step thing took a minute to get used to and the taste isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;m used to from other tooth pastes</li>
            <li> I am very selective about the toothpastes and other oral products I purchase so,</li>
            <li> I felt that my mouth felt much cleaner and my teeth a llittle brighter due to this Crest product.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel much cleaner after the cleaning step than after using other toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Over the past few weeks, I was given the opportunity to try Crest Pro Health HD for free thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li> Those bottom teeth as well as all of my other teeth are now visibly whiter, and having the dentist notice the difference drove home the point that this stuff really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike other toothpastes that claim they &amp;#34;whiten&amp;#34;, I really like how there&#x27;s 2 steps.</li>
            <li> I like this because I don&#x27;t really like the peppermint-type flavor of a lot of other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I have tried other ones, and did not notice much of a result.</li>
            <li> I like this because I don&#x27;t really like the peppermint-type flavor of a lot of other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> This was a much stronger feeling than with any other peppermint toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that it would help reduce plaque build-up as I have problems with that due to some overcrowding of two lower teeth.  </li>
            <li> I used this product once a day for 14 days straight, without using any other products in-between.  </li>
            <li> After reading through the directions, I was a little concerned about not being able to spit during the two minutes I was required to brush my teeth because I usually do a few times</li>
            <li> I had been using a standard whitening toothpaste that didn&#x27;t seem to be doing much on it&#x27;s own, but I&#x27;m generally skeptical of whitening claims in general.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little different having a two step process to brush my teeth, but it was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> However, after trying this for several weeks, I can now say that this isn&#x27;t any more difficult than my normal brushing routine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The two-step system is pretty simple, except for the fact that since we have to use two different toothpastes the time spent in brushing seems like forever.</li>
            <li> It takes a little extra time, but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I skipped one brushing went back to my normal toothpaste (also a crest product) and was back with the Pro Heath HD the next night.</li>
            <li> At first this was a little daunting, but it actually helped me to brush much longer than I usually do (I&#x27;m a slacker and never really brush for the full 2 minutes you are supposed to).</li>
            <li> Only small complaint is the slight burning on the gums after step 1, doesn&#x27;t last long and can be avoided with more gentle precise brushing.</li>
            <li> The second step is a little less enjoyable, since you apply it to the toothbrush after spitting (but not rinsing).  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m interested in a whiter smile, and I&#x27;m a big fan of Crest in particular for helping me achieve that, but after only 4 days, I started skipping step 2.</li>
            <li> but I do feel I can back down to using the two-step process once per day since the &#x27;regular&#x27; toothpaste I use is Crest Whitening with Baking Soda &amp; Peroxide (Fresh Mint).</li>
            <li> We have continued to use it daily, and our teeth have never been whiter, even though we have used special teeth-whitening products in the past.</li>
            <li> How could that actually be better than the conventional toothpastes that I have been using in the past.</li>
            <li> It made your teeth feel very rough even though this toothpaste had a lot of grit in it and is very abrasive.  </li>
            <li> I got this product from Bzzagent free thanks to Crest, and was a bit skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health HD is an okay product, but do not expect dramatic results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, my expectations were seriously blown away when I got the chance from Crest to review this product for free as a BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> But think about it, if a person has darker teeth to start the change will be more dramatic.</li>
            <li> At least my teeth should be clean even if they don&#x27;t get any whiter.</li>
            <li> I started using Crest Pro Health HD about a month ago  after receiving a free trial from Crest and after 4weeks of constant use, there is no doubt that my teeth are at least 1-2 shades whiter.</li>
            <li> The product instructions were clear and specific and the product left my mouth feeling refreshed</li>
            <li> The only slight downside was that I might have applied too much whitening paste to my gums, as one spot is slightly sensitive.</li>
            <li> After that first week I was checking the staining and there are NO brown lines on the backside of my teeth and the slight yellow at the corners of the bottom &amp;#34;canine&amp;#34; teeth is barely visible.</li>
            <li> The Step 2 is a clear gel that definitely lets you know you are using something different.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit that I think Crest should have put step 1 in the blue tube, since the toothpaste is blue, and then the finishing gel in the silver tube since it is clear, and I associate polishing with silver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it was, perhaps the two step process, but it really felt that my teeth were cleaner than normal.  </li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t know that it compares with the brightening of a professional treatment, Crest HD definitely gives me the extra gleam I want.</li>
            <li> And lastly, I have had to use a sensitive toothpaste recently because of tooth sensitivity, and using this toothpaste</li>
            <li> I began using this product in early June and now a month later I definitely notice whiter teeth and</li>
            <li> After my two week trial I would brush with regular toothpaste then apply the whitening gel and I use the step 1 paste from time to time to give it that deep cleanse, just not everyday.</li>
            <li> so I had to cut back to using it only one time a day and a sensitive toothpaste</li>
            <li> I have defeated the sensitivity by only using this toothpaste once a day in the morning and my old regular toothpaste once at night.</li>
            <li> I still feel that there is some yellow on my teeth near the gum line overall</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health HD is a breakthrough, the daily innovated system offers a noticeable and different experience that improves both the oral health and appearance of my mouth.</li>
            <li> It really does feel similar to a dental cleaning minus the discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the Crest 3d white polishing treatment in addition to my current natural</li>
            <li> the Crest 3d white polishing treatment in addition to my current natural</li>
            <li> The two step system is definitely worth the extra few seconds.</li>
            <li> Within a few days of brushing morning and night with Crest HD, I definitely noticed a difference in my smile.</li>
            <li> Still leaves your breath fresh with no extra steps in your everyday routine.  </li>
            <li> The main reason why I was really curious to try this product was because of the 6x teeth whitening advertisement.</li>
            <li> I am thinking however, that everyone is different as I have heard better and worse results from others.</li>
            <li> After just a few uses you will notice a color change to your teeth that will not only allow you to smile, but makes you want to.</li>
            <li> That would normally be expected to stand for &amp;#34;high definition&amp;#34;, at least in the realm of TV, which is where it is most often use.</li>
            <li> my teeth and gums were a little sensitive for a few days, but everything feels fine</li>
            <li> I also did not like the watery texture of the second product and weirdly had a hard time brushing with it for a full minute, as there wasn&#x27;t much substance to brush with - no foam, dripped out of mouth easily, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the two step process is a little over kill at first</li>
            <li> The first time I used the system I felt like the polishing/whitening step (#2) tasted a little metallic but as I continued to use the system I didn&#x27;t taste it again.</li>
            <li> Most of the other whiteners I used in the past made me gag, but this makes me feel like I just left the dentist</li>
            <li> I did notice a little change in the color of my teeth in the first couple days.</li>
            <li> When I first got the Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste I noticed how although the packaging is a little over kill for toothpaste</li>
            <li> The first step fluoride toothpaste was not overly minty flavored, it does get a little foamy though, but the texture was not something that would deter me from continuing to use it.  </li>
            <li> A little bit of a pain at first to stop brushing halfway through</li>
            <li> only give the 4 stars because I prefer a MAJOR minty toothpaste flavor.  </li>
            <li> , while my teeth feel pretty and shiny, there are a lot of little annoyances that bother me about this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> After three weeks there was a major different</li>
            <li> My gums/teeth also burned a little for the first three days.</li>
            <li> and I had no excuse to not whiten!</li>
            <li> The first step involves using what seems like a regular crest toothpast which i do feel is an improved version of other regular variety.  </li>
            <li> is maybe that the price is a little on the higher side just for toothpaste</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it all stars was that I didn&#x27;t experience a major whitening improvement.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant of the 2-step process but after the first use I wasn&#x27;t bothered.  </li>
            <li> The process is a little strange--I really want to rinse in between steps!</li>
            <li> It also helps that the first tube protects your enamel, because I was worried a little bit about my enamel with the Crest Whitestrips.</li>
            <li> I was willing to deal with a little discomfort because the toothpaste was working</li>
            <li> I was willing to deal with a little discomfort because the toothpaste was working</li>
            <li> all that said, I think I would repurchase this product (although I do acknowledge that the $15 price point is a little higher than I&#x27;d like to spend on toothpaste).</li>
            <li> all that said, I think I would repurchase this product (although I do acknowledge that the $15 price point is a little higher than I&#x27;d like to spend on toothpaste).</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t 6x whiter, whatever was exactly meant by that, but I did notice that my teeth were a little whiter.</li>
            <li> My teeth are really sensitive to cold water, and apparently are sensitive to the whitening component that is in most whitening toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> I know two-step with two tubes of toothpaste might sound little complicated, but it is as easy as regular one toothpaste brushing.  </li>
            <li> Step two is a gel that tastes a little strange, but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I stopped for a few days to see what would happen and my teeth were right back where they were before.</li>
            <li> It takes less than two minutes of your time to brush with the first toothpaste, spit and then brush with the second paste.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the results were not as profound with my husband, whose teeth need whitening more than mine.</li>
            <li> then id pay for 2 tubes of toothpaste that you have to use right after each other, so basically lasting as long as 1 tube.</li>
            <li> both do agree that our teeth do feel dentist clean and that morning breath is a thing of the past!</li>
            <li> The size was larger than I expected and the cost was half what I originally planned to plan for it.</li>
            <li> Trying to put on a second toothpaste (with a screw on cap), mid brush is a bit odd and makes it even more... messy.</li>
            <li> not like a bright crazy unnatural white, but my pearlies were definitely whiter.  </li>
            <li> It is an innovative way to get a brighter smile without having to use any of the inconvenient strips, trays or overnight treatments that often produce minimal results.  </li>
            <li> It is a 2-step process that takes the same amount of time as you generally spend brushing your teeth.  </li>
            <li> It is a 2-step process that takes the same amount of time as you generally spend brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> I can say I&#x27;m a big fan of Crest products in general.  </li>
            <li> Similar to teeth brushing in general.  </li>
            <li> My teeth in general are generally white, but I drink soda and coffee throughout the day, so it seems like from bed to morning my teeth lose their shine.</li>
            <li> It did not give me as much sensitivity as other whitening products especially the strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it is absolutely easier then dental trays or other whitening products but regular tooth paste is easier then a two part system.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, I do feel a difference in how my teeth feel after brushing where they feel much smoother and cleaner than a lot of other toothpastes i have used.  </li>
            <li> it is much easier to open one handed when your other hand is holding the toothbrush you&#x27;ve used for step one.</li>
            <li> The whitening power is also much stronger than other &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; toothpastes; I actually saw results!</li>
            <li> The different toothpastes have unusual textures, but they&#x27;re not unlike other whitening or prescription toothpastes I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Hope there are no long term effects.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been extra careful not to brush my gums to much and haven&#x27;t noticed the white spots as often.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The reason I was concerned in the beginning is because I have sensitive teeth and a majority of whitening products I can not use for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not taste funny like other people ^ claim - if you have had your teeth professionally whitened or have used other at home kits...</li>
            <li> Had to go back my old Crest Pro-Health toothpaste occasionally to stop the sensitivity before going back to the HD kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Two minutes is not long at all.  </li>
            <li> but no where near the 6x whiter claimed (I drink coffee daily and red wine several times a week).</li>
            <li> I also notice the feel of plaque on my teeth quite often, and not long after I brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is pricier than normal toothpaste, so I will likely use it again, but not completely replace my regular toothpaste with it.</li>
            <li> but I am now noticing a brighter smile with none of the white spots or uneven bleaching I have gotten using traditional whitening gels and trays.</li>
            <li> Also the first part, the cleaner, why is it so firm.</li>
            <li> my first few uses</li>
            <li> The taste of the step 1 toothpaste was as expected of any normal mint toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> My breath felt cleaner after the first brushing and my teeth were whiter after just a few days.  </li>
            <li> This heavy coffee and tea drinker thanks you!</li>
            <li> There are a few cons to the product which users should be aware of</li>
            <li> They always left my teeth sensitive and painful, so I would stop use before seeing good results.</li>
            <li> 4 minutes to whiten and brighten your smile is a small amount to ask.</li>
            <li> I , out of habit rinsed the first few times by accident.</li>
            <li> who would have known!&lt;br /&gt;After my first few days of brushing, i could see and feel a difference.</li>
            <li> My gums were sore and turned whitish in spots for the first few weeks of using this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> two step system just takes longer and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth the effort.</li>
            <li> If you think about it its really no longer than you normally are suppose to brush (the recommended two minutes).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that the for the first few times, I didn&#x27;t like the taste of Step 2, but that was because of the peroxide.</li>
            <li> I never really thought it was going to do anything my normal toothpaste hadn&#x27;t already done.  </li>
            <li> Again, my teeth do \\&quot;feel\\&quot; and look cleaner, but I&#x27;m not sure if it is worth the price for this product.</li>
            <li> Price wise this toothpaste is very expensive</li>
            <li> Price wise this toothpaste is very expensive</li>
            <li> The first step tastes fine, but makes your teeth feel dirty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s minty, it seems to at least cover the basics of giving you clean teeth, but so are regular toothpastes</li>
            <li> So I love having clean teeth, and I hate going to the dentist, I hse</li>
            <li> It is a very thin paste with a very strong mint flavor.  </li>
            <li> Also, both steps (especially step 2) have a pretty strong taste of artificial sweetener.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Step-1 of this process is exactly like any other tube of crest toothpaste, it has the same flavor, the same feel and likely the same result.</li>
            <li> The first step is a little gritty paste that is designed to help be microscrubbers for your teeth.</li>
            <li> And bonus points for whitening better than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried in the past!  </li>
            <li> And bonus points for whitening better than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried in the past!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The two-step system is pretty simple, except for one little thing.  </li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to at first with the different steps</li>
            <li> and I was a little concerned at first cause of the extra time it took to use both tubs.</li>
            <li> And bonus points for whitening better than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried in the past!</li>
            <li> I am a major red wine connoisseur and drink coffee regularly.  </li>
            <li> When I first received it, I was a little hesitant in the amount of time it would take every time I brushed my teeth</li>
            <li> It also helps whitening better than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried in the past!</li>
            <li> When I first read the packaging, I was a little concerned about the warning that you may experience temporary symptoms like white spots or oral discomfort when using this product, but I didn&#x27;t experience anything like that.</li>
            <li> The first tube has an odd flat and gummy feel to it.</li>
            <li> I was a fan of Crest ProHealth in general, so when this new whitening product came out, I was very curious to try it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference with how much whiter my teeth have gotten, which I haven&#x27;t seen with other similar products.</li>
            <li> I expressed to my office personnel that I received Crest ProHealth HD from BzzAgent and even though at first I thought that I would not like having to take the extra time to utilize 2 toothpastes as it became a habit it appeared to take as long as any other teeth brushing routine.  </li>
            <li> However, compared to other brands of whitening toothpaste, the Crest Pro-Health HD made the biggest difference in the whiteness of my teeth - so if your teeth and gums aren&#x27;t very sensitive, I&#x27;d say give it a go!</li>
            <li> my smile has dulled down, After 1 single use of this crest HD you see results!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the whitest teeth due to high fluoride exposure as a child.</li>
            <li> It is high compared to toothpaste alone but compared to other whitening systems the price is quite comparable.  </li>
            <li> The bad news is, I&#x27;m not sure this is a perfect system for everyone.  </li>
            <li> The bad news is, I&#x27;m not sure this is a perfect system for everyone.  </li>
            <li> I give it 3 stars because it did clean my teeth well, but I can&#x27;t get past the dry sensation and the taste of Step 2.  </li>
            <li> At first I will admit I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the two step process since I really, really don&#x27;t enjoy brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li> After a month of use, I have noticed my teeth are slightly whiter, but not as much as I</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind it that much, and I have used both steps for about a week and a half now.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind it that much, and I have used both steps for about a week and a half now.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are slightly whiter, but not by much.</li>
            <li> The Step 2 finishing polish did not have too much of a taste, it was just a slight mint.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a slight improvement in the color of my teeth and my teeth really are \\&quot;squeaky\\</li>
            <li> Only problem is I have sensitive gums so if I use this twice a day for too long I start to get cuts along my gums.</li>
            <li> The whitener is also mild, and please use for at least 1 min each time or it will not work.</li>
            <li> The feeling goes away pretty fast and decreased over a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> Over the past couple of years I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth aren&#x27;t as white as they once were, and I&#x27;d wondered about ways to refresh my smile.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first since it was two steps, but the results were worth it</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply but not a great foamy feel.  </li>
            <li> After the first few days, I ended up only using the Crest system at night.  </li>
            <li> My wife felt an initial surge of encouragement the first few days, but then felt nothing else happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are looking for whitening, I&#x27;m not sure this is worth the extra step.</li>
            <li> I love the just clean feeling from the dentist, but I hate that it only lasts about a week.  </li>
            <li> &quot; show up in the first few days, which was white spots on my gums.  </li>
            <li> Luckily Step 2 quells that drought pretty quickly, but because (and here&#x27;s my second reason)it has a different consistency and is clear, its impossible to use each tube at equal rates resulting in uneven amounts of product as to get closer to the end.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel that it took more than a few seconds longer than usual to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> I noticed a very slight whitening after the first week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whitening power is minimal and I reached full whitening in a few days</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad per se, but not nice and minty like regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> On the downside :  for busy people, including me as a new mom I do have to admit that a two-step process can be a little painstaking at times…  </li>
            <li> When I first received my sample of this two step toothpaste from BzzAgent, I must admit I was more than a little skeptical that 1.</li>
            <li> I must admit that I was a little skeptical at first as I have tried many whitening toothpaste, strips, mouthwashes, etc.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be like any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried, but this product really surprised me!!</li>
            <li> My teeth are pretty white to begin with, but I definitely could have used a little whitening help on the front bottom teeth and didn&#x27;t notice a difference after my 2-week trial period.  </li>
            <li> Naturally, this isn&#x27;t as \\&quot;easy\\&quot; as a single step 2-minute brush, but it&#x27;s not over-burdensome.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The foaming tooth paste in Step 1 removes all plaque stains in a single use as if you had a professional cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> You will get that extreme clean sensation during the day, your teeth will be brighter and after a few weeks they will be whiter (you have to use it twice a day and as directed).</li>
            <li> I will say a few positive things about the product though:  </li>
            <li> I also feel that both tubes will last several months making the cost for the Crest HD very reasonable, especially if it means I can use the more expensive whitening strips less often.</li>
            <li> Normally I wouldn&#x27;t use this type of product due to safety concerns and/or being unfamiliar with it.  </li>
            <li> Due in part to the two packages of toothpaste instead of the normal one.</li>
            <li> I am normally hesitant to spend this much $ on a whitening toothpaste,  but in this case, I would definitely recommend you try it at least once.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of a 2 step cleansing system when I received my complimentary box from BzzAgent, but after having a couple of weeks to test it out, I can say that the 2 step system is no more work than a 1 step toothpaste, but with much better benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Due in part to the two packages of toothpaste instead of the normal one.</li>
            <li> Consistent whitening of teeth on a daily basis, not just a 10 minute, harsh, whitening product that doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a big difference between toothpaste brands in the past, other than in color, taste, and texture, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with the new Crest HD.</li>
            <li> in such a short time my overall mouth has never been this fresh, nor my teeth as slick....</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any whitening of my teeth in the past few weeks, and someone actually took a close-up photo of me a couple weeks ago that made my teeth look more yellow than I thought they were!</li>
            <li> She had cute little pearly whites when she was little but since her adult teeth have come in they&#x27;ve been less than white</li>
            <li> 2- I have a filled tooth in front that usually looks darker than my other teeth, not always responding to whiting products.</li>
            <li> Overall this product only accomplished half the job.  </li>
            <li> However, the whole process really takes less than a few minutes.</li>
            <li> In fact, I would recommend keeping your tongue as far from this clear gel as possible because it does burn slightly.</li>
            <li> It sounds ridiculous, but it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll buy it again if it comes in other flavors and in actual paste format, but for now I think I will stick to my normal Crest Pro Health toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Although it did leave my breath fresh, the whitening affect was minimal, only slightly noticeable after two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> This is worth the cost due to the effects of step 1 even if the whitening part is average.  </li>
            <li> I also have not had any issues with sensitivity even after normal use, unlike other whitening products I&#x27;ve tried, which have definitely caused some discomfort.</li>
            <li> There is a slight minty taste to this light blue gel and your mouth will feel a little grainy after just spitting out &amp;#34;STEP 1&amp;#34;, but it will shortly go away when you have finished the next step.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks my teeth are certainly whiter.</li>
            <li> The smart thing that Crest did was making this your everyday brushing routine.</li>
            <li> The first product has a nice minty flavor, but the second step has an unpleasant after taste that is slightly salty.</li>
            <li> It also gets less gritty after a while, probably because there is less plaque to clean out from regular use.  </li>
            <li> spit that out and put a little of step 2 which is a gel that polishes and whitens on your brush and go on brushing the whole thing took 2 min of my time and gave me results that i get from a dentist trip with no dentist</li>
            <li> It made my gums bleed a little bit, my tongue very sore, and my teeth hurt.</li>
            <li> and I really think that my teeth are getting a little whiter.  </li>
            <li> My teeth did seem to get a little whiter, but I do not have a before and after picture to really tell if they did.  </li>
            <li> This is the one with little funky taste but it is also the one which is responsible for cleaning out the stains and yellowness from your teeth.</li>
            <li> I have to say, while it takes a little moe time to brush my teeth, it really makes them feel cleaner</li>
            <li> I thought brushing for 2 minutes in the morning and evening would take too much time, but I found I could do little things while brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth didn&#x27;t need whitening, so I was a little hesitant to try this product, but I didn&#x27;t really have anything to lose.</li>
            <li> Based upon other reviews (and her new crown)</li>
            <li> The two step process is easy and probably had me brushing for slightly longer than usual.  </li>
            <li> I break down my review into the two main product benefits: cleaning and whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would prefer to have been left with invigorating, minty fresh breath.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was a little nervous to try this since I do have sensitive teeth, but found that my teeth were whiter by about two shades in a little over a week</li>
            <li> It really cleans your teeth to the point where your teeth feel very dry and rough.  </li>
            <li> I find this  Crest HD,, and this is really works, I have a  yellow color  Teeth, but since I try  this for a couple of weeks, I can see a Little bit,  </li>
            <li> It takes a little adjustment to get used to the second brushing, but once you get it, it doesn’t really take any extra time or effort</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical that it would be able to do much for my teeth because I drink a lot of sodas</li>
            <li> I have tried other &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; toothpastes before, but they either didn&#x27;t work well or caused me a lot of discomfort since I have very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> The second step is a clear gel, and it&#x27;s hard to know just how much to use and</li>
            <li> I was curious how long that would last and was pleasantly surprised that coffee (even a iced beverage or frappuchino) didn&#x27;t affect how my teeth felt!!  </li>
            <li> It really is too bad because while having to go through a 2-step process isn&#x27;t the most convenient</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t suppose a bleaching product should taste good, but this one is exceptionally bad.</li>
            <li> I  know it sounds stupid, but it really was kind of an inconvenience.  </li>
            <li> I  know it sounds stupid, but it really was kind of an inconvenience.  </li>
            <li> Then use the second tube which is clear and not very tasty at all.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the paste is good, it is not too thick or too thin.</li>
            <li> The first step leaves my mouth a little dry which I am still getting used to, by the time I finish with step two</li>
            <li> part I worry about is long-term use though in that typically products that whiten teeth are wearing on the enamel/surface of the teeth, so users that have high wear on their teeth (from night grinding or what have you) may be weary.&lt;br</li>
            <li> in all, I highly recommend this product, even if it means brushing for a slightly longer time than I used to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so bad, that I always take pain meds before I arrive (and little good those do!).</li>
            <li> Too much coffee and those pearly whites have been looking less pearly!  </li>
            <li> After I used it for a few times I got used to it, and now barely recognize that residue, but it comes as a shock when you are new to the product.</li>
            <li> , I received this as a free promotion from the brand.&lt;br /&gt;While Crest HD isn&#x27;t a BAD product, it just isn&#x27;t right for me.</li>
            <li> Beware, that very first day it was as if I brushed with liquid nitrogen, the cold burn was pretty nuts.</li>
            <li> You brush your teeth as long as you normally would (two minutes total each brushing), so there&#x27;s no added time or inconvenienced like you can have with strips or other whitening methods.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first that it would work any better than other toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> It was a little odd not rinsing between brushing and switching pastes, but I got used to the routine quickly.</li>
            <li> This change is a little more subtle.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I would use this toothpaste periodically and not everyday due to the effects that it has on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I also only brush in the mornings due to somewhat sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> Received a package of the Crest Pro-Health HD toothpaste for free to try and I was a little skeptical at first.  </li>
            <li> i also have sensitive teeth and usually use sensitive toothpaste, so i really wanted to give it a few weeks before i reviewed to see if i had any unpleasantness or return of sensitivity and after 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I was given this product free to try by Crest through the website BzzAgent and at first I was skeptical of using 2 different tubes to brush my teeth everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much this product costs, but I&#x27;m guessing it is more expensive than your standard tube of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I do agree with previous reviewers that I&#x27;m not sure this whitens dramatically better than other whitening toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other teeth whitening systems in the past (gel with mouth guard and whitening strips that you have to wear for 30 minutes each day), but in just 2 quick minutes, you can get the same result with Crest Pro Health® HD™.  </li>
            <li> Although he had a bit of a hard time adjusting to not &amp;#34;rinsing&amp;#34; after the first step before starting the 2nd step.</li>
            <li> Although he had a bit of a hard time adjusting to not &amp;#34;rinsing&amp;#34; after the first step before starting the 2nd step.</li>
            <li> The price listed here seems a little steep, although I guess you should figure that you&#x27;re basically buying two tubes&#x27; worth of toothpaste, even though this product won&#x27;t last any longer than a typical tube would last.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt clean afterwards, no filmy residue was left behind.</li>
            <li> When I say your teeth stay clean all day long; I literally mean all day long.</li>
            <li> directions are very clear on each tube which definitely helps when one is half awake in the morning.</li>
            <li> I had other sensitive toothpastes that I had been trying.</li>
            <li> I never get this complete of a feeling from any other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Although this product has not made my gums sensitive like other whiteners I am still not a fan of the taste and consistency.</li>
            <li> also found that my teeth did not get sensitive like they do with other whiteners.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and have not noted any issues as I have with other whitening products on the market.</li>
            <li> I have been using other whitening toothpastes for years without nearly the difference.</li>
            <li> By the end of the week my tongue was slightly sensitive to the gel but other than that it didn&#x27;t bother me at all.  </li>
            <li> It really takes about the same amount of time as with the toothpaste I regularly used in the past.  </li>
            <li> Often times I&#x27;ve ended up using one toothpaste for whitening or some other type of benefit and another for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell that my teeth are any whiter, since I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough, but it&#x27;s a simple change and my teeth definitely felt nicer.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last long enough or is enough of a deterrent to stop me from using the HD toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Step one feels and tastes like normal toothpaste, but with a little extra texture from the baking soda.</li>
            <li> Had some friends over and started to talk about high end personal hygiene products that seem to be a waste of money.</li>
            <li> First, it does make your mouth feel a little strange - sort of like it is dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get 6x whiter when your teeth are already pretty white.</li>
            <li> I found it somewhat hard to be consistent with the second step.</li>
            <li> The taste was a little strange (a little medicine taste) but it seemed to clean my teeth</li>
            <li> I had tried their Pro Health Complete mouthwash last year, and the stannous fluoride in left my teeth so badly stained that I had to visit my dentist for a professional cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;After trying this paste (after receiving a free sample from BzzAgent)</li>
            <li> Not only did it remove the coffee stains, but it whitened the dark spots around an old filling.</li>
            <li> if I only used the one minute of brushing as directed by Crest, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon sells this product for nearly $28, which is less than a Crest white strips pack.</li>
            <li> if I only used the one minute of brushing as directed by Crest, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon sells this product for nearly $28, which is less than a Crest white strips pack.</li>
            <li> far as the process goes to using Crest Pro Health, it is a simple 4 step process – 1 – dry brush with the step 1 tube, 2 – spit, 3 – wet brush with the step 3 tube, 4 - rinse mouth</li>
            <li> whole process in the morning took almost the same amount of time I usually spend in the morning brushing my teeth but the feeling of freshness and cleanness</li>
            <li> whole process in the morning took almost the same amount of time I usually spend in the morning brushing my teeth but the feeling of freshness and cleanness</li>
            <li> The second product, the gel, left a strange sensation in my mouth, although this went away once I rinsed out my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long at all to follow the two step routine on a daily basis (the same time it takes to use my electric toothbrush...2 minutes).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product is going to last long on the market especially for $12.</li>
            <li> know you&#x27;re supposed to brush your teeth for 2 minutes, but I usually lose track after the first minute and probably don&#x27;t brush as long as I&#x27;m supposed to.</li>
            <li> I think in the long run I would use this product to get whiter teeth periodically, but switch back to a regular toothpaste for every day use</li>
            <li> It definitely forces you to change your routine, as you have to brush for 1 min with the paste in the grey bottle and 1 min with the gel in the blue bottle.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely something you can use everyday just to take away the stains from normal drinking and eating like coffee and tea.  </li>
            <li> I brush for 1 minute with the first tube which is a thick blue gooey paste.</li>
            <li> The two products still only take two minutes to use, so it&#x27;s actually not a huge change to my normal routine.</li>
            <li> It will make your mouth feel really clean, but a little raw.</li>
            <li> When I first got my Crest Pro Health® HD™ product for free to try from Crest via BzzAgent, I was a little hesitant about the two step process and if it would take too long or be too complicated to want to continue.</li>
            <li> was a little worried about having to use the two step process, but I definitely think it&#x27;s worth it to spend a few extra minutes each day while brushing.</li>
            <li> While step 1 is not really a problem, I actually like the fresh feeling left with this paste, I am rather having a hard time with step 2.</li>
            <li> While step 1 is not really a problem, I actually like the fresh feeling left with this paste, I am rather having a hard time with step 2.</li>
            <li> fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using for about 3 weeks I can report the following:&lt;br /&gt;-My smile is marginally whiter -- this kit works as well as other whitening toothpastes I have used in the past but not as well as Crest White Strips</li>
            <li> You have to brush your teeth a little longer than normal, but not like you have to do it for say 30 minutes or something.  </li>
            <li> The two step process takes a little getting used to, but I believe it is worth the little bit of extra effort.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1 feels like I am brushing with normal toothpaste, but step 2 starts to burn a little bit toward the end of brushing.</li>
            <li> However, it has many positives, including: I have not experienced any sensitivity like with other whitening systems I have tried before, neither gel has an unpleasant taste, and my teeth feel clean after brushing (although perhaps not as minty fresh as with other toothpastes).</li>
            <li> though with only a week of use, I&#x27;m not sure how much of my passing marks could be attributed to the toothpaste (though I had been using Crest Complete Multi-Benefit previously, of which I am a big fan).</li>
            <li> The only minor complaint is, the second step polishing paste runs out before the first step.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of Stand up Tubes because the toothpaste keeps seeping out until we are ready to use it next and gets clogged up in the cap and the mouth of the tube giving it a very messy</li>
            <li> After a week of not using it, and frequently and liberally applying everything from Chapstick to EOS to plain petroleum jelly, my lips are still itchy, dry, and somewhat sensitive.  </li>
            <li> And, I was shocked when they still felt that clean 12 hours later when I was ready to brush again!</li>
            <li> I am an avid drinker of black coffee, unsweet black tea and red wine...</li>
            <li> One other note - the taste of step 2 may take a little getting used to - the first time I used it</li>
            <li> At first, I thought the routine would be hard to stick</li>
            <li> I was hard to not rinse after the first brushing, but once I started bruching with Step 2, I understood why.  </li>
            <li> , it will be my new go-to toothpaste to keep away stains, for everyday use, and help with overall health of my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I have been using new Crest Pro-Health HD Daily two step toothpaste for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because the Hydrogen Peroxide ingredient in step 2 does produce a somewhat less than desirable sensation and taste and foaming action.</li>
            <li> The taste is a strong mint which is acceptable in the tooth paste &amp;#34;business&amp;#34; but I prefer a less subtle taste.</li>
            <li> Sometimes at night when I am super tired I do use a standard toothpaste</li>
            <li> Honestly, firstly, I was a little skeptical because a week seems a very short time to me for any at-home teeth whitening product to work; a few weeks would have seemed believable though.</li>
            <li> I absolutely dislike packaging that are hard to open, Inside there were two tubes in gray and blue color.</li>
            <li> The only negative, is that the first step paste is a little thick and feels like sand is in the paste, but its only a minute and so worth it!</li>
            <li> 2nd step is a clear gel with a slight bitter taste although it&#x27;s barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> Between work, being a single dad and all the things that requires, trying to remember to add in an extra step in my daily routine to deal with those trays meant I never completed a regimen.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on the shelves and was not sure I would want to try it out for $16 as I am usually very thrifty.  </li>
            <li> I really like the slick, shiny feeling</li>
            <li> I absolutely must admit it gets no better than this for years</li>
            <li> Ignoring the fact that teeth, or anything in real life, can&#x27;t be upgraded to HD, I have been using this toothpaste for the past week.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t really been a Crest fan in the past.  </li>
            <li> Usually when I drink coffee and brush afterwards, I still taste coffee no matter how much I brush my tongue and gums.</li>
            <li> not sure how much whiter my teeth will be.</li>
            <li> My teeth whitened at least 2 shades after the first brush.  </li>
            <li> It was too late after the first use.</li>
            <li> I really like the way that the toothpaste makes my teeth feel, but am not sure that I notice a difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel the need to jump to grab a piece of gum straight after my coffee and no more of that &amp;#34;fuzzy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Usually when I drink coffee and brush afterwards, I still taste coffee no matter how much I brush my tongue and gums.  </li>
            <li> This is so much easier than using the Crest whitening strips that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> It seems to vanish days later so for those those two blissful visits a year to the dentist, I cherish that silky smooth feeling and the weird tiny gap between the bottom of my front lower</li>
            <li> I would have given this 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t take that much longer than my usual routine and have the need for two separate tubes.</li>
            <li> I either haven&#x27;t been using the product long enough to notice a difference (it has been a week)</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue to use this product for as long as it is on the market.</li>
            <li> You aren&#x27;t just slathering on a flat toothpaste and hoping it&#x27;s doing what it says it will do, with Crest Pro Health HD</li>
            <li> The second issue I had was how long the process took</li>
            <li> I will keep buying this product for as long as it keeps delivering the same results!</li>
            <li> The process did not take long at all-apply one paste to your toothbrush and brush for 1 minute, spit without rinsing, and then repeat the process with a different paste.  </li>
            <li> Crest 3D white toothpaste and Pro Health mouthwash have been my go-to products for a long time.</li>
            <li> Also, it made me realize that before using Crest Pro HD I wasnt brushing my teeth long enough.  </li>
            <li> The combination of the deep cleaning toothpaste and the whitening gel works to remove those minor stains</li>
            <li> my teeth or make them &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; than regular toothpaste a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> the set is going to last you a long time.</li>
            <li> I will see if how long it will last if stop using for a while.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t last that long after use.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it dramatically whitened my teeth, because I&#x27;ve been using regular Crest Whitening paste for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is that because it has separate tubes it takes twice as long to brush my teeth now.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that because it has separate tubes it takes twice as long to brush my teeth now.</li>
            <li> For me though, it only lasted for as long as I was using it, so I had to use it every day.</li>
            <li> My only critique is that the actual tubes were a lot smaller than what I expected.</li>
            <li> The last thing I noticed immediately is that the cleanliness and freshness lasted for a long time.  </li>
            <li> None of them left any strange aftertaste.</li>
            <li> None of them left any strange aftertaste.</li>
            <li> Probably the fact that the product has two parts with two different toothpaste tubes makes me think it is going to take too long to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> all i rate this system a 3 instead of a 4 because to the flavor of the polishing and the not lasting all day long.  </li>
            <li> I received this toothpaste as a promotion and have to say that I couldn&#x27;t even use it long enough to find out if it whitened my teeth.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t last that long after use.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that my teeth were not sensitive like when I use white strips.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to figure it out what will I do if the step 2 runs faster than the step</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a minor hassle, but not enough to take anything away from the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
            <li> only caution would be those with either sensitive teeth, or sensitive gums/areas, is to take it slow.  </li>
            <li> only caution would be those with either sensitive teeth, or sensitive gums/areas, is to take it slow.  </li>
            <li> After a few hours they would return to their normal color.</li>
            <li> And while I do think my teeth look brighter right after I use it, a few hours later any difference has disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, and I know this is a little thing,</li>
            <li> It does add a certain degree of ritual to your routine if you typically brush and go in the rush to get to work as you&#x27;re supposed to brush for one minute with one paste then brush for another minute with the other before rinsing.</li>
            <li> Actually, it barely has a taste, and you can hardly taste it with the toothpaste in your mouth, but, if you do taste it, you may not enjoy it, and I wish it were a little better tasting because of that.</li>
            <li> Normally I have the worst taste in my mouth not long after using regular toothpaste, but after using the Crest Pro two step system; my mouth stays fresh and clean tasting all day!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only negative I can think of is that I rinse with cold water and sometimes I get that sensation of your mouth freezing (like if you chewed spearmint gum and drank water), but it goes away quickly and it&#x27;s likely due to the flavor more than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the first use, I was shocked with how clean my teeth and mouth felt.</li>
            <li> I did have to cut down to using the regiment once a day because I have sensitive teeth, but my teeth have still gotten progressively whiter.</li>
            <li> An added bonus is that your teeth do not feel sensitive as with other whitening products!</li>
            <li> My teeth however are yellow that i dont think any one can avoid any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the regular Crest tooth past, so an offer from bzzagent to try the new Crest Pro Health toothpaste was a no brainier.</li>
            <li> It requires one minute per tube with no rinsing in-between which can make it a little messy, but if it makes your teeth whiter, it would be worth it.  </li>
            <li> Especially when I&#x27;m rushing to get off to work in the morning, or when I&#x27;m super tired after a long day of work and then getting the kids to bed.</li>
            <li> began using this system with a bit of hesitation because my mouth is somewhat sensitive to whitening toothpastes &amp; gels and inevitably is affected, usually through drymouth, by such chemicals, but this paste seems to be different.  </li>
            <li> but I’m not sure that I would purchase this toothpaste going forward, when I consider all the concerns I described above along with the high price</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical when I read that improvements would include a few shades whiter in a week, but I have to admit, that even through smoking and drinking coffee daily, I did receive a noticeably whiter smile.</li>
            <li> The only strange thing I noticed with the toothpaste was that after you are done with step 1 there is a chalky like texture left in your mouth, so I really felt forced to use step 2.  </li>
            <li> I usually brush with Sensodyne, and my sensitivity is usually to temperature, so I was so surprised when my teeth were in total PAIN when I first used this.</li>
            <li> The only thing so far that I can say would be a drawback is that after brushing, my tongue, roof of mouth and cheeks seem to feel a little dry, or gritty.  </li>
            <li> Nothing major like other products would do, but still some discomfort.</li>
            <li> I can not use the Second Step daily because it &amp;#34;burns&amp;#34; my gums causing white spots and extreme sensitivity, I do Step 2 maybe three times a week.</li>
            <li> It makes your teeth feel like you just left the dentist all day long!</li>
            <li> My opinion of the product, 4/5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;SLS is not a major ingredient in the tooth polish, but it does contain some.</li>
            <li> Other than adding a second toothpaste to my routine, it didn&#x27;t feel much different from my regular brushing regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean by the end of the first minute my toothbrush is truly squeaking on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely a product I will be using for a long time!</li>
            <li> The Crest Pro-Health HD is my new everyday toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I have been using this new 2 step process for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> so step 2 was a very long minute for me personally,</li>
            <li> I have found that the paste works just as well, but it the second polishing paste tastes bad on its own.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any dramatic improvement, but my mouth feels clean.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that, like most toothpastes anymore, this has artificial sweeteners in it that make my gums swell &amp; bleed.</li>
            <li> It uses the previous steps action cleanser to finish the job.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner and plaque forms less frequently on my teeth than it use to.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner and plaque forms less frequently on my teeth than it use to.  </li>
            <li> I have previously been told I have early stages of gingivitis so opting for a whitening product, which also contains stannous fluoride,</li>
            <li> I plan on continuing using Crest HD so that I can have to do less frequent whitening with the strips.</li>
            <li> Gone are the days of painting your teeth and keeping your mouth open, so that the painted whitener will dry.  </li>
            <li> , there is no chalky dry mouth feeling and the freshness lasts for several hours.</li>
            <li> When I received my free trial from Bzz agent I was fairly skeptical  because of the amount of time Crest HD recommended to whiten your teeth was only 2 minutes a day.  </li>
            <li> The second agent was a gel which reversed the dry sensation, and had no taste.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have not noticed a difference in my teeth after using it for 3+ weeks, and for the hassle of going through the two-step process every morning, I expected more.</li>
            <li> and I have used the whole product at least twice daily.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s expensive, I&#x27;ll probably buy this kit every few months because I really liked the change.</li>
            <li> It can irritate gums and your mouth slightly if you&#x27;re sensitive--</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave 4 not 5 stars is I feel your mouth feels a bit dry after use,</li>
            <li> /&gt;update: After using it for a while, my gums are less sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I was really pleasantly surprised in less than a week by</li>
            <li> Years ago I was obsessed with the idea of Crest Pro-Health, so I went out and purchased the whole whole of products.</li>
            <li> When I got a free box of the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two Step Toothpaste from Crest through bzzagent, I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> The product did leave a slight tingle sensation after using so if you have sensitive gums or mouth this product may not be for you.</li>
            <li> Step 2 made my mouth dry, but that only lasted while brushing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever been--I typically swear by my natural toothpastes and homemade brushing powders.</li>
            <li> I typically use a sensitive toothpaste formula.  </li>
            <li> This is a two-step process that takes slightly longer than your old fashioned brushing routine...</li>
            <li> I do notice that it makes my mouth feel dry during the actual brushing, strangely enough, but it doesn&#x27;t stay dry after rinsing.</li>
            <li> OK so I bought these after I felt my regular whitening toothpaste wasn&#x27;t cutting it.  </li>
            <li> I got this free to test, and I was skeptical of needing two different toothpastes to get this job done.  </li>
            <li> It might sound silly (after all there are only 2 tubes)</li>
            <li> I rather have less sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Another bonus is that so far this is the only Crest toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t give me canker sores after a few days of use.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt markedly cleaner, and I also noticed a improvement in the whiteness and brightness of my teeth after only a few days use.  </li>
            <li> A few of my friends actually asked if id had a professional whitening.</li>
            <li> I decide to go through a professional whitening session, then I will definitely use this set to maintain every few days.</li>
            <li> Step Two doesn&#x27;t taste like much at all - it is a thin clear gel.</li>
            <li> its whitened my teeth from this gross yellow and white spotted from having braces to a &amp;#34;less yellow&amp;#34; in the last week and a half.</li>
            <li> I only ever see my teeth this white after the dentist cleans them, and really, not even then.  </li>
            <li> Did I leave them on long enough or too long?</li>
            <li> seriously I gave it a few more tries.</li>
            <li> The secnd one requires you to twist and completely remove the lid which seems to be a pain, especially when you have a messy toothbrush in your hands.  </li>
            <li> The toothpaste itself also left my mouth feeling rough, and I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the taste.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if I attribute that to the product itself or the fact that I normally don&#x27;t brush for 2 solid minutes every day</li>
            <li> So I was surprised that after only a few days, my teeth seemed whiter, brighter.</li>
            <li> There is not a real flavor to step 1 which also made the experience different from a standard toothpaste.</li>
            <li> After a week or two, I couldn&#x27;t really take the gum abuse anymore and reduced my usage of this toothpaste to 1x a day (instead of 2) but have slowly weaned back 100% to my Colgate go-to paste.</li>
            <li> It is a two step process that does take a little longer than my usual toothpaste but worth the extra time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not totally sure about the whitening as I have some veneers, but overall it seems like I have a little brighter smile.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try and a little extra money than ordinary toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It was a little odd to not rinse out my mouth after the first step, but I overcame the urge and powered through to the end.  </li>
            <li> I did experience some sensitivity when I first started the product,but I cut down to once a day for a few days and it went away.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not totally within my normal routine because of the two step process which isn&#x27;t technically that much longer than the two minutes I typically brush, but seems ages longer when you&#x27;re tired at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> The only downside is the second step has an unpleasant flavor, but most whitening products do.</li>
            <li> While it may sound slightly complicated, it really takes no more time than a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; tooth care routing.  </li>
            <li> Further, I should already be concerned with fluoride in general, but, it is a concession I have made to prevent cavities, I&#x27;m not comfortable with the sucralose and that is reason enough to state that after this trial I will NOT remain a crest pro health hd</li>
            <li> it can cause removable tooth staining (and maybe other reasons that aren&#x27;t apparent to me).  </li>
            <li> I have used white strips in the past and my teeth were left quite sensitive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many whitening products in the past and they always are messy or have a harsh taste, this product was nothing like that.  </li>
            <li> This annoyed me from the very first moment I used the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have a situation that not many of us have when we  start using a new product that could make a visual difference in appearance.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was skeptical at first because it seems like toothpaste brands are always looking for a new gimmick.  </li>
            <li> So I was skeptical at first about the practicality of me sticking to a new brushing routine that included 2 steps.</li>
            <li> Still not sure if I got six shades whiter in two weeks, but I definitely noticed a difference and can see myself using this as my new Crest toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of the 2 step brushing, but was pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to brush with this system.</li>
            <li> and I noticed that the first tube wasn&#x27;t sealed tightly at the bottom and leaked when I squeezed toothpaste onto my brush, but using a little Yankee ingenuity took care of that issue.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> in that I would back off to using it once per day and alternate with the Sensodyne to settle it back down.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The first part is a thick gel toothpaste that makes your mouth feel a bit dry.</li>
            <li> Due to the sensitive spots(probably due to recent dentist cleaning), I had to stop for a little while, but the old staining is not returning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to see more dramatic results after using this product a little longer.</li>
            <li> but, overall you&#x27;re still brushing as long as you should be with a single toothpaste</li>
            <li> I only use this two-step paste at night and continue to use the Crest 3D White in the morning and at other times during the day.  </li>
            <li> This 2 step process is definitely easier and less gross than white strips and trays.  </li>
            <li> The other toothpaste had made my teeth very white already, so the Crest toothpaste only had to maintain that whiteness.</li>
            <li> I have tried to go back to other toothpaste, it&#x27;s just not the same!!  </li>
            <li> Anyway, as other reviewers have stated, the feeling after using this product is VERY similar to the feeling after visiting the dentist for your regular cleanings.</li>
            <li> After the initial week of using only this, I started switching it up and using it every other day.</li>
            <li> After the initial week of using only this, I started switching it up and using it every other day.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try the Crest Pro Health HD system, but with sensitive teeth I was afraid my mouth could not tolerate it.</li>
            <li> Since the total 2 minutes is the same as a typical mouth cleansing time, I was back on the bandwagon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> Using Crest Pro Health HD was no different than the act of brushing my teeth with any other toothpaste, so I predicted that it would be a whitening product that I could actually stick with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have permanently damaged yellow teeth due to tetracycline when i was younger</li>
            <li> I am about half way through my sample and would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a whitening toothpaste that actually works.ing for a whitening toothpaste that actually works.</li>
            <li> The product takes 1 minute for the first step, 1 minute for the 2nd step, so it was no more time than I typically brush.  </li>
            <li> had only been using Crest Pro Health HD once a day and my regular toothpaste at other times.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, I use Listerine Zero mouthwash, and for whatever reason, I get a very dry feeling on my gums and tongue when using my mouthwash after the two-step whitening system.</li>
            <li> Step 2 is a clear whitening polish which had little taste and didn&#x27;t leave that sticky or gooey residue.</li>
            <li> Step 2 is a clear gel and tastes a little like peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The mornings are a little too busy to do the two steps for me.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth this may also hurt your gums or teeth for a little while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My gums are a little sensitive</li>
            <li> , I had to stop for a little while, but the old staining is not returning.  </li>
            <li> Maybe because my gum was a little sensitive.</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised to see the price tag</li>
            <li> was little worried too that it might make my teeth sensitive after using step2-whitening piece every day</li>
            <li> I was a bit annoyed at first because there are two steps but after two weeks I see it as the shampoo and conditioner for my teeth!</li>
            <li> The flavor is very nice on the first step, though the second has a heavy hydrogen peroxide taste that&#x27;s not great, but not too bad.  </li>
            <li> I first began using the new Crest Pro-health HD product approximately 2 weeks ago, and have noticed a slight difference in the brightness/whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> , nothing dramatic has occurred, but I really didn&#x27;t expect anything at all, and it seems to be making a small difference, which I think is worth buying the product.</li>
            <li> After the first few days, I noticed my gums were a little sore.  </li>
            <li> but I really didn’t find that it was too hard.</li>
            <li> my teeth are whiter after trying it, but it&#x27;s hard to say really.</li>
            <li> it is hard to say how much whiter they will get.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed my teeth being much whiter, but I think it&#x27;s hard to tell for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I was a little skeptical that I had to brush for 2 whole minutes, but it is what I should be doing anyway!</li>
            <li> They were getting a little yellow since my last whitening and this has definitely brightened them up.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other teeth whitening systems, this new kit does not require sticking strips of plastic on your teeth or biting down on a plastic tray.</li>
            <li> However, I have also noticed that this step 2 is effective at removing bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first tube or step one does an amazing job of removing that awful fuzzy feeling that my teeth develops over night and during the day between brushing.</li>
            <li> The first tube or step one does an amazing job of removing that awful fuzzy feeling that my teeth develops over night and during the day between brushing.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free sample and was skeptical - 2 minutes of brushing sounded like a long time</li>
            <li> my BzzKit arrived with the Crest Pro Health HD kit, I was glad to see that there weren&#x27;t any crazy contraptions involved.</li>
            <li> I got this for free through BzzAgent and was rather skeptical because every specialty whitening product I&#x27;ve tried has made my teeth start to hurt after a couple of days, forcing me to quit whatever whitening regimen I&#x27;m on.</li>
            <li> wanted to let at least one week elapse before I wrote this review, but this product really does work in days.</li>
            <li> When I recieced my free sample of Crest Pro Health HD, I was skeptical.</li>

            <li> When I recieced my free sample of Crest Pro Health HD, I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this free and was a tad skeptical about it.</li>
            <li> Received a free trial of Crest ProHealth HD and I was initially skeptical of the 2 step system.</li>
            <li> I do my best to put as few nasty, toxic chemicals in &amp; on my body as is reasonably possible.</li>
            <li> In addition, Crest offers a money back guarantee to customers who are not satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> At first it seems inconvenient to use two toothpastes each night, but it actually seems to make a difference and the two-tube thing becomes a normal part of your routine.</li>
            <li> Years ago I suffered from extreme tooth sensitivity and used Sensodyne or other sensitive toothpaste for years to overcome the sensitivity.</li>
            <li> As a smoker who drinks coffee and dark soda on a daily basis, I could use all the help whitening my teeth as possible.  </li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used whitening strips, but could only use them for a week before my teeth became overly sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I have used white strips in the past which are a complete pain and take weeks to work.  </li>
            <li> Based on my past experience using Crest Whitestripes that left my gums extremely sensitive, I was a bit hesitate in trying this</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long.</li>
            <li> results are the whitest cleanest feeling teeth I have had in a long time.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use, I can say that I am pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I even get strange looks in the restroom at a restaurant.  </li>
            <li> not a fan of the taste of the step 1 paste (personal preference - not really a con)</li>
            <li> The whitener also has a bit of a strange flavor to it.  </li>
            <li> As I no longer use the bleaching trays, I often look for products that I can use to whiten minor stains from drinking tea, coffee, and soda.  </li>
            <li> Four minutes has never felt SO LONG.  </li>
            <li> So this is a product that actually does what it promises as far as whitening, does not take any more time that your normal brushing needs are now and doesn&#x27;t have that awful taste whiteners have at times.</li>
            <li> I really do not see that big of difference in the color of my teeth, but I did stop using it after a week.</li>
            <li> After using it for as long as I have</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t look forward to brushing your teeth because this 2-step process takes a long time.</li>
            <li> But the fact that it lasts this long and how long it takes each time you use it, I&#x27;ll never put myself through this 2-step system again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also curious to see if both steps run out at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long</li>
            <li> and I have already whitened my teeth before, which is why I waited so long to write a review...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey (almost $14) for toothpaste so definitely get it here on Amazon, but I suppose it&#x27;s not really JUST toothpaste, is it?</li>
            <li> He suggested it could be from the harsh whitening products, that it probably stripped whatever protection I had, causing them to become sensitive again.</li>
            <li> My issues with it were minor compared to the result.</li>
            <li> so I would have to guess how long I had been brushing.</li>
            <li> Crest&#x27;s system cleans and whitens with no more effort than normal brushing.</li>
            <li> I have been a Crest toothpaste user for a long time but was looking for something to kick up the whitening a notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels kinda rough or grainy on your teeth and gums but don&#x27;t worry the next step will polish it away.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste has an ok flavor, not very minty (I hate mint) and step 2 really doesn&#x27;t have any flavor that I can tell.</li>
            <li> so I brush twice as long</li>
            <li> My teeth are whiter and cleaner than they have been in a long time.</li>
            <li> so it was a bit strange not having minty breath</li>
            <li> It only takes off the surface stains which are minimal.</li>
            <li> so it was a long year.  </li>
            <li> I am not wild about having to wash for two minutes</li>
            <li> I just added one extra step and a few minutes to my normal routine and in a few days not only did I notice a difference</li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t like, but can understand is that you have to brush for what seems like a really long time and there are two parts to this system.  </li>
            <li> teeth have long been a thorn in my side.</li>
            <li> Dont know how long your supposed to use the system</li>
            <li> However, what I don&#x27;t like is that the toothpaste leaves a strange sensation.... almost like drying your mouth out.</li>
            <li> I was curious to see if my teeth would actually have a change.</li>
            <li> That is totally my fault, but I have a bit of a mental block about using two products when I brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have even noticed that the minor swelling I had in my gums is no longer visible.</li>
            <li> Mouth feels cleaner but a strange feeling on gums which does go away  throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> The step one leaves a strange chalky taste in your mouth, but it goes away after using step 2.  </li>
            <li> The 2 minutes seems long</li>
            <li> The aftertaste of the second product felt bitter and did not seem to help with morning breath for me.  </li>
            <li> I was actually excited about this because I&#x27;ve had some trouble with other whitening systems in the past.</li>
            <li> So if you are constantly strapped for time, although a minimal addition to the toothbrushing process, you will need to stay close by your bathroom in order to apply the perfecting gel (step 2) after using the purifying cleanser</li>
            <li> We will continue to buy the product as long as it keeps working and after 2 weeks it&#x27;s still making a difference.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt cleaner all day long.</li>
            <li> Based on use of it so far, I&#x27;m expecting it to last at least twice as long as my regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> it would take one person a long time to go through it.</li>
            <li> also found the packaging to be strange.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Crest uses stannous fluoride has been around and approved by the FDA for quite a long time.  </li>
            <li> I had no trouble with the two step system after brushing for a few days.  </li>
            <li> The fact that it is a two-step process is an extremely minor inconvenience, though when you have an electric toothbrush (as I do)</li>
            <li> but I feel the price stands in the way of making this become part of my brushing ritual in the long run.</li>
            <li> Some feel the two step process takes you twice a long to brush and see it as a pain...</li>
            <li> Although my teeth only showed minimal whitening before I had to discontinue use.  </li>
            <li> However, this is a relatively minor</li>
            <li> Instead of having to deal with bleaching trays or strips that have to stay on a long time, you just take just a couple of minutes to brush with Step 1 and then just a couple of minutes to brush with Step 2.</li>
            <li> The whitening product was just a complete waste of time.</li>
            <li> I also realized this 2 step toothpaste takes away the need for separate whitening products therefore saving time in the long run.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it has a strange side effect of making you feel like you have cotton mouth while brushing.</li>
            <li> No strips or whitening trays to leave on for long periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> This takes no more time than my normal routine.  </li>
            <li> Stannous fluoride has been around and approved by the FDA for quite a long time.  </li>
            <li> My mouth was definitely blown away by the power of the polish and it actually burned a bit (a minty burn)...but only for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> This is not old Crest by any means.</li>
            <li> The two step process did not take as long as I though</li>
            <li> This is a minor issue, however, and I will still continue to use it.</li>
            <li> It took a while to get used to not completely getting the product out of my mouth, but once I got used to it</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t stopped using this product yet, so I can&#x27;t say whether or not this is a temporary effect, i.e. contingent on continued use or if my teeth will remain white if I switch to a non-whitening</li>
            <li> like they were polished at the dentist all day long.  </li>
            <li> Also, since you are supposed to use both products for one minute each, you need to have a clock or a timer around you while you brush your teeth, or just guess on how long you&#x27;ve been brushing...</li>
            <li> Skepticism aside, I have tried several whitening options over the years, but they never really work.  </li>
            <li> I think it was because I was not used to brushing my teeth that long.</li>
            <li> also found the packaging to be strange.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take twice as long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also never used a 2-step teeth-cleaning system, so I was curious to see how it would compare with regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Brushing twice takes twice as long, so if you&#x27;re in a hurry, this is not the way to go.</li>
            <li> Brushing twice takes twice as long, so if you&#x27;re in a hurry, this is not the way to go.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I went so long without it.</li>
            <li> My teeth were not sensitive after using it.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend Crest Pro Health HD, although I would not pay full price for it because it is a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> High-end whitening treatments aren&#x27;t in my budget at the moment, and I hate the sticky mess of whitening strips, so I was excited when I received a free sample of Crest Pro-Health HD from Crest and Bzz</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product, but it&#x27;s annoying that I have to brush my teeth twice to use it.  </li>
            <li> Especially if you&#x27;ve been spending money on white strips or the like, you&#x27;ll cut down on expenses and time used in the long run!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to have to set it down to open the second tube.</li>
            <li> The only down side is having two different steps</li>
            <li> After you brush your teeth feel clean and there is little to no after taste or dry mouth common with other options.&lt;br /&gt;The 2nd tube</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure that I would only buy this particular Crest toothpaste due to the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m a daily 2-cup coffee drinker</li>
            <li> I am a HEAVY coffee drinker and as a result I usually see light staining at the corners of my bottom front teeth and slight brown lines on the backside of my bottom front teeth.</li>
            <li> Some people might be annoyed by how the first paste makes your mouth feel really dry, and then you have to use the 2nd product (a gel), but I did not find it bothersome.  </li>
            <li> I believe it has whitened my teeth somewhat, but I am also a red wine &amp; coffee drinker, so at least it is keeping the new stains at bay.</li>
            <li> Works well quickly and doesn&#x27;t make teeth sensitive to cold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it once/day (at night) for the past week and a half and now know why she was advocating for it so much!  </li>
            <li> Frankly, I&#x27;ve seen better results from one step tooth pastes that were less expensive and not as harmful to my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> and although I&#x27;ve only used it for a short amount of time, I see a slight improvement in the color.  </li>
            <li> However, the toothpaste slightly burned my gums each time and left temporary white spots on my gums.  </li>
            <li> I alternate between a regular toothbrush and an electric, and I used less of the product with my electric toothbrush (about a pea sized amount).</li>
            <li> Whiter teeth in less than a month with regular brushing twice a day, and no coffee yellow spots anywhere to be seen!  </li>
            <li> Granted, I like to drink black coffee and red wine (not at the same time) so getting my teeth whiter is a challenge.</li>
            <li> The only difference here is stopping half way through to add a second paste to your brush.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste is more expensive than my previous paste, but I do plan on continuing with it even after I run out of my sample.</li>
            <li> The second step is essentially a low dose whitening gel and can cause some to feel anything from a range to slight discomfort or severe pain.</li>
            <li> After 45 days of using the whitening product my teeth actually look less white.  </li>
            <li> On a typical day I would notice my teeth were yellow and gross by the time lunchtime was over.</li>
            <li> However I expect that you could probably buy a different toothpaste for half the price that would do the same.</li>
            <li> Again trying not to split before you had enough time was difficult to remember but working on this so breaking habits of swishing a spiting to quickly.  </li>
            <li> I will not go back to single step brushing again!!</li>
            <li> I mean really.... 2 bottles?</li>
            <li> , I may not have tried it otherwise, now I am not sure that I can live with out it.</li>
            <li> Even with very hot / cold sensitive teeth, I have not noticed any increased sensitivity while using this product.</li>
            <li> I can only use the product once a day due to some minor gum irritation (probably from the hydrogen peroxide).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much whiter my teeth look to other people.  </li>
            <li> I was not a fan of the step 1 purifying cleanser, it also leaves a strange residue on your teeth and gums that feels quite chalky and dry.</li>
            <li> I have tried whitening strips in the past, but had to discontinue due to how much it hurt.</li>
            <li> The only other issue is that I can&#x27;t find anywhere that says how long it should take before seeing results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other whitening processes in the past and this is so much easier.</li>
            <li> There is a slight aftertaste after using the whitener, but it&#x27;s certainly not as bad as other whiteners and can hardly be noticed.</li>
            <li> The two step system was a little confusing at first, but now I am used to using two different pastes.  </li>
            <li> With four small kiddos, I was really skeptical about a product that was going to take twice the amount of time as my normal routine, but the prospect of having whiter teeth was worth the extra time!</li>
            <li> 1- I have very sensitive teeth that usually hurt when using whitening products</li>
            <li> However, I have very sensitive teeth, and teeth whitening usually comes at the expense of comfort.</li>
            <li> And this shouldn&#x27;t matter at all, but the label on step 2 is upside down if you place the tube on the flat part of the cap, the opposite of step 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried several different products with little to no positive results but Crest Pro-Health HD Two-Step Toothpaste actually did what it said it would do!</li>
            <li> My teeth are probably just average (not darkly stained and not super white).</li>
            <li> I can hardly keep it in my mouth long enough to complete the treatment which is &amp;#34;ONE MINUTE&amp;#34; for each of the two tubes.</li>
            <li> but if you miss those subtle clues you will still know if you are holding the right paste because step one has a flip-top toothpaste cap and is minty green like toothpaste, and the second step has a twist cap with a pointy nozzle.</li>
            <li> Especially if you have certain teeth that dont behave and will get worse when you cant visit the dentist for any reason, Crest Pro-Health will keep it under control.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to my other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different types of tooth paste and whitening gels only to be disappointed in the end.  </li>
            <li> Pick up clothes, make lunch, or other short 2 minute tasks.</li>
            <li> so it took a little longer than a week to notice major results.</li>
            <li> then I do from other regular whitening toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> I have used other similar products</li>
            <li> When the package of Colgate Pro Health HD toothpaste arrived I noticed something different about this product than other products I had seen.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been a smoker last year and his teeth were a little yellow.</li>
            <li> Overall, if you are looking for a whitening process for your teeth, I like having the Crest Pro-Health HD system and would recommend it to anyone who takes pride in the results they get by putting a little extra effort.</li>
            <li> will say that I did experience a little gum sensitivity the first couple of days, but I&#x27;m past that now.</li>
            <li> The color of my teeth remained the same &amp; I didn&#x27;t notice any of the &amp;#34;sparkle&amp;#34; that other users mentioned.  </li>
            <li> When you inevitably run out of one before the other, you&#x27;re going to have to go buy both.  </li>
            <li> When you inevitably run out of one before the other, you&#x27;re going to have to go buy both.  </li>
            <li> I also occasionally use whitening strips or other whitening products to combat stains to my teeth from drinking coffee.</li>
            <li> My teeth are already fairly white from the other products I use throughout the year, but this product maintains the whiteness as a part of my brushing routine rather than having to use another product in addition to brushing.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed to be sure, but for anyone out there with a history of sensitivity, this may not be the product for you!</li>
            <li> Due to not having insurance, I stopped visiting my dentist over ten years ago.</li>
            <li> Has similar ingredients to other whitening toothpastes.</li>
            <li> It only took a minute with each paste, then rinse and spit like any other toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> The cleanest my teeth have been in a long time!</li>
            <li> The feeling is a little gritty though there is no actual grit.  </li>
            <li> really white and other people are even noticing.</li>
            <li> After step 1 your teeth are left feeling a little gritty, but step 2 seems to polish the grittiness away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll switch to a routine of using this every other day to see if I can have some of the benefits without all of the side effects, but that makes for a lot of clutter having three different toothpaste tubes on my bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a product I&#x27;m probably going to incorporate into my regular regimen, probably using it at night every other day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a product I&#x27;m probably going to incorporate into my regular regimen, probably using it at night every other day.</li>
            <li> It also felt a bit grainier than other toothpastes, but maybe this is because I couldn&#x27;t rinse after I brushed.</li>
            <li> and I was really excited to give it a try, but overally not impressed.  </li>
            <li> The results I received were similar to those I’ve gotten using other at-home whitening products:</li>
            <li> /&gt;This toothpaste actually makes my mouth/teeth feel cleaner that any other I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> but I find it a bit of a pain to stop halfway through brushing to add a squirt of whitening gel when other toothpastes claim do do the same thing all in one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, if you are looking to whiten your teeth, give this a shot (but if you&#x27;re teeth are already white, Crest&#x27;s other products could fill the bill).  </li>
            <li> Although, I was a bit skeptical about having to do 2 steps instead of just one, the results are worth it!</li>
            <li> but I definitely feel as though this product keeps my teeth cleaner feeling than any other toothpaste I have tried.</li>
            <li> Noticably whiter teeth after only a couple of uses and my teeth feel cleaner than they have with any other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I had to stop using due to my gums turning white.</li>
            <li> only I decided to use it every other day to start with.  </li>
            <li> Possibly if I use it just once a day or every other day I wouldn&#x27;t have that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was excited to try out the two-step Crest Pro Health® HD(tm)</li>
            <li> I will say that after a week I have gone to using the 2nd step just daily because I did notice that my gums became a little sore if I used the whitening gel</li>
            <li> It also felt a bit grainier than other toothpastes, but maybe this is because I couldn&#x27;t rinse after I brushed.</li>
            <li> As someone who drinks copious amounts of coffee (and a red wine-lover to boot), my teeth are always needing a little help in the white department.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to everyone to try especially any other fellow coffee drinkers.</li>
            <li> This being said, following the directions (brush, don&#x27;t rinse, add other product and brush, rinse)</li>
            <li> Every other toothpaste that claimed whiter teeth fell short on their promise.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of whitening products and this one seems to be about the same as any other.</li>
            <li> I used the product for about 3 weeks to see if I could see significant whitening, and unfortunately, I did not.</li>
            <li> Also, if you have  any sensitivity to other whitening products, you will probably have the same with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave it shot, but was ultimately disappointed given that it costs 2-3 times more than regular toothpaste but only noticed a marginal whitening effect.</li>
            <li> It seemed to have a grainy texture that felt like it was cleaning deeper than other toothpastes, similar to a dental cleaning.</li>
            <li> When this product arrived, I was both excited and skeptical.</li>
            <li> What I like: I do notice a reduction in the visible hard plaque that resides on a particular area on my teeth.</li>
            <li> The only Con I encountered was that it left my mouth a little on the dry side</li>
            <li> I do have some sensitivity to it as I typically use a sensitive toothpaste due to sensitivity issues.  </li>
            <li> The freshness stays with me for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I&#x27;m very careful about chemicals and thus prefer using Essential Oil cleansers.</li>
            <li> As a casual coffee and tea drinker (one or two cups a day combined), my teeth tend to get minor stains, especially if I forget to drink water right after tea or coffee.</li>
            <li> If you have ever used a whitening strip, the second whitening paste does have that peroxide like taste and an interesting feel, but it is not too bad.</li>
            <li> but my mouth almost felt too dry to me.</li>
            <li> My mouth is also painfully dry after one use.</li>
            <li> dry mouth feeling that others have mentioned, but</li>
            <li> I found it to give me dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> They did however have a dry sensation and you are not to rinse in-between steps.</li>
            <li> Step one is a flip cap, but step two is a twist off and once you have already started brushing your teeth you need to get your hands dry to get the cap off.</li>
            <li> Without rinsing my mouth, I move onto step 2, which immediately relieves that dry mouth feeling.</li>
            <li> This dry mouth feeling does go away after step 2</li>
            <li> From a price point, this is an fairly expensive product for those of us who have used off the shelf Crest before, it retails for between $12-15, and the tubes are smaller than normal toothpaste and last about half the time, roughly about two weeks as opposed to about a month for a normal size tube.</li>
            <li> One thing I didn’t notice was an increased in dry mouth after each use.  </li>
            <li> Dry mouth-</li>
            <li> Like cotton mouth x100, hangover dehydration mouth and not having water for 5 days dry.</li>
            <li> I always had problems with the teeth in the corners missing out on the lovin that my front ones got, as we know white strips dont reach all the way to the back.  </li>
            <li> Also, you do get some white spots on your gums for a few brief seconds, which I believe is part of the peroxide in the whitening paste.</li>
            <li> The Crest HD product contains stannous fluoride as the active ingredient which not only helps prevent cavities, but also has antibacterial properties which helps fight plaque, protect against gingivitis, and helps reduce tooth sensitivity (beyond that of sodium fluoride).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d use this twice a day because of the whitening product and possible sensitivity, but it&#x27;s a revitalizing way to whiten up maybe at night only or just a few times a week.</li>
            <li> I understand that I may part of the population that the active ingredient may cause stains, but since I was using another two step toothpaste that was similar</li>
            <li> My mouth was getting the same total amount of brushing, but it was two rounds of hasty brushing instead of one round of thorough brushing.  </li>
            <li> but I will likely purchase another round in the future.</li>
            <li> I actually noticed a difference within a few days and my teeth are only getting whiter.  </li>
            <li> I do not think my teeth look much whiter, but they definitely don&#x27;t look worse either.</li>
            <li> My husband also has yellow teeth, worse than mine, so he was ready to try it</li>
            <li> They were much smoother, like no residue at all was left behind.</li>
            <li> The tubes are clearly marked &amp;#34;step 1, step 2&amp;#34; so even early in the morning you won&#x27;t get confused.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it will be in the long run, but so far it&#x27;s good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t believe how wonderfully white mine and my husbands teeth were getting just after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any issues with the Crest brand and will still continue to use their toothpaste, but these whitening products simply concern me enough, based on how they feel, that I&#x27;m not comfortable using them.  </li>
            <li> Crest is a solid brand and stands behind their products which should tell you that it does really work.</li>
            <li> - my mouth does feel brighter and tangy after use - but the sunglass needing white smile has eluded me - sorry</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get this product as part of a promotion from Bzz Agent and couldn&#x27;t help but be curious and also skeptical, because it contained two products to brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li> This, by far, is one of the most annoying to use.</li>
            <li> Other whiten tooth paste took forever to show a small improvement, whitening strips left my teeth sensitive after 1-2 treatments and always messed up the timing.</li>
            <li> I will admit that I was skeptical about this when I first tried it because I generally do not see a lot of results from whitening toothpastes or the white strips</li>
            <li> It might seem a bit tough at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m somewhat obsessed on my quest for whiter teeth, but find that my teeth are generally too sensitive for the strips, so I tend to experiment with different toothpastes to achieve similar results.</li>
            <li> first i thought the two steps would be annoying but it really does not take any extra time and actually encourages me to brush my teeth for the time dentists tell you too!</li>
            <li> The two-step process sounded a little gimmicky, but truth be told I like gimmicky tooth care products as long as the price is right.  </li>
            <li> The Crest Two-Step system breaks it down into two one-minute sessions so only &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; time you invest is the time it takes to apply the extra gel form the second tube onto the toothpaste, which is just a few seconds.</li>
            <li> This just doesn&#x27;t compare to the single tube toothpaste I&#x27;ve always used.</li>
            <li> This just doesn&#x27;t compare to the single tube toothpaste I&#x27;ve always used.</li>
            <li> It does take a bit longer for me to brush my teeth to go through the two steps than if I was using a single step toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This just doesn&#x27;t compare to the single tube toothpaste I&#x27;ve always used.  </li>
            <li> On a regular basis, I use a plain Crest toothpaste in the morning and 3D White toothpaste at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All in all, this toothpaste is nothing special, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> One would think this level of whitening could be incorporated in a single step process.</li>
            <li> I also noticed after my dentist visit that the whiteness and polish on my teeth has lasted much longer than it typically has in the past.  </li>
            <li> It gave me a strange aftertaste, turned the edges of my gums white after repeated use and made my mouth peel slightly.  </li>
            <li> After step 2, there is a slight peroxide taste, but it doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> Step 2 has a slightly minty taste to it, however the mintiness did not last long.  </li>
            <li> It might be more expensive than other toothpaste, but it&#x27;s less than whitening treatments, and without all the sensitivity.</li>
            <li> This part is easy, but after counting down 60 seconds for Part One, it does feel a bit tedious.</li>
            <li> My mouth doesn&#x27;t feel necessarily healthier (though, admittedly, that would be tough for me to gauge by feel) and my teeth don&#x27;t look particularly whiter.</li>
            <li> Due to my teeth sensitivity, I swap it out for Crest ProHealth sensitive shield every few days.</li>
            <li> I would be pleasantly surprised if it does whiten 6x as much as other toothpastes without the harsh chemicals of bleaching trays but have my doubts.  </li>
            <li> I have a sensitive mouth and while my teeth didn&#x27;t have the usual pain from whitening products my gums couldn&#x27;t handle the brushing.</li>
            <li> I usually use Sensodyne toothpaste for some sensitivity issues I have but so far, after 3 days, I don&#x27;t seem to notice any worsening.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth usually anyway</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth usually anyway</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s not worth the effort especially given that I am not seeing any noticeable whitening occurring</li>
            <li> feeling like I just got back from a cleaning at the dentist (minus the pain from being jabbed with a sharp tool in my gums).</li>
            <li> I have used whitening strips in the past, but my teeth were too sensitive to continue their use.  </li>
            <li> I do believe that since it is two steps I do brush my teeth longer than I do with the regular Crest, but for me the cost is not worth the benefit.</li>
            <li> I have fluorosis, so my teeth have been on the yellow side with dark patches since I was a kid.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well it would work with someone with deep, dark stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on average a 5 cups of coffee drinker along with a glass of red wine a day.</li>
            <li> I usually get sensitive teeth after using whitening products, but not with this.  </li>
            <li> I drink coffee and my teeth have turned a dark yellow</li>
            <li> It also made my teeth sensitive, which isn&#x27;t something that usually happens.</li>

            <li> They did not become glow in the dark white as I have seen on some of my co-workers after they get the whitening treatment from their dentist office.  </li>
            <li> I will say the only two things I noticed as a negative was that I saw some occasional white spotting on my gums.</li>
            <li> but it is difficult to assess as a full 6x whiter.  </li>
            <li> They leave a strange aftertaste in my mouth and are rough on my gums.</li>
            <li> At first, I was thoroughly annoyed with having to be bothered with having to do two separate steps.</li>
            <li> This two-step toothpaste definitely whitens your teeth effectively, but unfortunately, the whitening peroxide gel is too strong for my gums; when used two times a day a couple days in a row, it causes little annoying sores.</li>
            <li> It was a little hard to get used to the two step process, and I sometimes forget and rinse after the first step.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had really stained teeth, and I wouldn&#x27;t call the results dramatic, but I definitely think my teeth look cleaner and whiter</li>
            <li> Unless you remembered to have the tube of whitener opened before you began step 1 you would have to set down your toothbrush without rinsing it while opening the second bottle.  </li>
            <li> The only down fall to this</li>
            <li> The only down fall to this</li>
            <li> I will step down to once daily after I finish the tubes I have.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that I thought my teeth would be whiter then</li>
            <li> Used it down to the last drop... as you can see from the picture attached!  </li>
            <li> It requires you to put your toothbrush down, screw off the cap, pick up the toothbrush, add the gel, put the toothbrush down, screw the cap back on, pick the brush back up and finish brushing.</li>
            <li> but once you get the hang of it you&#x27;ll wonder why you ever brushed your teeth the other way!</li>
            <li> The first picture I featured is my teeth at the end of the day before brushing at all (nasty and yellowed from my caffeine habit), while the second is my teeth after using Crest Pro Health HD for a full week, twice daily.  </li>
            <li> The first picture I featured is my teeth at the end of the day before brushing at all (nasty and yellowed from my caffeine habit), while the second is my teeth after using Crest Pro Health HD for a full week, twice daily.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product with no high expectations.</li>
            <li> I realize, hard to tell the first few days.</li>
            <li> The taste was not as minty fresh as my normal toothpaste, but wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> But I think the results out weigh the dry mouth!</li>
            <li> On the first use, I was shocked at how much plaque was removed with step 1.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s when the second part comes into play that it gets a bit odd.</li>
            <li> The whitening gel caused some stinging and slight gum pain for me each time I used it, but it didn&#x27;t last beyond brushing.  </li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I started using the 2 step/2 minute regime and within less than a week, I was already seeing improvements in my overall health of mouth.</li>
            <li> so there may simply just be less staining to &amp;#34;erase&amp;#34; if you will.</li>
            <li> Now after having used it for about a month, my teeth are only slightly whiter than they were before I started using it.</li>
            <li> I had slightly added sensitivity but it was not enough to discontinue using it..</li>
            <li> After taking a break from using the product daily, I now use it once a day for half of the recommended time.  </li>
            <li> $16 retail for the 2 step system isn&#x27;t a big investment for teeth whitening, though it is pretty expensive for toothpaste.  </li>

            <li> Not only has it whitened my teeth, it has cut my brushing routine in half and eliminated morning breath.</li>
            <li> As mentioned above, I noticed a slight difference in my teeth coloring at the two week mark.</li>
            <li> I actually noticed a slight difference in the look of my teeth after just two days.</li>
            <li> recent dentist visit showed less plaque build</li>
            <li> Previously I have used all types of toothpastes and chemicals to get my teeth as white as I can.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I only have to subject myself to the yucky taste for 1 minute instead of 10 or 15 with a strip.</li>
            <li> It had a different taste than what I typically am used to in my mouth.</li>
            <li> It was a slight inconvenience having to brush the same teeth twice each time, but I figured it would still be easier than using white strips or and definitely less bother than using trays.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> My teeth are not super yellow</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had less morning breath and overall</li>
            <li> They are visibly whiter and have less plaque buildup than my last visit to the dentist.</li>
            <li> Definitely wake up feeling less like &amp;#34;morning breath&amp;#34; is an issue.</li>
            <li> Even though I keep to regular dental cleanings, in between my teeth can start to look less sparkly.</li>
            <li> but I only see a slight whitener to them at this point.</li>
            <li> After using this product twice daily for about two weeks, I have noticed a slight improvement in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I did notice a slight difference in the whiteness of my teeth but not enough to make me suck up</li>
            <li> The step 2 tube is smaller than step 1, which makes me believe that I need to use less of it.  </li>
            <li> However, in summary I found that the Crest Pro-Health HD system only slightly whitened my teeth</li>
            <li> While my mouth did feel healthier, I only saw a slight change in the whitening of my teeth.</li>
            <li> but I could achieve the same effects with much less expense.</li>
            <li> The most difficult thing to remember after using the product for the past month is to not rinse between steps one and two.  </li>
            <li> There are only 2 steps so it only takes a minute longer than the usual way of brushing.</li>
            <li> Did not make my teeth sensitive to cold or hot foods</li>
            <li> I have to say that it&#x27;s difficult for me to see a difference in the whiteness of my teeth because they&#x27;re pretty white to begin with.</li>
            <li> After using this for a week, the coffee stains that I noticed prior were much less noticeable</li>
            <li> And after two weeks of this, we discovered that our teeth were no better than if we just brushed with regular Crest Whitening.  </li>
            <li> If you want this effect for less of a hassle, I recommend brushing with your regular toothpaste for two minutes.  </li>
            <li> Crest HD is a product that actually delivers, cleaner, whiter and smoother teeth in less than 1 week.  </li>
            <li> It really is simple, and no more time-consuming than regular tooth brushing.</li>
            <li> There is less foaming of the pastes than regular toothpastes, which I think I prefer.  </li>
            <li> This says a lot because before this product I had been a stickler for paying less than $2.00 a tube since I felt they were all the same.</li>
            <li> It felt weird to not rinse after the first step which is what attributed to the gritty feeling on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I used it 2x/day for a week and only noticed a slight difference in my teeth.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: my teeth are not super white to begin with.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a month and at my next visit, the hygienist said that she saw noticeable improvement from my previous visit.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I have never heard of brushing my teeth twice with 2 different tubes of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> but it was still not very easy to open the kit.</li>
            <li> and my teeth definitely look brighter and less stained and the enamel looks glossy.  </li>
            <li> Definitely can tell the difference vs. when I use my previous toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I was super skeptical when Crest generously sent me a sample of the Pro Health HD to try.</li>
            <li> whitening gel is fairly thick and doesn&#x27;t drip down much.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve brushed my teeth too hard in the past in order to get rid of plaque build up, but realized that I didn&#x27;t have to put in that much work with Crest Prohealth HD.  </li>
            <li> My biggest problem with Crest Pro-Health HD was that both Step 1 and 2 made my mouth feel very dry while I was brushing</li>
            <li> I like that it could also replace other whitening products so it will end up being cheaper in the long run.</li>
            <li> I have tried several whitening toothpastes prior to this one and never noticed any difference.&lt;br /&gt;Crest Pro Health comes in two tubes and requires brushing twice which seemed slightly inconvenient at first</li>
            <li> It does taste a little different than typical toothpaste but is the same as whitening strips.  </li>
            <li> the money spent, especially if you are looking for a less exspensive way to whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li> Plus I found it super inconvenient to have two different toothpastes.</li>
            <li> Not a big deal, but something to think about if you&#x27;re tight on packing space or trying to reduce clutter.</li>
            <li> Although I was skeptical at first, after only a few weeks, my pearly whites actually sparkle!</li>
            <li> I could not believe the dramatic results achieved after just the first use.</li>
            <li> I saw a dramatic difference in the first week.</li>
            <li> having never really experienced extreme sensitivity before, its an experience I do not care to consistently have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that it made my mouth and gums a little sensitive, but when I backed off a little, that went away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that it made my mouth and gums a little sensitive, but when I backed off a little, that went away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The whole two step brushing process can get a little annoying when you&#x27;re super tired and just want to get to bed, but it&#x27;s worth the effort.</li>
            <li> Since the gel tube is nearly half the size of the purifying cleanser tube, I took that to mean I shouldn&#x27;t use as much of the gel, but I still think I will run out of gel before I run out of cleanser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a little over a week and family members have noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> For me, the results took a little bit of time to achieve, but I would compare them to the same results I receive when I use whitening strips.  </li>
            <li> The two tube system can be a little cumbersome for traveling but otherwise definitely recommend anyone give it a try!</li>
            <li> short, it works, you can feel it working, and with a little time you will see it working.eeth</li>
            <li> short, it works, you can feel it working, and with a little time you will see it working.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to with the multiple steps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a whitening solution - decades of diet soda consumption have made my once white teeth a little dingy.  </li>
            <li> The process is a little different, considering it&#x27;s a two step process, but I like the results.</li>
            <li> I do get a little plaque build up on the back of my three bottom teeth.  </li>
            <li> After my fourth or fifth brush, my gums were a little sore.  </li>
            <li> I was caught a little off guard though that the warnings on this tube explain that some of the ingredients could cause white spots that your dentist could remove.</li>
            <li> so I have only notice a little bit of teeth whitening improvement</li>
            <li> so my teeth definitely needed a little sprucing up.</li>
            <li> I have noticed whiter teeth, and it only took a little over a week to notice.</li>
            <li> You also only need a little bit, so</li>
            <li> Maybe brushing takes a little longer, but I can spare an extra minute for the whiteness I get from this.</li>
            <li> It also feels a little gritty when you brush.</li>
            <li> The taste is a little different</li>
            <li> Yes, I know we&#x27;re not actually &#x27;consuming it&#x27;, but you do end up ingesting a little.  </li>
            <li> This accomplishes both with little extra effort.</li>
            <li> I held off on writing this review because I wanted to give the product time to actually work, not just hype a review based on so little time.</li>
            <li> The step 1 toothpaste is a little on the gritty side, if that&#x27;s something that bothers you.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Even with regular dental cleaning I notice a little plaque buildup but this product removed it.</li>
            <li> After brushing it leaves a little bit of what I call an after taste that is different.</li>
            <li> It improved the overall cleanliness and whiteness of my teeth in just a little over a week.</li>
            <li> A little expensive for toothpaste, and a little more time consuming.  </li>
            <li> I simply considered this a little perk in addition to the cleaner feeling</li>
            <li> As for the whitening I have been using whitening products for a while, so it is hard for me to see a clear difference,</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long, long way.</li>
            <li> The polish (second bottle) tastes a little bleachy, but that is to be expected with whitening products.  </li>
            <li> -- I was a little skeptical when I signed up to try the 2 part Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste for free courtesy of Crest.</li>
            <li> So naturally, Crest&#x27;s claim that Crest Pro Health® HD™ leads to healthier/whiter teeth was hard for me to believe.</li>
            <li> What can I say old habits die hard.</li>
            <li> It was a little gritty when rinsing but for a real whitening system I was expecting a lot worse.</li>
            <li> The two part system does take slightly longer, but even using it once a day and a regular toothpaste the other has given me whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> and when you are already a minute into brushing your teeth it is hard to usncrew it and cap it back up while starting to brush for minute 2.</li>
            <li> Step 2 is a screw cap that if you forget to open before you brush, is hard to open one handed.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that it is sometimes hard to remember to do the second step.  </li>
            <li> It takes the same amount of time as just regular toothpaste (2 mins), but I have to admit I&#x27;m finding my desire to rinse in between steps hard to break.</li>
            <li> Step 2 is a screw cap that if you forget to open before you brush, is hard to open one handed...</li>
            <li> I went back after using Crest ProHealth HD for about a month and my gum inflammation had gone down and gingivitis was reversing!</li>
            <li> The texture of the second toothpaste (the &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; one) is a little more goopy than standard toothpaste and sometimes likes to fall off my toothbrush which is mildly annoying.  </li>
            <li> The strips cause some serious sensitivity pain and this new 2 step program does not.  </li>
            <li> Two small draw-backs: 1) storing Step 1 on it&#x27;s cap (like it&#x27;s apparently designed) causes a slight stringy mess when opening the cap, so I store it upside down &amp; issue solved, 2) my gums are, as a norm, sensitive &amp;</li>
            <li> : I didn&#x27;t notice a huge improvement in whiteness, and the solutions left somewhat of a bad taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I always found that they tasted bad, made me gag or left a coating on my teeth that left them feeling less than clean.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m horrible at taking of myself and they didn&#x27;t turn out great.</li>
            <li> I understand this is the whitening part, and perhaps I&#x27;m just sensitive to this taste, but it&#x27;s a clear gel peroxide that just feels both uncomfortable in the mouth and has a straight-forward peroxide taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only complaint is that there is some sensitivity, but that would be the same for any whitening product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I drink coffee daily, and red wine at least once a week.</li>
            <li> I was interested in this kit, because after a long cold winter of tea drinking my teeth were not looking so white.</li>
            <li> This one has won me over with the results, however, and it definitely works at least in the short term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t whiten as much as targeted (and expensive) whitening products over the same time frame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I went straight back to my Crest Pro-Health HD 2 step toothpaste</li>
            <li> The second step really doesn&#x27;t take any extra time, but feels inconvenient because you have to</li>
            <li> The only negative compared to Crest&#x27;s regular toothpaste is the taste.</li>
            <li> Definitely made my teeth at least a shade whiter in as soon as a week of regular use.</li>
            <li> In the past, I never really paid attention to how long I brushed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had professional teeth whitening before and my biggest complaint is the sensitivity after the whitening.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that step 1 left my mouth feeling &amp;#34;chalky&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Only used a few days and have already noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> only used a few times.</li>
            <li> found that this product provided minimal results .</li>
            <li> We have come to the conclusion that the problem is that our teeth are not really stained so the peroxide did not make</li>
            <li> he had used whitening products before that left the color uneven</li>
            <li> A white bump showed up a few days in while I was brushing, but it disappeared in about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I had yellow teeth and within a few days I saw a difference.</li>
            <li> I also had some sensitivity but not much.</li>
            <li> But after a few days I got used to the feeling and even find it necessary to get that &amp;#34;dentist-clean&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have, literally, tried everything under the sun for teeth whitening with minimal results.</li>
            <li> My teeth are whiter than before but not much.  </li>
            <li> As it turns out, it did not really complicate my morning/evening routine and did not take any additional time.  </li>
            <li> but no matter what product I tried I never really saw any difference in my teeth.</li>
            <li> I recently got married and used another brand of white strips prior and was disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> but it is really not you just use step one which is a purifying cleanser that uses Stannous Fluoride to remove plaque ,</li>
            <li> The Step 1 part leaves my teeth feeling rough once I am finished brushing with it</li>
            <li> My mouth has never felt cleaner and my teeth are definitely whiter by a few shades and I have only used it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> so I simply brush one round with the cleaner and a second round with the whitener.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially I was concerned that adding a step to my brushing routine would be frustrating during my busy mornings, but the process only takes a few extra seconds.</li>
            <li> I am a heavy coffee drinker and had yellow staining.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected from Crest.</li>
            <li> Then after a few days a definite improvement in the whiteness.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when the product promised a whiter smile within a week.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few days of morning and night bruising</li>
            <li> get to all of those places that are harder to reach.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Instructions/suggestions to this matter would help really round out the product, and would prompt me to update to 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, if you are at all considering a whitening product for your teeth, this would be the one I suggest.  </li>

            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks and have mixed feelings.  </li>
            <li> I do think my teeth have whiten a shade or two, but not nearly as much as I was hoping.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after about two weeks of use I started to notice my teeth were extra sensitive and were starting to be sore by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Just curious.  </li>
            <li> get over the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> two step process becomes such an afterthought after using it a few time.</li>
            <li> DID see a difference in the color of my teeth after only a few brushing.</li>
            <li> I have a Dentist cleaning scheduled in a month, so I&#x27;m really curious to see how that goes.</li>
            <li> However, after using it a few times,  things get back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Please know that apparently there is just a small percentage of people who experience this.</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, you can notice how white your teeth are getting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste for a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> After using for a few days my teeth are definitely noticeably whiter!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only been using it a few weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They looked whiter within a few days of starting using it.  </li>
            <li> , the whitening isn&#x27;t doing what I expected it to.</li>
            <li> I figured this would be another failed attempt at getting brighter teeth and fresh out of the dentist chair feeling.</li>
            <li> It was not as messy and did not require whitening trays or extensive amounts of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1 is the fluoride toothpaste that helps guard against cavities and gingivitis.</li>
            <li> A lot of toothpaste that I have used promised whiter teeth but never really delivered.  </li>
            <li> I tried to keep it up, but it was rough to eat with them being so inflamed</li>
            <li> There was not much taste to that gel</li>
            <li> My wife, who apparently has no taste buds has continued to use it for the past 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks with it, the jury is still out on whether I prefer it to my regular Crest Pro Health paste.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing this product as my everyday toothpaste from now on.</li>
            <li> the price is a bit steep for an everyday toothpaste, so I wouldn&#x27;t probably use it on a regular basis, just &amp;#34;as needed&amp;#34; to give me a boost of whitening.  </li>
            <li> I am a constant coffee drinker and never thought anything short of professional (and expensive) techniques would whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> i was not really prepared for.  </li>
            <li> But given the size of the 2 tubes, not very convenient to travel with.  </li>
            <li> My teeth were noticeable whiter after a week and now I only use the toothpaste a few times a week to maintain their whiteness.</li>
            <li> Step 1 is similar to your everyday toothpaste.</li>
            <li> For years I have been trouble with yellow color teeth and coffee stains.  </li>
            <li> I did knock off a star because it is a bit expensive for a toothpaste, but it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like toothpaste, and mentally, I have a barrier to it</li>
            <li> but it also does so with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> My only upfront issue that I will warn is that this is not for the medium to heavy coffee drinkers.  </li>
            <li> my teeth cleanings were minimal.  </li>
            <li> I had the usual foaming action that I see with my usual whitening gel, but to a slightly lesser degree.</li>
            <li> The instructions are simple just a few steps so anyone can use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days</li>
            <li> I mentally struggled thinking of the 2 minutes I needed to dedicate to the brushing process but soldiered on.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a lot of improvement over the last few weeks, and so have my family members.</li>
            <li> I found that the second tube of paste had a really harsh taste and burned my lips a bit</li>
            <li> I had a box of strips that had been sitting, unused, next to my sink for a few months, so I decided to give the Crest Pro-Health HD Toothpaste a try.</li>
            <li> and then you spit it out, but you do not rinse (It took a few rounds of this before it because second nature not to rinse with water).</li>
            <li> Try this product if your regular toothpaste isn&#x27;t whitening your teeth as you wish or if you don&#x27;t want to buy a separate whitening and harsh product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really noticed anything in regards to whitening toothpaste and thought maybe this 2 step process would be different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After a few uses I felt that my mouth was cleaner overall.</li>
            <li> After a few days using the product day and night, I began to notice white spots on my gums.  </li>
            <li> could see a difference after only a few days.</li>
            <li> Besides, my teeth are not much whiter than they were when I started the process.</li>
            <li> teeth brushing routine, when i never really have timed myself before.</li>
            <li> The Step 1 paste feels incredibly rough, and I was wondering if it could even wear away tooth enamel.</li>
            <li> only wish they had simplified it into one tube and reduced the waste of containers.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and have had trouble getting white teeth, give this a try.</li>
            <li> preformed as expected.</li>
            <li> so I expected to see some results.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after only a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it twice daily for a few weeks and have yet to notice whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not ready to test that out just yet.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not much of an annoyance.</li>
            <li> The step 2 whitening gel was fairly bitter.  </li>
            <li> My toothbrush was already wet</li>
            <li> So I have been using it everyday for several weeks.  </li>
            <li> Within a few days, I definitely noticed whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a topic of  discussion with my friends and family for the last few months.</li>
            <li> I used it several days in a row and have backed off to a few times a week.</li>
            <li> it was expected.  </li>
            <li> Only a few days after using Crest Pro-Health HD mouth felt the cleanest it has in years, like the way it feels after going to get a cleaning.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste is also runnier than regular toothpaste so be prepared to change a few shirts if you&#x27;re not paying attention.</li>
            <li> Definitely saw whiter teeth, but it took a few weeks.</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful when it comes to whitening my teeth.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that they were whiter, especially after a few uses.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is a bluish green in color and looks like a regular gel type toothpaste.</li>
            <li> However, it seemed like that my teeth only got a few shades whiter.  </li>
            <li> and my teeth actually felt cleaner and smoother and brighter after a few uses.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this product 4 stars is because I notice my teeth feel filmy after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> (my husband has been using this too and loves it and doesn&#x27;t notice a bitter taste)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know about &amp;#34;6 shades whiter&amp;#34; (since that&#x27;s a bit arbitrary) -</li>
            <li> It definitely took a few days to get in the habit of using the two step process but after a week I wasn&#x27;t even thinking about it.  </li>
            <li> Although, if you factor in the cost of whitening strips, it&#x27;s really not that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not really holding it against the toothpaste either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first when I saw two tubes of toothpaste instead of one, and was slightly uncomfortable the first couple of days since I was changing a brushing habit I&#x27;ve had for my entire life.  </li>
            <li> The taste doesn&#x27;t bother me, its a tad different from your everyday toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I know this doesn&#x27;t seem like a long time, but normally at night I&#x27;m exhausted after chasing my toddlers around all day.  </li>
            <li> Looks like I&#x27;ll have to drag myself upstairs just a few minutes earlier.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth you may want to take it slow using this product.  </li>
            <li> 1 (a thick blue traditional looking sparkling toothpaste for cleansing) and Step 2 (a clear/whitish gel for whitening)</li>
            <li> After 6 weeks, I&#x27;m almost through both tubes (annoyingly, I have a lot more left of step 2 than step</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter has always been obsessed with her teeth and kept complaining wanting to have her teeth professionally</li>
            <li> I also thought that the 2 step process might be annoying since I have brushed for 2 minutes straight through my whole life.  </li>
            <li> Because I have sensitive teeth, I was concerned that the peroxide formula could increase sensitivity, but I have not experienced any extra sensitivity from it, which makes it all the better!&lt;br /&gt;Full</li>
            <li> Although it is a two step process which is just kind of annoying</li>
            <li> So all in all, I hated the toothpaste and loved the gel.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about the whitening aspect of the toothpaste as I normally have very sensitive teeth; however, it has not affected the way they feel at all?  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t an unpleasant flavor - more of just an odd _lack_ of flavor.</li>
            <li> The only other complaint that I have is that it&#x27;s unclear if this is a product that you use forever, or if you only use it when you need it.</li>
            <li> and I will never go back to plain toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Certainly not anything close to &amp;#34;six shades&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Plain simple -</li>
            <li> The other negative was my teeth were sensitive about 2 weeks after using the product.</li>
            <li> Then came the second step and the gel was very odd feeling in my mouth.</li>
            <li> After 5 days in a row, I could only very slightly tell that my teeth were whiter.</li>
            <li> process which takes about twice as long as my previous brushing means is not at all a burden once you undergo the effort and the results speak for themself.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times due to the taste.  </li>
            <li> Previously I&#x27;ve used a baking soda/peroxide formula to brush, and it leaves a strange tingling feeling on my tongue.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; in the 2nd step causes my mouth to have a burning sensation in the last 30 seconds of brushing with causes me to rinse early and therefore probably cutting down on the overall effectiveness of the product;</li>
            <li> After the first step, my teeth felt a little weird, but once I did the second step, it was a world of a difference.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in the lack of whitening and it just seemed like after hitting a certain shade right off the bat, the product stalled out even though I used it night after night.  </li>
            <li> It does get a little tedious to have to do two steps, but I figure in the long run it will be well worth it.</li>
            <li> Step two has a less noticeable immediate effect but, over time, has actually seemed to slightly lighten my teeth.</li>
            <li> It works quickly and is less expensive than having a dentist do it.  </li>
            <li> This may be main reason why I purchase such an expensive kit again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to remember to stop mid brush, not spit and use a second tube that you have to put down your toothbrush to unscrew a cap.</li>
            <li> When I first got this product I was a little annoyed with the two step process.</li>
            <li> At first, I was a little annoyed by the use of 2 toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I have used one tube of toothpaste for so long, that it is hard to make myself reach for a second tube before I rinse.</li>
            <li> However, the extra step a little annoying in the morning when I was trying to get going and the peroxide flavor was fine while brushing, you definitely need to wait a bit before eating/drinking.</li>
            <li> But the only down fall is the 2 step system..a little time&lt;br /&gt;Consuming</li>
            <li> It did whiten slightly, but it is definitely comparable to other whitening toothpastes that have less hassle.</li>
            <li> Like crazy just-back-from-the-dentist clean.</li>
            <li> Be careful with this stuff - a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> initial thought when I was finished the first time was &amp;#34;wow, my teeth feel crazy</li>
            <li> Maybe if I was serious to whiten my teeth it would be a drop int he bucket compared to something else on the professional level.</li>
            <li> I typically use Sensodyne Whitening Toothpaste for my sensitive teeth, but I have not experienced any extra sensitivity since using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> and I definitely noticed my teeth looking a little whiter!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using Crest Pro Health HD for a little over a week and my teeth already look noticeably whiter!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product from Crest and was very skeptical; I&#x27;ve tried many whitening and deep cleaning tooth pastes and &amp;#34;systems&amp;#34; in the past and have had little to no improvement with any of them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little less convenient than one tube, but no big deal.  </li>
            <li> and it took a little bit of getting used to brushing my teeth with what seemed to be a regular toothpaste and then a whitening, less foamy toothpaste thereafter.</li>
            <li> It is a little odd to have to use two different tubes of product</li>
            <li> For &amp;#34;toothpaste&amp;#34; it is a little pricey, but as long as I don&#x27;t have continued sensitivity</li>
            <li> I have been a long time fan of Crest Toothpaste every since I was little.  </li>
            <li> I should first note that I hate the taste of other whitening agents because they taste very chemically.</li>
            <li> I am really sensitive to the aspartame taste and this definitely has it, but it is subtle and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> It is a little more on the expensive side than your usual toothpaste but it is less than the strips</li>
            <li> I am definitely one of those people who is skeptical of new products.  </li>
            <li> so I was easily able to switch between the two; however, I will say it was a little bit annoying to have to do two steps and switch back and forth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are only two negatives, one being that the toothpaste for step 1 is a little thick and feels like there is sand in it, but that you can get over since you only use it for one minute at a time.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I was a bit skeptical about this BzzCampaign but excited to try this new product.</li>
            <li> That being said, I do feel that my teeth have gotten slightly whiter in eight days since I began using this system, if only by a few shades or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I always want to whiten my teeth, and then spend a mint on kits that I end up using only a few days because I an never find the motivation to keep strips on my mouth for a half hour.</li>
            <li> the extra step does not fit in with the calculated time per quadrant and you need to do on and a half brushing cycles.</li>
            <li> Also, having a second step to my daily routine really wasn&#x27;t as bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not seeing any extreme difference</li>
            <li> Step 1 tastes just like any blue gel Crest formula I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t feel like your brushing with anything other than water, but with a not so pleasing taste.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;d use any other toothpaste, as the day went on, I&#x27;d end up feeling a sort of film on my teeth from lunch and snaking during the day.</li>
            <li> I was intrigued that the Crest Pro Health® HD™ included two tubes; one to focus on cleaning, removing both plaque and gingivitis and the other is for whitening and polishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That means I&#x27;ve also used other brands.</li>
            <li> but I learned if I started that step on the other side of my mouth and worked my way over to that side and it no longer hurt.</li>
            <li> as a plus, it has helped reduce the gingival inflammation I&#x27;ve had since my last pregnancy, which means no more bleeding gums!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t read the other reviews, so as not to be influenced.  </li>
            <li> but I am not sure I would go back now.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had any other problems.</li>
            <li> I may have been too rough in my brushing!</li>
            <li> Even other Crest products.</li>
            <li> Even other Crest products.</li>
            <li> Step 2 still leaves a strange taste in my mouth but it does dissipate after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used trays and strips in the past and in my opinion this product gives similar results over time without all the gum irritation.  </li>
            <li> I usually do this process before bed when I have some extra time.  </li>
            <li> I as well as other have noticed the difference in my teeth.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical that this system would work.</li>
            <li> My teeth may not exactly sparkle</li>
            <li> No funny aftertaste.</li>
            <li> I was not sure I would like having to spend an extra step each morning to brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I have used white strips in the past</li>
            <li> other harsher whitening methods.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I recommend this one of other teeth whiteners.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste though has split both aspects of the ordinary toothpaste and each gives magnified results that regular toothpastes don&#x27;t give.</li>
            <li> Step 2 smells and taste like other whitening products.</li>
            <li> am starting to see whiter teeth just a few days in!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the different fluoride or the whitening formulation, but...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also a life long (read heavy) coffee drinker, so I have that to factor in.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first started using it.</li>
            <li> This irritaiton was probably from the whitening agents, as I&#x27;ve noticed this in the past (white strips, trays, etc).</li>
            <li> I doubt I will get any other Crest products after this.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using Crest Pro-Health HD for a week and the results are unbelievable.</li>
            <li> And the longer I tried it over the next few weeks, the whiter my teeth became!  </li>
            <li> I have not noticed any increased sensitivity or other negatives.</li>
            <li> also think the cost is a bit extreme.  </li>
            <li> also think the cost is a bit extreme.  </li>
            <li> and I have to admit that at first I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> Like EVERY other whitening product out there.  </li>
            <li> It makes my mouth feel fresher than any other toothpaste I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I tried using each step for 30 seconds every other day</li>
            <li> I got a free sample from Crest through bzzagent and was very skeptical.  </li>
            <li> With this Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste, even though is a 2 part steps, it still only the usual 2 minutes route.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste removes the plaque and grime that all other toothpastes are claiming to be removing as well as whitens.</li>
            <li> We use it with him every other day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried any other whitening techniques</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not gonna lie, it feels weird at first.</li>
            <li> One tube removes plaque and cleans your teeth, and the other tube polishes and whitens.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see myself using any other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> not sure how different it is from other gel toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2, the whitener:&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> long term, I think it may be too harsh for my teeth.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will be purchasing this in the future.</li>
            <li> We looked at each other in amazement after seeing it in the mirror.</li>
            <li> but I realize there are other solutions to counter that and</li>
            <li> , I was very skeptical when receiving this product as a free trial through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I have used strips in the past, but they only get the front of your front teeth.</li>
            <li> I have tried other whitening products before.</li>
            <li> and it takes no more time than regular brushing!!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel a need to use whitening strips or any other brightening product on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I felt like it helped with morning breath but had to stop using it due to my gums</li>
            <li> I have had this happen before with other tooth pasts so its not just crest.</li>
            <li> I use other crest products as well.  </li>
            <li> first I was a bit skeptical about the effectiveness of an over the counter whiting system.</li>
            <li> I brushed in small circles during this step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know some other toothpastes claim to do this</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when I first tried Crest Pro-Health HD</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first tried this.</li>
            <li> Once you start step 2 you can feel the difference from other products out there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t seem to effect the sensitivity factor like other fluoride products.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s twice the price of regular Crest ProHealth toothpaste i usually buy&lt;br</li>
            <li> , at first I thought that it would turn out to be just like all of the other &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; toothpastes found on the toothpaste aisle, I was proved wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, to sum it up, even though I have never been a Crest girl in the past I will purchase this product in the future.</li>
            <li> have had  no burning of the gums or any other side effects that I have had with other whitening products..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty skeptical about a lot of whitening products out there.</li>
            <li> My husband has a small white spot on his gums, which the box said could happen, and it was temporary.</li>
            <li> I skeptical at first</li>
            <li> but so do all the other whitening treatments I have used.  </li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t experience any of the sensitivity that I have with other whitening products.</li>
            <li> Works like other whiting tooth pastes.</li>
            <li> This product does it all and doesn&#x27;t gag you like other whiteners.</li>
            <li> This two step whitening toothpaste is vastly different than toothpastes i&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> (I have used other whitening toothpastes with baking soda and peroxide for years</li>
            <li> I am anxious to see what my teeth would  look like  next week.</li>
            <li> I am excited that I have found something that will whiten as well as this does without having to use expensive strips or mouth plates!</li>
            <li> As a parent of a small child who needs my constant attention, time is everything!</li>
            <li> I will be continuing to use the system until I have no more left.</li>
            <li> I usually cannot even go a day without skipping the mouthwash or my gums bleed the next time I brush.  </li>
            <li> My teeth stain easily due to lacking enamel from overdoing fluoride treatments at the dentist as a kid.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t see a reason to use any other toothpaste moving</li>
            <li> My first reaction was that this looks complicated.  </li>
            <li> my mouth closed, I flash those babies!</li>
            <li> I moved the other toothpaste I had in the bathroom</li>
            <li> Was skeptical at first since its a tooth paste.</li>
            <li> and my mouth feels cleaner than with any other product.  </li>
            <li> This is like the other Crest Pro Health toothpastes in that it is one that will cause mucosal sloughing in some individuals (meaning that the insides of your mouth may shed like a snake).</li>
            <li> I took away 1 star due to the price.</li>
            <li> It removes plague and other stuff.</li>
            <li> The expectation is that you will use the system morning and night, totaling four minutes a day of oral care (not including flossing and all the other stuff you might or might not do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My daughter teeth on the other hand are whiter.</li>
            <li> I have tried other whitening systems before but they have not work like this one does.  </li>
            <li> I also dont get any sensitivity issues with this system as I have when using other whitening products.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning toothpaste seems to be comparable to other Crest products.</li>
            <li> I get why regular toothpaste isn&#x27;t for small kids because they could eat the fluoride.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use any other products because this toothpaste covers everything.</li>
            <li> I received the opportunity to test this product from Bzzagent, and was completely skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any sensitivity which I have had from other whitening systems</li>
            <li> /&gt;Different from other whitening toothpastes, using this product over a month caused NO sensitivity issues with teeth or gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had the same reaction to teeth whitening strips in the past.</li>
            <li> other than that</li>
            <li> Initially I was skeptical about having to use two products just to brush my teeth, but it&#x27;s not complicated to use and doesn&#x27;t take any longer than usual to brush (about 2 minutes).</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> How the heck did these two very different containers get past the testers and into the market?  </li>
            <li> The packaging at 1st glance looked like it was going to be difficult to open, but then I spied an arrow in the upper left corner.</li>
            <li> I am a coffee drinker and a past smoker and my teeth definitely needed this!</li>
            <li> I would like to start off that the ONLY reason this is not 5 stars is because I am lazy and this product is two steps.  </li>
            <li> In other words, spread the buzz.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> time consuming - you have to use 2 products 1 after the other which takes lot of time in the morning rush hours.</li>
            <li> No sensitivity or burning like other systems.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> have tried several other methods in the past, including whitening strips, trays, etc.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t hurt, bleed, and weren&#x27;t extremely noticeable to anyone other than me.  </li>
            <li> Almost threw up and ended up re-brushing with other toothpaste to get rid of the taste.</li>
            <li> With other toothpastes I&#x27;ve used, it always seemed like I still had stuff on my teeth after brushing.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> To sum things up, I love the toothpaste, but I&#x27;m disappointed by the whitening/polishing gel.  </li>
            <li> would note two other things:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> There is a noticeable astringent effect from the toothpaste - I have noticed this with other Crest products as well.  </li>
            <li> The one other thing I would like to note is the taste of the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Other whitening toothpastes have not yielded any noticeable results and I am not willing to invest the time or cost of whitening strips.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest Whitestrips in the past and it has been a couple of months since I last used them.</li>
            <li> I guess I’m just trained by other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t drink coffee, smoke or use any other teeth staining products</li>
            <li> but I have also tried plenty of other products that haven&#x27;t worked.</li>
            <li> It felt like I had extreme cotton mouth</li>
            <li> I have tried white strips and trays in the past.</li>
            <li> If you were to go from using any other tooth paste (beside Pro-Health)</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t have any problems with extra sensitivity, which has happened in the past with other whitening products.  </li>
            <li> The Step 1 has a grainier grit than other toothpastes which I think contributed to this.&lt;br /&gt;Whitening-</li>
            <li> (sometimes I was too lazy to do the second step and other times</li>
            <li> I found this product to be comparable to other complete/total care tooth pastes.</li>
            <li> Although, I&#x27;m not sure why I even bothered, because from my experience, I have never used whitening toothpaste that actually made my teeth</li>
            <li> I will be using my other whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> as with other toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I plan to continue using this product on a twice weekly basis, and will move onto other Crest whitening products when I come to the end of</li>
            <li> I plan to continue using this product on a twice weekly basis, and will move onto other Crest whitening products when I come to the end of</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say if I will end up finishing one tube before the other.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say if I will end up finishing one tube before the other.</li>
            <li> Its minty taste is on par with other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner and look extremely whiter.</li>
            <li> In other words, I know how to keep my teeth</li>
            <li> I have tried other whitening toothpastes.</li>
            <li> is a 2 step process that was easier compared to other products on the market.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used mine with an oral b pro brush, and while you might think that skews the results, I have never seen whiting results like this with any other paste and my electric brush.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I have been using these two step system for about five days now and have noticed extreme results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used white strips in the past and they hurt my teeth, even causing sore spots in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several whitening toothpastes in the the past.</li>
            <li> I used to use Sensodyne due to tooth sensitivity, but haven&#x27;t noticed any worsening of those symptoms since I started using the Crest Pro-Health HD system.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone looking for a way to whiten their teeth without the use of strips or other methods.</li>
            <li> My teeth were uncomfortable the first day I used this, but nothing that wasn&#x27;t manageable.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I was rather skeptical at first about this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> As stated Step 1 does leave your mouth feeling a little dry, but rinsing with water or mouth wash takes care of that problem.</li>
            <li> 1 leaves your mouth feeling a little dry and</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed dramatic continued whitening beyond that of the first few uses, but it cleans my teeth</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed dramatic continued whitening beyond that of the first few uses, but it cleans my teeth</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t want to set my wet brush down anywhere, so</li>
            <li> some other reviewers have noted, the active ingredient, Stannous Fluoride, can stain the teeth.</li>
            <li> The 2nd stage (whitening stage) is a little harsh on the gums.</li>
            <li> I would not consider using this everyday as it is a little bit costly, but would use it once or twice a week in conjunction with my regular dental routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little on the expensive side, but if it can improve the health of my smile, I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions very carefully.  </li>
            <li> which I assume is why they made step 1 as step 1 makes your teeth feel very rough.  </li>
            <li> My only concern for this product is that I feel the toothpaste is very harsh.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions very carefully.</li>
            <li> I started using once a day in the morning, I was very curious to see the results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very excited about trying this product, but am somewhat disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I have also noticed a distinct &#x27;saccharine&#x27; taste to the Step 1 gel - not too bad, just definitely sweeter than any other product i have used</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this whitening toothpaste combo, but I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about using this toothpaste duo due to the fact that I have used many products like it in the past.  </li>
            <li> We had to give the routine a break after 3 days for our gums to heal, but we&#x27;re back in the routine now, just use a little less of the polish, and are softer with the brushing!</li>
            <li> So, even if other teeth whitening products have let you down in the past, definitely give Crest HD a chance..</li>
            <li> You will definitely have a fresh mouth feel for a while, I feel bad when I want to go have juice or coffee in the morning because I don&#x27;t want it to go away.  </li>
            <li> My mouth even feels cleaner when I wake up in the morning because I&#x27;ve noticed I don&#x27;t really have near as bad of a taste or morning breath.</li>
            <li> The extra step isn&#x27;t too bad, and is worth it.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want to use Step 1 without also using Step 2, as the active ingredient in Step 1 is known to cause yellowing of the teeth.  </li>
            <li> While I love having white teeth, I hated the sensitivity caused by whiteners and worried it was eroding my enamel.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basics: two step system - step 1 has the active ingredient in it.</li>
            <li> am only giving it 4 stars because it is a bit frustrating to need to use 2 different tubes of tooth paste.</li>
            <li> Not impressed enough to buy this again- makes teeth sensitive and can&#x27;t be bothered</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;Products containing stannous fluoride (and that is the active ingredient in this toothpaste) may produce surface staining of the teeth.  </li>
            <li> This is a side-effect from the active ingredient on the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really not longer than my typical toothbrushing routine.</li>
            <li> For step 1 which is the purifying cleanser, the active ingredient is Stannous Fluoride.</li>
            <li> Step 1 is a purifying cleanser that contains Stannous fluoride 0.454% as the active ingredient.</li>
            <li> whitening: there may have been a slight difference, but it might have all been in my head - certainly not as much as I&#x27;d seen with some of the whitening strips in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I feel that although it wasn&#x27;t pleasant it wasn&#x27;t a terrible taste either.</li>
            <li> I think in the long run, this product has re-trained my to brush my teeth in a healthier way and will save the life of my toothbrushes, or at least help them to last a little longer.</li>
            <li> I think in the long run, this product has re-trained my to brush my teeth in a healthier way and will save the life of my toothbrushes, or at least help them to last a little longer.</li>
            <li> You have to brush with both types of toothpaste each time you brush, so this can be a little awkward, especially since the first tube foams up quite a bit, and the instructions also state that you shouldn&#x27;t rinse out your mouth in between each step.</li>
            <li> I did notice slightly whiter teeth, but certainly not six times whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Given all of these pros &amp; cons, I give it 4 stars because Crest Pro-Health HD works as well as other products in its class but has the extra benefit of not being hard to use.</li>
            <li> I have always been skeptical about quick fix whitening claims in the past.  </li>
            <li> If you put them down on their caps, you can read one tube and not the other.</li>
            <li> To make my life more difficult... NOT EASIER CREST!!</li>
            <li> This sounds ridiculous but a habit that you have done your whole life is hard to change.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I was skeptical, but soon found out that this toothpaste really does work to whiten</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I found this to perform much like other whiting toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> You are suppose to do conventional brushing for 2 minutes anyway.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using the product 2 times per day for a few days, my gums became a bit irritated so I started using the Pro-Health HD only once per day and my usual toothpaste the other.  </li>
            <li> it was a little rough on the gums</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from step 2 tasting a little bitter to me</li>
            <li> I thought the 2-step process was going to be annoying, but it was actually very easy and after just a few days</li>
            <li> It resulted in myself in whiter teeth, less plawue, fresher breath longer than other methods and toothpastes.</li>
            <li> It had an odd flavor - or maybe it was just a lack of mintiness that didn&#x27;t cover up the other flavors of the gel.</li>
            <li> I have one tooth I injured as a child and this has caused it to  be slightly darker than my other teeth.</li>
            <li> but it less time than other forms.</li>
            <li> I even notice that I am less &amp;#34;yucky&amp;#34;  and fresher in the morning versus when I use other toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> I saw this kit in the store the other day for less than $13.  </li>
            <li> Again, I didn&#x27;t notice a signicant whitening because of my previous shade, but I did notice that this products seems to keep my mouth feeling fresher longer than other pastes that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have since purchased another set as my other half has been using it too.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little troubled by the idea  </li>
            <li> I usually spend as little as possible when buying toothpaste, but the Crest Pro-Health HD Two-step toothpaste made me think twice about that habit.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I first heard about this 2 step brushing process.</li>
            <li> At first, I was a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> and therefore it was a bit hard to know if it was actually working, but it looks like it is kinda working.</li>
            <li> However, I did find the box a bit hard to open, even with the pull tab on one of the corners.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of this product at first.</li>
            <li> However, I did find the box a bit hard to open, even with the pull tab on one of the corners.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first about using a 2-step process to brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li> At first I was a little skeptical about the two step process but after trying it I didn&#x27;t have a problem with it.</li>
            <li> When I first received my product sample from Bzz agent I was a little skeptical of the two step process.</li>
            <li> Step 2 tastes a little weird, not bad, and makes my teeth feel slick and polished, as if I had just been to the dentist.  </li>
            <li> The only other negative is I have a sonicare toothbrush that goes for two and a half minutes</li>
            <li> My only other negative would be that the mouth feel of step one is... odd.</li>
            <li> I personally have a pretty bad gag reflex with some dental products</li>
            <li> I like that this is incorporated in your normal brushing routine, no messy strips or trays or a bad taste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And honestly it&#x27;s not even that much extra work.</li>
            <li> I knew there would be enough product for both of us to use for at least a week.  </li>
            <li> we all agreed the price difference was not worth it.</li>
            <li> Overall, I do feel as though system has whitened my teeth a few shades over the past month.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t drink coffee, wine, tea, or dark sodas</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the price</li>
            <li> really* long time, especially when you&#x27;re tired and want to go to bed.</li>
            <li> Only complaint -</li>
            <li> My teeth are much whiter and brighter, and I would compare the end result to the expensive whiting products purchased through dental offices.</li>
            <li> Not until next year at least.</li>
            <li> My only complaint</li>
            <li> This process is not worth it for me</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it is a two-step process, which messes a bit with my electronic toothbrush regimen.  </li>
            <li> I usually do not smile, and chew gum like it&#x27;s my job.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend to anyone to at least try it to see if it works for you.</li>
            <li> I took before and after pictures of my teeth, but unfortunately the whitening steps of this product didn&#x27;t do much to change the color of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Step 2 was your average whitener.</li>
            <li> I did like the fact that step one is required for one minute and then step 2 is required for one minute assuring I get at least a 2 minute brush in twice daily!</li>
            <li> even thought I&#x27;m still drinking 20-32 ounces of dark soda almost every day as well.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are average in color.  </li>
            <li> This step has the taste and consistency of your average toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I drink a lot of coffee and dark soda and noticed a difference in my teeth&#x27;s appearance in about a week.  </li>
            <li> kinda ruins it</li>
            <li> only negative</li>
            <li> The only thing is the price – I wish it was at least $10 cheaper.</li>
            <li> Contacting P&amp;G to file a complaint next week.</li>
            <li> I realize you can get that just from changing out with a brand-new toothbrush, but the different seem to be at the end of the day even after a few meals my teeth still felt likity slick-  </li>
            <li> They were expensive, took too much time to use, caused tooth sensitivity, etc.</li>
            <li> I have not had a negative experience prior to this</li>
            <li> Not sure about keeping up the two-step process for long, or traveling w TWO tubes of paste, but I do think my teeth are whiter.</li>
            <li> Over the past few days I have definitely noticed my teeth a couple shades whiter.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not see much difference in whitening.</li>
            <li> One night when I was out of town, I used regular toothpaste because I didn&#x27;t bring my Crest Pro-Health HD with me, and it was crazy how different the regular toothpaste felt.  </li>
            <li> For me, it was not worth the hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Longer into it now, even the dark patches are fading which I did not expect.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about a two-step toothpaste, really.  </li>
            <li> As for the second step, my teeth have been visibly whiter over the past few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I went in quite skeptical that a product could really improve the whiteness of my teeth by 6x.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are what I would call average.  </li>
            <li> , that claim to whiten teeth, and I&#x27;ve honestly never noticed a difference with regular usage.</li>
            <li> complaint I find when using this system is the two bottles/tubes have different style lids.  </li>
            <li> It usually takes me a few minutes to brush my teeth regularly so having to brush with each tube&#x27;s contents for a minute wasn&#x27;t an issue</li>
            <li> or you don&#x27;t usually spend that long brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have it</li>
            <li> I noticed that there was a possibility for white spotting on my gums but did not have any negative effects.</li>
            <li> For me, it was not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how the 2nd toothpaste made the foam/bubbles from the first go away.  </li>
            <li> I found myself getting lazy and not brushing as long as was suggested</li>
            <li> In the past, I have used white stripes but found them to be a hassle and sometimes messy.</li>
            <li> but if you have sensitive gums like I do this is not a great choice</li>
            <li> In just the two weeks of brushing, even starting slow and working my way up, I&#x27;ve seen noticeable improvements in the color of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have a sour taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I have weird pockets of discoloration on my teeth (mottling), so I am not brave enough to include a before/after of my smile.</li>
            <li> If you have extremely sensitive gums, this step might be irritating to you.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I&#x27;ve never liked the taste of Crest products and while I&#x27;ve gotten used to it some, it is still weird and too sweet.  </li>
            <li> This is a daily use system that slowly whitens.  </li>
            <li> My teeth tend to be on the sensitive side, and the whitening agent seemed to make this worse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;What has been most annoying however is that the mouthwash causes teeth yellowing -</li>
            <li> but now I appreciate using a system that I feel not only cleans my teeth but then protects (and maybe slowly whitens?)</li>
            <li> Having whiter teeth is not worth wearing down tooth enamel or brushing with a paste that tastes like bleach, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting dramatic results from a toothpaste whitening system, but boy was I surprised!</li>
            <li> The results were not overwhelming, my teeth still have a slight yellow tinge on a few teeth</li>
            <li> The jelly texture is just plain weird in my mouth, and the taste of it is pretty yucky.  </li>
            <li> while the toothpaste has a flip cap, the perfecting gel has a twist-off, which means that you have to put down your toothbrush between step one and two to take off the cap for the gel.</li>
            <li> It whitens down by the gums when the strips don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> This toothpaste system cuts the plaque down and has improved my breath.</li>
            <li> When you get down to it, it&#x27;s still just toothpaste.</li>
            <li> so to keep the staining down, that helped.</li>
            <li> knocked it down a star because I didn&#x27;t feel the product whitened as it claims.</li>
            <li> Now let&#x27;s get down to the nuts and bolts of it.  </li>
            <li> This has maintained the level of whiteness I achieved through this product AND cut down my sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Hands down</li>
            <li> It took another 2 weeks of use of my sensitivity toothpaste to get it down to a tolerable level again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The packaging doesn&#x27;t match the stand-up aspect for Step 2, since when you stand the toothpaste tube on the sink the writing is upside down.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel like they have been scrubbed down every time I brush.</li>
            <li> As I sit down to write this review, I am smiling from ear to ear.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, my dental world was flipped upside down when one afternoon a week or two into using Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste, I realized that I was continually running my tongue along my teeth.</li>
            <li> and I, hands down, will be buying this product every time.</li>
            <li> Crest has never let me down and this product is a keeper in our home.  </li>
            <li> down side for me, was it made my mouth so sore that I couldn&#x27;t use it beyond day 3.</li>
            <li> Digging deep to find something wrong, I could see that the step 1 stage could be a little harsh for folks with sensitive teeth &amp; gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothpaste(s) as it will make it impossible to go back to any other brand...</li>
            <li> The paste didn&#x27;t dry my lips out like some whitening products have done in the past.</li>
            <li> But on the other hand it&#x27;s no more expensive( and much cheaper) than other whitening products.</li>
            <li> Plus, you are left with a fresh mouth all day and no more bad morning breath.</li>
            <li> other thing I noticed from reading reviews is there&#x27;s quite a few people who said they didn&#x27;t like the taste of this.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint was that it is a little on the spendy side</li>
            <li> The Crest Pro Health HD system seems to include what other toothpaste have been missing to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> Not only am I being forced to brush a little longer than I would have (by forcing me to cover my tracks twice), but I can almost taste and feel the cleaning difference.  </li>
            <li> The kit arrived as a promotion from Crest and was a little late, but no big deal.</li>
            <li> few other comments:&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Negatives: The two-step process is a bit annoying and when you are using an electric toothbrush that automatically shuts off after two minutes, you have to carefully watch the clock to notice when it’s time to spit out the first step and move on to the second.</li>
            <li> The product tastes like it should, but feels a little odd in the mouth - kinda gritty and thick.</li>
            <li> If you are up for trying something new that is less expensive than some other options, it can&#x27;t hurt to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I was given this product to try out and was skeptical due to the 2 step process, which is a pain; mainly because of storage of this product - both tubes do not fit in my toothpaste holder.  </li>
            <li> It took me a few tries to get adjusted to the routine of spitting without rinsing before I went on to step 2 but within a week, I had it down pat!</li>
            <li> I was not sure if this was due to the toothpaste or not, so I decided to wait for my gum to heal and start again the product.&lt;br /&gt;The second try was not as bad as the first one</li>
            <li> I was not sure if this was due to the toothpaste or not, so I decided to wait for my gum to heal and start again the product.&lt;br /&gt;The second try was not as bad as the first one</li>
            <li> Crest has come out with an even easier way to whiten teeth, clean teeth and remove bad odors from your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I just had my dental cleaning tonight and the hygienist was shocked by how clean my teeth were - he said it was the easiest cleaning he&#x27;s ever done</li>
            <li> So far I have not seen any dramatic difference in my teeth color.  </li>
            <li> I did have a slight burning feeling with the whitening gel</li>
            <li> I do feel like my teeth are whiter, and have less build up.</li>
            <li> , less plaque build up on the interior of my teeth</li>
            <li> This was not an ingredient in my previous toothpaste (Colgate).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s convinced me to switch over from my previous brand.</li>
            <li> I have also not notice my teeth getting any whiter, although they seem less treated then</li>
            <li> my previous toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to go to the dentist to see if my teeth are cleaner than previous visits.  </li>
            <li> it was just odd.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner, smoother, and have much less plaque buildup than before I started using it.  </li>
            <li> : Odd after feel in my mouth.</li>
            <li> If we go to such pains to buy expensive facial products, why not do it with our teeth too?</li>
            <li> The two step process made me slightly hesitant as did the fact that you don&#x27;t rinse after step 1.  </li>
            <li> I think I see a slight improvement, but dont have a fancy camera and side to side images of my before and after.</li>
            <li> I guess it takes less time.</li>
            <li> I have noticeably whiter teeth after about a week and a half.  </li>
            <li> It was definitely slightly whiter from using this product.</li>
            <li> The “not spitting” and stopping to add the second step to my toothbrush are not so awkward anymore and have just become a part of my natural routine.</li>
            <li> and it is one less thing I have to worry about now.  </li>
            <li> one of the claims is less plaque (i have a dentist appt in 3 weeks, so i will update then on this aspect) and another is whiter teeth</li>
            <li> Step one felt like a typical toothpaste, but it did feel like it was cleaning.  </li>
            <li> The gum line on one of my teeth seems to have started to recede ever so slightly which is something I will need to speak to my dentist about.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t bother my gums or teeth but would on occasion tingle or have a slight burn.</li>
            <li> My teeth began to look less stained within days.</li>
            <li> I typically tend to drink one coffee or one soda a day.  </li>
            <li> It costs less than having to buy whitening toothpaste, whitening mouthwash, and whitening strips.  </li>
            <li> It takes 3 minutes, as opposed to a typical 15-20 minute for whitening gel</li>
            <li> Previously, I&#x27;d brush in four quadrants for 30 seconds each.</li>
            <li> That said, I do think my teeth are slightly whiter.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t thought about less morning breath until now, but I do</li>
            <li> I accidentally rinsed in the mornings where I am half asleep.</li>
            <li> but I think that they are slightly whiter.</li>
            <li> I did see some slight whitening effect after two weeks.</li>
            <li> After using the system for a week I saw slight results.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try it again, but I gave it another shot and luckily no pain.</li>
            <li> It has been a week, and his teeth are slightly whiter.</li>
            <li> I had less scraping and poking which was a plus for me.</li>
            <li> The whitening factor is noticeable over time but not a quick fix.</li>
            <li> I was previously using a prescription strength paste I received from the dentist</li>
            <li> , I felt as if my teeth were slightly whiter than when I started using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> , I felt as if my teeth were slightly whiter than when I started using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical as I have tried whitening products in the past.  </li>
            <li> Also, the design of the tubes are a bit odd.  </li>
            <li> Except for the slight tingle While brushing with Step 2, I did not notice a discomfort while using it or after.  </li>
            <li> It is slightly disconcerting to put the liquidy gel (step 2) across your tooth brush and in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> and I can see a slight difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> My mouth does feel healthier and has less visible build up.</li>
            <li> I just had to switch toothpaste halfway through my typical two minute brushing session.</li>
            <li> Each kit comes with two tubes of toothpaste - Step 1 is the typical toothpaste and Step 2 is a finishing polish.</li>
            <li> Step two does have a slight bleach taste</li>
            <li> I have tried Crest strips and teeth gel whitener, and everything before just seems to mellow out quickly or never worked.</li>
            <li> ; is less noticeable since I have been using this product.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s actually less than that</li>
            <li> /&gt;Minus 1 star for the typical Crest taste.</li>
            <li> A two step toothpaste that leaves your moth feeling slightly cleaner then a one step toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks and found a slight whitening of my teeth and less gum bleeding.  </li>
            <li> Both my husband and I have also noticed that our gums are healthier and less inflamed.</li>
            <li> Also, I notice that I wake up with less morning breath.</li>
            <li> so I was less inclined to want to use it.</li>
            <li> In less than 2 weeks I became convinced, a believer.</li>
            <li> However, she thought it makes her teeth feel cleaner and less &amp;#34;slimy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and half</li>
            <li> At first i was skeptical about the two steps because i&#x27;m usually rushing in the morning....</li>
            <li> The two step process is a bit cumbersome and odd</li>
            <li> I had previously tried the Whitestrips, which were not for me.  </li>
            <li> If you are a serious tooth-brusher, you won&#x27;t mind the extra minute.  </li>
            <li> I am not a fan of the typical fluoride toothpastes out there</li>
            <li> And let me tell you, Crest&#x27;s claims that this product whitens your teeth noticeably &amp; quickly is NO LIE.</li>
            <li> The truth is you don&#x27;t have to brush them twice each time, you just stop half way through and use paste 2 to finish your brushing.</li>
            <li> A 2 step process that takes less than 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> My teeth are slightly whiter.</li>
            <li> There is a slight difference to whitening</li>
            <li> typically experience sensitivity when using whitening products</li>
            <li> My previous experiences with whitening always led to gum soreness and yucky taste in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> It does leave an odd feeling in your mouth after which I am guessing is part of the whitener.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically brush the front of my teeth for 2 minutes, so I think I brought this on with an improper technique.  </li>
            <li> Time - I typically use a Sonicare which has a 2 minute automatic timer.  </li>
            <li> I noticed i have less plaque build up.</li>
            <li> I find the packaging a bit odd.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a slight whiter appearance in my teeth but as a once a year Crest Whitening System user, this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t come close to the strips.</li>
            <li> I have been using this two step product for about a month and a half now.</li>
            <li> About Me: I typically pick my toothpaste based on taste.</li>
            <li> The cleaner gave me a slight burning sensation when I put it on.</li>
            <li> - Teeth slightly whiter</li>
            <li> Definitely less cost than a dentist whiting for hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li> This step is the gel you would typically see in the whitening</li>
            <li> I did some a slight improvement in the brightness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I will be brushing my teeth and for that reason, this is a time saver and less of a hassle.  </li>
            <li> They had less tartar build-up and we&#x27;re whiter.</li>
            <li> Saw this mentioned on Tv and looked it  up, it it&#x27;s less than half this price at CVS.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed a slight improvement in the whiteness week over week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> typically, Crest toothpaste has been too &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li> I also deviate from the directions slightly and do 2mins for each cycle.</li>
            <li> only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; i&#x27;d say is that step 1 is very thick and its hard not to make a mess of the cap with the &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; toothpaste that sort of misses the brush due to the thicker consistency of the toothpaste, but its honestly not a big deal, a little practice</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will keep using the product as long as I continue to see results and encourage anyone who had tried other systems and given up to try&lt;br /&gt;Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste because if it can make my teeth whiter when everything else failed then</li>
            <li> It was really hard to remember not to rinse my mouth when I was done with it, but it didn&#x27;t take long for me to get in that routine.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about trying the HD Daily, as I&#x27;ve always been wary of any whitening formula used outside of a dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical that it would be any different than regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little annoying to add a second step to my brushing routine, however, I&#x27;ve been finding that it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> The Step1 product isn&#x27;t too bad, but the Step2 protective gel is strongly sweet from the flouride or something.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been as bothered with the sensitivity to the cold or hot drinks or foods.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the taste is not great, especially the gel taste.</li>
            <li> Its almost like they took normal toothpaste, separated the gel from it, and made something that used to be 1 step and complicated it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use this until it&#x27;s empty, but I&#x27;m not sure I will buy again.  </li>
            <li> Having been a Crest Whitening Strip user in the past, I do have to say that the Step 2 paste does taste a bit like the Whitening Strip gel...but definitely not as much as the strips.</li>
            <li> I would have expected this to cost around $25, like the strips I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I was at first unhappy with the price, BUT</li>
            <li> I think my teeth weren&#x27;t that yellow to begin with, so maybe a less dramatic change is to be expected.</li>
            <li> and it can be a mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I would have spent the money on the kit, but after trying it, it&#x27;s a no brainer...</li>
            <li> Others have complained about brushing taking twice as long..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious to find out if my mouth is, in fact, healthier from what it usually</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to mess around with sticking strips of bleeching tape on your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Some people because of thin enamel or other reasons just never have those sparkling Hollywood star white teeth.</li>
            <li> Not bright white but not stained.  </li>
            <li> not significantly whiter, but whiter than a typical whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It took a few days for me to get the routine down</li>
            <li> , are very sensitive and uncomfortably tingly for about a half hour after I finish the process.  </li>
            <li> At all...I think the strong flavor of step 1 helps mask the poor taste, but it leaves a bad flavor in your mouth for a long time.</li>
            <li> I like it but its hard to deal with the Dry mouth</li>
            <li> The taste is a little weird, and it doesn&#x27;t foam up as much as normal tooth pastes do, which is something to get used to.</li>
            <li> After trying the new HD Daily-Two Step Toothpaste, I can see how wrong</li>
            <li> As with any new product, I was wary of the promises it made: 6 x whiter teeth, 6 x healthier mouth.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked at how quick this worked.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t been to the dentist to get my teeth cleaned for a while and could feel a slight build up of plaque on a few teeth.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about how well this would work because whitening toothpastes I&#x27;ve used in the past didn&#x27;t work very well at all.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a lot easier and less messy than whitening systems with trays or strips.</li>
            <li> I will say I&#x27;m a bit skeptical about tooth whitening systems inside of toothpaste, because it doesn&#x27;t seem like the bleach will be on your teeth long enough.</li>
            <li> I am a white teeth fanatic and usually purchase gel from the dentist and use it in a custom made tray.  </li>
            <li> The taste is typical of dental products with peroxide but without the messy foaming of strips.  </li>
            <li> After just a few days I could feel the cleaner, fresher feeling in my mouth and after about a week and a half to two weeks</li>
            <li> a much longer amount of time than 2 measly minutes.  </li>
            <li> Also, I felt like this product worked as well as strips, but was WAY easier to use, and took much less time (and less mess!)</li>
            <li> and I was a little skeptical about changing to a longer two step process, but it seriously only took me two minutes, which was how long I used to brush my teeth for anyway.  </li>
            <li> but my  friends and family did too.&lt;br /&gt;Tastes a little weird compared to my normal toothpaste, but after a few days I didn&#x27;t mind it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Any slight whitening I did see was a little uneven.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive gums, so finding a whitening toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t bother my gums is QUITE difficult.</li>
            <li> There are no messy trays or inconvenient strips to mess with, it&#x27;s a simple as brushing your teeth for 2 minutes like usual.</li>
            <li> I have continued to use this product for a little over a week now and the whiteness hasn&#x27;t worn off, it just keeps getting</li>
            <li> do have to mention, that the hydrogen peroxide in Step 2 can make it a little abrasive.</li>
            <li> I believe that my teeth were a little whiter at the end of the week.</li>
            <li> I think maybe my teeth are a little whiter, but not noticeably.</li>
            <li> Listen, I said it was a little thing, but it is kinda annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little intimidated about the time it would take since it&#x27;s 2 separate steps</li>
            <li> While her teeth looked a little bit whiter than mine</li>
            <li> Other whitening toothpates that I have tried in the past didn&#x27;t give me a lot of hope that this one would work.  </li>
            <li> I think my teeth are somewhat whiter, ,but not significantly.</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive of having my teeth stripped and then having to apply another layer.  </li>
            <li> First, the routine itself isn&#x27;t difficult but it is, at least for me, messy.</li>
            <li> When I received Crest pro health HD as part of the Bzzagent campaign I was a little reluctant to try it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> You can almost feel little bubbles scrubbing decay away and then Step 2 (the gel) polishes your teeth and makes your mouth feel spotless.</li>
            <li> These had little flavors and little foam.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a little steep for toothpaste to me.</li>
            <li> I have tried other at home whitening products in the past.</li>
            <li> It is a little drying to my tongue and that takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> like chalky a little bit.</li>
            <li> I also found that after brushing with step 2, my mouth felt a little dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Crest Pro- Health HD for a little over a week.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s truly my only complaint!  </li>
            <li> Step 2&#x27;s taste took a little getting used to</li>
            <li> I was a little relieved when the two minutes was up</li>
            <li> The system seems a bit pricey, but a little dab of each does the job.</li>
            <li> and I see that my teeth is a little whiter</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the polishing step, and tastes a little fruitier.</li>
            <li> The container itself is sleek, albeit a little bulky.  </li>
            <li> (I always use a &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; toothpaste and it usually doesn&#x27;t whiten, just  maintains the whitening I get from other products.</li>
            <li> The product worked well to whiten my teeth a little after a 7 day period.  </li>
            <li> I use this product with my Sonicare, which keeps track of my brushing time for me, but I think it&#x27;s just a little bit of a hassle to have to use two products.  </li>
            <li> It took a little adjusting to the two-step process</li>
            <li> Although I do not love the flavor of the toothpaste, it is comparable to the flavor of other whiteners on the market.</li>
            <li> I have been using it once a day for about a little over 3 weeks</li>
            <li> were finding little plastic balls everywhere.  </li>
            <li> So I was a little hesitant to try Crest Pro Health HD.  </li>
            <li> Although my dentist did not mention anything specifically about the condition of my teeth, I felt as if my appointment seemed a little quicker than it sometimes can be.  </li>
            <li> Although my dentist did not mention anything specifically about the condition of my teeth, I felt as if my appointment seemed a little quicker than it sometimes can be.  </li>
            <li> Even though strips do help a little but its nothing compared to crest pro health HD.</li>
            <li> I find my teeth to be a little whiter after about a month, but not anything extravagant.</li>
            <li> II have been using this product for a little over two weeks now</li>
            <li> , I was a little apprehensive.</li>
            <li> I will say that I prefer to feel a little mintier after</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other whitening toothpastes in the past and</li>
            <li> I could see my teeth get a little whiter</li>
            <li> The two-step process takes a little getting used to, but all in all</li>
            <li> And after a week my teeth did look a little whiter.</li>
            <li> It just took a little getting used to.  </li>
            <li> the two step thingy is a little bothersome because I would sometimes rinse after step 1</li>
            <li> , the price tag&#x27;s a little bit of a deterrent though.</li>
            <li> My teeth look a little whighter also.</li>
            <li> so the process is a little longer than I am used to.  </li>
            <li> in fact, I thought it could have been a little stronger.</li>
            <li> Not sure if Crest Pro Health® HD will offer other flavors because that will give consumers a variety to choose from.</li>
            <li> in fact, I thought it could have been a little stronger.</li>
            <li> Not sure if Crest Pro Health® HD will offer other flavors because that will give consumers a variety to choose from.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my teeth were shinier and a little whiter.</li>
            <li> It whitened a little</li>
            <li> I could see how they might have been polished a little though; they do seem shinier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried other teeth whitening toothpastes in the past</li>
            <li> I also have a little but of sensitivity in my teeth but found this system didn&#x27;t hurt or cause me any discomfort at all while using.  </li>
            <li> but this product did not affect the sensitivity of my teeth like other whitening toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> I used the toothpaste twice a day for about 5 days and then my gums began to be a little sore.</li>
            <li> Another factor I found, which may or not not be connected to this toothpaste combo, would be that I develop a slight pain in my molars each time I use this product, which lasts for about half the day!</li>
            <li> I noticed that my teeth appeared a little whiter and brighter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Crest and Crest Pro Health toothpastes in the past, but not for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I found that fact a little bothersome and counterproductive.</li>
            <li> After using this, I&#x27;m content with the other Crest toothpastes I&#x27;ve used in the past and don&#x27;t see a reason to switch.</li>
            <li> : After 2 days, I think that my teeth do look a little bit whiter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if there is a scientific reason to using the two gels separately, other than committing to two minutes of brushing versus one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not like that it had the two steps, and the taste was a little blah.</li>
            <li> The two-step process is a little &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the taste and texture of the polish,which I can get over because of the results!</li>
            <li> I got this product with a little worry about teeth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this for a little over a week now.</li>
            <li> I was honestly a little concerned that I would experience some sensitivity because my teeth felt so...</li>
            <li> I am still a little nervous about a lack of protection against sensitivity</li>
            <li> I do wish that it was a little mintier in flavor.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste and gel both taste a little \\&quot;dentist-y.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall?</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of the results I would see in just 6 days, but I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> I use this every day and have had no issues -- no excessive bleeding, dry mouth, or weird gagging sensation that I can get with strips or trays (if have that issue, you know what I mean).</li>
            <li> But I actually found that this toothpaste was easy to use without the horrible whitening aftertaste.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> This two step toothpaste, plaque remover/whitener worked very well for my teeth; however, my wife, who suffers from chronically stained, maybe genetic oriented, teeth did much less so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also much less expensive than professional whitening at the dentist.  </li>
            <li> Regardless of logistics, it left my teeth sticky, with a bad aftertaste, and very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> The whitener is just standard Hydrogen Peroxide in a gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it I feel this product is no better, nor worse than any other whitening toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband and I both agree, we will probably purchase this Two Step System every few months to whiten our teeth since it is a little pricey.  </li>
            <li> My teeth do seem a little bit whiter after using for a few weeks</li>
            <li> one of the process feels very thick and gritty.</li>
            <li> Step 2 which is a gel like substance to whiten your teeth has a very sour after taste to me.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of using this because I have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> The only thing that took a little getting used to is that it dries out your mouth; I have never experienced that before.  </li>
            <li> and I also find it a little annoying to have two bottles especially since I travel so much.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s pretty much impossible to mess up the order of the steps.</li>
            <li> It is not a strong taste like some of the other brands I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I really think it would be difficult for anyone who has difficulty squeezing hard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too bad and well worth the results.</li>
            <li> After using the product consistently for about 3 days, it started to get somewhat unpleasant feeling - which the packaging mentioned might happen.</li>
            <li> The taste is not horrible as compared to some of the gels that you keep inside of a toothbrush, whitening strips that feel like bad gum stuck to your teeth, nasty bleach trays that cost WAY to much or the dangerous UV light on your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I guess I expected it to taste bad if was really going to work.  </li>
            <li> Not super dramatic, but I can tell a difference, especially using my permanent cap as a guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was disappointing because I could have really benefited from the whitening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used whitening products in the past and have noticed some sensitivity to hot and cold</li>
            <li> They went away after a few days.  </li>
            <li> After a few days, my teeth are noticeably whiter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Crest ProHealth HD two step solution for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> and I think they also seem to have lightened a few shades.</li>
            <li> Plus, I had trouble keeping the paste on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I also found it messy.  </li>
            <li> After a few uses I could notice a difference in whitening.  </li>
            <li> That said, I noticed whiter teeth within a few days and my teeth seemed to feel cleaner longer into the day.  </li>
            <li> The 2-steps add just a few minutes to your brushing time, though there have been a few mornings</li>
            <li> I started using Crest Pro Health HD a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> At first I was very skeptical.  </li>
            <li> At first I was very skeptical..</li>
            <li> It feels as though I have visited my dentist everyday.  </li>
            <li> of those things is always missing or subpar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a messy, over the sink, tooth-brusher.</li>
            <li> At first I was very skeptical..</li>
            <li> and I found it to be a bit messy.</li>
            <li> I had him start trying this and within a few days, I could already notice a difference.</li>
            <li> This did the work of the strips in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> I felt like it was too harsh for my teeth and</li>
            <li> Alas this is not the case but they definitely have gotten one shade lighter and they managed to stay that way with me using this so instead of paying $500 for a treatment.</li>
            <li> But what was worse was the texture that was left on my teeth.</li>
            <li> After a few uses</li>
            <li> Product will go to waste.  </li>
            <li> Product will go to waste.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a few things that I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> I should note that I also have bonding on a few teeth</li>
            <li> Mine have gotten a bit whiter, but there hasn&#x27;t been a stark difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a heavy tea drinker, and it seems to protect against staining that comes along with that.</li>
            <li> I think, unless you&#x27;re a heavy smoker/coffee drinker, you probably don&#x27;t need it all of the time anyway.  </li>
            <li> I drink coffee everyday and do notice a sufferance in whiteness.</li>
            <li> but you just lose a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> so I use whitening strips on my teeth a few times a year.  </li>
            <li> However the two minute system took a toll on my gums and I had to stop using after a few days.</li>
            <li> The pain continued for a few days</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I few friends asked if I had my teeth whitened.</li>
            <li> The taste took me a few brushing to get used to</li>
            <li> After just a few days, I noticed my teeth were a bit whiter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The toothpaste started to make my teeth noticably whiter after just a few days.</li>
            <li> I could not be happier in just a few days</li>
            <li> After a few seconds, it starts to feel almost like it&#x27;s literally scrubbing your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a check up for a few months, still</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a check up for a few months, still</li>
            <li> so I am not happy with the price at which it&#x27;s offered currently through this vendor plus shipping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After just a few days I noticed my teeth were noticeably whiter already.  </li>
            <li> I tend to get an accumulation of plaque behind my lower teeth and on one where it&#x27;s a bit crooked.</li>
            <li> The area behind my bottom teeth is vastly improved.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel overly harsh or burny on my tongue or lips.</li>
            <li> then the second tube is so thin that the brush scrapes across my teeth like nails on a chalk board.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels cleaner, my teeth are brighter and the taste isn&#x27;t harsh or leave an aftertaste.</li>
            <li> The two steps took a few days to get used to</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Since you are supposed to brush for 2 minutes with regular toothpaste, this was not cumbersome, adding unnecessarily to your brushing time.</li>

            <li> I decided to use Crest Pro Health HD for a few days before I wrote this review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few days, I was already noticing results.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few days but my teeth are already getting whiter.</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro-Health HD to review from Crest and have been using it for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> Although it works I did not enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> The cost is lower compared with whitening strips and the system should last approximately two months.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed my teeth are whiter after using it just in a few days.</li>
            <li> Not with harsh chemicals, but with hydrogen peroxide.  </li>
            <li> Using whitening strips can be a pain and professional whitening can get expensive.</li>
            <li> Wow, I was so wrong.</li>
            <li> The concept behind this product is that you can brush and whiten in the same amount of time it takes to brush -- 2 minutes.</li>

            <li> I decided to use Crest Pro Health HD for a few weeks before I wrote this review.</li>
            <li> While I feel like this system did give me the results that it promised, I couldn&#x27;t quite get used to using the polish step everyday.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for a few weeks</li>
            <li> A few days into trying this, I ran into another problem as well.</li>
            <li> I am a heavy iced tea drinker</li>
            <li> I am a heavy tea drinker and my teeth get stained.</li>
            <li> This product will whiten teeth after a few uses.</li>
            <li> After a few days I decided to read what was required for this test.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for several weeks now and have not experienced any increased sensitivity or pain.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth are a few shades lighter.  </li>
            <li> is a few shades whiter.</li>
            <li> I am a heavy coffee drinker</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not cheap for toothpaste, around $15.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll probably not be using it as my everyday toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably put it in the rotation every few months - just to re-whiten a bit, but I need a sensitive-teeth toothpaste on a day-to-day basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro Health HD for a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> However, within a few weeks my teeth were noticeably whiter.  </li>
            <li> Teeth color goes a few shades whiter after a week&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li> Not 6x whiter after a few weeks of use, but noticeably whiter.</li>
            <li> 2 minute everyday to brighter whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> And after a few days, I could see a noticable whitening of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I am not a smoker, although I do drink coffee a few times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would not use this forever, but for periodically whitening the teeth (since I am a heavy tea drinker).  </li>
            <li> This product consolidates my whitening routine into my everyday brushing.  </li>
            <li> It took a few days to see a difference</li>
            <li> I will give it another few days...</li>
            <li> After using Crest Pro Health HD both my husband and I noticed an improvement within just a few days.</li>
            <li> After just a few uses</li>
            <li> , they were a few shades whiter.  </li>
            <li> and I do not enjoy having to brush twice in a row.</li>
            <li> After using it twice a day for two weeks, my pearly whites turned dingy green.</li>
            <li> I can also see this product counteracting the effects of the toothpaste, helping to avoid the green stains caused by the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The two step process takes a few brushes to get used to, but now that I am in the habit I don&#x27;t have to think twice about how to get whiter, cleaner teeth in 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t speak to the teeth whitening aspect - but will update when I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I will be in a few weddings this spring, though, and plan to use it leading up to the events.</li>
            <li> The plaque in the back of my teeth has noticeably decreased.</li>
            <li> They get whiter and whiter everyday.</li>
            <li> Within a few days, I thought my teeth looked whiter.  </li>
            <li> As a heavy coffee and tea drinker, I often worry about how the drinks stain my teeth.  </li>
            <li> and I do not like whitening my teeth with harsh chemicals often.</li>
            <li> I do notice a difference in my teeth, but the problem is that the second step tastes not great.</li>
            <li> To the point that a few of my friends &amp; my wife have purchased this product and are using it.  </li>
            <li> If you are among the unfortunate to have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I use an Oral-B electric toothbrush everyday and go to the dentist every 6 months.  </li>
            <li> I then realized after a few uses that you get used to using both tubes.</li>
            <li> And after a few days have not found any value.</li>
            <li> I decided to use Crest Pro Health HD for a few days before I wrote this review.</li>
            <li> I have an Oral B brush with the 2 minute timer broken into 4 30 second sections</li>
            <li> But after a few days I just became habit..</li>
            <li> It does take a few times to get used to the taste of it..</li>
            <li> At first I was very skeptical..</li>
            <li> If you also had trouble with the whitestrips, this may be a solution for you.</li>
            <li> However, that is not deterring me from continuing to use 2x a day for another few weeks to see if there is a noticeable improvement longer-term.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> But even then, although my periodontal problems have not gotten worse, my gums continued bleed when I brushed my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> especially when I was really tired.</li>
            <li> My everyday routine is not affected and I&#x27;ve received a ton of compliments.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing this in a few days when my tube runs out.</li>
            <li> In a way it dried out my mouth and made it feel strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I noticed in a few days my teeth were brighter and whiter.</li>
            <li> I wondered if the claims of whiter teeth in a few days using this two step toothpaste system.</li>
            <li> but I got use to it after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> I’ve had my buzzkit for Crest Pro Health HD for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> A few</li>
            <li> I liek the fact that there is a noticeable difference even after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I strongly disliked the way my teeth felt after using Crest Pro Health HD.  </li>
            <li> I had a few reservations.</li>
            <li> I did use the product for two weeks following the directions but couldn&#x27;t manage any longer because of the taste and poorly designed lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received Crest HD as part of the BzzAgent program and after a few weeks of using it I can see a visible difference in the shade of my teeth.</li>
            <li> However, I had taken a break from using Crest Pro Health HD for a few days</li>
            <li> However, I had taken a break from using Crest Pro Health HD for a few days</li>
            <li> Honestly I am an impatient person</li>
            <li> followed the directions very well by reading it multiple times so that I don&#x27;t skip anything and do anything wrong which will give me wrong results.</li>
            <li> My teeth were whiter after a just a few uses.  </li>
            <li> I would not use it for everyday, but rather save it for when I have an event or upcoming pictures.</li>
            <li> After a few days this irritation went away.</li>
            <li> but I cannot say I&#x27;ve seen a stark change in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I brush and floss everyday</li>
            <li> The only issue is that it&#x27;s not a great breath freshener.</li>
            <li> I mentioned some drawbacks and there are a few.</li>
            <li> It is taking some getting used to having a two step process, but it really is not a huge deal switching from a one step to a two step process.  </li>
            <li> Did not entirely remove the worse stains but made a difference after a few use day and night.</li>
            <li> Personally, I feel that this is a false statement on the product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a huge difference, but a lot easier than using strips.</li>
            <li> like dentist clean (minus the painful scraping!).  </li>
            <li> like dentist clean (minus the painful scraping!)</li>
            <li> like dentist clean (minus the painful scraping!)</li>
            <li> I usually quit due to them being time consuming and or that they taste horrendous!  </li>
            <li> The other tooth whiteners I&#x27;ve used are bulky and taste bad when you have to leave them in your mouth for a certain length of time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not a strong burning feeling, but definitely not comfortable.  </li>
            <li> While switching paste half way through the process is a bit of a nuisance, it&#x27;s a small price to pay for the benefits.</li>
            <li> the price, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d switch over to this product, but then again, I&#x27;m not super concerned about the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> It is a two-step brushing process and takes no more than 2 and a half minutes.</li>
            <li> so I usually go close to a minute &amp; a half.</li>
            <li> Over the course of having used the product for the past week, my teeth seem slightly whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did notice some slight sensitivity, but I have had this happen in the past with all forms of whitening, so  </li>
            <li> and i bet they will noticed a difference in my plaque build up - less of course!  </li>
            <li> Even my hygienist, said that my teeth seemed less stained than they had in the past.  </li>
            <li> however I&#x27;m not sure if that is due to the excessive brushing or the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a little sensitivity, but I chalk that up to brushing for a little longer than usual.</li>
            <li> The only reason I scored it 4/5 stars is because I find it difficult to do the 2 step system any other time than at night before bed.  </li>
            <li> Not only did it give me that clean feeling, but it also whitened my teeth dramatically (and I don&#x27;t have terribly stained teeth).  </li>
            <li> I have used other whitening systems and they usually make my teeth very sensitive to the cold.  </li>
            <li> I was highly concerned when I saw all the negative reviews that there must be something wrong with me.</li>
            <li> It just plain works.</li>
            <li> The second step/tube is a very watery gel that I felt had a very unpleasant taste.  </li>
            <li> After only using this twice, I have seen dramatic results.</li>
            <li> look a bit whiter after one use, but not as dramatic as white strips do.</li>
            <li> The first few days was extremely painful from brushing with step one.  </li>
            <li> I did actually get some whitening, but it wasn&#x27;t the dramatic results hyped on the packaging or on the TV commercials.  </li>
            <li> Once you get the base staining taken care of, you can let your mouth rest, and just start an upkeep routine mixed with your normal brushing cycle.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s not easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> It is not a bright white, but it slowly cleans and brightens your teeth as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This I noticed less, but did still notice at least a little.</li>
            <li> Thank u again BzzAgent for choosing me for this campaign because I was so skeptical after getting disappointed so many times by other whitening products out there that I probably would not have tried Crest HD n</li>
            <li> and I noticed small abrasions on them with a little bit of bleeding.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t even mind the brush time being a little longer than usual.  </li>
            <li> Usually there&#x27;s a little spray from washing the tops and bottoms of your teeth, but not like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I had no problems at all remembering to only use this for a minute, because it leaves a residue on your teeth and a dry, almost numb fluoride feeling that lets you know</li>
            <li> Results were noticeable after the first try and if i managed to quit my bad habits</li>
            <li> At first I thought, this is not to bad.</li>
            <li> The only real complaint I have about this toothpaste is the fact that you have to stop midbrush to switch toothpastes.</li>
            <li> The first week I tried, I had to stop because mu gum started being extremely painful.</li>
            <li> but I generally don&#x27;t because I find the process tedious</li>
            <li> The first week I tried, I had to stop because mu gum started being extremely painful.</li>
            <li> THey are expensive and generally alot of work.</li>
            <li> I have noticed an increased yellowing to my teeth over the past few years.</li>
            <li> After seeing some photos of myself a few weeks after using Crest Pro-Health HD, I noticed that my teeth looked whiter than they have in the past.  </li>
            <li> Some of the whitening toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried in the past are too harsh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the past few days</li>
            <li> No more messy strips or trays.</li>
            <li> I usually use a whitening tray, but it is so messy and time consuming compared to this.  </li>
            <li> It is quite annoying to use two toothpastes but this does force me to do it for two minutes because I want to get the full effects.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, but I think it can at least partly be attributed to the active ingredient, stannous flouride.</li>
            <li> I have always been a little skeptical when it comes to teeth whitening, I have tried several products for sale and some work</li>
            <li> The second toothpaste was a little uncomfortable to me in the beginning.</li>
            <li> otherwise I will end up with white teeth and bad breath or bad breath and yellow teeth ;)</li>
            <li> The Morning Breath has decreased due to less plaque on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Raw?</li>
            <li> My teeth are very sensitive so other tooth-whitening products are painful to use.  </li>
            <li> The benefits to whitening slowly is that you will experience less sensitivity and issues with enamel breakdown.  </li>
            <li> Its dry and irritating.</li>
            <li> A lot of the heavy duty whiteners require leave on strips that felt awkward and made my teeth really sensitive after I used them.</li>
            <li> I try to brush for at least one minute for each step, but I am seeing very few results as compared to other whitening products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want them  glowing in the dark or anything!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m continuing to use the product for a little longer in hopes of whiter teeth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the gingivitis as it&#x27;s hard to tell, but I do think my teeth are slightly whiter after using it for 10 days.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this toothpaste I hated Crest oral care products because they left a thick white film in my mouth, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this toothpaste whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a pain to have to brush twice, but it really isn&#x27;t too bad.  </li>
            <li> It really eliminates any bad breath on the spot</li>
            <li> - It really helped me to keep the bad breath</li>
            <li> I will keep using Crest Pro Health® HD and hopefully the bad taste will give me results very soon.</li>
            <li> What I really like is that there is zero sensitivity to the whitening agent and it doesn&#x27;t taste bad.  </li>
            <li> The taste wasn&#x27;t bad, with only a minor sting like that of mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> but with 2 days of this I was shocked at how much whiter my teeth were.</li>
            <li> This is a somewhat strange procedure, I think not necessarily because it is a hardship or bad, but because it&#x27;s not the usual routine.</li>
            <li> My gums had small ulcer like sores a couple of hours after use.</li>
            <li> No more &#x27;fuzzy&#x27; teeth.</li>
            <li> I am not sure that this toothpaste gets teeth</li>
            <li> It is a tad on the expensive side compared to regular toothpaste-</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing this product instead of my usual toothpaste from now on.</li>
            <li> am never really satisfied how my teeth feel after brushing.  </li>
            <li> The Crest Pro-Health HD is a two-step system that claims to make your mouth 6 times healthier and your teeth 6 times whiter, than ordinary toothpaste, in just one week.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I took a before picture and another picture this morning after using the product twice a day for the past 9 days.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t rinse in between steps (not sure why?)</li>
            <li> I have used the Crest whitening strips in the past</li>
            <li> like some toothpastes have in the past.</li>
            <li> may not buy this kit again; it is after all expensive with no extra result.</li>
            <li> naturally skeptical husband noticed the difference and actually asked to try it out.  </li>
            <li> I am a mom to 3 small kiddos</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t helped with mine, but I attribute that to acid reflux and smoking, so I&#x27;m not sure that this product was designed to combat either of those.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t helped with mine, but I attribute that to acid reflux and smoking, so I&#x27;m not sure that this product was designed to combat either of those.</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;re done, you spit and rinse as usual.  </li>
            <li> In the past I have used lightening strips.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s from brushing a lot longer than I usually would</li>
            <li> (I estimate I usually take 30-45 seconds to brush my teeth, as opposed to 2 minutes) or from the harshness of the whitening gel.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure I am seeing a difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also giving this a 5 star rating, because I get the impression if I didn&#x27;t have 30+ years of coffee drinking going past these teeth, it would be way whiter than it ended up being.&lt;br</li>
            <li> 1 Added benefit of this 2 part system is that it requires 1 minute with each step ensuring 2 minutes of brushing where in the past I would stop around 1 minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few weeks now!</li>
            <li> While my mouth definitely felt cleaner and my teeth were whiter, the taste and feeling were difficult to bear.  </li>
            <li> I feel like the product size is on the small side for the price though.</li>
            <li> The package says 6X whiter teeth after a week versus ordinary toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I see a difference or not.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I didnt get the dirty teeth feeling by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Not only was I prone to cavities prior to using a motorized toothbrush, when using Crest white strips in the past I would get TERRIBLE zingers within minutes of me putting the strips on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Also, it may seem tedious to have to use two different toothpastes when brushing your teeth -</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no film/coating as there usually</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, HD has nothing on the Crest White Strips.</li>
            <li> 6x as claimed I am not sure but definetly a difference.</li>
            <li> No more guilt about indulging when you use this product</li>
            <li> It is unrealistic to expect a total transformation with this product</li>
            <li> That is now a thing of the past.  </li>
            <li> Everyone has a few minutes in the morning and night to make this product do what it is designed to do and that is to transform your teeth!  </li>
            <li> You use a small dab from each tube for 1 minute.  </li>
            <li> He looked at it and instantly said it looked too complicated.</li>
            <li> I am not into complicated procedure when it comes to my morning routine, but this is very simple.</li>
            <li> Bottom line is I am not sure I would pay the price to buy this myself.</li>
            <li> After I brushed it on my teeth it felt really weird.</li>
            <li> No more losing the cap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I am not impressed by this product.</li>
            <li> And while I&#x27;ll agree that there is no better whitening product out there the way it makes my mouth feel after using it is a bit off putting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I noticed it feeling cleaner than after using my usual toothpaste though.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro Health® HD™ Toothpaste for the past two weeks.  </li>
            <li> The taste is minty but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d feel that way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d feel that way</li>
            <li> Whitening in the past was time consuming and caused sensitivities.</li>
            <li> , i do not wake up with the usual morning breath.</li>
            <li> I usually have to stop using after a time because they make my teeth way too</li>
            <li> I was not sure I would like the two step process, and it took me a couple of times after step one, not to rinse.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I will purchase the product for the whitening aspect though.</li>
            <li> I have used whiteners in the past that burn your lips if it gets on them.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take any longer to brush than I usually do.  </li>
            <li> Please know that there may be just a small percentage of people who experience this....and I am one of those unlucky one.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say, that I do not see any difference from what I was currently using.</li>
            <li> I am too lazy to use two tubes.</li>
            <li> and I started developing some irritation when I was using the paste to brush my teeth every time that I did (which is usually three times a day.)  </li>
            <li> To me, stripping seems damaging, but let’s give it a shot anyway as it indicates this can provide 6X whiter teeth in one week (vs. ordinary toothpaste).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually post reviews</li>
            <li> Now that iv&#x27;e tried it, I&#x27;m noticing small improvements across my teeth.</li>
            <li> so I found that I usually needed to keep the brush upright as I applied the gel because it had the tendency to run off the side of the brush.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if my teeth are getting whiter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m anxious to see my dentist to show him the results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what happens if you do rinse between steps</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what happens if you do rinse between steps</li>
            <li> I usually use Crest with scope and don&#x27;t have this problem.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are not getting fuzzy and I have been eating candy some days, which usually does it.  </li>
            <li> I have not used Crest in the past because I&#x27;ve always felt it makes my mouth feel too sugary.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure that the benefits outweight the hassle of the two steps.  </li>
            <li> - I am not confident that usually do that.</li>
            <li> I did not find it to be at all time consuming, as you just brush as usual with step one, spit, and brush with step two.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take any longer than it usually does to take care of my teeth in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over a month and while the containers are small</li>
            <li> I have to say I was quite skeptical to about trying the product  for several reasons: 1.)</li>
            <li> Weird, I know, just a personal preference .</li>
            <li> I can use it in small doses</li>
            <li> I was eager to try it because I&#x27;ve used a lot of whitening toothpastes in the past with lackluster results.</li>
            <li> Using step one of the kit literally makes my teeth feel as lickety slick, if not more slick and shiny then when I go to get a cleaning at my dental office.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste day and night for the past three weeks</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it was my technique or if my sensitivity adjusted.  </li>
            <li> naturally skeptical husband noticed the difference and actually asked to try it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d feel that way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d feel that way</li>
            <li> Couple with regular flossing and mouthwash and you cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> Step 2 is a slick gel that uses hydrogen peroxide to polish and whiten teeth.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be left with a really weird taste and feeling in your mouth.</li>
            <li> So, I am at the halfway point through my usual testing period for these types of products.</li>
            <li> A few shades whiter at least.</li>
            <li> But then again im not entirely sure i can</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t usually have any issues like that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, given the time that the product feels like it&#x27;s taking - I know you&#x27;re supposed to brush 2 minutes with regular toothpaste, but this feels longer having to use two products - and it&#x27;s price, it is unlikely that I will re-purchase this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, given the time that the product feels like it&#x27;s taking - I know you&#x27;re supposed to brush 2 minutes with regular toothpaste, but this feels longer having to use two products - and it&#x27;s price, it is unlikely that I will re-purchase this product.  </li>
            <li> Im not sure if Im a fan of the two step process</li>
            <li> I was worried adding an extra step would be tedious</li>
            <li> and hopefully I can get my teeth a few shades lighter!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure how to explain it</li>
            <li> My teeth are a bit crooked and not perfectly aligned, so</li>
            <li> I have tried a variety of whitening products in the past (toothpastes, strips, gels).  </li>
            <li> I usually need to floss and use mouth wash in order for my gums not to bleed.  </li>
            <li> However one small annoyance of the product is the two step process.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a lot of luck in the past using whitening products</li>
            <li> 2 steps, not sure if I&#x27;m a fan of doing that</li>
            <li> Why 4 stars then instead of 5 not sure my teeth are 6x whiter like it states.</li>
            <li> I usually buy what is on sale.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 7 days.</li>
            <li> If you not satisfied with your results, Crest will send you a pre-paid card in the amount of your purchase.</li>
            <li> Today I used the whitening gel in place of my usual gel in my teeth whitening tray.</li>
            <li> I am a mother with 4 small kids</li>
            <li> Sorry, but I do not see any difference in how white my teeth look now after the 3 week trial period.</li>
            <li> Not sure what ingredient in the Pro Health line does this,</li>
            <li> but I am not sure if they are 6x whiting than what they were before, as I have no way to measure this.</li>
            <li> In fact, I have been looking for a toothpaste that I like the taste of because most of them are awful in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This may be because I have used Crest Whitestrips within the past two years, or it may just be that whatever has caused the discoloration of my teeth isn&#x27;t affected by hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s because of the tooth paste or not</li>
            <li> This will help with tooth sensitivity issues which usually occur with whiting products.</li>
            <li> And call me lazy</li>
            <li> The tubes are small, though.  </li>
            <li> I have used the Crest Whitestrips product in the past.  </li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m not ashamed to go for it because morning breath is a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> No more strips or trays that take up to an hour.  </li>
            <li> I noticed my teeth were getting sensitive to cold drinks and food</li>
            <li> it just gives a weird taste that I personally can&#x27;t stand if not rinsing before continuing with step 2 .&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> I have tried whitening toothpastes in the past, and they always seem to hurt my teeth.</li>
            <li> The Crest packaging say a 6x healthier mouth and 6x whiter teeth in one week vs ordinary toothpaste.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a small reason)</li>
            <li> I have a dental checkup soon, and am anxious to see if plaque has been reduced.</li>
            <li> But i have noticed, in just a few days, that any plaque i might have seen before is no where to be found!</li>
            <li> A Purifying Cleanser and Perfecting Gel system gave me unbelievable results.</li>
            <li> have noticed in the past week that my teeth are getting noticeably whiter.</li>
            <li> But i have noticed, in just a few days, that any plaque i might have seen before is no where to be found!</li>
            <li> Also I am not sure when I should be flossing, before or after brushing.  </li>
            <li> I unfortunately was offered this product shortly after going through a Rembrandt whitestrips regimen.  </li>
            <li> Since every minute counts when you are trying to get out of the house for work in the morning and have 3 small children, this is a drawback but the results make up for it.  </li>
            <li> Frankly I think many of them are disgusting.</li>
            <li> Then, without rinsing (yes, you can spit), add a small bit of the polishing/whitening gel and brush for another minute.</li>
            <li> Some others I have tried in the past tasted like chemicals...</li>
            <li> I have tried strips and gels in the past, but to no avail.</li>
            <li> Ill keep brushing my teeth with the two step system as it is a simple process and doesn&#x27;t take any longer than brushing your teeth with ordinary toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Within a few days I also noticed they were whiter!</li>
            <li> I am too lazy to brush my teeth twice every time.</li>
            <li> Some of the whitening strips have caused a bit of discomfort for me in the past but this was not so with the Crest Pro Health HD.</li>
            <li> I usually brush once a day for about 30 seconds, using an Oral B electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about trying this because I did not want to get the tooth sensitivity that usually comes with whitening products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d pay this for toothpaste though.  </li>
            <li> The two step process does make me brush my teeth longer than i usually do, which would probably make a healthier mouth.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;m going to stick with my regular inexpensive toothpaste and every 1-2 weeks use my trays and peroxide.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but kept an open mind.</li>
            <li> The biggest difference was that my teeth felt 10x cleaner than when I use my ordinary toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is something in the 1st step toothpaste or what,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small thing</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> I was slightly skeptical as to whether or not this would actually work.</li>
            <li> I also worried that the lighting my cause sensitivity in my teeth as some whiting products have done in the past</li>
            <li> I usually have sensitivity after using whitening products but not this one.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure if it whitened them at all.  </li>
            <li> Instead, set a timer and brush for a few minutes!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the whitening claim at this time and will withhold judgement on that for now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m anxious to see the results with continued use.</li>
            <li> and even though I was somewhat skeptical about the product&#x27;s claims, my teeth are whiter and my overall oral health has become elevated.</li>
            <li> When I received Crest HD Pro-Health Daily 2 Step System I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ve noticed whiter teeth yet, but I did have a bit of tooth sensitivity one day, which I usually get when I try a whitening product -</li>
            <li> /&gt;The claim that it whitens 6x in one week are a bit difficult to compare, but I can definitely see a difference in the whitening.</li>
            <li> No more morning breath and whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> Well, now you can have it at home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1: is not your usual toothpaste cleaner.</li>
            <li> I was asked to try  Crest Pro Health® HD by Crest via Bzz Agent almost a month ago, and I have to say that it takes some commitment beyond the usual brush and go.</li>
            <li> I do this because Im too lazy to count the vibrations and beeps from my sonicare in the morning.</li>
            <li> Brushing takes a little longer, which probably isn&#x27;t a bad thing, and after a few weeks, I&#x27;m actually beginning to see a slight improvement in tooth color.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend at least giving this a try, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little weird brushing then NOT RINSING and applying the gel, but it&#x27;s ridiculously easier than applying the strips, and the gel goes a lot further in every</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about using the new 3-D crest Pro health HD because of the two-step process.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the flavor of step two and the awkward aftertaste left behind.</li>
            <li> Plus, they tend to be very messy.  </li>
            <li> Also, the 1st step was very harsh on my gums and I felt it burned my gums.</li>
            <li> The product tends to puddle at the bottom of the lid, wasting product and making it very messy.</li>
            <li> I am a very heavy coffee drinker, so</li>
            <li> My dentist said some whitening toothpastes are very harsh on teeth, but he was not concerned about me using Crest Pro-Health HD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 days I can tell that there is a subtle difference in the whiteness of my teeth already!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While a little inconvenient to use correctly, compared to basic toothpaste,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little annoying, but they tell you this straight out.</li>
            <li> I say off and on, because usually the only ones that I have really seen work are the products that require you to pour some really nasty tasting gel into a plastic tray and put it in your mouth every day.</li>
            <li> Step one is a simple toothpaste, but it&#x27;s weird because you aren&#x27;t to rinse after brushing, which is hard to get used to.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of it at first since I have tried other whiteners in the past and always had bad experiences with gum and nerve pain from the chemicals.</li>
            <li> it really does help with keep bad breath at bay and whiten your teeth - slowly over time.</li>
            <li> I started off determined to try it for a few days to see if it made a difference, with the intention of cutting out the second step after I could determine if it whitened or not just as a time saver.</li>
            <li> I have been trying this product for a few weeks and notice a subtle difference.</li>
            <li> thin kmy morning breath is less nasty too :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to think that this product may help keep me from a very painful procedure.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical because other whitening toothpastes.</li>
            <li> The first visit was a little brutal</li>
            <li> Cons - the two step process is not that bad, but the second tube is tough to open / apply while using my electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I certainly never would&#x27;ve thought to try this product if I saw it on a shelf, but now I&#x27;m sad it wasn&#x27;t around when I was trying desperately for whiter teeth before my wedding and dealing with nasty whitening strips and treatments that really just left me with sensitive teeth and no results.</li>
            <li> It seems a little ridiculous brushing my teeth for three minutes now, but at least my teeth feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2 started off bad when my husband squeezed the tube like normal and the thinner gel shot out.  </li>
            <li> but in the interest of full disclosure...  My husband tried it once and hated the taste--</li>
            <li> I would prefer a one tube product and although it is not much more time consuming was not thrilled with having to do a two-step process.</li>
            <li> BUT The two step thing its pretty annoying.</li>
            <li> I will say being a creature of habit remembering that its 2 steps was annoying at first</li>
            <li> In the past, I have not liked whitening treatments because of the taste and time involved.</li>
            <li> The containers look small but the toothpaste is not as thick as you would expect.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen the 6X whiter results in a week that they say on the box, but I have noticed at least some difference, without the sensitivity that usually accompanies whitening products, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> but its still not very pleasant.</li>
            <li> But even worse my teeth are sensitive, my gums are sore, insides of my cheeks raw and tongue feels numb.</li>
            <li> However, I found out while timing myself (1 minute for each step) that I have obviously been cutting my brushing shorter than I should have in the past</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it makes your mouth feel dry.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed that even after three weeks of pain, white gums, and even bleeding gums, I saw absolutely no results.</li>
            <li> I felt a little less guilty about drinking tea or coffee when I do this step.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the number 2 toothpaste has an unpleasant taste that I do not enjoy.</li>
            <li> Colgate Total is the brand I was sticking with because the reaction wasn&#x27;t as bad, just slight shedding.</li>
            <li> My gums became very sensitive and Step 2 left a terrible after taste.</li>
            <li> , I hate feeling my teeth are dity and constantly picking and cleaning at them all day long because I hate the feeling so much.</li>
            <li> but if you are serious about whiter teeth, it&#x27;s a small sacrifice to use two tubes.  </li>
            <li> I was wary of trying another product other than my usual sensodine.</li>
            <li> However, after 3 weeks of use I am still having a hard time breaking years of routine.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to get out of the tube.</li>
            <li> Toothpaste is hard to review.  </li>
            <li> 2, at lessor amounts, was hard to even notice anything else was there.  </li>
            <li> After using this product for just over a month as part of a promotional thing, it was hard to tell if there was a difference from before I started using the product.  </li>
            <li> but I hardly notice it now.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to spread evenly across all of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time using both steps without spitting, but am getting the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> Do you know how hard that was?</li>
            <li> I realized that I was brushing my teeth too hard.  </li>
            <li> While my teeth aren&#x27;t as dull, they just don&#x27;t seem any whiter.</li>
            <li> I learned this the hard way.</li>
            <li> The two step process isn&#x27;t hard to get used to at all.</li>
            <li> I do think the whitening gel makes a difference, but it&#x27;s hard to tell.</li>
            <li> The system isn&#x27;t that hard</li>
            <li> stannous fluoride is hard to formulate into a stable toothpaste, 2)</li>
            <li> However, the &#x27;not rinsing&#x27; between steps one and two was hard for me to remember in the beginning -</li>
            <li> It is so hard not to rinse your mouth out with water or your toothbrush, but</li>
            <li> The flavor of each tube is pleasing and my hard to please husband even loves using Crest Pro-Health HD for his tooth brushing routine.</li>
            <li> Two steps weren&#x27;t hard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not time consuming or hard to use.</li>
            <li> healthier and 6x whiter may be hard to measure, but here&#x27;s the lowdown (</li>
            <li> I have a little bit of sensitivity and this product did not make that any worse</li>
            <li> The inconsistency is a little irritating but all in all, I would probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> Also, the 1st step is a thick gel which can make it hard to get it neatly out of the tube.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical that the 2 step system would be complicated, but it was actually very simple- one minute with step one, one minute with step two.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t taste bad for a whitening product nor does it make your teeth sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed one thing thou it taste weird the first few times</li>
            <li> My one complaint is the length of time it takes to use.  </li>
            <li> At least not in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but then you had to use the product for at least  a week to determine if there was any difference.</li>
            <li> I knew this was a common side effect from pregnancy, so I just shrugged it off.  </li>
            <li> I never liked the taste, sensitivity to teeth, and inconveince.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait at least a week before posting a review</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that the product advertises that teeth can be up to six times whiter with use.  </li>
            <li> like I commonly did before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, white strips are terrible for my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> The taste of this step is not nice at all.  </li>
            <li> Myteeth do look brighter but not blinding artificial white which I appreciate!</li>
            <li> I wish they were a stronger mint flavor but at least they are not chalky.</li>
            <li> is a negative.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for at least 2 weeks now, maybe closer to 3</li>
            <li> The bad aftertaste from the prohealth that I disliked is gone after using the second step.</li>
            <li> do not use an oral irrigator, mouthwash, or eat / drink for at least an hour after using the product.  </li>
            <li> So I bought this product and use it at least once a day.</li>
            <li> I have any complaint about this toothpaste</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing dramatic, but just slight whitening.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s my only disappointment.  </li>
            <li> And trust me I have been taking lots of selfies of me and my baby as of late.  </li>
            <li> Do this for at least a week</li>
            <li> or at least i do.  </li>
            <li> I have found that, when I am running late, I don’t use the Crest Pro Health® HD™.  </li>
            <li> the artificial sweetener (in my opinion - likely a cancer causing agent).  </li>
            <li> You are supposed to use twice a day for at least a week and teeth should be up to six shades whiter.</li>
            <li> negative is the price.  </li>
            <li> Now for the negative.  </li>
            <li> It got my teeth at least one shade lighter within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> At least for me...</li>
            <li> complaint is in regard to the whitening claim.</li>
            <li> Aside from remembering not to rinse between the two steps, my biggest complaint is the cap of Step 1.  </li>
            <li> I was looking forward to trying this product because I never really liked the whitening strips.</li>
            <li> I try to avoid artificial colors, and the toothpaste has Blue 1 in it</li>
            <li> With Crest Pro Health HD I was happily surprised and shocked by my result.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 4 stars because I do get some peeling of my cheeks and gums and after research realized this is a common occurrence with the floride that is used in the Crest HD.  </li>
            <li> Since I brush for at least two minutes, twice per day, the process didn&#x27;t phase me at all.</li>
            <li> It took at least 3 minutes to do the two step process in the morning and at night</li>
            <li> There is nothing truly negative I can say about this toothpaste duo.</li>
            <li> If I have one complaint</li>
            <li> At least for me...</li>
            <li> That being said, I have never been happier with toothpaste (at least not since I was about 8 and discovered the glittery crest toothpaste).</li>
            <li> The directions are to brush at least 2 times a day.</li>
            <li> Maybe that would eliminate or at least mask the bleach taste I had after the polishing gel.  </li>
            <li> and I never liked the feeling of the strips on my teeth - too gunky.</li>
            <li> , I was not thrilled but wanted to give it a shot so continued to use it and after a couple days, I stopped noticing the flavor, but like the results, so am sticking with it.</li>
            <li> However I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> but I thought that if I could at least use it once a day I would see results in about 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> The thin product also contributed to the messy sink after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am one of those people, but worse I was  a 2 pack a day smoker and a heavy coffee and cola drinker for almost 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will see whiting after a few days with maximum whiting at approximately two weeks.</li>
            <li> I slowly worked up in amounts of toothpaste from there until I could feel an effect.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> my friend decided to use this once a day for a week, then slowly move up to twice a day.</li>
            <li> Go slow and see if this works for you.  </li>
            <li> The system is a two step system, the gel coat can be a bit thick and gummy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a bit annoying because I really can&#x27;t be bothered to count out the 1 minute or set a standalone timer/cell phone to time it.</li>
            <li> Whitens - yes it does whitens your teeth but seems to be a slow process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re like me and hate using whitening kits/strips due to sensitivity but find that whitening toothpaste just doesn&#x27;t have enough &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34; to it, Crest ProHealth HD is for you!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re like me and hate using whitening kits/strips due to sensitivity but find that whitening toothpaste just doesn&#x27;t have enough &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34; to it, Crest ProHealth HD is for you!</li>
            <li> and I do not have to take the additional time to use the inconvenient, messy strips or other time consuming or costly products.</li>
            <li> package is difficult and somewhat sharp when opened, so be careful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean, why two steps?</li>
            <li> I am still not sure, but I think I like it!</li>
            <li> (I mean, there&#x27;s two tubes here)</li>
            <li> I assume they mean non-whitening, but who knows what they mean.  </li>
            <li> An added plus is no more morning breath!</li>
            <li> I mean, who doesn&#x27;t want whiter teeth?</li>
            <li> The original Crest Pro Health whitening toothpaste was the worst for my mouth.</li>
            <li> No More Morning Breath!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried whitening strips in the past with little to no results and so I was skeptical about this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that slick run-your-tongue-over-your-teeth-and-smile feeling of &amp;#34;Wow!</li>
            <li> I mean, i would have to committ to a &amp;#34;two minute&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> morning breath is a thing of the past!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really, REALLY stupid marketing gimmicks aside, this is a decent toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Yes still annoying having to add a second toothpaste half way through</li>
            <li> I will use all of the Crest Pro Health HD system until it&#x27;s gone, but after that I will likely return to the single step Crest Pro Health Whitening paste that I like best.tried it once and hated the taste--didn&#x27;t use it again.  </li>
            <li> I will probably only use this once a week though, because it is so unpleasant and because it works so well</li>
            <li> All you need is a very small dab of this stuff to work.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I both smoke and drink coffee, so are teeth; needless to say, are very stained and have a terrible yellow</li>
            <li> I did not love Step 2 unfortunately, the flavor of the Perfecting Gel was not pleasing and it was very difficult to finish brushing for the time expected due to that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I took off a star in my rating is because I began to find the toothpaste (tube 1) too sweet, almost sickeningly so!</li>
            <li> I understand the logic behind it, but there are nights where I&#x27;m just too tired to mess with the 2 steps.</li>
            <li> Any toothpaste that promises to whiten your teeth usually is a false claim from past experience.</li>
            <li> This has made a big difference for me, since I&#x27;m prone to rushing through the boring steps of daily life.  </li>
            <li> I take my toothpaste seriously.  </li>
            <li> I take my toothpaste seriously</li>
            <li> Seriously, every day when I brush my teeth with the Crest Pro-Heath HD and my Oral B Pro toothbrush</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but it does make a difference vs my previous toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You have to be serious about it though.  </li>
            <li> I can say that I feel there was a subtle change, but nothing like advertised.</li>
            <li> This is seriously my holy grail.</li>
            <li> 1) it&#x27;s going to have ridiculous &amp;#34;rules&amp;#34; like not eating for hours afterward, 2)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier than the annoying strips that take forever and, quite frankly, end up irritating my teeth anyway.</li>
            <li> I have a serious aversion to wintergreen flavored anything.</li>
            <li> And oh my goodness, my teeth are seriously whiter.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> subtle mint.  </li>
            <li> I was one of the unfortunate souls that had their gums slightly burnt by the polishing paste (the whiteness on your gums the package talks about).</li>
            <li> I Don&#x27;t like: The 2 steps are too complicated in the morning when I&#x27;m half asleep (but not a problem at night).</li>
            <li> Because of my previous experiences with whitening products, I was wary about trying this out.</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t happen with Crest Pro Health HD - I seriously feel like I&#x27;m visiting the dentist every day I use</li>
            <li> If not cared for properly bad teeth and lead to heart issues and other illnesses some even deadly.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical to try Crest Pro Health® HD™.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned it would taste terrible,  but it was that of a wintergreen toothpaste, no weird feel either!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical having to brush twice</li>
            <li> It was a little difficult getting into the routine of brushing longer and rinsing etc..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little bit obsessed with my teeth.</li>
            <li> and i was a little skeptical in begining seeing two tubes, a process to follow</li>
            <li> So i was a little skeptical when trying this product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;m a little gun shy about trying again</li>
            <li> The two-step process has been a little difficult to get used to.</li>
            <li> the taste of it is a little weird</li>
            <li> I thought it was a little weird that you are not suppose to rinse your mouth between the two toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I also thought the gel bottle was poorly designed--it was hard to screw on and off the cap while also holding a frothing toothbrush.</li>
            <li> it bad enough to stop using it?</li>
            <li> the topic of bad morning breath, that is where I feel the product falls short.</li>
            <li> the topic of bad morning breath, that is where I feel the product falls short.</li>
            <li> I have never been to a dentist and left without them telling me my plaque is bad.</li>
            <li> Having to use two different products in one brushing isn&#x27;t so bad once you get used to the routine.</li>
            <li> The second step wasn&#x27;t that bad, but the taste leaves a bit to be desired.</li>
            <li> The second step tastes bad but makes your teeth feel fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t taste like regular toothpaste, but it wasn&#x27;t a bad taste.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have been using Crest Pro Health HD for a few weeks now and have not seen any whitening effect.</li>
            <li> I was shocked when I saw my mom the next day</li>
            <li> I had been procrastinating about trying some of the myriad of products on the market that promise whiter teeth but have been turned off by the thought of trays with messy goop, strips, expensive trips to the dentist, etc.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it took me a few days of eliminating products to figure out</li>
            <li> The taste is not good.  </li>
            <li> I have never loved a toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> The worst is the price, but even then it may be worth it.</li>
            <li> The worst is the price, but even then it may be worth it.</li>
            <li> No messy, annoying whitening strips.  </li>
            <li> The problem with brushing at home, at least for me, is that within a half hour, my teeth feel dirty again.</li>
            <li> Just because it didn&#x27;t work for me doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not a great product.</li>
            <li> I had my teeth whitened years ago in a dentists office and it was uncomfortable, painful and made my teeth very sensitive.</li>
            <li> This came just before I went away on vacation and because I hate carrying one - no less two - tubes of toothpaste when flying (not to mention that I didn&#x27;t know how my teeth would react to it), this stayed at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have weak teeth to begin with, and this process was not a good choice.  </li>
            <li> Hydrogen peroxide is not a pleasant</li>
            <li> Hydrogen peroxide is not a pleasant</li>
            <li> It is nowhere near as messy and doesn&#x27;t taste terrible.</li>
            <li> this point, my mouth feels awful; dry and puckered.. strange for toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m disappointed in the results I got.</li>
            <li> It was not as complicated to use as some whitening systems I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I admittedly hesitated because those awful experiences with other whitening products flooded back into my memory.</li>
            <li> My teeth have honestly never felt cleaner!</li>
            <li> I would DEF recommend anyone to at least give it try!</li>
            <li> I have been skeptical of teeth whitening products in the past.</li>
            <li> The whitening gel tasted pretty nasty.</li>
            <li> I was, however, disappointed with the taste of the toothpaste and the after taste it left when I was done brushing.</li>
            <li> I definitely wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t need to squeeze it very hard.</li>
            <li> I also tried very hard not to eat or drink anything for 30 minutes after using, although the package didn&#x27;t instruct me to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I found it very hard to understand that Step 1 has 4 oz of toothpaste and step 2 has 2.3 oz.</li>
            <li> other thing that is just plain stupid are the containers.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully, I&#x27;ll never have to use those dreadful other whitening products or paying for expensive professional whitening.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, I&#x27;ll never have to use those dreadful other whitening products or paying for expensive professional whitening.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to stick with a product that you don&#x27;t like, after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Step two has a tough job to do...</li>
            <li> BUT NO MORE!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other whitening strips in the past and found them too annoying.  </li>
            <li> process does take a little bit to get used to, and remember especially late at night when I&#x27;m sleepwalking to bed.</li>
            <li> In between the two is a little awkward; you are to spit but not rinse as you &amp;#34;load&amp;#34</li>
            <li> The steps aren&#x27;t difficult, but a little tedious, having to time yourself and remembering not to rinse in between.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did not, after a month my teeth are noticeably dull compared to before using the Crest Pro.</li>
            <li> That sticky, weird gel tape that made it hard to talk or swallow or breathe.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t hard to use, I just found it tedious to use both.</li>
            <li> The second step is a little painful, not too bad.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because it&#x27;s hard to find a teeth whitening product that actually works without uncomfortable side effects like sensitivity or bad taste.</li>
            <li> The paste has a gritty and minty consistency to it (don&#x27;t worry, it isn&#x27;t uncomfortable or painful at all) and brushes off plaque with ease and leaves a minty aftertaste.</li>
            <li> Lately I seemed to get a nasty taste in my mouth early on in the morning.</li>
            <li> kinda tastes like crap, but overall the toothpaste does what it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li> I have tired everything</li>
            <li> we are all addicted and</li>
            <li> I use a Sonicare toothbrush and am used to brushing each of my four quadrants for 30 seconds at a time, so I found myself annoyed and feeling rushed.  </li>
            <li> are not great.</li>
            <li> I also think that step 2 has a really unappealing taste.  </li>
            <li> Although I hate having to do two steps, this toothpaste system has actually changed my life.</li>
            <li> It did not even hydrate my poor puckered mouth.</li>
            <li> Then I began to notice some tooth sensitivity that I had not experienced before.  </li>
            <li> Some reviewers have mentioned pain and or burning which I have not experienced at all.  </li>
            <li> but its the HD polish tube number 2 that makes this product a game changer.</li>
            <li> but it is just annoying enough for me to bring it up.</li>
            <li> The packaging of the tubes seem to be made of a thin material (aluminum perhaps).  </li>
            <li> You have to brush your teeth twice in the morning and twice at night and when are really tired and just want to sleep - sometimes you miss your one shot toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The two steps feel slightly unnecessary, but I have to say, I like the way I feel after using it.  </li>
            <li> The 2 step process worried me a bit, I hate to add too much extra time.  </li>
            <li> are whiter and are begging me to let them in on the secret.  </li>
            <li> my own.&amp;#34;I Tryed crest HD and was not happy with product, It burnt my gums</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really experienced noticeable results with whitening toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> The taste is not great, but it is not unbearable either.  </li>
            <li> and I have not experienced any sensitivity.</li>
            <li> The 2 step process is not as inconvenient as you might think once you have done it a few times.  </li>
            <li> anyone who worries about cavities like I do knows it a game</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s kinda an annoying extra process...</li>
            <li> absolutely 100% hate the flavor of the whitening stuff!!</li>
            <li> The freshness that I feel after brushing my teeth is like something I have never experienced before.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product after using as it irritated my poor tongue and took a layer off on one side &amp; caused canker sores until i stopped using it.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like the after taste it leaves behind.</li>
            <li> I have always had issues with whitening toothpastes leaving behind a sticky glue like residue on my teeth and in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried those strips but was always annoyed by the 30 minutes I had to leave them on and the gooey taste, plus they made my gums sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I thought the whitening product was too thin.  </li>
            <li> Have never experienced that from a toothpaste before.</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference in my teeth after using this for approximately 3 days.</li>
            <li> I hate brushing my teeth, it&#x27;s such a chore - my dental hygienist can attest to that.</li>
            <li> There was no discernible difference on a day-to-day basis, but after approximately two weeks my teeth were one shade lighter when referencing the chart.</li>
            <li> I hate using the white strips because I find them messy and inconvenient.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste is a game changer.  </li>
            <li> So now after using Crest HD for approximately a month, I have had NO sensitivity issues.  </li>
            <li> on the plus side it&#x27;s not any worse either.</li>
            <li> I also had a broken front tooth as a child</li>
            <li> The swelling of my gums decreased as well over the course of 10 days.</li>
            <li> That might just be because I have thin enamel on my teeth which allows the yellower dentin to show through.</li>
            <li> Step one was really difficult to dispence, as it was extremely thick.</li>
            <li> but I have not experienced it yet.</li>
            <li> dentist said that there was approximately a 10% difference.  </li>
            <li> It is a 2 step process, which can be annoying, especially in the morning when you are tired and in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use most whitening products like trays or strips because they make me sick and a lot of the toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried just tasted nasty</li>
            <li> I will admit it was a little weird using 2 toothpaste tubes during one session, but it just makes sense!</li>
            <li> I made the mistake without knowing and it was so bad - much worse than if you drank soda after brushing your teeth with any other tooth paste.</li>
            <li> I had no interest but due to my bad habits</li>
            <li> Had to discountinue use of this product because it is EXTREMELY abrasive (step 1) and it was causing me to lose tartar on my teeth (which my dentist said is a bad thing).</li>
            <li> The one other bad is that I use an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> The mint taste is subtle without tasting too fake.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt seriously cleaner than they ever have using the Crest Pro Health HD system!</li>
            <li> Seriously, it rivals a dentist cleaning!</li>
            <li> You should seriously consider removing your products from your smoking area!  </li>
            <li> It was a little unpleasant but bearable.</li>
            <li> is flavorful enough to not notice the taste of step 2 which is very unpleasant if used alone.</li>
            <li> Usually they were time consuming (sometimes up to 30 minutes at a time), awkward to use, and the results were never noticeable for the time and effort involved.  </li>
            <li> I hate having to do something for a long period of time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week and have seen dramatic results.</li>
            <li> I have a permanent cap on one of my front teeth that was done almost 15 years ago, while the color change of the surrounding teeth has not been dramatic over the years, I&#x27;ve become a fan of coffee and tea in that time, so there is a bit of discoloration from those dietary habits.</li>
            <li> notice a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I haven&#x27;t noticed a dramatic change in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how dramatic the whitening is</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health® HD is expensive, product doesn&#x27;t last long,is annoying in the morning but does control plaque, may whiten teeth and makes you feel proactive about your oral hygiene in between dentist visits.</li>
            <li> Second, it didn&#x27;t taste that bad!</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical of whitening agents because I have some exposed enamel due to a receding gum line - any whitening agent is usually extremely painful.</li>
            <li> This 2-step process is not as cumbersome as I expected, tho ran out of toothpaste before the gel which is annoying.  </li>
            <li> I tried professional bleach, and my teeth began to hurt terribly.  </li>
            <li> But alas, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that I am not happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the teeth whitening strips out there only to find that with my receding gum lines, I tend to find these strips very painful almost immediately.</li>
            <li> The past few times I tried Crest products, they had terrible flavors (either too minty that my mouth burned, or too weak so that it tasted like baking soda).</li>
            <li> I have always hated the baking soda and peroxide toothpastes that left a weird after taste in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed and found this paste to just be average.</li>
            <li> SERIOUS cold burn happens, although after a couple days you get used to it.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Well, unfortunately I had to cut my trial short as those spots eventually became very painful, irritated</li>
            <li> And upon waking, &amp;#34;morning breath&amp;#34; did not seem as bad as usual.  </li>
            <li> I logged into Amazon to buy some and was disappointed to see it was not available.  </li>
            <li> They usually (and quite painfully) have to scrape my teeth when I go in for a cleaning.</li>
            <li> I thought that the 2 step process would be annoying and not worth the effort.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to paint something on your teeth or stick on those little strips that make your gums feel weird, this is your answer!!</li>
            <li> but it was a little bit annoying to have to use two tubes at each brushing.</li>
            <li> and I always get negative feedback from my dentist on how badly my teeth are getting stained.</li>
            <li> but I was still somewhat skeptical as well.</li>
            <li> I never had a two step toothpaste before, so I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Even at $12, it&#x27;s too expensive for me to use all the time.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about having to add another step to my oral care routine</li>
            <li> I may be addicted!</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost a gritty feel afterwards and the taste is awful.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical it would work and that I would see a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I won&#x27;t find out how well it will whiten.</li>
            <li> but it might be cheaper than purchasing the really expensive whitening strips.</li>
            <li> I will admit that I was skeptical...</li>
            <li> To the point that I randomly notice in the mirror if I am just in a bathroom washing my hands.</li>
            <li> And unfortunately the flavor stuck around after I finished my 1 minute of brushing and</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical of my willingness to brush twice each time.  </li>
            <li> but it also felt uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I would always get the strips twisted, not put on correctly, or wouldn’t remember to put them on until I was out the door</li>
            <li> I would always get the strips twisted, not put on correctly, or wouldn’t remember to put them on until I was out the door</li>
            <li> It seemed weird to me, to have to brush my teeth in two steps.</li>
            <li> Because of this I unfortunately will not be recommending this to anyone or continuing to use it.</li>
            <li> , I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> It made it difficult to close without cleaning the opening where the paste exits.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Somewhat expensive (but all whitening products are)&lt;br</li>
            <li> So needless to say</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about having to use two steps to brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li> in all I am not impressed.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a sad fact I learned about myself from trying this toothpaste:</li>
            <li> I was wrong on both counts.</li>
            <li> Not impressed by this tooth paste.</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time with the taste.  </li>
            <li> I remember using a white strip after a dental exam and the pain was awful.</li>
            <li> This has proven difficult after years of coffee drinking.</li>
            <li> This system takes away the uncomfortable whitening gel trays that ooze gel all over your mouth, or the strips that are supposed to stay on for what feels like an eternity.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the claims of it working in 6 days.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t have any plaque build up behind my bottom teeth at all!</li>
            <li> It caused my teeth and gums to hurt a lot, and I couldn&#x27;t stand it, so unfortunately I needed to stop using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> Wrong.  </li>
            <li> and I can have another cup without feeling too guilty about</li>
            <li> , the pleasantness was undone with a weird chemical taste from the Perfecting Gel.  </li>
            <li> I only used it three times because the taste of step 2 was so horrible.</li>
            <li> The second step was terrible.  </li>
            <li> Ill explain why.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was a bit difficult for me to remember.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have a sensitivity or a chipped tooth like I do, it will be a bit uncomfortable in that area.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the record as being skeptical when it comes to a lot of dental hygiene product&#x27;s whitening claims.</li>
            <li> There is a different after taste that takes some getting used to but nothing terrible you can&#x27;t handle.</li>
            <li> just makes having to add the second toothpaste annoying!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, it&#x27;s not a product I will plan to purchase.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I am afraid that I will invest a bunch of money into something that will not work, or even worse...</li>
            <li> I brush my teeth before I leave the house for work, but after I have my morning coffee, I would always have that taste in my mouth and that weird film on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t deal with it, so I unfortunately won&#x27;t be using the toothpaste (step 1) again.</li>
            <li> but i was so wrong.</li>
            <li> I am also extremely skeptical about a toothpaste (or &#x27;system&#x27;) that makes teeth whiter.</li>
            <li> The two step process does become tedious and I often rinsed after step one when instructions said to rinse after step two.</li>
            <li> use a Sonicare toothbrush, and unfortunately mine does not have the feature that beeps every 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Step 2 does have a weird smell</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong,  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical because the 2-step brushing process seemed like a hassle.</li>
            <li> Would it taste weird?  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> So this may seem weird</li>
            <li> It is a bit weird to have two separate products to use while brushing my teething, but that is the nature of this product.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about having to use two tubes for one brushing session.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the claims of this product but tried it out as I received it through a brand promotion.</li>
            <li> I did have to brush my teeth with my regular toothpaste afterwords, because the taste in my mouth was so horrible</li>
            <li> but I was so wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, you&#x27;re not allowed to rinse just yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2, the perfecting gel is meant to polish and whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that didn&#x27;t happen for me.  </li>
            <li> Not as difficult at it</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product when I recieved it through a promotional trial.  </li>
            <li> Only used it once, the taste of step 2 was so horrible</li>
            <li> The second step is a watery gel and tastes awful!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have not seen the results of the claims of 6x whiter</li>
            <li> I was skeptical and didn&#x27;t want to pay the $, so she brought me some on her visit.  </li>
            <li> This is almost scary to think about using twice a day every day because of how well the abrasive qualities seem to work.  </li>
            <li> but some times when you are in a hurry the two minutes can be tedious.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when I received a</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to sample this product via BzzAgent, and I must say I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> I used regular toothpaste yesterday, and hated it!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it has not helped in this matter.  </li>
            <li> The step to whitening has a weird taste.</li>
            <li> For me, unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t quite work out.</li>
            <li> however I was wrong.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Pro Health HD toothpaste has made brushing my teeth a pampering ritual (and I don&#x27;t feel so guilty about not flossing).  </li>
            <li> So sad I didn&#x27;t take a before picture.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> It’s also expensive for toothpaste</li>
            <li> Some people say it&#x27;s expensive for toothpaste</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I, too, was a bit skeptical of this product after receiving it as part of a promotional event.</li>
            <li> but I am always skeptical.</li>
            <li> So, I was a bit skeptical about trying a two step toothpaste, it could be twice as bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this 2-step whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> on a couple of occasions where I&#x27;ve been very tired, I&#x27;ve accidentally skipped Step 2 altogether.&lt;br</li>
            <li> on a couple of occasions where I&#x27;ve been very tired, I&#x27;ve accidentally skipped Step 2 altogether.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Which by the way, that bitter taste that espresso leaves behind..... GONE!!!!</li>
            <li> I will say, I have had poor experiences in the past with Crest whitening products tasting awful.  </li>
            <li> It would peel off in thick layers and leave my mouth bloody and sore.</li>
            <li> For me, I found it awkward because I use an electric toothbrush which automatically turns on for 2 minutes of brushing so to pause the toothbrush halfway through it&#x27;s interval is a bit weird.</li>
            <li> Nothing too bad, but I hate a messy toothpaste</li>
            <li> While the base of my teeth got whiter and whiter, the ends turned almost translucent, which was not a good look.  </li>
            <li> down side to this is this leaves a terrible film in you mouth.</li>
            <li> my breath and teeth feel a little nasty even after chewing gum.</li>
            <li> I can tell my mouth is cleaner because when I get done brushing and rinse with cold water it tingles the inside of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tingly and cold feeling, and leaves your gums throbbing in</li>
            <li> Step two was tasteless to me.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s crazy.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid that this product will do it faster.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically hydrogen peroxide in a gel suspension with artificial sweetener added.  </li>
            <li> however I did experience sensitivity in my teeth to cold water/food.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried strips before which I found to be cumbersome and inconvenient.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid that this whitening method would aggravate the sensitivity issue</li>
            <li> and it is awkward having to turn the toothbrush off to add Step 2</li>
            <li> I was afraid that the 2 steps would take longer than I wanted, but that wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li> I am afraid that I will run out of Step 2 before I finish Step 1.</li>
            <li> $20+ for toothpaste is kinda crazy.</li>
            <li> and I was afraid that this system would cause pain in my teeth.</li>
            <li> You can use the tooth whitening system the way that you use your toothpaste or gel - and I like that it does not foam like crazy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been afraid to try whitening strips because I have some tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a bit inconvenient to have two containers.  </li>
            <li> but I found it to be quite tasteless.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about.  </li>
            <li> teeth plaque like crazy</li>
            <li> About 2 weeks into using Crest Pro Health HD, I started having a numb feeling along the front edge of my tongue.  </li>
            <li> , from what i have come to understand  Step 2 is basically hydrogen peroxide in a gel form with artificial sweetener added.</li>
            <li> It is also painless and doesn&#x27;t require sitting around with strips for 20 minutes awkwardly waiting for the whitening reaction to take place.</li>
            <li> However after 2 weeks of using this paste just once a day and using my sensitivity toothpaste once a day I found my sensitivity to cold had increased substantially.</li>
            <li> When I would breath in through my mouth, it would feel so cold that it would almost hurt.</li>
            <li> (crazy huh???)</li>
            <li> My teeth do not feel as furry or dirty all day (or in the morning)</li>
            <li> I had been unhappy with the color of my teeth for some time and had considered buying a product when I was invited to the Crest Pro Health® HD™ bzz campaign.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t manage the stupidity of it all for longer than two weeks.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel as awkward at smiling after having coffee or tea.  </li>
            <li> It drys out your mouth like crazy.</li>
            <li> They feel the way they do when I leave the dentist office after having them scraped and polished...which is very painful (at least for me anyway).  </li>
            <li> and I am just obsessed with making my teeth whiter always!</li>
            <li> you will NOT be sorry!</li>
            <li> I was WRONG!</li>
            <li> and I am a teeth obsessed!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a horrible product but don&#x27;t be disappointed if the results aren&#x27;t as extreme as advertised.</li>
            <li> Well, I was wrong!</li>
            <li> I WAS WRONG!  </li>
            <li> but I was wrong!</li>
            <li> (sorry Mom!).</li>
            <li> I do believe that Crest has made me a believer in teeth whitening without the uncomfortable sensitivity...!</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> No longer am I skeptical!</li>
            <li> My breath doesn&#x27;t  feel as horrible in the morning, either, which meant that germs were being killed, as it is the plaque which causes bad breath.</li>
            <li> but the flavor isn&#x27;t unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> that I wasn&#x27;t used to, but it wasn&#x27;t unpleasant.</li>
            <li> and that was unpleasant.</li>
            <li> it covers up any unpleasant taste.</li>
            <li> The Step 2 product isn&#x27;t bad... just like a tasteless gel.</li>
            <li> Instead I noticed an unpleasant peroxide flavored aftertaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received this from Bzzagent to test, and I was very skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Whitening kits are expensive, and sometimes I HATE them.  </li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The lid has to be twisted off and if not done before brushing begins it can be annoying to twist it off and find a place to sit it.  </li>
            <li> I hate having to do two steps, and if you don&#x27;t use the gel the tooth paste makes your mouth feel weird.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always very skeptical of anything that whitens teeth.</li>
            <li> and I had no issues with sensitivity!&lt;br /&gt;Considering how expensive and annoying the strips are</li>
            <li> I am always very skeptical of whitening products.</li>
            <li> It was very uncomfortable and took some time to get used to.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this was done as it makes opening and closing with one hand very difficult.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of the whitening process.</li>
            <li> bad-</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t taste bad</li>
            <li> In the morning my breath isn&#x27;t nearly as bad.  </li>
            <li> It does not have a bad flavor.  </li>
            <li> They hurt so bad that the pain would make me feel like I could pass out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The flavor isn&#x27;t bad for the toothpaste and the whitening step just tastes like peroxide.</li>
            <li> My breath is bad, my teeth have visible cavities, and my wisdom teeth have erupted and started to decay.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like talking one on one to people because I know my breath is bad.</li>
            <li> Maybe because my teeth weren&#x27;t so bad to begin with?</li>
            <li> I probably wouldnt go out of my way to buy this product, but I have nothing bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> What I can&#x27;t deal with is anything leaving a bad taste in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I do wish  that there was a way that it could become a one step process, but two steps is not that bad for the results that you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it did so at the cost of bad gum irritation which made me stop using the product althogther.</li>
            <li> and it didn’t leave any sort of bad aftertaste or grittiness.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I have both used it and from what we have figured is that the polish tastes bad and</li>
            <li> I noticed that my teeth were about 1/2 shade lighter which isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> The taste of the peroxide step isn&#x27;t too bad either.</li>
            <li> It leaves a bad taste in your mouth afterward, too.</li>
            <li> Now for the bad.  </li>
            <li> each tube.&lt;br /&gt;Neither tube has a bad taste either.</li>
            <li> Fights bad breath</li>
            <li> The smell wasn’t bad.</li>
            <li> I also have a bad gag reflex</li>
            <li> Now the bad...</li>
            <li> The step 2 perfecting gel has a bad taste to it.</li>
            <li> It strips all the bad stuff away and preps your teeth for Step 2 by leaving some of the baking soda in your mouth.</li>
            <li> It strips all the bad stuff away and preps your teeth for Step 2 by leaving some of the baking soda in your mouth.</li>
            <li> and I asked him to look at my teeth discoloration (which wasn&#x27;t all that bad).  </li>
            <li> Once I got used to the process it wasn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> I get bad &#x27;morning breath&#x27; and this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t help with that at all.</li>
            <li> If I had been prepared for the taste, it wouldn&#x27;t have been so bad-</li>
            <li> It has some drawbacks but none that are too bad.</li>
            <li> It has some drawbacks but none that are too bad.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health HD doesn&#x27;t taste bad, and does what it says in regards to whitening my teeth.</li>
            <li> was a bit painful</li>
            <li> so I was shocked that he noticed a change in my teeth.</li>
            <li> Maybe like a disgusting cough syrup, but worse</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used whitening strips and applications before and the taste is always atrocious, but the purifying cleanser isn&#x27;t bad at all.  </li>
            <li> I was cursed with poor gums and am prone to awful gingivitis if I skip brushing my teeth for even one night.</li>
            <li> What shocked me is my teeth</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that this product did not even come close.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you if you try this you will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t even see the difference. :(</li>
            <li> If I was not given this sample, and had to buy it, I would have been quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> Try it and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> Get it - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed but figured I needed to just use the product longer.  </li>
            <li> But, I am disappointed to say it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Toothpaste is very bad, let me brush very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This is probably why step 2 tastes terrible (as sucralose and aspertame in yogurts and other foods often tastes nasty to me), no clue why step 1 tastes nasty.  </li>
            <li> If you are at all skeptical about this product just take my word for it!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just stupid</li>
            <li> I hate the tooth sensitivity that they give me</li>
            <li> i was worried it would be annoying</li>
            <li> (and they hate brushing).  </li>
            <li> but I hate the whitening strips-</li>
            <li> I did find it to be annoying at times, to brush one minute then reapply and brush another minute</li>
            <li> Must easier to brush your teeth for two minutes (1 minute per step) than annoying whitening strips or trays&lt;</li>
            <li> I also HATE that you can&#x27;t rinse between step 1 and 2.  </li>
            <li> is really annoying with an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It just gets a bit annoying doing that every day, twice a day.</li>
            <li> I hate to say,</li>
            <li> It comes in a cardboard base with a slot for each tube.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t nearly as annoying as I thought it would be, brushing my teeth &amp;#34;twice&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Biggest think I hate about this</li>
            <li> ; it taste like a whitening strip (which I hate).</li>
            <li> I am a 2-3 cup a day coffee drinker, and so my teeth always have that dark-ish off-white tinge to them that I hate.  </li>
            <li> I used to hate whitening because of the pain it would cause my gums.</li>
            <li> So call me doubtful as I began my test with this product.</li>
            <li> Blech.</li>
            <li> And the step 2 polish tastes like celery, which I absolutely hate.</li>
            <li> tastes kinda bad, but it works!</li>
            <li> They do what they say on the box, they whiten AND get rid of bad breath!</li>
            <li> Brushing twice will probably increase the amount of time you spend brushing, and that can&#x27;t be a bad thing!</li>
            <li> I was shocked!</li>
            <li> I hated the whitening strips I used to use.</li>
            <li> Halfway through I hated it and was about to toss out, since it had been given to me to try...</li>
            <li> I hated the tasted.</li>
            <li> I hated the taste.  </li>
            <li> but I hated wearing them.  </li>
            <li> I always hated when it was that time again to whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> But I hated sitting around for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Do yourself and your teeth a favor, give crest Pro-health HD a try, you and your teeth will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I can not say that our teeth are terribly stained but we had hoped to get some degree of whitening from this product.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have that awful sensitivity like I do from the whitening strips.  </li>
            <li> It does however make soda taste AWFUL if you drink it after brushing your teeth ever.  </li>
            <li> I feel the need to keep mints close and use mouthwash before and after brushing because the taste is awful</li>
            <li> the 3 worst things for staining your teeth.</li>
            <li> The Step 2 also tastes terrible if you accidentally rinse out your mouth from Step 1 before you start.  </li>
            <li> The Step 2 also tastes terrible if you accidentally rinse out your mouth from Step 1 before you start.  </li>
            <li> Give it a try - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> I have never used a teeth whitening product before, as I was told they just taste nasty.</li>
            <li> and I was unable to brush my teeth for 2 days !!!!</li>
            <li> If you have tried whitening strips and had horrible sensitivity as a result this product is for you.</li>
            <li> I also could be imagining things, but I haven&#x27;t woken up with terrible morning breath which I would assume could be attributed to the cleaning powers of step 1.  </li>
            <li> The 30 minutes after brushing my teeth, I had that nasty layer of skin peeling off from inside my mouth.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s going to taste horrible, or 3)</li>
            <li> packaging is very annoying.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste tastes really nasty.</li>
            <li> I detest the taste of peroxide to the point that I lived with my yellowing teeth for the sake of never having to use those awful whitening trays.</li>
            <li> It tastes horrible!</li>
            <li> The price in relation to the amount of product you get is outrageous in my opinion even with 2 tubes.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Definitely makes your teeth feel cleaner, and there is a noticeable difference as far as whitening. The two-step process isn&#x27;t time consuming at all, takes almost the same amount of time to be honest. I&#x27;m not seeing any extreme difference but it&#x27;s pretty good. Worth the $12 I paid.</li>
            <li> Only used a few days and have already noticed a difference. Cant wait to see how much more white they become. I did have to switch to a sensitive tooth brush instead of soft as the product does tend to cause tender gums</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. My teeth are just as white as before I used this product (a month straight). But this does give me a clean feeling.</li>
            <li> As a person with sensitive teeth I was wary of trying another product other than my usual sensodine. But there was a coupon and this product only cost me 8 bucks so I figured might as well! I have used this for six days and so far, I haven&#x27;t noticed a sensitivity issue!! And I have noticed my teeth are getting whiter!!! I think I have found my new tooth paste!</li>
            <li> only used a few times. my teeth did not feel clean any of those times.</li>
            <li> Lies!  I don&#x27;t see any difference in my teeth.  They want you to spend so much money on a product that doesn&#x27;t do what it says it should.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great product and delivered very fast.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. The minty toothpaste is very refreshing!. Simply brush with the step one toothpaste for about a minute, spit, no rinse, then proceed to brush for an additional minute with the step two whitening gel. Leaves your teeth feeling clean and smooth, your breath very nice and refreshing, and whitens your teeth to boot. Love it!</li>
            <li> I really like this two step toothpaste. Step 1 leaves your teeth feeling super clean, and Step 2 helps lift and remove stains.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it works as good as their high end whitestrips, but it does remove surface stains.  I&#x27;ve been using Invisalign for the last year which creates stains on my teeth faster than usual, so this toothpaste has been awesome at preventing that. I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s get one thing straight: it&#x27;s not a whitening toothpaste. With that being said, this is one of the most expensive and yet worth every penny toothpastes you&#x27;ll ever use! After the first brush my mouth felt great. It actually felt post dental cleaning but not sore clean. And I&#x27;ve been using it for weeks, two weeks straight and then 3x /week night and day WITH A WHITENING TOOTHPASTE and I have noticed a difference in my gums but also in how my teeth just feel better. You will get a more naturally white look from this alone, but if you want pearly whites, use the other whitening products also. But I cannot stress enough how healthy your mouth will feel.</li>
            <li> I liked this product to the point where I purchased another box at Walmart. OK, but 6x whiter? I think that&#x27;s a statement that is relative to the consumer but to me? Nope, it did not make my teeth 6x whiter but my teeth are white already and I am just obsessed with making my teeth whiter always! I think this is a great maintenance product for your teeth. Actually, I do not know what 6x whiter would look like! I think your teeth would be glowing!!</li>
            <li> I bought this at CVS for the same price it is listed on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste: Step 1 tastes just like any blue gel Crest formula I&#x27;ve used in the past.  Step 2: a barely noticeable taste, somewhat like baking soda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness: I could tell a difference after the third use.  I&#x27;ve had it for about two weeks now and there was no color guide in it so I can&#x27;t tell you how many shades whiter my teeth are, but the results are ok, not fabulous and I really doubt it&#x27;s six shades.  However the product works better than cheaper &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; toothpastes. I also feel like my mouth, gums and teeth are cleaner, not just whitened.  They feel very slippery&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Side effects: With continued use, my teeth are becoming sore, as are my gums.  And to be clear, I do not have sensitive teeth.  I plan to discontinue using daily and will probably only use it every 3-4 days. Also, I cannot use any mouthwash after brushing (which is a huge negative for me) because the sensitivity is killer.  I also find myself rinsing a lot more to get the product out of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final thoughts: Effective, yes, but with side effects.</li>
            <li> tastes kinda bad, but it works!</li>
            <li> The first time I used the product, step 2 left an after taste, but maybe I just used too much. I can really tell a difference in the whiteness of my teeth. I think my dentist will be pleasantly surprised:)</li>
            <li> I found that my teeth sparkled from the very first use. Even though they couldn&#x27;t have been whitened with one brushing, they sparkled so much that they looked whiter. This product is easy to use, it&#x27;s not hard to brush one minute with each tube. My mouth feels fresh and the great clean feel lasts all day. At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure about the taste, but I like it and I will never go back to plain toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste and Polish have a pleasant taste but it&#x27;s quite strong and it did cause irritation at my gum line. My gums had small ulcer like sores a couple of hours after use. They went away after a few days.  I do have sensitive teeth and gums though.  I did notice that my teeth feel cleaner and they are whiter than they were before. My mouth feels fresh and clean when I wake up in the morning. No more &#x27;fuzzy&#x27; teeth.</li>
            <li> This 2-step process is not as cumbersome as I expected, tho ran out of toothpaste before the gel which is annoying.  I noticed a slight lightening of coffee/wine staining within the first couple of days but since then no improvement. Product is pleasant-tasting and left my teeth feeling smooth and clean. Would have rated higher except whitening effect not as good as expected.</li>
            <li> so refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product from bzzz agent i opened it immediately as soon as i brushed my teeth i felt like i left the dentist office. My gums felt fresh and clean and my teeth looked great, A must try product</li>
            <li> I am not sure that this toothpaste gets teeth 6x whiter but I did notice my teeth were whiter after the first day. I pay greater attention to the time I spend brushing because of the two-step process. My teeth feel cleaner and my mouth feels fresher after each brushing. The freshness stays with me for a very long time. Despite the higher price I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of crest pro health hd through Buzzagent. Denial health is very important to me. I am prone to cavities. I also drink coffee so I use different whitening products on my teeth. This system is really easy to follow and works very well. You start with step one for one minute then step two for one minute. This toothpaste leaves your mouth feeling very clean. Almost like you just went to the dentist. I like that it could also replace other whitening products so it will end up being cheaper in the long run. I like the minty taste of step one. Step two doesn&#x27;t taste as good but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> I got to try Crest Pro Health HD as part of a bzz campaign. I love this product! It is easy to use and does not require any more time than a regular toothpaste but the effects are phenomenal. I love the fact that it makes your mouth healthy and beautiful at the same time.</li>
            <li> I have just started to use this product, so I am still indecisive as to how well it really works. But I will say that it is by far the easiest, simplest, most straightforward teeth whitening system that I have ever used! It is a 2-step process that starts with you first cleaning your teeth with the toothpaste (step 1) and then, without rinsing your mouth, you brush on the second substance, which is the whitening step. You are supposed to brush with each product for one minute. They recommend doing this twice a day. It doesn&#x27;t taste gross. It doesn&#x27;t take long. It&#x27;s seems like a very smart way to make a reasonable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have been a Crest fan since I was a child.  I have completed day one of using Crest Pro Health HD, and I immediately saw and felt results.  My mouth was tingly and refreshed.  I was a smoker for many years, so I have had plenty of experience with whitening products.  After just one day, I could already see a difference!! Some whiteners can hurt your mouth, but not this one!  Crest has a great reputation, and are known for producing good products.  I am so pleased they came out with this new product, and I can&#x27;t wait to see my smile in a week!  Will follow up with pics soon!!</li>
            <li> Love it 2 steps is easy to do. It actually keeps your mouth clean and I believe it has a plaque blocker because I can&#x27;t feel plaque after eating all day. It making my teeth whiter I been using it for 1 week with lovely results.  Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed one thing thou it taste weird the first few times</li>
            <li> This product is an absolute life changer. I recieved this product to test and at first I was hesitant of the 2 step process, thinking I don&#x27;t want to add any extra steps to my routine but after seeing and feeling the almost immediate results, I don&#x27;t mind a bit. And honestly it&#x27;s not even that much extra work. You brush with step 1 for a minute, spit but not rinse, and then step 2 for a minute. 2 minutes and you will instantly have a brighter smile! I actually enjoy brushing my teeth every morning and night now because I get to see results and my teeth have never felt so clea. Highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I got to try this toothpaste kit through BzzzAgent and I was so excited!!! I love white teeth, fresh breath, and clean feeling mouths. The first part is a regular toothpaste it seems except with more scrubbing power. You use it for 1 minute and then add the 2nd step- it is more of a gel- I assume for whitening and disinfecting. It bubbles in your mouth like hydrogen peroxide and makes your teeth squeaky clean. Only available on amazon and at CVS right now but you can bet I am going to go and buy it as soon as this runs out. It is a tad on the expensive side compared to regular toothpaste- but the difference in how your teeth feel is pretty incredible.</li>
            <li> The 2-step process of Crest Pro-Health HD is exactly what I needed. I must admit- my brushing habit tends to be quick in the morning. However, Crest Pro-Health HD two-product system encourages me to brush longer than I  normally would. I don&#x27;t mind this and it is quite enjoyable. It&#x27;s great for my teeth and gums. In the first step, you use is the Purifying Cleanser which I would desribe as your typical minty toothpaste. It tastes great! The second step requires to immediately use the Perfecting Gel. This product doesn&#x27;t really have a taste; the formulation of this is so light that it feels like I&#x27;m brushing my teeth with no product but it does help with a better-looking smile. Most importantly my teeth and gums feel and look clean afterwards. I am so happy I was able to try out this product for free, thanks to Crest. If you looking for a method to enhance your brushing habit that I highly recommend this - it&#x27;s definitely worth a shot. I really believe Crest Pro-Health HD makes my smile better. I&#x27;m ready to show it off in high definition!</li>
            <li> I tried the Crest Pro Health HD system by Crest in return for a review and was hoping for the best as I&#x27;ve always had issues getting my teeth white (years of drinking coffee). The good news is, my teeth did get whiter, but how the toothpaste and gel made my mouth feel left me not wanting to continue use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first step left my mouth seeming really dry. Granted you&#x27;re following it up with the next step but my mouth almost felt too dry to me. Then came the second step and the gel was very odd feeling in my mouth. It kind of felt like I loaded my mouth with Orajel (minus the numbness factor). The gel also left an aftertaste in my mouth that I didn&#x27;t necessarily prefer.</li>
            <li> First off, let me say I was pretty skeptical about a product that wanted me to brush once and then brush again, but I&#x27;m very happy that I had the opportunity to try this sample from Bzzagent. I went into this not expecting a lot from this product and a few days into it, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step-1 of this process is exactly like any other tube of crest toothpaste, it has the same flavor, the same feel and likely the same result. It has that sort of gritty toothpaste texture, but in a refreshingly decent tasting way. Step-2 is where I started to question the process. This tube doesn&#x27;t have the most pleasurable taste at all and it doesn&#x27;t feel like your brushing with anything other than water, but with a not so pleasing taste. I would have stopped using this after the second day if I didn&#x27;t feel like it was actually protecting my teeth a little better than just using regular toothpaste. When I&#x27;d use any other toothpaste, as the day went on, I&#x27;d end up feeling a sort of film on my teeth from lunch and snaking during the day. I don&#x27;t get that feeling with this 2-step process. My teeth feel smooth, just like how they feel after leaving from a dental appointment. It&#x27;s like Step-2 added an invisible, magical force field to my teeth to repel any and all build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am willing to keep using this, just for that magical force field alone. Add on top of that, the whitening ability to this kit and I&#x27;m in a happy spot. I would easily give this 5 stars, if the taste of Step-2 was a little more pleasing. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that&#x27;s willing to give it a try. It does everything that it claims it can do.</li>
            <li> The first step reminds me a lot of Pepsodent.  Since you apply the second step fairly quickly the two step process does not seem as involved as it might sound.  After almost a week I do notice some whitening but not 6x.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I changed my review to 5 stars from 4 stars.  After the second week I really started to notice results.  I followed the instructions, twice a day, a minute brushing with each step.  I really works.  Will be getting it again.  Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I received the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two Step Toothpaste as part of a buzz kit and I love it!  There are two steps, you first brush with the toothpaste and then the polishing paste.  My teeth have never felt so clean!  I will be purchasing this product instead of my usual toothpaste from now on.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical to try Crest Pro Health® HD™.  I have tried every whitening toothpaste and product available.  They either only focus on whitening and your teeth don&#x27;t feel so clean or they are so harsh that they leave your teeth so sensitive.  I was intrigued that the Crest Pro Health® HD™ included two tubes; one to focus on cleaning, removing both plaque and gingivitis and the other is for whitening and polishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the instructions, brushing with the purifying cleanser first - the taste is good, very similar to other Crest Pro Health® toothpastes.  The instructions say to spit but not to rinse before applying the perfecting gel.  I do not rinse my mouth but I do rinse my toothbrush to apply the perfecting gel.  Be careful with this stuff - a little goes a long way!  All you need is a very small dab of this stuff to work.  It tastes a lot like the stuff that&#x27;s on a Crest WhiteStrip, so definitely not the greatest taste in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are the whitest cleanest feeling teeth I have had in a long time.  Running my tongue over my teeth, they feel so smooth and clean and looking in the mirror - SO WHITE!  2 minutes of brushing my teeth has whitened better than any other toothpaste I have ever used.  I have continued to use this product for a little over a week now and the whiteness hasn&#x27;t worn off, it just keeps getting better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky enough to receive this product for free from Crest.  Although I did not pay for this product my review is completely my own thoughts and opinions.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is by far my favorite.  After every brush I feel like I just left the dentist and only after one week I could already see a whiter smile. LOVE this product and thanks to Crest for letting me try this product for FREE!</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product free thanks to Crest and I am so thankful to have had the opportunity.  It is amazing!  The results are no joke.  I have been using it for a week and my teeth are noticeably whiter and my mouth feels cleaner.  I can tell my mouth is cleaner because when I get done brushing and rinse with cold water it tingles the inside of my mouth.  Similar to how it feels after you&#x27;ve just used a powerful mouthwash.  My one complaint is the length of time it takes to use.  You have to brush for 2 minutes morning and night.  I know this doesn&#x27;t seem like a long time, but normally at night I&#x27;m exhausted after chasing my toddlers around all day.  I pick myself up off the couch, drag myself upstairs and just want to quickly brush my teeth before falling fast asleep.  Standing in front of the mirror for a 2 step process of brushing is the last thing I want to do.  That being said however, the results are totally worth it.  Looks like I&#x27;ll have to drag myself upstairs just a few minutes earlier.  :)  Thanks Crest!</li>
            <li> I have tried many teeth whitening products over the years, but never stuck with any of them.  Usually they were time consuming (sometimes up to 30 minutes at a time), awkward to use, and the results were never noticeable for the time and effort involved.  I soon gave up.&lt;br /&gt;If I had not received the free trial of Crest -Pro Health HD through BzzAgent I probably would have never tried another whitener again and that would have been my loss!&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this product.  It does take a little extra time to brush each day, but the time and process is SO simple and easy.  Not to mention, how it makes my teeth feel like I just came from the dentist.  I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a little over a week and family members have noticed a difference.  At first, I didn&#x27;t tell anyone that I was using something new so I can see if there was a reaction.  The fact they did notice was very exciting!  I quickly filled them in on Crest Pro-Health HD and  couple of them ran right out to get their own.&lt;br /&gt;This is a process I will definitely stick with over time.</li>
            <li> I was lucky to receive this toothpaste for free from Crest as a BzzAgent. I will never go back to my other toothpaste. This works great and I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference after 4 days of using twice a day. The 2-step process is super easy. I personally don&#x27;t think the 2nd step tastes very good, but it&#x27;s not awful either. It just leaves a yucky taste in my mouth afterwards. But worth it because I love my whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> As a once a day, HUGE cup of hot tea drinker, as I inch towards 50, I have noticed that the tea stains are starting to remain on my once white teeth! I&#x27;ve tried all the teeth whitening strips out there only to find that with my receding gum lines, I tend to find these strips very painful almost immediately. So as a Bzz agent, when the opportunity arose for me to try Crest&#x27;s new Pro Heath HD 2 step toothpaste program, I jumped at it but I was still somewhat skeptical as well. Any toothpaste that promises to whiten your teeth usually is a false claim from past experience. This system is, as it states, a 2 step program. It does require that you brush your teeth for 1 full minute with each step which for most people is probably more than they&#x27;re used to brushing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the very first use, I was pleasantly surprised at how clean my teeth felt! I&#x27;ve used Crest toothpaste off and on for my of my life. That means I&#x27;ve also used other brands. Not once has ANY of the toothpastes I&#x27;ve used ever gotten my teeth as clean feeling as this 2 step program did. I was very, very impressed with step 1. Then I moved on to step 2 which is the whitening step. Of course, I didn&#x27;t notice anything different in color immediately but at the end of a week, I did notice the tea stains mostly gone from my teeth. On day 2, I noticed that when I went to apply step 2, the area where my gums have a tendency to recede (from years of over brushing!) was a bit painful but I learned if I started that step on the other side of my mouth and worked my way over to that side and it no longer hurt. If I put the paste direcly on the receding gums, that&#x27;s when  it hurt. Other than that, I had no issues with this program and have nothing but good things to say about it. I can only recommend it for everyone to try!</li>
            <li> When I first received my sample of this two step toothpaste from BzzAgent, I must admit I was more than a little skeptical that 1. It would actually whiten my teeth and 2. I would be able to keep up this 2 step process for more than a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step one - for me, it seems akin to every other minty toothpaste out there - same refreshing taste, same clean feeling after. Definitely does the job of a toothpaste. So far, so good. Step two: at first, I was thinking, this is going to get old really quick. Who has time to brush with 2 different products? Especially when I&#x27;m rushing to get off to work in the morning, or when I&#x27;m super tired after a long day of work and then getting the kids to bed. No way would I be able to keep this up. I started off determined to try it for a few days to see if it made a difference, with the intention of cutting out the second step after I could determine if it whitened or not just as a time saver. After over a week of brushing morning and night with both Step one and two, I can confidently say that it really does work. My teeth are definitely whiter. Even better - it really wasn&#x27;t hard to adjust my routine to include both steps. I&#x27;ve been able to keep it up all week without a problem and plan on keeping it up since it has been so easy.&lt;br /&gt;And as a plus, it has helped reduce the gingival inflammation I&#x27;ve had since my last pregnancy, which means no more bleeding gums!&lt;br /&gt;I do have to mention, that the hydrogen peroxide in Step 2 can make it a little abrasive. At first, I noticed actually more irritation and bleeding to my gums - but quickly learned it was because I was brushing too hard with it. (I&#x27;ve always been overzealous with brushing my teeth, which is my brushes look frayed after only a couple of months). As soon as I figured this out though, I&#x27;ve been able to adjust by brushing more lightly and carefully - I actually pay attention to what I&#x27;m doing while I&#x27;m brushing my teeth now instead of doing it automatically while thinking of a thousand other things. I think in the long run, this product has re-trained my to brush my teeth in a healthier way and will save the life of my toothbrushes, or at least help them to last a little longer. Thanks Crest!y while thinking of a thousand other things. I think in the long run, this product has re-trained my to brush my teeth in a healthier way and will save the life of my toothbrushes, or at least help them to last a little longer. Thanks Crest!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this 2 part kit since I received it about a week ago, and I&#x27;ve found the taste for part one to be pleasant. It&#x27;s much like regular toothpaste, leaving my mouth feeling clean. It&#x27;s when the second part comes into play that it gets a bit odd. I understand this is the whitening part, and perhaps I&#x27;m just sensitive to this taste, but it&#x27;s a clear gel peroxide that just feels both uncomfortable in the mouth and has a straight-forward peroxide taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it bad enough to stop using it? No, especially as I&#x27;ve already seen some whitening results from it and my teeth feel really clean! It&#x27;s simply offputting, but it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package is difficult and somewhat sharp when opened, so be careful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this as a part of a free promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the best results with this product. I used it for about 10 days and saw pretty minimal whitening. Certainly not anything close to &amp;#34;six shades&amp;#34; whiter.  Though, come to think of, &amp;#34;six shades&amp;#34; is a pretty subjective metric, perhaps by design? Any slight whitening I did see was a little uneven. It seems to be working for others though, so it may just depend on the state of your teeth.</li>
            <li> I love my HD Crest toothpaste...it makes my teeth have that fresh--I just got my teeth cleaned at the dentist--feeling....I did receive this product as part of a promotion from the brand...BUT I will def buy it again!  &amp;lt;smiling brightly&gt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Crest Pro Health HD system for a week now and all I can say is I&#x27;m sold.  I&#x27;ve tried many different types of tooth paste and whitening gels only to be disappointed in the end.  I have some sensitivity in my teeth so it&#x27;s a struggle to find the right things I can use.  So far, I&#x27;ve experienced no sensitivity issues, especially with the whitening gel portion.  I&#x27;ve seen some whitening so far, although I haven&#x27;t been using it the recommended twice a day, so I&#x27;m sure it could improve.  I&#x27;m hopeful to get on the two a day program this week to see if it makes a noticeable difference.  You will definitely have a fresh mouth feel for a while, I feel bad when I want to go have juice or coffee in the morning because I don&#x27;t want it to go away.  Oddly enough, I&#x27;m looking forward to finishing this product off and seeing what it can really do over the course of a month or so....</li>
            <li> I received this as a free marketing sample. I was very intrigued about the concept and the claims written on the package. I am happy to say that it delivers what it promises: white smile/ dentist-clean mouth. the dual step process is not a big deal only one minute of brushing with each one. The problem I had with the product is that it caused some sensitivity after a while. Nothing major like other products would do, but still some discomfort. I plan on using it weekly rather than daily. All in all a good product though.</li>
            <li> I have used Crest Pro Health HD for the last week (free courtesy of Crest!) and I love it! It just makes logical sense to me. I was already a fan of the Crest Pro Health line! I am also a fan of the Crest 3D line. So I would switch back and forth between the two. The Crest Pro Health Health HD i the best of those two worlds. I will admit it was a little weird using 2 toothpaste tubes during one session, but it just makes sense! I do feel like my teeth are super clean and I have noticed that they look brighter and whiter just after a week! So I think Crest really got it right with this set!</li>
            <li> I never had a two step toothpaste before, so I was skeptical.  However, after getting a sample package and using it I am very, very pleased.  I haven&#x27;t read the other reviews, so as not to be influenced.  I will say that my teeth have never felt so clean, other than a dentist&#x27;s cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;I am never really satisfied how my teeth feel after brushing.  But after so many years, I wrote it off as, \\&quot;well, time to go the dentist and get the job really done.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I do not feel that way after using Crest HD!  It is amazing.  And it makes me feel real good about my dental hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I received this free to try from bzzagent. At first it seemed a bit strange to have to brush my teeth twice but I am not sure I would go back now. I LOVE the way my teeth feel after. So clean!!! My teeth even start to look whiter. I cant wait to keep using and see the progress!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received this from Bzzagent to test, and I was very skeptical.  After a few weeks of use, I can say that I am pleasantly surprised.  The product is good tasting, makes my mouth feel fresh, and I think has had a subtle but slightly noticeable whitening effect on my teeth.  Mind you, nothing dramatic has occurred, but I really didn&#x27;t expect anything at all, and it seems to be making a small difference, which I think is worth buying the product.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on the shelves and was not sure I would want to try it out for $16 as I am usually very thrifty.  So I was pretty excited when I had the opportunity to try it out for free from Crest.  Immediately upon first use I felt my teeth were much cleaner than with my normal generic brand.  It literally felt like I had just walked out of the dentists&#x27;s office.  I either haven&#x27;t been using the product long enough to notice a difference (it has been a week) or it is not doing much to whiten my teeth, so the whitening claim is still up for debate for me.  It is taking some getting used to having a two step process, but it really is not a huge deal switching from a one step to a two step process.  I think it is actually making me brush my teeth for a longer period of time (if I am thinking about my time it&#x27;s not such a good thing, but if I am thinking about my health it is a great thing!).  I would give the product 4 starts for now, just because I have not seen any whitening action on my teeth after a week.</li>
            <li> The Crest Pro-Health HD is a two-step system that claims to make your mouth 6 times healthier and your teeth 6 times whiter, than ordinary toothpaste, in just one week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit includes everything needed:&lt;br /&gt;1 tube of purifying cleanser (step 1)&lt;br /&gt;1 tube of perfecting gel (step 2)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is recommended that this product be used twice a day for the best results. You are directed to brush with the purifying cleanser for one minute. This strips away plaque. Then spit but do not rinse. Add the perfecting gel and brush for another minute. Then spit and rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll find the directions on the back of the package. Note that Crest offers a pre-paid card in the amount of your purchase if you aren&#x27;t satisfied with the results. You&#x27;ll want to keep your receipt and the UPC code in the event that you need to make a claim. You can visit their website for more details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that this product provided minimal results . It did make my mouth feel clean. I believe that my teeth were a little whiter at the end of the week. I didn&#x27;t experience any sensitivity issues, which was a pleasant surprise compared to other whitening products I&#x27;ve tried, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t live up the the claims of a six times improvement. At least not in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As such, I can&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I received the Crest Pro Health HD 2 step toothpaste for free from Crest. I think it is a great way to whiten your teeth quickly and easily. Much better than using strips or other whitening products. I love the taste of step one and sorta dislike the taste of step 2 but I am used to it now. I love how my teeth are whiter and feel cleaner. It&#x27;s as simple as brushing your teeth for 2 min. No mess and no lengthy process. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a two step toothpaste.  Being two steps, this is something new that I&#x27;d never considered before.  It&#x27;s intended to be used in the morning &amp; again at night.  You&#x27;re supposed to brush with each paste for one full minute each, with no rinsing in between.  The first paste leaves my mouth feeling very dry but then you move on to the second paste, like a gel, really, and the dryness goes away.  Once done, you can rinse &amp; get on with your routine for the day.  I really like the slick, shiny feeling this paste system gives my teeth.  Although it claims 6x whitening, I can&#x27;t really comment on that because I am not a heavy coffee or tea drinker, so I don&#x27;t really notice staining on my teeth too much.  That being said, I do feel that my teeth have gotten slightly whiter in eight days since I began using this system, if only by a few shades or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using this system with a bit of hesitation because my mouth is somewhat sensitive to whitening toothpastes &amp; gels and inevitably is affected, usually through drymouth, by such chemicals, but this paste seems to be different.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week now with no adverse affects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two reasons why I might not use this again in the future. One is cost.  I&#x27;ve done some looking around and this system seems to be a minimum of $12 on one website that I found, and up to as much as $38 on another.  Even at $12, it&#x27;s too expensive for me to use all the time.  The second reason I might not use it again is the stannous fluoride which is in this paste system.  I&#x27;m someone who really carefully considers what chemicals I expose myself and my family to and as such, I want to really look more closely into the dangers (if there are any) of stannous fluoride, before I would continue using Crest HD.  I did receive a free trial product of Crest HD.</li>
            <li> Got a free one from Bzzagent.  Clean feeling is fantastic.  Hope there are no long term effects.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product due to the wonderful people at Crest and BzzAgent, and I&#x27;ve been using the system for about a week now. So far, I enjoy it. It&#x27;s this fancy 2-stage thing so you certainly feel like it&#x27;s more serious than that single-stage toothpaste the proletariate uses. Brush with the first stage for a minute, then spit (don&#x27;t rinse!) and brush with the second. The second stage is where it gets interesting. I guess it&#x27;s where the science starts or something. It&#x27;s tingly and cold feeling, and leaves your gums throbbing in that &#x27;this must have been productive&#x27; kind of pleasant way. After using the product consistently for about 3 days, it started to get somewhat unpleasant feeling - which the packaging mentioned might happen. No worries, I switched back to my Sensodyne for a day and then went back to this afterwards. All as well again. I think it&#x27;s too early to tell if my teeth are whiter, but they do feel cleaner and I haven&#x27;t had any other problems. Stay tuned for a follow up on the whiteness!</li>
            <li> I have been using this system for about three weeks.  I have seen a change in my teeth.  The seem a shade whiter.  I think this is an easy system to use compared to others.  First you brush with the purifying cleanser.  This has a minty flavor to it and seems similar to tooth paste.  You do not rinse and only spit this out after brushing.  Then you brush the perfecting Gel on; which is the whitening gel.  You rinse this step.  I like that this is only a two step process that only involves your tooth brush and the two containers.  I also liked the taste of step 2.  It is not a strong taste like some of the other brands I have used in the past.  The Crest Pro Health System is easy and effective!</li>
            <li> I got samples of this from Crest and it&#x27;s actually pretty good at whitening.  My teeth were very white before, but they&#x27;re practically glowing now! What I REALLY love is the way my teeth &amp; mouth feel afterwards. So Clean! And no &amp;#34;morning breath&amp;#34; anymore, either. The only drawback is that, like most toothpastes anymore, this has artificial sweeteners in it that make my gums swell &amp; bleed. If not for that, I&#x27;d use this stuff forever!</li>
            <li> First, let me say Thank You Crest and BuzzAgent for letting me try this product!  It is amazing!!  I have always had a problem using whiting stuff because it hurts my gums or makes my teeth sensitive.  Not with this!  I did have a slight burning feeling with the whitening gel but it stopped after the second time using it.  My teeth are so much whiter now!  The 2 step process isn&#x27;t a pain at all.  My teeth feel fantastic and I will continue to purchase this product!!</li>
            <li> I got this product from Bzzagent free thanks to Crest, and was a bit skeptical.  I&#x27;ve tried whitening toothpastes many times and they never really give noticeable results.  However, this combination works.  The key is the step 2 with hydrogen perioxide which is in dentist sold whitening products.  After using this system for about 2 weeks my teeth feel so much cleaner and are noticeably whiter.  Now this won&#x27;t give you the same whitening as having the procedure done at the dentist, but it&#x27;s a good, much cheaper alternative.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants whiter teeth without paying the cost of the dentist office procedure.</li>
            <li> Preface: I received the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste System as a free promotion from BzzAgent, in return for my unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, I was a bit put off by the two tubes. The kit seemed far more serious than my normal tube of toothpaste. But, I’m a self-professed fresh breath junkie and I’m willing to try anything touted as “the biggest breakthrough in toothpaste since fluoride” if it will give me a whiter smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two-step process is simple. I brushed with the “purifying cleanser,” a gentle plaque-blaster, first. After a minute, and without rinsing, I brushed again for another minute with the “perfecting gel,” a clear gel polish. Easy enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth felt “fresh from the dentist” clean after two minutes, instead of 30 minutes in the dental hygienist chair. After a few days, my teeth are noticeably whiter. I have noticed a little more sensitivity in the area around my crown, but I think that is normal with any teeth-whitening product. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really like this system and I feel like it does a good job at both cleaning my teeth and whitening them.  My only issue is that my teeth and gums are rather sensitive and this irritated them after about four days of continuous use. I simply cannot use every day instead I alternate using it with Crest Pro-Health toothpaste and have no issues. I received this fore review from Crest.</li>
            <li> I received the Crest Pro Health HD product as a promotion from BzzAgent to test and review.  I was really excited to try this product because I generally use whitening products a few times per year to brighten and whiten my teeth.  Crest Pro Health HD is a two step process.  First you brush for a minute with the purifying cleanser which has a refreshing minty taste, then brush for another minute with the perfecting gel.  This product is convenient because you are both cleaning and whitening your teeth in the two minute process.  The first week I did not notice a change in the color of my teeth and was beginning to think the product was not working for me.  I continued with using Crest Pro Health HD for a second week but really did not pay much attention to the color of my teeth.  I was so surprised when I caught a reflection of my smile in the mirror-my teeth were so much whiter than when I started!  For me, the results took a little bit of time to achieve, but I would compare them to the same results I receive when I use whitening strips.  I love the results of whitening strips but I have two issues with them- I hate the tooth sensitivity that they give me and I don&#x27;t like that they only whiten your front teeth.  The Crest Pro Health HD product takes care of both of those problems.  I didn&#x27;t have any sensitivity and you are whitening all of your teeth.  The best part is Crest Pro Health HD is much cheaper than the whitening strips I have used in the past.  I definitely recommend this product if you are looking for a brighter and whiter smile!</li>
            <li> I have always had the kind of smile that never seems to get any brighter, no matter what products I use.  I have tried all kinds of at-home whitening kits and religiously brush with whitening toothpaste.  When I had the chance to sample Crest Pro Health HD for free, I figured it would be about the same as all of the other whitening products out there.  But Crest Pro Health HD is the first toothpaste I have used that actually made a difference in the brightness of my smile.  After using Crest Pro Health HD for just a couple of days I could see a difference.  I continued to see my brightness improve the more I used it.  However, I have repeatedly experienced discomfort, especially in the gum area, when using Crest Pro Health HD.  The package warns that white spots may appear on the gums after using the brightening gel and I experienced those each time I used the product (though they disappeared within an hour).  The whitening gel caused some stinging and slight gum pain for me each time I used it, but it didn&#x27;t last beyond brushing.  Overall, I am happy with the product because despite the discomfort, I am seeing results I am happy with.  If the results are the most important thing for you, then I highly recommend Crest Pro Health HD.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest Pro Health HD for a couple of weeks, thanks to a free kit from BzzAgent. Some things I love, some are just okay. Here&#x27;s the scoop: the purifying cleanser is probably one of the best toothpastes I&#x27;ve ever used. You know how sometimes you brush your teeth in the morning only to feel like you have to brush them again 15 minutes later? Yeah, the purifying cleanser takes care of that. My mouth feels really clean after brushing, which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfecting gel, on the other hand, I was not so impressed with. I think maybe my teeth are a little whiter, but not noticeably. And while I do think my teeth look brighter right after I use it, a few hours later any difference has disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, and I know this is a little thing, while the toothpaste has a flip cap, the perfecting gel has a twist-off, which means that you have to put down your toothbrush between step one and two to take off the cap for the gel. Listen, I said it was a little thing, but it is kinda annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, great toothpaste, and I&#x27;ll probably buy it just for step one. My mouth does feel cleaner for longer.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this toothpaste made my mouth and teeth feel. It freshened my breathe and did give me sort of the \\&quot;just from the dentist\\&quot; feel. Although, thanks to Crest I was able to try this product out for free I cannot get over the cost. Crest would need to significantly reduce the price for me to continue using this on a regular basis, as it is a daily 2-step system.  Not too many people will be able to afford this product. I would also want better results for the retail price.</li>
            <li> First off the toothpaste worked. My teeth became whiter, I have no doubt about that. I just did not like having to do the two steps.  The reason I did not like the two steps is because I like to do stuff while I brush my teeth: Pick up clothes, make lunch, or other short 2 minute tasks. I did not like having to stop my task to go add the second paste to my brush. Again, if you dont mind the second step this is for you, because it did whiten my teeth I have no doubt about that. I got the product free to review.</li>
            <li> As part of the Crest Pro Health HD Bzzagent campaign I received a complimentary package of this product. I am a coffee drinker and I was excited to try this new product. When I showed it to my husband he too was excited to try it. Being that results should be seen in a week I knew there would be enough product for both of us to use for at least a week.  I can not say that our teeth are terribly stained but we had hoped to get some degree of whitening from this product. The directions were simple and straightforward. Being that we have  rechargeable toothbrushes that signals 30 second intervals it is easy to figure how long we had been brushing. The two step process is easy, and both products are good tasting. After using step one of the process for one minute, you spit but do not rinse your mouth. Then you continue to brush with step two of the product for an additional minute. Then rinse as you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I can honestly say that my mouth feels really clean and fresh. Upon waking my mouth and breath feel fresh! My teeth are smooth and I do not feel that I need to rush to the bathroom to brush my teeth. I took a before picture and another picture this morning after using the product twice a day for the past 9 days.I would share it with you but honestly I can not tell which picture is the before and which is the after. I would like to blame it on the resolution of my iPhone 4s but I can&#x27;t say that is completely true! I have been having my husband do daily checks and he can not see a difference. We can not see a difference in his teeth either. We have come to the conclusion that the problem is that our teeth are not really stained so the peroxide did not make a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both do agree that our teeth do feel dentist clean and that morning breath is a thing of the past! So what will we do....I think I will use it before going to bed and have fresher breath in the morning!</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of Crest brand toothpaste, so I was pretty confident that trying this new product would turn into a positive experience (and having the chance to try it free was a bonus), and I was correct.  I have to admit that at first it was an adjustment to use two different products when brushing my teeth; it took some getting used to.  But once, I got into the groove, it seemed natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two things I really like about this product: the way it makes my teeth feel and how it whitened my teeth.  Immediately after using these products, my teeth felt cleaner.  I&#x27;m not sure what it was, perhaps the two step process, but it really felt that my teeth were cleaner than normal.  The other thing I liked was that after the first day I already noticed that my teeth were whiter.  Being an avid coffee drinker, I&#x27;ve always had &amp;#34;not so white teeth&amp;#34;.  I started to notice a change right away and over the time I&#x27;ve used it thus far (about a week and a half) I&#x27;ve seen a difference (that I love).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say one of the downsides (and reasons I did not give this product 5 stars) was that the toothpaste itself is not as &amp;#34;minty fresh&amp;#34; as others.  The second product, the gel, left a strange sensation in my mouth, although this went away once I rinsed out my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very pleased with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have a new addiction and it is Crest Pro Health HD!!!  When I received the package, I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like using a toothpaste that required two steps.  However,  I was excited to use the product and it did not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1: It feels like a traditional toothpaste although it felt a little tart.  I was concerned that I didn&#x27;t need to rinse, but I kept going to Step 2.  Step 2 did not disappoint either.  Step 2 literally made my teeth shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed immediate results and truly felt like my teeth were sparking.  My fiance did not see any whitening results, but she immediately commented on how shiny my teeth were.  The system made me want to brush my teeth and I didn&#x27;t care that it was two steps.  After a week, I noticed that my teeth are much whiter and shinier.  Foods no longer stick to my teeth and my mouth feels clean throughout the day.  This stuff is awesome and I would recommend it at the drop of a dime.  It is certainly dentist quality and I felt like I had visited the dentist after the first brush.  This is my go-to toothpaste now.  Amazing product!!!</li>
            <li> When I recieved my free sample of Crest Pro Health HD from Smiley360 I was excited. I have used many whitening toothpastes and find that they don&#x27;t whiten like strips, but they are not convinient and are a bit expensive. After using Crest Pro Heath HD twice a day for over a week now I have notice a big difference! I was concerned it would taste terrible,  but it was that of a wintergreen toothpaste, no weird feel either! Step two was tasteless to me.  Overall I am pretty satisfied with the product, and would recommend it to anyone who wanted a toothpaste that actually whitens!! As an ex-smoker, I am very happy to reverse the damage I did!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a full week at first I was a bit skeptical about having to add another step to my oral care routine BUT I must say I am THRILLED with the results.  I am a chronic whitener... after one week of using Crest Pro HD I&#x27;m officially ditching the whitening strips.  Crest Pro Health HD cleans and whitens all in one but I don&#x27;t have that awful sensitivity like I do from the whitening strips.  I would highly recommend you try this product.  My family and friends have noticed how white my teeth are (and I&#x27;m a 2-3 cups of coffee a day kind of gal).  Also my mouth feels cleaner.  I am HIGHLY recommending that you try this product, you will love it!</li>
            <li> With four small kiddos, I was really skeptical about a product that was going to take twice the amount of time as my normal routine, but the prospect of having whiter teeth was worth the extra time! My husband and I both still use this product and are hooked! The toothpaste that you use in step one has a very familiar feel to it, however the second step polish is different and took some getting used to due to the feel of the gel sitting on your teeth. The newness of the feel was quickly diminished when we saw how amazingly it worked! In 2-3 days you can already start to see the difference! Within a week you won&#x27;t even recognize your beautiful teeth! The only reason this product didn&#x27;t get 5 stars was because it made our gums super sensitive! We had to give the routine a break after 3 days for our gums to heal, but we&#x27;re back in the routine now, just use a little less of the polish, and are softer with the brushing! Very satisfied!! We were provided this product for free to try from BzzAgent and Crest!</li>
            <li> Well, I received this to try from Bzzagent. I was not sure what to think at first......I mean, why two steps? I am still not sure, but I think I like it! My electric toothbrush buzzes at 1 minute, so that allows me to switch from product number one to number two. You don&#x27;t rinse in between steps (not sure why?) The second step gives my mouth a bubbly feeling, which is the peroxide working. I do feel like my teeth are whiter, and have less build up.I think having two steps also makes me more aware and I do a better job at brushing. I may be addicted!</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health HD is awesome! I was a little intimidated about the time it would take since it&#x27;s 2 separate steps but once I realized that each step requires only 1 minute and no rinse in between, my mind was at ease because my old routine took 2 minutes- I have a really nice electric toothbrush with a pulsing timer that let&#x27;s me know when each 30 second increment is up and when 2 minutes are complete so this toothpaste really complements what I was doing to start with. One of my favorite things about this toothpaste, that I echo others in, is that after brushing I feel like I literally just left the dentist chair (I compare my first time to getting my braces removed- so smooth and clean feeling I wanted to run my tongue across my teeth over and over). Both my husband and I have been using this paste and I will say that from a whitening perspective, we can definitely see a huge difference in his teeth- he had used whitening products before that left the color uneven and now they are sparkling all over. The other thing that I want to brag about this toothpaste is the clean feeling that I have experienced all day, even around my permanent retainers and after meals. Since I haven&#x27;t changed anything else in my routine, I can only account this change to Crest Pro Health HD. I got this toothpaste for free but I will definitely purchase it in the future because I love it.</li>
            <li> I received Crest HD to try for free and I love it! Although it is a two step process which is just kind of annoying it really does help with keep bad breath at bay and whiten your teeth - slowly over time. It does however make soda taste AWFUL if you drink it after brushing your teeth ever.  I made the mistake without knowing and it was so bad - much worse than if you drank soda after brushing your teeth with any other tooth paste.</li>
            <li> I got this kit to try as a promotion through BzzAgent, and I have to say- I love this kit. I only use it once a day, (and use my regular whitening toothpaste at night,) so it took a little longer than a week to notice major results. But the results are certainly there!! My teeth aren&#x27;t ever very sensitive, so I can&#x27;t speak to how it feels on sensitive teeth. But my gums can get pretty sensitive. At first I was using it twice a day, and I think it was a bit too much for my gums. A white bump showed up a few days in while I was brushing, but it disappeared in about 5 minutes. I may have been too rough in my brushing! The two-step process is super easy and it isn&#x27;t any more time consuming than my regular daily routine. I had been previously using a whitening pen/UV light combo that works, but is so much more time consuming! My mouth feels fresh and glossy all day!</li>
            <li> Had some friends over and started to talk about high end personal hygiene products that seem to be a waste of money. Which got me talking about crest HD. I told them i had got this sample kit from Crest for free and had been using it for 3-4 weeks. The majority of my friends said my teeth looked noticeably whiter. We looked up the price on Amazon and found it was only $35. One of my buddies said she had got her teeth whitened by her dentist for $250!!! While her teeth looked a little bit whiter than mine we all agreed the price difference was not worth it. Looks like several friends are going to get it too!</li>
            <li> I received a complementary Crest Pro Health HD from BZZAgent for testing purposes and I&#x27;m hooked. This is a great teeth whitening product that actually works. I have used the Crest whitening strips in the past but I must say that I enjoyed this product better. The Crest stripes take 30 minutes and only over the front of your mouth. They also sometimes made my teeth after using them. This product only takes two minutes, covers the whole mouth, and does not hurt at all.</li>
            <li> Love the new Crest HD Daily Two-Step toothpaste! My daughter and I have been using it for over a week. Fresh taste. Easy to use. Doesn&#x27;t make my gums ache like some toothpastes have in the past. My teeth seem brighter, but more time will tell. The research says it reduced plaque (that&#x27;s good) and gingivitis (even better).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate great products...and this is one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#GotItFree - I am a tester for BzzAgent. Thank you, Crest.</li>
            <li> This is really a great product. Especially if whitening strips and bleach trays scare you (like me) this is a very very effective whitening system. I had never heard of it until I was given a free trial as part of a promotion from BzzAgent. You brush your teeth for two minutes twice a day--one minute for each step--and you get visibly whiter, brighter, more even-toned teeth. I hesitate to say this since this is a whitening product, but they FEEL even better than they look, polished and smooth. It&#x27;s easy to fit this into your morning and evening routine and it&#x27;s kind of addictive because it works so well. I am so much more confident in my smile now.</li>
            <li> The two-steps aren&#x27;t really any more work! You simply brush for a minute with step 1 and then spit, put step 2 on the toothbrush and brush for another minute, its that easy. I really like the neutral taste of the second step, so I don&#x27;t have that super fake mint taste, just a clean fresh taste. I&#x27;ve been using it (free, thanks to a promotion) for two weeks and my teeth are already whiter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; i&#x27;d say is that step 1 is very thick and its hard not to make a mess of the cap with the &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; toothpaste that sort of misses the brush due to the thicker consistency of the toothpaste, but its honestly not a big deal, a little practice and you&#x27;ll get it figured out.</li>
            <li> I received a sample before the release from Smiley360, I love this amazing product. I had yellow teeth and within a few days I saw a difference.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from smiley360 Crest Pro-Health HD is a unique method of dental health care. It resulted in myself in whiter teeth, less plawue, fresher breath longer than other methods and toothpastes. I recommend this product and will but it again myself. thanks to Smiley360&#x27;s free sample offer I was able to try for free before buying. &amp;#34;I received a free product from smiley 360 for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.”</li>
            <li> Toothpaste is very bad, let me brush very uncomfortable. Squeeze a lot of toothpaste, also feel of the brush is not very good, after brushing the first branch and teeth feel very strange very afflictive, the second also need many squeeze enough, but have not seen the so-called whitening effect. Instead, I regret that I saw so high sales, I think it is good to use, the results are not as good as the general toothpaste brush and comfort.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free and really looked forward to using it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Crest ProHealth HD two step solution for a few weeks now. Step 1 is to clean your teeth and remove plaque. Step 2 is the polishing/whitening step. Step 1  left my teeth feeling clean. Step 2, I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant whitening, compared to the label which says up to six shades lighter teeth in a couple of weeks. But I had in recent months used whitening strips before trying this, so perhaps I am more maintaining with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the results from this toothpaste. I don&#x27;t have to sit and let something sit on my teeth. I just take the time to do the 2 stages of brushing. My husband said he can tell the difference and I can too. Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> i love this  i started to see a difference within 2 days... i bought another of this product and will continue to do so</li>
            <li> This dual system makes for an extra clean teeth brushing experience. I found that I spent more time brushing my teeth due to the two steps, which is not a bad thing! I definitely saw results after the first three weeks of using this product. My teeth feel cleaner, less plaque build up on the interior of my teeth and I think they also seem to have lightened a few shades. I also noticed a fresher breath for longer after brushing. I&#x27;m trying this product free from Crest but plan to purchase this again in the future due to all the benefits I have experienced so far!</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try this product for free.  I did actually take pictures to compare, but since the whitening results were underwhelming I won&#x27;t share here.  I work in the public, use a soniccare and have had braces so I try to take very good care of my teeth.  So in  my defense my teeth were already reasonably white.  I will say however if you are using this product to get your teeth clean it does a really great job! I feel like I&#x27;ve just visited the dentist because of the superior polished feel it leaves my teeth!</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this to try for free and give my honest opinion.  Man, I love this toothpaste!  It leaves your mouth SO fresh and clean, and it really did whiten my teeth in one week.  not like a bright crazy unnatural white, but my pearlies were definitely whiter.  I only give this four stars, though, because as a new mom I just couldn&#x27;t fit the second step into my routine.  I gave it a good go for the first week to see if it has results, but now I end up just using the first step and not the second.  I only have so much time in the morning and at night!  I have to say I was truly impressed how fresh my mouth stays throughout the night getting up with my newborn!  it&#x27;s crazy.  If you are looking for a great feel and natural whitening, this is your product!!</li>
            <li> I am a BzzAgent so I had the opportunity to try this product free from Crest. I must start by saying that I am a HUGE Crest fan. It&#x27;s the only toothpaste I will purchase. So I was super excited to try the new Crest Pro Health HD that I was hearing so much about. I suffer from super sensitive teeth when I try to whiten them so I was hoping this would be my answer (white teeth without the sensitivity..yay).&lt;br /&gt;The process does take a little bit to get used to, and remember especially late at night when I&#x27;m sleepwalking to bed. Also I find it difficult to take the cap off of step 2 and screw it back on while I have a mouth full of toothpaste, the cap could be a bit easier if it was a flip top or something.&lt;br /&gt;However, I liked the toothpaste. It wasn&#x27;t my favorite flavor, not bad but I prefer the super minty toothpaste that makes me feel extra clean and the flavor for the HD is more subtle.&lt;br /&gt;I was happy that I never experienced any tooth sensitivity! My teeth seem to be a bit whiter and I felt that the toothpaste cleaned well. I&#x27;m just not sure that I would only buy this particular Crest toothpaste due to the cost. I would probably go back and forth from the regular Crest Pro Health and once that was finished I would spend the extra money and buy the Crest Pro Health HD.</li>
            <li> I have used many many types of whitening products— toothpaste, strips, dentist trays, at home lights— all with varying degrees of success. I was excited to try the Crest Pro Health HD for free as part of a BzzCampaign. It is an easy to use 2 part system (just like Supersmile). It takes a little adjustment to get used to the second brushing, but once you get it, it doesn’t really take any extra time or effort and I think it helps you to actually brush for 2 minutes. I find myself brushing longer when I use a 2 step system than just paste. Unfortunately I have been using Crest Pro Health HD for a few weeks now and have not seen any whitening effect. My teeth are not any whiter than they are with my regular toothpaste. For me other whitening methods work much better.</li>
            <li> I know what you&#x27;re thinking. There are a gazillion toothpaste and whitener products on the market already. Why this one above the others? Because it&#x27;s effective, fast to bring results, and fun to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a BzzAgent, I was sent a free sample by Crest and couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to get my teeth whiter in two-minute, twice-a-day brushings after about a week of use. There are two products that you use for about a minute each. Each has a different purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The peppermint flavor gel toothpaste (Step 1) made my mouth feel incredibly, incredibly clean. On several occasions, I used Aquafresh ExtremeClean Whitening Action for a minute or so immediately BEFORE using the Crest HD and the difference is like night and day. The Aquafresh actually didn&#x27;t feel fresh at all and even after using it a while, my teeth looked no whiter. Plus, I had trouble keeping the paste on the toothbrush. The Crest HD peppermint toothpaste gel made my mouth incredibly fresh even while brushing, foamed very well so that I didn&#x27;t lose any in the sink, and made my teeth feel cleaner than at the dentist! This after just one minute of use. It&#x27;s definitely an advanced product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whitener (Step 2) is great because of the obvious results I got---whiter teeth at last! I hated the whitening strips I used to use. Wearing plastic in my mouth for hours and not seeing the results that others had. Plus I didn&#x27;t trust the chance that I&#x27;d swallow it. (Toothpaste and whiteners should never be swallowed.) I also don&#x27;t like brushing continuously for two minutes with the same product. Crest HD solves both problems, and the toothpaste is the most thorough and flavorful paste I&#x27;ve tried in a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what I like most about the whole process with this product is that it&#x27;s actually FUN to brush with one product for a minute, followed by another for a minute. Makes the process go much faster for me. There really is a difference between this product and others. Even other Crest products.Even other Crest products.</li>
            <li> I am really really impressed with this product. I have been using the 3D white toothpastes for years, this is on another whole level! After 2 days my teeth are definitely whiter, but more impressive is how clean my mouth feels. I experienced gum bleeding with the 3D white toothpastes and didn&#x27;t feel like my mouth was very clean after use. No bleeding with this product, and even 7 hours after morning brushing and eating, my teeth still feel clean. A+++ I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> This duo whitened my teeth beautifully(took care of nicotine and coffee stains), great taste and squeaky clean feeling  ! The two tubes lasted much longer than I expected. Great deal !!!</li>
            <li> Drinking regular tea and coffee has left my teeth yellow with stains. When I received the Crest 2 step whitening kit from BzzAgent I was happy to give it a try. Before I started using this I was using the Crest Pro Health Whitening toothpaste. The kit has the toothpaste and a perfecting gel in it, the perfecting gel sounded promising. So I was really happy to get into the Bzz Campaign.&lt;br /&gt;I love the pro Health toothpaste in the 2 step kit, it is much better than the regular Crest Pro Health Whitening Toothpaste, it removes the plaques better giving a nice smooth clean feel on the teeth and leaves my breath fresh longer, also while brushing it foams more than the regular one.&lt;br /&gt;Whereas I am not so happy with the Perfecting gel, it is too strong mint flavored and leaves a burning sensation in my mouth. I have not seen any&lt;br /&gt;extra whitening from before when I used only the Crest Pro Heath whitening toothpaste. While my stains were gone while I used only the toothpaste my teeth still have a noticeable yellow hue.&lt;br /&gt;I may not buy this kit again; it is after all expensive with no extra result.</li>
            <li> I have been using this routine for several weeks.  First, there has been a slight whitening to my teeth and they feel nice which I love.  However, after 3 weeks of use I am still having a hard time breaking years of routine.  The product requires that you first brush with the paste to clean your teeth then spit NOT rinse, next open the second tube of whitening gel and polish and brush to whiten and polish your teeth.  So many times after step one I started rinsing my mouth and not just spitting before starting step 2.  This sounds ridiculous but a habit that you have done your whole life is hard to change.  I also found it messy.  Unless you remembered to have the tube of whitener opened before you began step 1 you would have to set down your toothbrush without rinsing it while opening the second bottle.  The first bottle/tube has a flip cap which is great for one hand use.  But! the second bottle of whitener and polish is a large twist off cap.  I believe the caps are different because the whitener polish/gel is runny.  It is so runny that as soon as you twist off the cap the product starts running out of the tube.  I felt like I was wasting it.  The thin product also contributed to the messy sink after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all it works however the packaging needs work and old habits have to be broken.&lt;br /&gt;*Crest sent this product to me for free via BzzAgent.  Thanks Crest!</li>
            <li> I love Crest products! From their whitening strips to their whitening toothpaste so I was very excited to try this product. I have been using Crest Pro Health® HD™ for about three weeks and yes, it has improved the appearance of my teeth. My teeth seem to be slightly (not a lot) whiter but this did not happen in a week, it took more like two weeks or more to achieve a noticeable difference. A couple of things to note about this product that I am not too thrilled about are: Step one does not seem to foam very well to distribute through your entire mouth, it seems like you have to use more product to spread out to cover all your teeth. Also, the two step process is a little over kill at first but once it became part of the routine it was no big deal. I do like that step 1 is flavorful enough to not notice the taste of step 2 which is very unpleasant if used alone. In general I am pleased with the product and thanks you CREST for this free product.</li>
            <li> I received this as part of a promotion through Bzzagent.  This however, did not influence my opinion.  I have to say that I am somewhat impressed.  The first time I used the system I felt like the polishing/whitening step (#2) tasted a little metallic but as I continued to use the system I didn&#x27;t taste it again. Perhaps I got used to it.  Step 1 definitely cleans your teeth well.  I get a deeper, cleaner feel from this toothpaste then I do from other regular whitening toothpastes.  Step 2 still leaves a strange taste in my mouth but it does dissipate after a few minutes.  Overall, I do feel as though system has whitened my teeth a few shades over the past month.  I would recommend it to anyone looking to whiten their teeth a shade or two.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed! This product has two things going for it. The first  is that it actually works. I am a coffee and red wine drinker and so keeping my teeth from announcing that every time I open my mouth is an uphill battle. I&#x27;ve used trays and strips in the past and in my opinion this product gives similar results over time without all the gum irritation.  Second, because it&#x27;s a timed two-step system, it really encourages me to be mindful about my brushing time, which I admit, I sometimes slack off on. I received this kit to try from BzzAgent but I would not hesitate to recommend it to friends and I will definitely purchase it in the future.</li>
            <li> I got this as a sample to try.&lt;br /&gt;The good- It&#x27;s really simple to use. i was worried it would be annoying but it is not. The flavor is also okay. It also does whiten teeth although not as much as six shades. It did not give me as much sensitivity as other whitening products especially the strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad- It&#x27;s gritty and will hurt your gums. I also had some sensitivity but not much. It does not whiten as well as it claims but it does do a decent job.</li>
            <li> I got this toothpaste as part of a BzzAgent campaign a couple of weeks ago. Was excited because, &amp;#34;hey, free toothpaste!&amp;#34; but didn&#x27;t really have any expectations for it. I haven&#x27;t really noticed a big difference between toothpaste brands in the past, other than in color, taste, and texture, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with the new Crest HD. I&#x27;m not sure, but I think it can at least partly be attributed to the active ingredient, stannous flouride.This was not an ingredient in my previous toothpaste (Colgate). Immediately after brushing for the first time, my teeth felt noticeably smoother and cleaner. And upon waking, &amp;#34;morning breath&amp;#34; did not seem as bad as usual.  It&#x27;s hard to say how much whitening it has done for me, as my teeth are fairly white to begin with, but I do feel as if my smile is &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34;, if that makes any sense.  My housemates, however, did find that it made their teeth noticeably whiter, and they all also agreed that their teeth felt smoother.  So overall, my teeth definitely feel cleaner, whiter, and it&#x27;s convinced me to switch over from my previous brand. I was also pleasantly surprised that the price was lower than many other whitening products out there. So if you&#x27;re looking for a new toothpaste, I highly recommend giving this a try.</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro-Health HD for 3 weeks now FREE from being a BzzAgent and I LOVE IT!!!  I was not in the market for a new toothpaste at all, but I&#x27;m am completely and totally sold.  It is a 2 step process, however it still only takes 2 minutes of your time so it&#x27;s not a hassle at all.  My mouth has NEVER felt cleaner!  My teeth always feel and look extremely clean and smooth and super white.  I&#x27;m a coffee drinker so this is a wonderful thing!  I also forgot to brush my teeth 1 morning before work and my mouth and teeth stayed looking and feeling extremely clean all day until I brushed that night!  I use this product when I wake up and again before bed with my electric toothbrush and it is a BETTER than the dentist clean in my opinion.  I plan on continuing with this toothpaste and can&#x27;t wait to go to my next dental cleaning to see what they have to say about my teeth.  I honestly feel that you will see a very noticeable difference if you try it!  Oh and by the way, no more morning breath :)</li>
            <li> As a member of Bzzagent, i was given the chance to test out this product for review purposes. I am not a fan of this toothpaste/kit. It claims to make your mouth healthier, fresher breath, and whiten teeth. I have yet get any of those benefits. One I feel the need to keep mints close and use mouthwash before and after brushing because the taste is awful and my mouth doesn&#x27;t feel clean or minty fresh. I also have experienced pain in my gums, as if I had just taken a long flight (anyone travel and know that uncomfortable feeling?). I have also not notice my teeth getting any whiter, although they seem less treated then my previous toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step one toothpaste, has the same flavor as the Crest ProHealth 3D, which is grainy and grimy. nothing about the texture or flavor is &amp;#34;freshening.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step two polish: This is different in the sense that you don&#x27;t rise and use the product. The polish does have a better taste, though it doesn&#x27;t seem to still make me feel like I just brushed my teeth. The polish does help eliminate the grainy feel from the toothpaste, though I still feel like something is missing after the whole process is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly would not go out of my way to recommend the Crest Pro-Health HD kit.</li>
            <li> I tried this product courtesy of Crest. I have been using the system twice a day for 16 days. It took a bit longer than a week to see a difference but I am a coffee drinker and I attribute the extra time to that. Step 1 of the two step system honestly made my mouth feel healthy and sparkling clean. I used it for the full two minutes each time because I love the way it left my mouth feeling. Step 2 is a clear whitening polish which had little taste and didn&#x27;t leave that sticky or gooey residue. I immediately noticed a cleaner feeling mouth and like the product just for that. It took about two weeks but I am now noticing a brighter smile with none of the white spots or uneven bleaching I have gotten using traditional whitening gels and trays.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I noticed a difference after just one use.  Thank you Crest for giving me a chance to try your product for free.  Consider me a believer.</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro-Health HD for free complimentary of BzzAgent as part of my bzzAgent campaign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a 2-part whitening and better oral health product that claims to work within a week. Honestly, firstly, I was a little skeptical because a week seems a very short time to me for any at-home teeth whitening product to work; a few weeks would have seemed believable though. Secondly, I thought it was &amp;#34;too complicated&amp;#34; to use, having two items, not just one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I started using the 2 step/2 minute regime and within less than a week, I was already seeing improvements in my overall health of mouth. My breath was fresher and cleaner, and my teeth were looking whiter. My mouth is definitely benefiting from this 2 step system. I must say, though I find it cumbersome but I like the concept - use one product to get rid of plaque and use the second to polish away the stains and whiten your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Both toothpastes taste great. Also these don&#x27;t cause any sensitivity in teeth or gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all I have to say it is very effective, and performs as it claims. With Crest Pro-Health HD 2-step toothpaste system, Crest ushers in new era of toothpaste for a healthier mouth and whiter smile. I am sold on Crest Pro Health HD, and I definitely recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;#BzzAgent #HealthyObsession #Sponsored #GotItFree</li>
            <li> I received this free as a BZZ Agent and boy was I skeptical as so many other products claim to do the same but fall short. After my first use I definitely noticed a difference and after consecutive uses I was hooked. This is my new favorite toothpaste. I am very pleased with the results and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I received a package of Crest Pro-Health HD to try for free from Crest.  I was able to easily add this 2 step toothpaste to my morning and evening routine.  After the first use I could notice a difference, I felt like I had just left the dentist my teeth felt so clean.  After a few uses I could notice a difference in whitening.  I&#x27;ve used many whitening products in the past and they always are messy or have a harsh taste, this product was nothing like that.  The directions are very clear and easy to understand. I am very happy with this product and will definite continue to use this as my new toothpaste and recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I received the crest pro health HD for free from Bzz agent to review my views. I have now using this product last 2 to 3 weeks and I didn&#x27;t like the products because after using since last so many days now my gums have started giving me burning sensation and I don&#x27;t see any noticeable results Of whitening but I feel my teeths clean whole day.&lt;br /&gt;I will stop using but will ask my husband to give a try and finish it.</li>
            <li> I tried the Crest Pro Health as a free sample.  As a Bzz Agent, I was excited to try the toothpaste as I have been using Crest Whitestrips for several years.  At first, it felt like there was a film on my teeth after you use Step 1, and I found the taste of Step 2 to be very minty (almost too minty).  That said, I noticed whiter teeth within a few days and my teeth seemed to feel cleaner longer into the day.  I like that it whitens all your teeth and not just the front ones, as I found with the Whitestrips. It took me a few days to get used to the two-step process, but I think I actually spend more time brushing my teeth as I am more aware of how much time I spend on each step.  I would recommend this product and would use it again after it runs out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying this for free thanks to Crest and BzzAgent. At first I thought Step 1 was too &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34; feeling and was not a fan. But after a few days I got used to the feeling and even find it necessary to get that &amp;#34;dentist-clean&amp;#34; sensation. I haven&#x27;t noticed much whitening, but I didn&#x27;t take a before and after picture to really compare. I have sensitive teeth and this does not bother me at all. Another bonus is that so far this is the only Crest toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t give me canker sores after a few days of use.</li>
            <li> I was offered the oppertunity to try Crest ProHealth HD whitening toothpast as a BuzzAgent promotion. I was asked to try the toothpaste and simply share my honest reaction. I must be honest I would not normally purchase this product as I&#x27;m very particular about my dental hygene and following a pretty strick cleaning process. I have very sensitive teeth and they always overreact to whitening products. Additionally, I&#x27;m very careful about chemicals and thus prefer using Essential Oil cleansers. But, since the product was free, I decided to give it a try. You must do a two step process which really isn&#x27;t that time consuming (1 minute cleaning with each tube). That proved easy enough but then you had to use the product for at least  a week to determine if there was any difference. The taste is a strong mint which is acceptable in the tooth paste &amp;#34;business&amp;#34; but I prefer a less subtle taste. I always worry what they&#x27;re masking with the added mint flavor. You mouth does indeed feel clean once you&#x27;ve used the product, but I get the same clean feething when using Theives essential oils so I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed. Yes, I would tend to say that step one cleans better than a typical Crest product. The second step, the whitening gel, made my teeth and gums sensitive so I was hesitant to use much. I would venture to say that perhaps my teeth lightened a shade but it may also be simply because I kept staring at them and took more notice than normal. I don&#x27;t drink coffee, wine, tea, or dark sodas so I don&#x27;t have as much staining as perhaps others so there may simply just be less staining to &amp;#34;erase&amp;#34; if you will. I know that many others have high reviews of this product so perhaps I&#x27;m just the outlier but I would prefer to go back to my normal chemical free cleanse. I personally wouldn&#x27;t spend the nearly $13 for this product. I would however say that if you&#x27;re looking for a product to try, this one is significantly easier and less time consuming to use than white strips!rips!</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Crest 3D White toothpaste for a quite a while, so I was excited to try a free sample of Crest Pro-Health HD toothpaste.  It was a little hard to get used to the two step process, and I sometimes forget and rinse after the first step. I have found that the paste works just as well, but it the second polishing paste tastes bad on its own. Crest knew what they were doing when they told you not to rinse after step one! I only use this two-step paste at night and continue to use the Crest 3D White in the morning and at other times during the day.  My teeth were already fairly white, so it took me a couple of weeks to notice a difference.  However, even my husband commented that my teeth were looking whiter.  Although the routine takes some time to get used to, it is much easier than using my whitening trays from the dentist. I plan to continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I received crest pro-health HD free from crest to try it. What a great product - I have noticed results that same day I used it. My mouth instantly feels cleaner and brighter. The 2 step system is really convenient - there are no messy trays or gross tasting strips to let sit on your teeth. It takes 2 minutes, the flavor is great, and you have a beautiful sparkling, clean feeling mouth afterwards!</li>
            <li> I love to have white teeth and fresh breath, and this product does both!  I thought it would be a pain to have to brush twice, but it really isn&#x27;t too bad.  I usually do this process before bed when I have some extra time.  The mornings are a little too busy to do the two steps for me.  I really love the taste of the toothpaste.  It really cleans your teeth to the point where your teeth feel very dry and rough.  It is an odd feeling at first, but once you do step two it goes away.  The whitening paste makes your teeth feel very smooth and they end up very bright and white when you are done.  Within a week you really notice a difference and your teeth look and feel great.  I can&#x27;t wait to go to the dentist to see if my teeth are cleaner than previous visits.  This is a great product and for the price a great deal.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I have noticed a significant change in the color of my teeth and this is only day 3 of using it. My teeth are becoming whiter, they do not look like they have the yellowish tint anymore. It is important to following the directions and do not rinse after step one. Step two kind of tastes like the whitening strip paste but it seems to be working. I am also using 3D white floss to help the discoloration in between my teeth.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of the product to test and I really liked it! It was a bit different at first with two steps, but it turns out that they are worth it as the product preformed very well. I as well as other have noticed the difference in my teeth.</li>
            <li> The new product Crest HD is a two step process of whitening your teeth.  It consists of two tubes.  Step 1 is a cleanser and step 2 is a whitening gel.  It’s is vey easy to use and the taste is not bad.  I have used the product for over 2 weeks and I am very pleased with it.  My teeth feel clean and I feel they are whiter.  It is easier than strips or other forms of whitening methods and more cost efficient.  I would recommend this product and I plan on purchasing the Crest HD when I use up the G.I.F. that I tested.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try Crest Pro Health HD because I was expecting amazing results. I got results, but I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call them amazing. The first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my teeth, but I did notice that my mouth was extremely dry. The tube says that it strips away plaque and it does. It also strips away every drop of moisture in your mouth. Each time I used it, I had to drink a glass of water and swish it around my mouth. While consuming more water is not a bad thing, having a dry mouth is. I used this toothpaste exactly as directed. After a week, I noticed a negligible difference in the whiteness of my teeth. Now after having used it for about a month, my teeth are only slightly whiter than they were before I started using it. I will say that my teeth and gums do feel healthy, but the reason I tried this was for the whitening. Overall, I&#x27;m disappointed in the results I got.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical that this system would work. No strips? No paste to leave on for hours? But after 1 week (as promised) my teeth were noticeably whiter.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and there&#x27;s a significant difference.  PLUS! I was concerned that it would enhance my already sensitive teeth&#x27;s sensitivity.  Not at all! Really pleased and will definitely continue to purchase!  I received this free through BzzAgent for testing. Opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> This 2 step toothpaste system is AMAZING!! I cannot say enough about it. At first I was a little troubled by the idea  that I would have to take 2 separate actions to brush my teeth, but I am so glad I tried it! The first step is a little gritty paste that is designed to help be microscrubbers for your teeth. They made my teeth instantly feel cleaner. You brush for a couple minutes, but do not rinse, then you use step 2. Step 2 is the magic! It uses the previous steps action cleanser to finish the job. It adds in gentle whitening and sparkle to my smile. After using step 2, you can finally rinse and enjoy the results. After 1 use, I was hooked. I will def. buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**My review is in return for enjoying this product FREE from Crest!</li>
            <li> I brush my teeth three times a day and have gone through a variety of toothpastes trying to find one that I liked. I eventually settled on the Rembrandt whitening toothpaste and have been using it for about a year. It&#x27;s good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crest Pro Health HD completely blew it, and all others, away. I was a little skeptical at first having to do a two part system, but I was very impressed by the cleanliness I felt afterwards. In addition to that, my teeth because noticeably whiter over the course of the first week. The two part system, while sounding cumbersome, takes no longer than regular brushing. You use the first part, brush normally, then spit (don&#x27;t rinse!). You immediately use the second part and go over your teeth again. Afterwards, you&#x27;ll feel like you just came back from the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if you&#x27;re looking for super clean feeling, whiter teeth, give this stuff a shot! Especially if you&#x27;ve been spending money on white strips or the like, you&#x27;ll cut down on expenses and time used in the long run!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free from BzzAgent but will be purchasing more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I received the Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste as a free trial. I have always been a little skeptical when it comes to teeth whitening, I have tried several products for sale and some work and some are just such a pain in the butt that even if they work there is too much of a hassle. But the Crest Pro Health HD whitening toothpaste really is easy to use. Not even a week after using this toothpaste I could start seeing the results. I have definitely noticed the difference in my teeth. The two part system is much easier than whitening strips and works better and faster than any other whitening toothpaste that I have tried. I have also noticed that my teeth feel cleaner longer after brushing with this toothpaste. I do have some issues with the toothpaste. Thee first is that if it is a two part system shouldn&#x27;t both parts be the same amount? What if you run out of one part, do you just throw out the rest of the second part? Also the first part, the cleaner, why is it so firm. It is hard to get out of the tube. But all in all I do like this toothpaste and plan on continuing to use it.</li>
            <li> Such a great toothpaste/whitening system. It is so easy to use and make a daily part of your lifestyle. I noticed a whiter smile 3 days into using it. It makes my mouth feel fresh and clean while it makes my teeth whiter.</li>
            <li> I received this as a Bzzagent trial for Bzzagent.com. After only using this twice, I have seen dramatic results. This stuff is amazing. I have, literally, tried everything under the sun for teeth whitening with minimal results. Try this. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I found this to be a really great product!  The two steps seemed daunting at first, but I was so impressed by how clean my teeth felt, and the feeling lasted almost all day!  I think the second step does a great job at whitening already after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> I am very conscience of how white my teeth are since I drink a lot of coffee and sometimes red wine both of which cause my teeth to be stained.  I had the opportunity to test Crest Pro-Healthy HD Daily two-Step Toothpaste for free and jumped at the chance.  I have used other similar products so I know what works and what does not.  I was very  surprised by this product My first thought was it would take too much time I also doubted I&#x27;d see results in a week - nothing in my experience works that quickly. This is quite simple - you squeeze a bit of tube number one on your toothbrush and brush for one minute - spit it out but don&#x27;t rinse. Then you use a bit of the second tube, brush for another minute, spit then rinse and you will really have dental hygienist clean teeth. I am very impressed with this product and will recommend it to friends and family, it does a great job and now I can enjoy both coffee and wine without worrying about stained teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of whitening toothpastes. This one actually works. Not only did it remove the coffee stains, but it whitened the dark spots around an old filling. I have sensitive teeth and had been using Sensodyne for years before this, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with increased sensitivity since switching.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with brushing my teeth.  I brush after every meal. Yes, I even get strange looks in the restroom at a restaurant.  I thought all toothpastes were the same until I tried this.  You can see and feel the difference after only one use!  Don&#x27;t be hesitant to try this because it is a 2 step process.  You brush with each only one minute each, so it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of time at all. I&#x27;m so glad that I got to try it for free from Crest.  I probably would not have purchased it, but now that I tried it, I can never go back to my regular toothpaste. I am loving the results already after only a few days!</li>
            <li> The first time I used Crest PH Advanced toothpaste, I found it very gentle. There was no after taste or burning. It left my mouth feeling fresh, even until I woke in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently trying this product free thanks to Crest! So far, it&#x27;s been a great product. My mouth feels dentist fresh after every brush and stays that way longer than with my regular toothpaste. The two tube system can be a little cumbersome for traveling but otherwise definitely recommend anyone give it a try!</li>
            <li> Stars: 4 out of 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest PH Advanced has a fresh clean taste. My teeth may not exactly sparkle but I feel like they do. I have a very sensitive tooth right now and that was the only thing it did not properly take care of. I had other sensitive toothpastes that I had been trying.</li>
            <li> Love Crest Prohealth works great</li>
            <li> This helped with my sensitive teeth. I haven&#x27;t been as bothered with the sensitivity to the cold or hot drinks or foods. My teeth feel cleaner and my smile is brighter. It says that it freshens your breath but I didn&#x27;t feel that the smooth mint flavor hel</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the Crest Pro-Health HD from BzzAgent, and have used it for a week. I will definitely continue to use this product for as long as it is on the market. My teeth feel professionally cleaned. I have found that many whitening products burn my mouth, but this product does not do that. I notice a difference in the degree of whiteness in my teeth. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I tried Crest Pro-Heath HD for free thanks to Crest but the opinions are 100% mine. My teeth are WAY whiter after using this toothpaste but I am not feeling they are cleaner. It&#x27;s almost a gritty feel afterwards and the taste is awful. Happy to be white but not as refreshing as my previous paste.</li>
            <li> As a bzz agent I recently received this as a free trial thanks to Crest.  I was a bit skeptical it would work and that I would see a noticeable difference.  Boy was I wrong.  After the first use, I saw a huge improvement.  I was shocked when I saw my mom the next day and she asked me if I went to the dentis.  When I asked why she said my teeth looked so white.  After that, I was sold.  Since then, my teeth continue to be white and I swear by Crest Pro Health HD.</li>
            <li> I was/am very pleased with the total product - from the packaging to the tube to the product inside. So far this product has lived up to the description/advantages printed on both box and tube. I would recommend this product to any and all who would listen or read my review.</li>
            <li> Since I have more crowns than natural teeth - I don&#x27;t get much of the whitening effect from this toothpaste (obviously), however! My husband has seen more than stellar results. Both of us have experienced healthier feeling mouths, fresher breath, and just an overall improvement. My husband has always battled staining (coffee...) and he&#x27;s relieved to finally find a toothpaste from a well known and trusted brand that actually works. It may seem intimidating at first (I mean, there&#x27;s two tubes here) but it&#x27;s super easy and the added steps, in my opinion, are what make the difference. You aren&#x27;t just slathering on a flat toothpaste and hoping it&#x27;s doing what it says it will do, with Crest Pro Health HD, you know it&#x27;s working. Thanks to Crest, we&#x27;re able to give this toothpaste a good run at no cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a busy Mom with 1 on the way and before I received the Crest Pro-Health HD free in the mail from Crest, my gums were bleeding daily.  I knew this was a common side effect from pregnancy, so I just shrugged it off.  I will say that since using this product, my gums have STOPPED BLEEDING!!  I honestly wasn&#x27;t using this product to whiten my teeth, although that is a very pleasant side effect.  My teeth look whiter and feel much cleaner!!  I would say that the polishing gel makes my whole mouth feel so clean.  Below are my list of pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Gums stopped bleeding&lt;br /&gt;After-Dentist clean feeling that lasts&lt;br /&gt;Really does whiten teeth&lt;br /&gt;The step 2 gel makes my mouth feel amazing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;2 steps can be a hassle when you are in a hurry&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of the taste of the step 1 paste (personal preference - not really a con)</li>
            <li> Work wonderful. See result within first time using. Recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> I got this product free from bzzagent.com and thank you also to Crest for letting consumers try this product for free. When I first got this product I was a little annoyed with the two step process. After using the product for a couple of days the two step process was not bad at all and I could definitely see a difference in my teeth and mouth. I breath was fresher and mouth definitely felt cleaner. The polishing agent has made my teeth nice and white and I extremely in love with this product and would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I recently received a sample of Crest Pro Health® HD™, compliments of Crest, and love the results after just 1 week of using it!  I&#x27;ve tried other teeth whitening systems in the past (gel with mouth guard and whitening strips that you have to wear for 30 minutes each day), but in just 2 quick minutes, you can get the same result with Crest Pro Health® HD™.  I drink a lot of tea and have some stains on my teeth from it, but thanks to this new product, those stains are gone!  I feel myself smiling more these days to show off my pearly whites :)</li>
            <li> Great product. Leaves teeth feeling fresh and clean. The two step system is definitely worth the extra few seconds. No funny aftertaste. Highly recommend. I got this product free for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this 2-step routine for just over 10 days now &amp; am loving it! I&#x27;ve used other whitening products before that didn&#x27;t yield results this good, this quickly, or this easily! I never forget or skip brushing, &amp; with these products being my go-to toothpaste, now I never forget to whiten! The 2-steps add just a few minutes to your brushing time, though there have been a few mornings I was in a rush &amp; just used my regular toothpaste. Overall, the 2-steps aren&#x27;t a hassle, especially in comparison to the process required with other whitening products; the time required to do this is totally worth it. I will definitely keep a supply of this in our bathroom (but will likely also keep a regular toothpaste for when I&#x27;m in a hurry.) The flavor isn&#x27;t as minty as many toothpastes, but it definitely leaves your mouth feeling clean, smooth, shiny, &amp; visibly whiter. Two small draw-backs: 1) storing Step 1 on it&#x27;s cap (like it&#x27;s apparently designed) causes a slight stringy mess when opening the cap, so I store it upside down &amp; issue solved, 2) my gums are, as a norm, sensitive &amp; this product did magnify that sensitivity on about day 2, but only for about 1 day. Since about day 3, my gums have felt just fine, and my mouth has felt so much cleaner! I&#x27;m happy that I got to try this product free from Crest/Bzz as part of brand promotion, but it is worth the price &amp; I totally recommend it for everyone!</li>
            <li> To me this works better than the strips and there is never any sensitivity.  Friends noticed my whiter teeth!</li>
            <li> I was given Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Tw0-Step Toothpaste to try for free from Crest.  I was not sure I would like having to spend an extra step each morning to brush my teeth.  The very first time I used this product my teeth felt so much cleaner.  It feels like you have just been to the dentist for a teeth cleaning.  I noticed some whitening of my teeth as well.  If you have sensitive teeth you may want to take it slow using this product.  I had slightly added sensitivity but it was not enough to discontinue using it..</li>
            <li> I love the fresh, clean feeling of my teeth after checkups at the dentist.  This toothpaste due gave my mouth the same feeling, but with a better taste and easier cleaning regimen!  While I only noticed a slight difference in the whiteness of my teeth, my mouth felt healthier and this toothpaste had a great taste that lasted longer than usual.  My breath felt cool and fresh for several hours, which is very important to me.  I enjoyed using this toothpaste and would buy it again.  I am so impressed with the product, and with Crest for letting me try it for free!  I would also recommend it to others who are looking for a feeling of healthy teeth and long-lasting fresh breath!</li>
            <li> I received a free trial as part of a campaign.I doubted at first that it would whiten my teeth, and while they are not pearly white they are much closer than they were before I began using this.  This toothpaste has done wonders with my teeth. I will definitely continue to use this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I started using Crest Pro Health HD a few weeks ago.  I received the product as a Bzzz agent.  I was able to see the improvement in my smile within a week.  The toothpaste has a nice minty flavor that leaves your mouth feeling fresh.  Although the polish works well on I did not care enough for the taste.  It didn&#x27;t taste bad it was just odd.  If they could improve on the taste..... I would give it five stars!!!</li>
            <li> The whole 2 step thing took a minute to get used to and the taste isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;m used to from other tooth pastes but it seems to work as described. My teeth are definitely whiter!</li>
            <li> We are loving this toothpaste combo that we received free thanks to Crest. At first, it seemed potentially tedious with two steps, but as soon as we used it, we realized how easy it was. But the best part is the just-went-to-the-dentist clean feeling you get. It might be more expensive than other toothpaste, but it&#x27;s less than whitening treatments, and without all the sensitivity. I think we have a new regular toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I was so excited to try this toothpaste, which I received free from Crest!! as part of a Bzzagent campaign and I definitely was not disappointed.  After just one use, I was amazed to discover my teeth felt as clean as they do after a good dental cleaning.  Initially, I was reluctant to try a two step process, but I quickly realized it didn&#x27;t take me any more time than brushing my teeth normally does.  I noticed whitening results right away which I am very impressed by.  The one draw back is how sensitive my teeth are to this formula.  I&#x27;ve used other Crest whitening products before with a mild sensitivity, but my results from the Pro-Health HD were pretty severe.  I experience quite a bit of discomfort when I use the product as directed.  After taking a break from using the product daily, I now use it once a day for half of the recommended time.  Since doing this, I no longer have sensitivity and can use the product again.  However, the results aren&#x27;t quite as amazing as when used as directed.  That being said, I will still recommend this product to others and probably purchase it once it runs out, as you can&#x27;t beat the clean feeling and ease of whitening.  I know I have extra sensitive teeth and I haven&#x27;t heard of anyone else having this issue.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping.  Step one kinda tastes like crap, but overall the toothpaste does what it is supposed to.  My teeth are whiter than before but not much.  I have used white strips in the past so my teeth were pretty white to start with.  I always had problems with the teeth in the corners missing out on the lovin that my front ones got, as we know white strips dont reach all the way to the back.  On top of the color, once i finish with step 2 my mouth really feels clean, almost like when you leave the dentist.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> At first I was very skeptical.  Why would I want to take a routine that I have had for 40+ years and change it, and potentially make it more time consuming and complicated?  In fairness, I received this free as part of campaign from Proctor and Gamble, so I figured I had nothing to lose.  As it turns out, it did not really complicate my morning/evening routine and did not take any additional time.  One minute on step 1, one minute on step 2, done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I like the most about this toothpaste is the feeling that it leaves your mouth with - it really does feel like you just left the dentist - every day!  Also, my teeth were definitely noticeably whiter after about a week or so - definitely more noticeable than with other whitening toothpastes but with a lot less hassle than using things like whitening strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that I won&#x27;t purchase this every time I buy toothpaste, but I probably will use it every other time to keep my teeth extra white and my mouth extra fresh!</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try Crest Pro-Health HD by BzzAgent and I&#x27;m quiet satisfied with it! I love the two-step system. It is so easy and makes my teeth feel really well-cleaned afterwards. I definitely noticed my teeth getting whiter. The only thing that bothers me is the aftertaste of the step-2 whitening gel. It was a little unpleasant but bearable. Overall a good toothpaste!</li>
            <li> When I first saw this product I was hesitant to try it and didn&#x27;t expect much.  Other whitening toothpates that I have tried in the past didn&#x27;t give me a lot of hope that this one would work.  I received a free package of this product, tried it, and now I love the Crest HD 2 Step System.  The first step is a deep cleaning toothpaste that I would buy on it&#x27;s own without the whitening gel.  My teeth feel cleaner, smoother, and have much less plaque buildup than before I started using it.  Step 2, a whitening gel, gave noticeable results.  It wasn&#x27;t a dramatic change, but enough where I was left impressed.  My only gripes are that the whitening gel left white spots on my gums right after brushing with it, but those faded relatively quickly.  The whitener also has a bit of a strange flavor to it.  Overall though this is a great product and worth a try.</li>
            <li> At first I was very skeptical.. why do I need to brush my teeth twice? This tastes kind of funny compared to the toothpaste I am used to...&lt;br /&gt;I quickly overcame my skepticism after brushing.  My mouth has never felt so clean...like dentist clean (minus the painful scraping!).  I honestly didn&#x27;t think it was possible for my mouth to feel this clean just from brushing my teeth.  The clean feeling (similar to the sensation of getting your braces off for the first time) lasted practically all day!  And bonus points for whitening better than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried in the past!  Brushing my teeth with a two-step process doesn&#x27;t take much more time than doing one step, and the results are incredible.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Great addition to my morning routine. White teeth and a clean mouth feeling! Much better than using white strips! I got a sample free thanks to crest. #imabzzagent #gotitfree</li>
            <li> So I got this product as a free sample, and I&#x27;m probably going to be buying more.  The whitening aspect works about as well as any other whitening toothpaste, though it does taste a little more like whitening gel (just Step 2).  What I personally have been loving though, is that it makes it so much easier to brush my teeth for the recommended 2 minutes!  Just 1 minute with each gel, which feels like no time at all.  This has made a big difference for me, since I&#x27;m prone to rushing through the boring steps of daily life.  I like that it is whitening as well, and combined with the two step process makes this really work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time my dentist didn&#x27;t complain at my checkup!</li>
            <li> Tried this toothpaste and whitener through bzz agent as a sample. The appearance is 5 star, a very modern and up to date flare. The toothpaste feels high quality and is not too strong but cleans thoroughly. The flavor is also very mild and doesn&#x27;t sting. The texture is a bit gooey in a positive way though so u can finish brushing your teeth without adding additional toothpaste. The whitener is also mild, and please use for at least 1 min each time or it will not work. Don&#x27;t expect miracle work for the price. It does work but it takes time and patience. Love this product planning on buying again! thank you bzz agent and crest !</li>
            <li> In love! So far one of the best toothpaste brands that I have tried. My smile did get brighter even though I&#x27;m a coffee drinker. I thought that it would take me longer to get my teeth brushed, but it only added a minute to my routine. The fresh feeling when you are done brunching is great because I hate having the after taste of food lingering after I brush. I will consider purchasing it when I run out of my current one.</li>
            <li> When I initially recieved this whitening combo as a promotion, I was hesitant to use it. I have not been a fan of at-home whitening products. I never liked the taste, sensitivity to teeth, and inconveince. This product changed my mind! It did not alter my toothbrushing routine and I had noticeably whiter teeth. The product did not make my teeth sensitive nad did not have a funny taste. Overall, I was very pleased with the product!</li>
            <li> Our entire family absolutely LOVES this new product from CREST.  I first tried this when I received a free product sample as part of the BzzAgent program and after three days of use, I was so impressed with my results that I ordered three more to share with family members.  I am very selective about the toothpastes and other oral products I purchase so, although I was willing to try this, I certainly wouldn&#x27;t be repurchasing if it wasn&#x27;t superior to the other products I use.  This one is!  I recently purchased two more sets for my personal &amp;#34;stockpile.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest Pro Health HD, is being touted as Crest’s biggest breakthrough in toothpaste since fluoride, and I am a believer!  It is a 2-step process that takes the same amount of time as you generally spend brushing your teeth.  I could tell a difference from the first use: my smile was brighter and my teeth felt so clean.  Within a week of twice daily use, my teeth were definitely whiter and I no longer awoke each morning with  &amp;#34;morning mouth.&amp;#34;  WOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My naturally skeptical husband noticed the difference and actually asked to try it out.  His whitening results were even more dramatic than mine and he is now a very enthusiastic convert to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are sensitive in spots but I have had zero discomfort with Crest HD.  I think a bright smile is the best accessory and very important in the business world as well. This system offers that, but more importantly, it offers healthy teeth and gum benefits from a very trusted brand.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is the easiest way to get a brighter, whiter smile without going to the dentist and spending hundreds of dollars. The sparkly blue paste (step 1) removes plaque and makes your teeth feel super clean. The clear gel (step 2) brightens and polishes your teeth. I am not a cola, coffee, or tea drinker, and I don&#x27;t smoke, so I don&#x27;t have surface stains, but I can still see notable improvements in the color of my teeth after just 10 days of use. Thanks to Crest and BzzAgent for the free sample to get me started on this.  I&#x27;m here to order more!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It feels as though I have visited my dentist everyday.  Within the first day I was able to tell a difference in the way my teeth felt.  I was a little skeptical about the whitening aspect of the toothpaste as I normally have very sensitive teeth; however, it has not affected the way they feel at all?  Even after two weeks of using product, my teeth still feel great--no sensitivity issues!  I received this toothpaste in a BzzKit!</li>
            <li> Shipping was perfect, arrived right when stated. The size was larger than I expected and the cost was half what I originally planned to plan for it. Love the product and can already see an improvement in the coloring of my teeth, funny taste to get used to at first though. Almost a gritty feeling to the first paste that you use prior to using the whitening gel.</li>
            <li> I am a mom to 3 small kiddos and I do not have a lot of time for myself, but I love that in 2 quick minutes I can whiten my teeth!  It&#x27;s so easy, and it tastes pretty good.  Most of the other whiteners I used in the past made me gag, but this makes me feel like I just left the dentist chair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product as part of a promotion from Crest, but I am so glad I did.  Whitening kits are expensive, and sometimes I HATE them.  I will definitely buy one when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> I was given a Free sample by Crest via BzzAgent to try and give my opinion on once I have used it.  I have used this product 2X/day for the last 5 weeks.This product is very easy to use. Takes only 2 minutes to do, 1 minute for each step.  The first step is actually cleaning your teeth and preparing them for the 2nd step, which is the Whitening.  The first step does a great job at removing the plaque from your teeth.It has been found to reduce plaque by 35% and reduce gingivitis by 43%. I was amazed after the first time I used this 2 step system for cleaning my teeth.  My teeth felt so clean, very smooth like glass. My teeth did whiten some, even my crowns looked better. I have internal staining of my teeth from antibiotics that I had taken as a child.  So I have been told my teeth will not Whiten with any of these products.  I was still happy with my results. I feel my oral health is much better now after using this product.  I am very concerned about keeping my gums healthy. I love that this product can help me by removing plaque and reducing my chances of getting gingivitis.  I did not experience any tooth sensitivity while using this product.  I did have some burning initially when using the 2nd step.  I had to make sure not to go past the 1min. and I would rinse well once my minute was completed.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest who gave me Crest Pro Health HD for Free to try a little over a week ago I am a much happier man.  I wanted to wait at least a week before posting a review and I&#x27;m glad I did!  Normally I wouldn&#x27;t use this type of product due to safety concerns and/or being unfamiliar with it.  I needed to know that it was safe before using it.  The fact that it was from Crest and P&amp;G made me more comfortable with it.  I&#x27;m glad I tried it and am using it.  I&#x27;m only the 9th day and I can actually notice quite a difference.  My wife can too!  This morning we slept in.  After waking up we hung out in bed talking about our &amp;#34;list of things to do&amp;#34; for the day and she made a statement that surprised me.  She said &amp;#34;Hey your breath is pretty good this morning&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;no morning breath&amp;#34;.  I also had a friend ask me if I went to the dentist recently because my teeth were looking whiter and wanted a dentist recommendation.  Well, the only thing I changed over the last week+ is used Crest Pro Health HD and I can&#x27;t be happier.  Glad I tried and now my wife and friend will be checking it out too.</li>
            <li> The Crest Pro-Health HD is my new everyday toothpaste. I got this as a free sample from Crest and have been using it for about three weeks. It is a two step process that does take a little longer than my usual toothpaste but worth the extra time. My teeth always feel freshly polished like I just walked out of the dentist office. And my breath smells great.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I got to try this product as a promotion by the Crest brand for a chance to review it and experience the product. I had nearly given up on my teeth being white(r). until I tried  Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even as a child I never had super white teeth and no one in my family did either, even though we&#x27;ve always had good oral hygiene. Some people because of thin enamel or other reasons just never have those sparkling Hollywood star white teeth. I am one of those people, but worse I was  a 2 pack a day smoker and a heavy coffee and cola drinker for almost 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I gave up cigarettes, coffee, and colas I had hoped I could have whiter teeth but no matter what product I tried I never really saw any difference in my teeth. But I still wanted white teeth, so when I got offered the chance to try this product and the chance to review it I jumped to accept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the 2 step system. I love that Crest Pro - Health HD Daily does not make my teeth hurt or my gums sore and I especially LOVE that after just a couple of days I could see my teeth were whiter even from a distance looking in my bathroom mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using the product as long as I continue to see results and encourage anyone who had tried other systems and given up to try&lt;br /&gt;Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste because if it can make my teeth whiter when everything else failed then I believe it could help others too.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product from Crest and was very skeptical; I&#x27;ve tried many whitening and deep cleaning tooth pastes and &amp;#34;systems&amp;#34; in the past and have had little to no improvement with any of them.  I was also a little put off by the prospect of using two separate products, each for a full minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my first few uses, I noticed both extra clean teeth (it felt like the toothpaste was removing more &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; than usual), and a cleaner sensation in my mouth afterward.  There was a nice minty, but not overbearing, taste after brushing as well.  I&#x27;ve used Crest Pro-Health HD for about a month now and am pleased to say that I see significantly reduced plaque buildup and much whiter teeth.  My wife, who never comments on such things, even noticed and said how much better (whiter, brighter, cleaner) my teeth look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While a little inconvenient to use correctly, compared to basic toothpaste, Crest Pro-Health HD has really worked well for me.  Despite it&#x27;s significantly higher cost, I will be purchasing it in the future, as it is worth the investment.</li>
            <li> This product worked right away!  My teeth looked whiter from day one but most of all my teeth and mouth felt fresh and clean all day long!</li>
            <li> 2 steps are too many. Create a combo strip of product. This is too workey.</li>
            <li> I have used the products for one week. After brushing with both products...my teeth feel dentist clean after each use. They both leave a refreshing taste...and my teeth have indeed whitened. I would continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about three weeks now and have found that my teeth not only feel very clean but have gotten noticeably whiter as well. It is nice to use a whitening product that is easily integrated into my normal routine and I don&#x27;t have to take extra time out of my day to use whitening strips or trays.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love the product. The product instructions were clear and specific and the product left my mouth feeling refreshed</li>
            <li> Stars: 5 out of 5&lt;br /&gt;Review:&lt;br /&gt;I love this product! It made my teeth feel so clean and fresh! It has also whitened and brightened my teeth! I love it!</li>
            <li> I was really excited about using this product but after the fourth use I noticed some yellow-brownish stains on a couple of teeth.  I had read this was possible so made certain to follow the directions given.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest Pro Health® HD for about a week now, thanks to a fantastic free sample I receive in the mail from Bzz Agent.  Crest Pro Health® HD is a 2-step toothpaste system, each taking 1 minute to complete.  Step 1 is a purifying cleanser that strips away plaque.  It is a blue gel that I found was most similar to conventional toothpaste that I was used to.  I applied it to my toothbrush, and brushed for 1 minute as directed.  Although it did not &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34; as much as my conventional toothpaste, it had a similar pleasant fresh taste.  After 1 minute, I spit out the cleanser (no rinsing), and then applied the perfecting gel, Step 2, to my toothbrush and brushed for 1 minute.  The gel is a white gel that is designed polishes and whitens your teeth.  it did not foam very much, and had a distinct minty taste, which was strong but very refreshing.  I brushed for 1 minute, spit, and then rinsed my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed this regimen for 1 week, and really liked the results I achieved with so little effort and variation from my normal routine.  After each brushing session, my teeth and mouth felt so clean and my breath fresh.  While my teeth did not become significantly whiter (I am an avid coffee drinker, so my teeth are not as white as they could be),  I noticed an improvement in color.  Best of all, my mouth felt fresh and clean, using such a user-friendly whitening regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest Pro Health® HD is a fantastic product that is so easy to use, takes practically no time at all, with such fantastic results.  It was literally like brushing your teeth, but with the whitening benefits rolled into it.  I&#x27;ve tried other whitening products such as other whitening toothpastes as well as whitening strips, and you really can&#x27;t beat a 2 -minute cleaning AND whitening system!  Thank you, Crest Pro Health® HD!</li>
            <li> I love the smooth clean feeling of my teeth after each brushing with Crest Pro-Health HD.  I think my teeth are somewhat whiter, ,but not significantly. The major issue I have with this product is the time investment.  I clearly don&#x27;t leave another time before work. Sometimes a full two minutes of teeth brushing is not possible! I do like the taste.&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure, I received this system for free to test as a BZZ agent.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Crest Pro Health HD system for a week. I like how it makes my teeth feel really clean. My teeth are not noticeably whiter, but to be fair, my teeth are naturally very white.</li>
            <li> I loved the two step process. The First one cleaned well while the second one really freshened up and felt like it whitened. I never get this complete of a feeling from any other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This product was a great kit for offering a one box solution for caring for your teeth. Crest PH HD is a great product to use on a daily basis to not only strengthen your enamal but also to whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li> I felt that my mouth felt much cleaner and my teeth a llittle brighter due to this Crest product. It was very easy to use. I liked the two-step process. First you brush with the paste for a minute, spit but not rinse, and then use the gel for one minute and then rinse. The brightness was noticeable. I will continue to use this product. It was gentle on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any result from this product yet. I feel as though I shouldn&#x27;t expect results this early (after only a week of use), though. I do think it&#x27;s a good idea, but am not yet convinced that it works. The flavor of the part 1 of the toothpaste i liked, but the flavor of the part 2 was a little off-putting. It made me think that my teeth were not that clean.  I would prefer if the step 1 toothpaste could be used last, to leave the fresh taste in my mouth</li>
            <li> The two-step toothpaste is an inexpensive, efficient way to get your bright smile back. I recently got married and used another brand of white strips prior and was disappointed in the product. I wish I had received this product sooner! The strips did not truly whiten my teeth. The process of getting the strip off its backing was beyond stressful and aggravating. Regardless of logistics, it left my teeth sticky, with a bad aftertaste, and very sensitive teeth. I tried this product for free from Crest. The two phase pastes are explained well on the packaging and tubes themselves. It is very easy to use. The first phase freshens your breath more than any other paste I&#x27;ve ever used. The second phase gel doesn&#x27;t leave your mouth tasting back or sticky with ingredients to whiten your teeth. Within a few days, the results were very noticeable. After a week, I began to receive compliments and inquiries. I will continue to buy this product to k people my white smile, this product is a must have if you are looking to brighten your smile wIt&#x27;s out breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> this is the best product for whiting your teeth. I was given this as a sample to try and I am a OCD teeth whitener!  I have tired everything and I can tell you that this really works.  You can see results after one day and if you continue to use it will get lighter and lighter on your teeth!</li>
            <li> I received this Crest Pro-Health HD 2-step toothpaste to try for free from Crest and Bzzagent. I was super excited to try this toothpaste out but I have not seen any noticeable difference in the whitening part but my teeth do feel really clean. I have also noticed that, since I have sensitive teeth, that the toothpaste is starting to irritate them. It is not nearly as bad as the whitening strips or anything that I have received from the dentist, so I am not too worried about using it.</li>
            <li> I received this toothpaste as a free sample from BzzAgent and I love it!!! This toothpaste gives you the clean fro!m the dentist feeling and the results are amazing. The whitening power of this toothpaste is beyond belief! I saw results after just a couple of usages</li>
            <li> I received this toothpaste for free through BzzAgent. I was super excited to try this product and it did not disappoint. I usually spend as little as possible when buying toothpaste, but the Crest Pro-Health HD Two-step toothpaste made me think twice about that habit. I feel as though my teeth have gotten whiter - I am a coffee drinker and had noticed some darkening recently. I also love the clean feeling the toothpaste gives. I would recommend this toothpaste to anyone who is serious about taking good care of their teeth.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness.  I received this toothpaste in the mail from the company as a promotion. Not going to lie I was a little apprehensive of having my teeth stripped and then having to apply another layer.  Boy was I wrong. I love this tooth paste!! You can actually feel the plaque being stripped away from your teeth. Then when you apply the finishing step, my teeth become so smooth and clean.  I have never been able to feel the difference before but with this toothpaste you can feel every step.  I think I am even beginning to notice a change with how my teeth look. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a good amount of toothpastes and haven&#x27;t found one that had the three things I&#x27;m looking for:&lt;br /&gt;1. Whitens my teeth&lt;br /&gt;2. Tastes good&lt;br /&gt;3. Has some health benefit too&lt;br /&gt;One of those things is always missing or subpar. Having used HD for a couple of weeks now and can definitely say I&#x27;ve found something that checks off all three, even if it had to be in a two-step! It really wasn&#x27;t a big deal to add another step into my morning routine (one more minute of brushing really hasn&#x27;t ruined my day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I could actually note the difference that my teeth were much whiter than they had been before. I came from using another whitening toothpaste and couldn&#x27;t see any difference from that but with HD I really saw that my teeth were whiter within the first week. Second, it didn&#x27;t taste that bad! The first tube of paste was pretty minty. The second tube was a gel which I wasn&#x27;t used to, and it took a while to adjust the feeling but I genuinely feel like my teeth are &amp;#34;polished&amp;#34; after using it. Third, my mouth feels fresher and cleaner. As said, I truly feel like my teeth are &amp;#34;polished&amp;#34; after brushing. Feels like my mouth is healthier and hoping that the dentist agrees next time I visit! The only negative I can think of is that I rinse with cold water and sometimes I get that sensation of your mouth freezing (like if you chewed spearmint gum and drank water), but it goes away quickly and it&#x27;s likely due to the flavor more than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, it&#x27;s a fantastic product and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking for those three things I listed.</li>
            <li> When I first heard about Crest Pro Health HD, it sounded cool but I wasn&#x27;t sold on using two seperate tubes of paste. I tried the product courtesy of BzzAgent, and was relatively impressed but did have a reservation or two. Here are the details of what I experienced. First, the routine itself isn&#x27;t difficult but it is, at least for me, messy. I&#x27;m a messy, over the sink, tooth-brusher. Trying to put on a second toothpaste (with a screw on cap), mid brush is a bit odd and makes it even more... messy. I&#x27;m also not in love with the fact that you can&#x27;t rinse your mouth between pastes, that&#x27;s hard for me. Now, the effects on my mouth. After using this system just one time, my mouth did feel fresh and clean, not just minty. I took a photo of my teeth on day one, and another after using the system for a week. My teeth were somewhat whiter than they were initially. I wouldn&#x27;t say they were to the level of professionally whitened, but a definite improvement. Overall, I think this is a good product, just maybe not for anyone with OCD.</li>
            <li> I received this kit as part of a promotion from Crest. Upon first use, my teeth felt immediatly cleaner than they do when I brush with traditional flavor. The mint flavor in both pastes is sweet and mild and I found the 2 step process novel and fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using for about 3 weeks I can report the following:&lt;br /&gt;-My smile is marginally whiter -- this kit works as well as other whitening toothpastes I have used in the past but not as well as Crest White Strips&lt;br /&gt;-I had a visit to my dentist and my hygienist noted that my teeth look great and it was obvious I was doing a good job brushing&lt;br /&gt;-The 2 step process is starting to get old -- I use an electronic tooth brush and I have to stop and reapply the second paste mid-cycle which restarts the brushing from the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend if you are looking for a clean mouth with smooth feeling teeth and do not mind a 2 step brushing process.</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great packaging. The tooth paste (step 1) was very minty and refreshing. When I brushed with step 2, I knew exactly what the main ingredient was...Hydrogen Peroxide.  I grew up brushing my teeth with toothpaste and than rinsing or brushing with peroxide. Therefore I know this product will whiten teeth because of its main ingredient for step 2. There is a plus with step 2, you don&#x27;t experience the foam action that you would with regular hydrogen peroxide, however I will probably stick to my cheaper alternative of just buying the $2 bottle of hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li> So far I am really pleased with this product. It made my mouth feel clean, made my teeth f eel fresh and white and did not leave my teeth sensitive. I also liked how quick and efficient it wAs</li>
            <li> My mother has been using this system for 2 weeks now,  and we can see a drastic improvement in the coloring of her teeth and health of her gums! Thanks Crest for the free sample!</li>
            <li> At first I was very skeptical.. why do I need to brush my teeth twice? This tastes kind of funny compared to the toothpaste I am used to...&lt;br /&gt;I quickly overcame my skepticism after brushing. My mouth has never felt so clean...like dentist clean (minus the painful scraping!). I honestly didn&#x27;t think it was possible for my mouth to feel this clean just from brushing my teeth. The clean feeling (similar to the sensation of getting your braces off for the first time) lasted practically all day! And bonus points for whitening better than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried in the past! Brushing my teeth with a two-step process doesn&#x27;t take much more time than doing one step, and the results are incredible. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It works and doesn&#x27;t take any extra time to use. Each step takes 1 minute and you are supposed to brush for two minutes with regular toothpaste. It tastes just like regular toothpaste. I saw results after the first use on day two there was a huge difference. I don&#x27;t have to worry about coffee stains anymore. Great product! I was able to get a free box through a promotion from crest.</li>
            <li> Having a healthy feeling mouth is important to me.  I work in a very large office setting and attend several meetings throughout the day.  With not having to worry about my breath and yellow teeth is an very important thing to me and by having the opportunity to try Crest Prohealth HD, since I have used Crest tooth paste for over 15 years, I know it is a brand that I can trust.  I know that having a great bright white smile helps improve my confidence level when I am in front of a group of co-workers.  Thanks to Crest and BzzAgent for allowing me this opportunity to document my experience with this product and help share my comments with others who are trying to reach the same ultimate goal of a healthy, clean and fresh mouth.  #Gotitfree</li>
            <li> Ok, so I have tried a lot of whitening products and they either didnt work at all or made my teeth so sensitive I couldn&#x27;t eat or drink anything without suffering. Crest Pro Health HD has been a breeze so far. I like that I only have to brush for a total of 2 minutes- one for each tube- no foaming mouth or slobbering! I have been using it for 2 days and I&#x27;ve gotta hand it to Crest...it is actually doing what it claims to do!</li>
            <li> I think Crest created quite the remarkable product with this 2-Step paste. It seems to be much more than that, though... This isn&#x27;t your run-of-the-mill toothpaste that you routinely apply to your toothbrush and start brushing away like a zombie with twice a day. No, in fact, it feels like an oral spa treatment with each use. I was pretty skeptical when I read that improvements would include a few shades whiter in a week, but I have to admit, that even through smoking and drinking coffee daily, I did receive a noticeably whiter smile. I had nothing to lose as this was offered free by Crest to me as a promotional sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first step (brushing for 1 minute with gray tube) feels like a tooth/gum exfoliation treatment. The paste has a gritty and minty consistency to it (don&#x27;t worry, it isn&#x27;t uncomfortable or painful at all) and brushes off plaque with ease and leaves a minty aftertaste. After that one minute, you rinse the toothbrush (but not your mouth! Leave whatever paste is in your mouth) and apply a bit of the blue tube to your brush. Another minute of brushing with this paste will leave a euphorically clean sensation all around your mouth. Your teeth and gums will feel much slicker and smoother, and your tongue will have a clean, fresh feeling. It really eliminates any bad breath on the spot and you feel dentist-clean. What&#x27;s more is that this second paste actually has a similar, if not identical taste that tooth whitening strips/paste have, so you know that this product is the real deal made from the same stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with this clean feeling, I did not notice a difference in the first 2 or 3 days. However, by the 7 or 8-day mark, there was a difference in the shade of my teeth (not astounding, but noticeable for sure), and now that I&#x27;ve been using this for close to a month, my teeth are even whiter still. Also, keep in mind I am still smoking, drinking coffee and wine, and this paste just keeps on helping to maintain the whitest smile my teeth can give.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the topic of bad morning breath, that is where I feel the product falls short. It hasn&#x27;t helped with mine, but I attribute that to acid reflux and smoking, so I&#x27;m not sure that this product was designed to combat either of those. It will rid you of morning breath after you brush in the morning, but if you are expecting to wake up in the morning with minty breath, this product doesn&#x27;t seem to offer that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, it works, you can feel it working, and with a little time you will see it working.eeth can give.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the topic of bad morning breath, that is where I feel the product falls short.

            <li> I received a free product to try for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own and I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I really didn&#x27;t think I would like this product because my teeth tend to be sensitive to other whitening products I have used. I have also tried the Crest Pro Health toothpaste and didn&#x27;t find that it cleaned my teeth very well. I have to say I was blown away by the results of the Crest Pro health HD system. In step 1 which is the cleaning part, it really does what it says. My teeth are dentist clean and they don&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; on them. The taste of the paste is also great and leaves my mouth feeling fresh. Step 2 is the whiting phase. This phase I was a bit concerned about because of sensitivity. I have to say I do not have any pain or sensitivity and  I feel this step whitens better than anything on the market. I have noticed a huge difference in the shade my teeth are and it has really helped with stains(coffee, tea etc.) I highly recommend this system to anyone who wants clean white teeth.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel really clean, but I do not see any whitening action so far.</li>
            <li> I have used this product 6 times now. I and I do notice a whiter smile. I have a calcium deficiency in my teeth so I i have a natural discoloration, something that I am embarrassed about. I have tried maby over the counter products to help whiten my smile and this one most certainly made my teeth whiter. But I&#x27;m very concerned that it&#x27;s ingredient list includes hydrogen  peroxide and they can ruin the enamel on your teeth. My enamel is already going away and I&#x27;m afraid that this product will do it faster. White teeth is important to me but my enamel is more important. Also, unlike other tooth pastes, I don&#x27;t get the crisps clean minty taste because it leaves a hydrogen peroxide foamy taste. Gross!</li>
            <li> I like this product - it adds another step to the traditional tooth brushing regime but I think the fresh, clean results are worth it.  I wish the cap on Step 2 was not a twist off but that&#x27;s my only gripe with the product.  If you&#x27;ve ever washed your face with any St Ives Face Scrub and experienced the way your face feels super polished and buffed out, this is how your teeth will feel.  I almost felt like I used a mild sand paper to buff out my teeth so you certainly will feel the difference right away - great for plaque removal. I tried this product free thanks to Crest. #BzzAgent</li>
            <li> At first thought the two steps would be a pain but it&#x27;s just a routine that has a nice ending....fresh, clean !!</li>
            <li> My teeth honestly feel so clean after I use this product.  I don&#x27;t have time for the whitening strips and they make my teeth sensitive.  The two-step process takes no time at all and left my mouth feeling - amazing!</li>
            <li> I received a free kit from Bzzagent to try out this product. I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes after the first time i used it. My teeth were SQUEAKY clean, i brushed my finger against them and they actually squeaked. They also looked whiter after the first use. After a week I had a dental cleaning, my hygienist was amazed at the results. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost a week now and there are 2 cons with this. The first is it takes about a minute or 2 longer than your normal brushing with having 2 pastes and also the first step leaves your mouth very dry. This bothers me a bit, but let me tell you the pluses for this makes it all worth it! This is by far the best toothpaste set I have ever used. My teeth feel nice and clean from the minute I brush until late at night after dinner. I can&#x27;t recommend you use this enough. As for the whitening I have been using whitening products for a while, so it is hard for me to see a clear difference, but I really do think it is working. Now go try this product, it really is great! Got it free from Bzz Agent for reviewing purposes!</li>
            <li> I absolutely must admit it gets no better than this for years i was using arm &amp; hammer with baking soda to get my pearly whites .But after i was giving a free sample to try by bzzagent i was hooked.I am ordering a extra pack and from now on this is my toothpaste of choice for my pearly whites .After all whats a face without a clean and bright smile.MUST HAVE IN ANY PERSONS BATHROOM IF YOU VALUE YOUR TEETH AND APPERANCE</li>
            <li> Seems to work as described...have been using for three weeks and I notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this toothpaste!  I am an avid drinker of black coffee, unsweet black tea and red wine...the 3 worst things for staining your teeth. I&#x27;m also really busy and rarely have time to complete a cycle of Crest White Strips. With this two-step toothpaste, I am able to whiten while brushing and see immediate results. It was weird at first not being able to rinse after using the toothpaste but before using the polisher....but now I&#x27;m used to it.  The hydrogen peroxide content is high because after the first two times I had white spots on my gums. That has since subsided (same thing happens with white strips).</li>
            <li> This product left my teeth feeling and looking good, but there were some things about the product that I&#x27;m not 100% sold on. The first tube you use has a &amp;#34;wintergreen&amp;#34; taste -- not one of my favorite flavors. The second tube cuts the wintergreen taste almost immediately, so that helped, and the fresh feeling it left lingered after finally being able to rinse! The second issue I had was how long the process took and I found it to be a bit messy. Maybe it&#x27;s how I brush my teeth, but it seemed like the first tube foamed more than regular toothpaste, so I had it running down the toothbrush onto my hand. I liked the end result, but on a busy morning, it took a little bit too much time and effort to use two different products to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Aside from whitening strips, this is the single best product I&#x27;ve found for whitening my teeth. I like it so much, I purchased it for my girlfriend and daughter, both of whom have seen great results as well.</li>
            <li> I recently received a sample of Crest Pro Health HD from Crest to try out.&lt;br /&gt;I do like the freshness this product gives, but after a week I didn&#x27;t really notice any whitening benefits. I will continue to use it because I like the taste. Not sure if I would pay for more.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not Crest Pro Health HD actually whitens my teeth with their new two step whitening process. The taste isn&#x27;t great and you have to brush your teeth twice instead of once but it&#x27;s worth it to get whiter teeth that get slightly darkened from coffee. I definitely recommend trying it out and thanks for letting my try this product out Crest!</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro Health HD for about 2 weeks and I can already see a visibly whiter smile.  I am a big coffee drinker and the process has whitened my teeth several shades.  The product is much easier to use than the trays or strips and seems to have great results.  The process may seem a little strange but it is really easy.  Basically you just brush twice for one minute each time with the two gels.  This has a great taste and it makes your teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro Health HD for free from BzzAgent.  I am really impressed by this product.  First, the system:  there are 2 tubes.  The first one is the actual cleaner -- it&#x27;s minty and tastes like normal toothpaste -- not quite as minty as the Crest Scope, but it still is refreshing.  You have to brush for one minute with this paste.  Then you spit, but don&#x27;t rinse.  And then you put the second paste on your toothbrush, and brush for one more minute with this one.  This tube is a gel, clear, and it&#x27;s the whitener/polisher.  It also has a good flavor.  Once you&#x27;re done, you spit and rinse as usual.  I have to say, after about 5 days of using this, I think my teeth are looking whiter.  Not dramatically so, but there is definitely a difference in the brightness.  I was worried about sensitivity, because I have sensitive teeth, but it has not bothered me at all.  Another perk to this system is that is forces me to actually brush for a full 2 minutes -- as opposed to just a quick brush -- it makes me more conscious of using the 1st tube for about a minute, and then the second part.  So that is an added benefit for sure!  I&#x27;ve always used Crest Scope, but I would buy this toothpaste instead, especially if my teeth continue to whiten.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste made my mouth feel really clean and I noticed whiter teeth after just one use. The effects improve over time, but it&#x27;s nice to get that initial boost right off the bat, so if you&#x27;re heading out for a date or something, this will give you some impact just the first time. What I noticed most about this two step toothpaste was how clean my teeth felt after only one use. Like a fresh from the dentist kind of clean. I really liked how smooth my teeth felt from the polishing step. I have sensitive teeth, and while this isn&#x27;t a toothpaste FOR sensitive teeth, it didn&#x27;t aggravate or bother my teeth or gums at all. I would definitely buy this product, though I was provided a free sample to review.</li>
            <li> My mouth definitely felt fresher after a week and my teeth physically felt smoother and more polished. However, the extra step a little annoying in the morning when I was trying to get going and the peroxide flavor was fine while brushing, you definitely need to wait a bit before eating/drinking.</li>
            <li> I received this for free from BzzAgent to try and I was not disappointed.  I have very yellow teeth from years of drinking coffee, wine and soda, and after 3 weeks of use my teeth are definitely whiter.  It is a simple procedure that only takes 2 minutes at a time. Step 1 tastes great, step 2 doesn&#x27;t have a great taste but it is better than using white strips or a whitening gel kit.  Are my teeth bright white after a month, absolutely not, but Crest Pro Health HD definitely has them whiter than they were before.</li>
            <li> I could notice a difference the first time I used Crest Pro Health HD. My teeth actually felt cleaner - you know, that feeling you get when you leave the dentist, where your teeth are squeaky clean? Yup, that&#x27;s how I felt. I also like the polishing gel, since it hasn&#x27;t made my teeth sensitive, but I do feel like they look whiter. The only slight downside was that I might have applied too much whitening paste to my gums, as one spot is slightly sensitive. Also, you do get some white spots on your gums for a few brief seconds, which I believe is part of the peroxide in the whitening paste. I did receive this sample of Crest HD free from Crest. I am looking forward to it becoming available for purchase!</li>
            <li> I love the dentist clean feeling I get after using Crest Pro-Health HD Two-Step Toothpaste.  As a Bzzagent I was sent a free sample by Crest and couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to use and how white my teeth looked after just four days of use.  The best part for me was that in the past when I used whiteners my teeth became sensitive to cold very easily and after just a couple of uses of the product.  I&#x27;ve been using Crest Pro-Health HD for more than a week now twice a day and my teeth do not feel any sensitivity.  This is a bonus perk for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest mistake I made was telling my kids and husband about Crest Pro-Heath HD because now I&#x27;m almost out as they&#x27;ve been using it (and they hate brushing).  They are all amazed at how easy the process is: brush for one minute with step 1 then brush for one minute with step 2 and rinse.  Also, they love that same dentist clean feeling that got me hooked.  I logged into Amazon to buy some and was disappointed to see it was not available.  Hopefully my grocery store or pharmacy will have it in stock since now we are all addicted and Crest Pro-Health HD is the only toothpaste we will use from now on.</li>
            <li> Despite the daily brushing of my teeth, the smile reflected back at me from my mirror was something I was less than pleased with.  I had heard about whitening products, but thought they were either too pricey or took too much time to use.  When Bzz Agent offered me a chance to try a product that could whiten my teeth as I brushed my teeth, I took up their offer immediately.&lt;br /&gt;  When the package of Colgate Pro Health HD toothpaste arrived I noticed something different about this product than other products I had seen.  Instead of mixing the whitening agent into the toothpaste and selling it as one product , I noticed that this product came in  two separate tubes.  To avoid confusion of which bottle to use first, not only were the tubes in different colors, but they are marked as &amp;#34;STEP 1&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;STEP 2&amp;#34;.  The colorful packaging claimed to make my teeth healthier and whiter in a week, so I decided to take up the challenge and see for myself if this was true.&lt;br /&gt;  Surprisingly, it took very little time to get adjusted to using two different tubes of toothpaste instead of one.  The silver tube, &amp;#34;STEP 1&amp;#34;, was the &amp;#34;purifying cleanser&amp;#34; and used for taking off the plaque from the teeth.  You are suppose to brush for one minute with this product and just spit it out, not rinse out your mouth and spit out. There is a slight minty taste to this light blue gel and your mouth will feel a little grainy after just spitting out &amp;#34;STEP 1&amp;#34;, but it will shortly go away when you have finished the next step. &amp;#34;STEP 2&amp;#34;, the blue tube, was the &amp;#34;perfecting gel&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s job was to polish and whiten your teeth.  This clear gel has more of a peppermint smell to it and after one minute of use you are suppose to rinse and spit it out.&lt;br /&gt;  The verdict?  After one week of using this product, not only have I noticed a whiter smile, but my family has as well. It feels normal having two separate tubes instead of one tube to use to brush my teeth with. My teeth feel cleaner and plaque forms less frequently on my teeth than it use to.  I do wish that my mouth felt mintier and fresher though.  My teeth may feel cleaner , but I feel more self conscious with my breath because the toothpaste needs to be a bit stronger in the mint department for my preferences.  Since there is no price for this product at the moment I am writing this review, I can not compare the price value to the product value, but if I were to to put a price I would pay for this product it would be  $5-$6.&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you BZZ Agent for allowing my to try the Crest Pro Health HD whitening toothpaste system and hopefully my review will assist the rest of you in making your purchasing decision.teeth with.

            <li> First, I would say that I received a trial of this product free from Crest as a buzzagent. But don&#x27;t let that fool you, this product really works. I have tried other &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; toothpastes before, but they either didn&#x27;t work well or caused me a lot of discomfort since I have very sensitive teeth. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 1 month now and the results are amazing. My teeth are noticeably whiter, so much so that my wife has even commented. She started steeling my toothpaste because she was so impressed with the results. Also, my oldest son has always had problems with teeth staining (since he was a toddler eating prunes). I know he&#x27;s self conscience about the color of his teeth. I had him start trying this and within a few days, I could already notice a difference. He&#x27;s been using it for weeks now and his teeth are looking white for the first time in his life. If you have issues with morning breath (don&#x27;t we all?), want whiter teeth, or have sensitive teeth and need a whitener that won&#x27;t cause pain, give Crest Pro Health HD a try.</li>
            <li> So I received this to review...  I have been using it for a week.  I drink coffee daily and had a few light stains.  In the past I have used lightening strips.  This did the work of the strips in just a few days.  Plus, my teeth FELT clean after the first use.  I love this stuff.  The mint isn&#x27;t over powering, but you definitely feel fresh.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> First, it is a PAIN to travel with. Not one, but two tubes. Second the second tube tastes like gel Clorox. Didn&#x27;t try to wash the sink, but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I just didn&#x27;t like this. Halfway through I hated it and was about to toss out, since it had been given to me to try...but husband reclaimed. He went from &amp;#34;It&#x27;s okay&amp;#34; to hating it too.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical having to brush twice but i trust Crest so I gave it a shot I have to say this is the best I have ever tried.  I feel like I have come from a dental cleaning of course without the pain.  My teeth have never felt or look more cleaner.  My have never tingled or felt so fresh and clean .  I love it .  Now I can fully smile with confidence because of how clean my mouth feels. My teeth have never been whiter ...more white than any other whitening paste.  I received a free product for the purpose of my review from Crest . Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> It leaves my mouth feeling cleaner than with regular toothpastes. My teeth are noticeably whiter. I like it.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use and makes my teeth very shiny and clean feeling. My teeth are whiter every day! Fast easy and great minty taste. The product is great and I would buy it for myself.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of deep cleaning and polishing but the taste makes it so I can not endure the one minute treatment of each.</li>
            <li> I really loved this product! The smell and taste were fresh but not overpowering and the two-step process really didn&#x27;t take any more time than my usual brushing routine. I felt as if my mouth was more fresh when I awoke in the morning and that the fresh feeling lasted longer into the day than with my normal Colgate toothpaste. As far as whitening capabilities I have mostly crowns in the front of my mouth so I didn&#x27;t notice a huge change in the color of my teeth. I did receive this product as part of a BzzAgent campaign but plan on repurchasing in the future!</li>
            <li> I got the Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste to sample for free via Bzzzagent. The first time I tried it, I felt that my teeth were cleaner that ever. The instructions were so simple and the best part is that it promises not only to clean the teeth and freshen breath but it also has the ability to whiten the teeth. What else is better than this.</li>
            <li> When I used as directed my teeth felt incredibly clean even hours later, which I liked a lot. I tried it even though the thought of having so much fluoride was a bit intimidating since I know that there are health concerns in the alternative health field</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent, I get to try it for free! I&#x27;m over 7 days into switching to Crest HD health and I&#x27;m starting to notice a difference! My teeth are more noticeably white. I enjoy the mint flavor or step on and it really isn&#x27;t hard to add in the process of step two. I&#x27;m excited that this can help reduce/reverse gingivitis as well!</li>
            <li> As a big coffee drinker, I jumped at the chance to try out a promotional sample of the Crest HD teeth whitening products.  The things that appealed to me about this product included the quick action whitening (with noticeable effects within a week), the emphasis on gingivitis reduction, and the relative ease of use.  The product required simply two minutes of brushing; one minute with the purifying cleanser, and one minute with the perfecting gel.  I found this system to be a much better alternative to whitening strips or other harsher whitening methods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically when I shop for toothpaste I am torn between \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; tooth pastes or overall oral health toothpastes.  The great part about the Crest HD is you get the benefits of both products in one package.  The majority of regular whitening toothpastes contain sodium fluoride as the activity ingredient for fighting cavities.  The Crest HD product contains stannous fluoride as the active ingredient which not only helps prevent cavities, but also has antibacterial properties which helps fight plaque, protect against gingivitis, and helps reduce tooth sensitivity (beyond that of sodium fluoride).  To me this is a win-win.  You get overall improved oral health benefits and tooth whitening in one product.  I have previously been told I have early stages of gingivitis so opting for a whitening product, which also contains stannous fluoride, combines exactly what I am looking for in a toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the product for one week following the steps on the package.  I did notice a difference from the beginning in that my mouth did actually \\&quot;feel\\&quot; cleaner and healthier after brushing with the HD product compared to my regular toothpaste.  After one week I noticed improvements in whitening but it is difficult to assess as a full 6x whiter.  The taste of the step 1 toothpaste was as expected of any normal mint toothpaste.  The gel used in Step 2 reminded me of the old gel fluoride treatments that dentists used to give after a cleaning.  Personally, I find the taste of the gel a turnoff, but it would not prevent me from using the product in the future.  I would recommend this product to others seeking a whitening toothpaste that also has the benefits of improving oral health.s used to give after a cleaning.

            <li> I was able to try this new product out thanks to Crest and I LOVE it! Leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean, not to mention my family and friends around me have noticed my brighter smile! At first I was a little skeptical that I had to brush for 2 whole minutes, but it is what I should be doing anyway! And now I actually enjoy it because I know I am getting great results!</li>
            <li> I receive a free sample via bzzz agent to try and had high hopes. Does this product deliver significantly whiter teeth? YES. Did i notice better morning breath? YES. Why the three star rating? The increased sensitivity of my teeth which weren&#x27;t that sensitive before offset the benefits significantly, to the point where I had to debate if it was worth using the product. This product truly does what it promises it whitens teeth and gives you that clean mouth feel in two easy steps with better morning breath. I tried this product for two weeks straight hoping for a decrease in sensitivity. While I did notice whiter teeth without having to use the white strips (a huge plus), I found myself straying away from cold items and sweeter items as well because my teeth were suddenly much more sensitive. While I think I may use this intermittently, For touch ups on my teeth, in no way will this become my go to. I felt like it was too harsh for my teeth and having never really experienced extreme sensitivity before, its an experience I do not care to consistently have.</li>
            <li> For years, I paid for professional teeth whitening with my dentist.  As I no longer use the bleaching trays, I often look for products that I can use to whiten minor stains from drinking tea, coffee, and soda.  Crest Pro-Health HD is an okay product, but do not expect dramatic results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:  The two step process is very easy to use, and it does not add any additional time to my daily routine.  The first tube is used for one minute and cleans plaque from the teeth. After using step one, my teeth felt super clean.  Step two is a one minute gel that whitens and polishes teeth.  After using the second tube, my teeth felt smooth, much like leaving from my six month dental exam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did not like:  First of all, the taste of the paste and gel leave much to be desired.  Neither were as refreshing as a normal mint paste or gel, so I was excited to rinse after step 2.  My biggest complaint is that the product advertises that teeth can be up to six times whiter with use.  After a month of use, I have noticed my teeth are slightly whiter, but not as much as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an over the counter whitener and can purchase it for a reasonable price, I recommend this one of other teeth whiteners.  While results are likely to vary, the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step system is worth trying.  In addition, Crest offers a money back guarantee to customers who are not satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest I got to try out this cool new 2 Step Toothpaste system! I have pretty sensitive teeth, so the white strips/tray systems don’t work very well for me.  Plus, they tend to be very messy.  So having a 2 step toothpaste was a much better option for me! The taste of the toothpaste was great! Not overly minty but still fresh, which I loved.  I have only been using it for a few weeks but I can definitely tell my teeth feel cleaner. I will have to wait to see how much the whiteness is improved. The only strange thing I noticed with the toothpaste was that after you are done with step 1 there is a chalky like texture left in your mouth, so I really felt forced to use step 2.  I don’t think you can just use Step 1 only. I was thinking Step 1 would be more of a classic toothpaste and 2 would be the whitening step, but I think you really do need to use both every time.  My only downside is the time it takes to do 2 steps. In reality, I should probably be taking that long to brush my teeth normally, so maybe this is a good thing!  It is definitely a great option for me!</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. The item did a good cleaning my mouth. Better than regular tooth paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Odd after feel in my mouth. As though I ate an unripe fruit. I did not notice any whitening effect after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of the Crest Pro Health HD and have been using it for a month now, and my teeth have never looked better.  The kit is really easy to use and leaves my mouth feeling clean and refreshed.  I was a little skeptical that it would be able to do much for my teeth because I drink a lot of sodas but I can really see a change in my teeth.  The kit is really easy to use just brush with the first tube for 1 minute.  First tube feels like regular toothpaste then without rinsing your brush or mouth switch to the second tube for the whitening and brush with that for a minute.  Couldn&#x27;t be any simpler</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product - I really enjoy the two step process. Each steps makes me feel more involved in dental care than just standing around brushing for 2 minutes as I&#x27;ve done for decades and what is traditionally recommended. The time actually went quicker. I liken it to cleaning my face, with multiple steps it&#x27;s easy to be engaged in it.  I probably paid more attention to the health of my teeth than ever before and have grown to realize my teeth deserve the attention.  If we go to such pains to buy expensive facial products, why not do it with our teeth too? I really have enjoyed it.  In the morning my breath isn&#x27;t nearly as bad.  This is an expensive product, but compared to facial care, it&#x27;s even more important for the long term.  Beauty fades anyway but our teeth hopefully don&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ll buy this product regularly from now on.</li>
            <li> I have been actively looking for a good toothpaste for a while. I do have sensitive teeth so any product that whitens my teeth leaves me with a huge headache the day after. When I received Crest pro health HD as part of the Bzzagent campaign I was a little reluctant to try it.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I followed the instructions to bruch with one toothpaste for a minute and then use the whitening gel for another minute. The next day I saw a big difference in my smile. My teeth were whiter. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks already so I can be sure that the results are lasting and that I indeed see results. I&#x27;m very happy I gave it a try as my smile is much brighter. I even had my fianc&amp;eacute;e try it. He&#x27;s been a smoker last year and his teeth were a little yellow. He also noticed that his teeth are much whiter.&lt;br /&gt;For me the biggest value is in giving me a night white smile without the headache.&lt;br /&gt;I am recommending this product to anyone looking for healthy and white teeth without sensitivity.</li>
            <li> This product was great! I think it definitely improved my overall look and made my teeth whiter.  The only think I did not like was the two step process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**This product was given to me free to try.</li>
            <li> Recently, I received the Crest ProHealth HD kit for testing purposes. I have to say, I didn&#x27;t love it. It&#x27;s two steps, which I feel is fairly cumbersome for something as simple as brushing your teeth and the first step contains Stannous Fluoride which can actually stain your teeth versus whitening them. According to my dental hygienist, stannous fluoride should be avoided. Also, my teeth actually hurt immediately after use while rinsing. I only used it twice before giving up.</li>
            <li> Disclosure: I was given this product by Crest for review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;In all honesty, this toothpaste pushed me to brush for the two whole minutes one is supposed to brush. I know I&#x27;m not alone when I say that sometimes I&#x27;m just too rushed in the morning and too tired and so ready to sleep a night that I may not always brush for two whole minutes. This toothpaste though has split both aspects of the ordinary toothpaste and each gives magnified results that regular toothpastes don&#x27;t give. My teeth feel clean every time and everyone comments on my pearly whites. I liked that this also allowed me to have white teeth without having to use white strips which often times have made my teeth extra sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have been using the new Crest Pro Health HD for about a week now and I am very happy with the product.  I received it as part of a BzzAgent campaign (www.bzzagent.com. It is 2 steps which may seem like a pain, but trust me.....it is quick, painless and the results are great!!  I just love not having that fuzzy feeling on my teeth.....you know that feeling, especially in the back of your teeth.  It is gone.  You will notice that your mouth feels cleaner in the morning!!  The first step cleans away plaque and the polish...oh my, it really feels like you just got out of the dentist&#x27;s chair after a cleaning.  Give it a try....you will NOT be sorry!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying this free thanks to Crest! I was super exited for this because I love having whiter teeth but I hate the whitening strips- I figured this would be awesome!&lt;br /&gt;The process is easy- 1 minute of brushing with the Crest HD toothpaste followed by 1 min of brushing with what I assume is a whitening gel. Your teeth feel great after, and neither of the pastes/gels are unpleasant tasting. It does make your mouth feel a little sensitive, as do most whitening products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;I did it for five days, every night before I went to bed and by the fifth day, my gums really hurt. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s from brushing a lot longer than I usually would (I estimate I usually take 30-45 seconds to brush my teeth, as opposed to 2 minutes) or from the harshness of the whitening gel. I took a 3 day break and started again, and so far no pain. I&#x27;m trying to brush a little more gently, because I really love Crest and I&#x27;d love for this to work out.&lt;br /&gt;As for their claim that it works in a week- I&#x27;m gonna disagree. After 5 days in a row, I could only very slightly tell that my teeth were whiter.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both had a chance to use this product. After just 1 week we both noticed that our teeth felt much cleaner and the shade had more brightness.  Overall very impressed with the product for the price. This is the first whitening product I have ever used to.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I received this free as part of a promotion and I authentically like the product. It takes a little getting used to with the multiple steps. It will make your mouth feel really clean, but a little raw. I felt like I had just eaten a bowl of Captain Crunch or chewed up a dozen toothpicks. The feeling goes away pretty fast and decreased over a couple weeks. It does make you teeth look a bit whiter after one use, but not as dramatic as white strips do. The results compound over time when it comes to the whitening but stop when you hit a certain point. What I really like about it though is that you get whitening without having to do much more that you have done your whole life. It whitens down by the gums when the strips don&#x27;t and you don&#x27;t have to sit around without talking for 20 minutes. You also don&#x27;t have to mess with brushing product on like nail polish or holding a blue light to your teeth so it gets points for convenience. My teeth look whiter than anything a regular whitening toothpaste ever did, but not enough for my husband to notice a difference. I can see it though and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li> I received this recently from Bzz Agent and Crest for trial, and honestly I love it! I use this two step kit every morning along with my Crest whitening toothpaste at night, and I could feel a whole lot of different in the cleanliness of my teeth!!!! and it added more whitening for sure. I am planning on adding the whitening strips to my routine to see more whitening difference!!! Crest in the best</li>
            <li> There are a lot of reasons to love this product, but the immediate gratification of no more morning breath is forefront in my mind!  I have only used the product twice but I can tell a difference already.  It&#x27;s a simple process, used the paste first and then follow-up with the gel, without rinsing in between.  Not that different than my normal routine, I frequently have to add more paste to my brush to get a really clean mouth feel anyway.  I am facing surgery for gum erosion so I am very in touch with how my mouth and teeth feel.  They&#x27;ve never felt better!  I can&#x27;t wait to see how they feel after a full week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product free as part of a Bzz Agent campaign, but I will be adding it to my regular grocery list when it is depleted.</li>
            <li> This a quick alternative to whitening strips.  It is a two step product that takes 2 mins twice a day. The results are noticeable within just a few days, but the clean fresh feeling is immediate. I was able to try a full size sample for free and being a fan of crest whitening strips I was excited to try out this new product. This is a simple alternative and doesn&#x27;t add any extra time to your daily routine (unless you don&#x27;t brush your teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also liked that this product did not cause the sensitivity issues I have had with other whitening products. This product is a great value for quick results.</li>
            <li> I just started using Crest Pro Health HD and after 4 uses, I can already see a difference in the shade of my teeth! The two step process is easy and leaves my teeth feeling clean and sparkling!  Step 1 (the cleanser) feels different from the normal toothpaste. You can almost feel little bubbles scrubbing decay away and then Step 2 (the gel) polishes your teeth and makes your mouth feel spotless. I have received numerous comments from friends and family already asking if I got my teeth professionally whitened. I LOVE this product</li>
            <li> I got this product thru bzzagent at no charge so that I can review it and give it my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the product for about 2 weeks now, the product comes in a carboard bubble containing 2 different tubes, tube #1 must be used to brush your teeth for one minute and acts as the cleanser, this product is fantastic, when you Finish brushing with it your mouth and teeth feel just as clean and smooth as when you get a professional cleaning, after a minute you must spit but not rinse, because you must apply the second product now and brush for an additional minute, this is the whitener, but it is more difficult to apply because it tends to fall of the  brush, the flavor of booth products is pleasant and as I said before your teeth feel amazing, I haven&#x27;t seen a radical change in the color of my teeth, but my husband has, maybe my teeth can only get this white! I would definetly recommend this product to anyone who wants a cleaner feeling that lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t felt any sensitivity on my gums or teeth for using it, but the box does warn that it can happen, I love it and will keep on using it, maybe longer use will get better results in the whiting department</li>
            <li> I have never felt my teeth so clean. Ever. Even after leaving the dentist my gums and teeth never felt this clean. I&#x27;m an avid coffee drinker so usually by the time I get home my breath and teeth feel a little nasty even after chewing gum. This left my teeth plaque free all day! I didn&#x27;t believe the hype at first about it whiten your teeth in 6 days but rest assured if that&#x27;s the main reason your buying this, you will see results. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received the Crest Pro-Health HD for free, and just had to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, there are two steps to its usage, but they are simple to follow. Step one, you brush your teeth with cleanser that is very similar to regular toothpaste for one minute to clean your teeth. Make sure you only spit after this first step without rinsing because you need to move on to step two. In step two you brush with a whitening solution for another minute. After one week, your teeth should be 6x white and 6x healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, how did it go? Well, it went well. Here are some pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I didn&#x27;t notice a huge improvement in whiteness, and the solutions left somewhat of a bad taste in my mouth. If you have sensitive teeth this may also hurt your gums or teeth for a little while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: While there wasn&#x27;t a huge improvement in whiteness, there was an improvement nonetheless. The idea that you had to brush for one minute with each step was also beneficial as it caused me to focus on the time versus just a quick (too-quick according to many dental studies) brush like I commonly did before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, buy it and try it. It is not a miracle cure, but it is better than your average whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It works! I can see the improvement after about 1-2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I love this product. After the first use my teeth felt smoother and cleaner. After a couple of days my friends started asking what I did to get my teeth so white.  I haven&#x27;t experienced any sensitivity as I had with other whitening products.</li>
            <li> I tried the new crest HD system as part of a bzzcampaign.  I noticed a cleaner feeling right away and a definite whiter smile in a few days.</li>
            <li> So, first off, did Crest Pro Health HD make my teeth whiter?  I think the answer to that is, &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34; (see before and after pics attached).  Did it make my teeth &amp;#34;6 shades whiter&amp;#34;?  I&#x27;ll let you be the judge, but I think not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I drink a lot of coffee in any given day.  I know that by the end of the day, my teeth (and breath) are in need of attention.  I typically use Crest Pro Health toothpaste, because I like how clean it makes my mouth feel.  Having an opportunity to try new Crest Pro Health HD through BzzAgent seemed ideal!  I know my teeth could use some whitening, and using a brand I already know and like?  Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two-step system is pretty simple, except for one little thing.  One is advised to use each of the two products for one minute each, but I use a Sonicare toothbrush that is programmed with a two-minute brush cycle.  I can turn it off early, but I would feel like I wasn&#x27;t cleaning my teeth properly.  So I ended up using each product for two minutes each.  Four minutes has never felt SO LONG.  It sounds ridiculous, but it&#x27;s true.  4 minutes of tooth brushing is pretty excessive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Step 1 product I like a lot.  The taste is good, and it makes my mouth feel fresh and clean (as does Crest Pro Health toothpaste in, um...regular definition, I guess).  Step 2?  It&#x27;s basically hydrogen peroxide in a gel suspension with artificial sweetener added.  You know how peroxide fizzes and gives a sort of burning sting on contact?  It&#x27;s pretty much the same thing in your mouth.  It&#x27;s not unbearably unpleasant, but I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s great.  The tip of my tongue sometimes felt a bit of a burn while using it (though this ended immediately upon rinsing).  The white spots one is warned of on the label on gums and soft tissue DO appear, but I wasn&#x27;t alarmed at all since I&#x27;m well aware of how hydrogen peroxide operates.  TOTALLY harmless, and disappears quickly--so no worries--but in the interest of full disclosure...  My husband tried it once and hated the taste--didn&#x27;t use it again.  I didn&#x27;t mind it that much, and I have used both steps for about a week and a half now.  I haven&#x27;t noticed dramatic continued whitening beyond that of the first few uses, but it cleans my teeth well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is, it did seem to whiten my teeth a bit, which I am always happy about--and I didn&#x27;t experience any increase in the sensitivity of my teeth to heat/cold at all.  The bad news is, I&#x27;m not sure this is a perfect system for everyone.  Two steps means more on the bathroom counter (or to pack in a travel case), more time spent brushing one&#x27;s teeth (I have 3 young kids, so I sometimes feel lucky to manage the basics of personal hygiene), and the whole slight fizzing issue...  Overall, I say it&#x27;s worth a try--and you can see the pictures of my results below.  The first picture I featured is my teeth at the end of the day before brushing at all (nasty and yellowed from my caffeine habit), while the second is my teeth after using Crest Pro Health HD for a full week, twice daily.  No filters, same lighting, etc.  I wanted to include this to let anyone considering Crest Pro Health HD judge for themselves the results.  $16 retail for the 2 step system isn&#x27;t a big investment for teeth whitening, though it is pretty expensive for toothpaste.  I will use all of the Crest Pro Health HD system until it&#x27;s gone, but after that I will likely return to the single step Crest Pro Health Whitening paste that I like best.tried it once and hated the taste--didn&#x27;t use it again.

            <li> I recently switched to a sonicare electric toothbrush from a regular toothbrush and this toothpaste system seems to be perfect for it. I received the product as part of a promotion from Crest. Although it takes a couple of times to get used to using two different toothpastes, it was definitely worth it. It leaves my teeth feeling clean and smooth. It is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> i recived Crest Pro Health® HD free to try and review for free, its a 2 step system for cleaning and polishing your teeth, it seemed like a lot of work to me but it is really not you just use step one which is a purifying cleanser that uses Stannous Fluoride to remove plaque ,spit that out and put a little of step 2 which is a gel that polishes and whitens on your brush and go on brushing the whole thing took 2 min of my time and gave me results that i get from a dentist trip with no dentist no waiting and no appointments it did work wonders with me my only complain would be the taste of the polishing gel that&#x27;s why i gave it four stars but its is an amazing product</li>
            <li> Wow, this product was great!!! I noticed a different in just one brushing! After using it just a week my teeth have gone from yellow to white. It is easy to use and only takes 4 minutes if you use it 2 times a day. It does not make my teeth sensitive. My teenage daughters have also used it and love it. I am trying this product for free to try and review. This is a product that I will be buy to use on a regular bases. I am hooked!</li>
            <li> I got a free sample via BzzAgent to try this product and am so glad it happened. I spend a decent amount (7-8.00) on toothpaste normally and do not see the results that I saw in a DAY with Crest Pro-Health HD. So this is a product that actually does what it promises as far as whitening, does not take any more time that your normal brushing needs are now and doesn&#x27;t have that awful taste whiteners have at times. I will keep buying this product for as long as it keeps delivering the same results!</li>
            <li> Let me start off saying that this is probably a fantastic product for SOMEONE ELSE!  If you love that just from the dentist feeling, you will certainly get it from this toothpaste system but I cannot speak to how well it whitens, since I must discontinue use immediately. I received the product to try for free, so I used it, but I don&#x27;t think I can use it more than one time. It made my gums bleed a little bit, my tongue very sore, and my teeth hurt. My mouth is also painfully dry after one use. I may be allergic or otherwise sensitive to something in this product. The science behind the product is sound. Fluoride in step one for clean, strong, healthy teeth, and peroxide and whiteners for a gleaming smile. It should work wonders for someone else. If you have sensitive teeth or a sensitive mouth, you might want to avoid this one. I brushed my teeth this morning and then had breakfast and lunch and my mouth still feels dentist fresh, but unfortunately I won&#x27;t find out how well it will whiten. I would recommend you speak with your dentist if you are considering this product and if he/she thinks you should try it, then go for it! It just wasn&#x27;t right for me.</li>
            <li> I was provided with a full sized sample of crest ProHealth HD from the BzzAgent program.  I have been concerned about plaque build-up and its impact on my teeth and gums, so the product arrived in the mail at a perfect time for me.  The process did not take long at all-apply one paste to your toothbrush and brush for 1 minute, spit without rinsing, and then repeat the process with a different paste.  My teeth felt markedly cleaner, and I also noticed a improvement in the whiteness and brightness of my teeth after only a few days use.  My mouth tingled a bit after use, but it was not painful at all.  I thought that my moth felt cleaner throughout the day, and even after waking up in the morning.  My only complaint is the price-I hope that Crest will come out with high value coupons for this product.</li>
            <li> Wow I have been a crest fan for years but this has honestly changed my relationship with my toothpaste routine. I drink red wine, and tea, and a ton of coffee, on the daily. Well I got this through BzzAgent and after two days even my husband wanted to use it. People noticed I was smiling a lot more and showing off my teeth which I&#x27;m normally too shy to do. I had braces which ruined my enamel and white strips and all that make my teeth sensitive but not this stuff. Results were noticeable after the first try and if i managed to quit my bad habits I&#x27;m pretty sure my teeth would be whiter than they have been in years. Alas this is not the case but they definitely have gotten one shade lighter and they managed to stay that way with me using this so instead of paying $500 for a treatment. I&#x27;m so happy I bought one for everyone in my family. My husband really likes this too so I&#x27;m doubly happy and we are both smiling a lot more lately.</li>
            <li> I got this free from Bzzagent.  I gotta say, my teeth have never felt cleaner and it does gradually whiten your teeth.  And, because it&#x27;s 2 applications in the same session, you don&#x27;t forget to do it AND you brush more, which is also better.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free from Crest to try. I am not sure why these two can&#x27;t be in the same tube, but I am willing to try this one out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really it doesn&#x27;t take any more time than my usual brushing so I am keeping up with it. The Step 1 part leaves my teeth feeling rough once I am finished brushing with it so I am sure happy that Step 2 makes me teeth super smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say I get that &#x27;fresh from the dentist&#x27; feel from it much more that just regular toothpaste. And honestly, it does last through the day. My teeth feel smooth and clean even up to when I do my nightly brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flavors aren&#x27;t overwhelming. Step 2 smells and taste like other whitening products. Step 1 has a nice minty taste that doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I am starting to see whiter teeth just a few days in! Perfect timing for my wedding.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I tried professional bleach, and my teeth began to hurt terribly.  I wanted something to work just as well, but without the pain of bleach.  This is great.  My teeth are whiter and I feel it is much safer.  Got this as a free trial from Crest through BzzAgent which makes it all the more better!!!</li>
            <li> I started using Crest Pro-Health HD after receiving it through BzzAgent.  The two step process made me slightly hesitant as did the fact that you don&#x27;t rinse after step 1.  However, both of these concern quickly became a non-issue.  The toothpaste (both steps) has a light flavor.  Some toothpastes can be overwhelming with the mint flavor but this is subtle which I loved.  I also really love the way my teeth feel after.  I get that post-dentist office feeling which is great.  I&#x27;ve been using the toothpaste for about 2 weeks now and I&#x27;m not sure I am seeing a difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  Thankfully, that&#x27;s not the main thing I&#x27;m looking for and this toothpaste gets it right with the fresh, clean feeling I get after I brush.</li>
            <li> I got to try this out for free from Crest through BzzAgent, and so far I&#x27;m pleased with it. I have been a Crest Vivid White and then 3D White toothpaste user for several years now as I&#x27;ve found it to be the best whitening toothpaste with a pleasant taste. I also supplement with Crest white strips every 6 months or so to keep my smile at its brightest. As in my experience before, Crest&#x27;s whitening products don&#x27;t disappoint and this just adds to it. To me this is in between the power of the 3D white toothpaste and a white strip. I don&#x27;t know of I&#x27;d use this twice a day because of the whitening product and possible sensitivity, but it&#x27;s a revitalizing way to whiten up maybe at night only or just a few times a week. It definitely leaves a noticeable difference even after just one use. I can&#x27;t speak on the health aspect as I historically have had very healthy teeth from regular brushing, flossing, and cleanings.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this toothpaste. My mouth has never felt cleaner and my teeth are definitely whiter by a few shades and I have only used it for a few weeks. Will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> So, as a BzzAgent, I was really excited to try this product for free. Whiter teeth without trays or strips in a week? Excellent! As a busy mom of two, I don&#x27;t have time to deal with that stuff. I received my kit and tried it out immediately. It was a little odd not rinsing between brushing and switching pastes, but I got used to the routine quickly. A week later, and my teeth are definitely whiter! Total win, right? Not so much. First, the paste tastes really chalky in your mouth when you&#x27;re brushing. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the different fluoride or the whitening formulation, but...ick. Not a fan. Second, brushing your teeth for two minutes is probably what everyone should be doing regardless of what toothpaste they&#x27;re using, but it feels like a *really* long time, especially when you&#x27;re tired and want to go to bed. (See above note about being a mom of two.) Third, and perhaps most importantly, the toothpaste has given me two large canker sores in my mouth. Nothing else about my diet or health has changed, so I have to assume it&#x27;s from changing my toothpaste. I&#x27;ve since discontinued use of the product and doubt I will use it in the future because of this. So, in sum, it definitely whitens your teeth, but if you get canker sores in your mouth, maybe steer clear.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I can see quick results in such a short amount of time. It did not make my teeth sensitive and I think the product is easy to use! I know this product is going to help me feel confident on my wedding day! I got this product free as a BzzAgent to try!</li>
            <li> I received a Crest Pro Health HD kit as part of free trial.  This 2 step process is definitely easier and less gross than white strips and trays.  I have tried strips and gave up on them before ever noticing any great result.  I noticed a difference in the whiteness of my teeth within 3 days of starting the Crest Pro Health HD kit.  After that, though, I started having sensitivity along my gum line that was a bit too much for me to just ignore.  I would also like for it to have more of a minty taste.  After brushing my teeth I felt like I should brush them again so I could get the fresh breath that I get from my normal toothpaste.  HD is definitely effective at whitening and keeping teeth smooth and clean but it can irritate the mouth.</li>
            <li> I evaluated this product for BzzAgent who provided me with a free sample.  #Sponsored.  The product left my teeth feeling clean and smooth.  There are abrasive granules in tube 1 to scrub your teeth, but you do not feel it in your mouth.  The flavor is nice and minty.  Tube 2 contains the whitening gel.  It does not have a bad flavor.  I did not see any noticeable difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  It requires one minute per tube with no rinsing in-between which can make it a little messy, but if it makes your teeth whiter, it would be worth it.  If you are looking for clean teeth and mouth, this is a good product.  If you are looking for perceptible whiteness and your teeth are not very stained, this is probably not the right product.</li>
            <li> OMG this works!  I was shocked at how quick this worked.  2 days of use twice a day and I was getting compliments!!  I would recommend to ANYONE!  This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> I am loving the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste System! Using these two simple tools will help advance and whiten your smile beyond belief. The two step system is easy to use and provides lasting effects. I use this system twice daily, I love using the first tube (purifying cleanser) because it leaves your teeth feeling refreshed and extra clean (the feeling you get when you leave the dentist after the cleaning process). Next you apply the (perfecting gel) and it helps to whiten and brighten your smile. The whole process only takes two minutes (about as long as the first half of a Katy Perry song). I would recommend this easy cleaning system to anybody that wants a brighter smile without a ton of effort. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was&#x27;t sure how to write this review, because it&#x27;s a highly personal thing.  Toothpaste.  But I found a remark in someone else&#x27;s review that I thought was amusing and not at all inaccurate.  They called this product &amp;#34;an oral hygiene adventure&amp;#34;.  Basically, this is similar to brushing your teeth like you always have known it, but it&#x27;s a two step procedure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you&#x27;re done with the two steps, it has a feeling similar to that feeling you get when you get your teeth cleaned at the dentist.  Not quite the same mind you, but it has that &amp;#34;feeling&amp;#34;.  You have to brush your teeth a little longer than normal, but not like you have to do it for say 30 minutes or something.  Just make sure and read the directions in the package, as I get the impression if you don&#x27;t follow that, it won&#x27;t work as well.  But I did like the extra clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the main feature, the whitening..  It does seem to make my teeth whiter.  I&#x27;m also a life long (read heavy) coffee drinker, so I have that to factor in.  It did make them brighter - but at this point in my life, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ever going back to &amp;#34;pearly whites&amp;#34;.  Still, it made an improvement, and that&#x27;s a good thing.  I&#x27;m also giving this a 5 star rating, because I get the impression if I didn&#x27;t have 30+ years of coffee drinking going past these teeth, it would be way whiter than it ended up being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging also says it helps with gingivitis.  I can&#x27;t speak to that too much, as it is not a problem for me, but it claims to be six times more effective than conventional toothpaste for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I noticed from reading reviews is there&#x27;s quite a few people who said they didn&#x27;t like the taste of this.  Now I was&#x27;t expecting a &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; tasting product here.  Given this purported to clean your teeth too, I figured it had to have some stuff closer to the stronger things the dentist uses.  So I was prepared before using it.  To that, the taste didn&#x27;t bother me that much, but I could see where some might.  This part is hard to write anything about, because taste is one of the most personal things out there.  So be warned, it doesn&#x27;t taste like toothpastes who say they try to taste great, but it doesn&#x27;t taste like you&#x27;re brushing with baking soda, either.  :)&#x27;t bother me that much, but I could see where some might.

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different products for teeth whitening.  I have sensitive teeth and when I have used strips before my teeth have been hyper-sensitive for several days and I couldn&#x27;t use them as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad that I received Crest Pro Health HD as a sample to try out!  Using it two times a day doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive!  It&#x27;s as easy as regular teeth brushing yet MAKES YOUR TEETH WHITER!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hooked and will definitely become a regular user of this product!  I did receive this product from bzzagent.com.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really see a whiter smile, better breath, cleaner mouth feel when using this as opposed to the stuff I previously used. However, it does seem to be performing just as well or better than anything I previously tried. 1 Added benefit of this 2 part system is that it requires 1 minute with each step ensuring 2 minutes of brushing where in the past I would stop around 1 minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I would say give it a try and see how it works for you</li>
            <li> The Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste works miracles, I am a tea drinker and I can never seem to get my teeth whiter but with this toothpaste I noticed the difference within days. I used the toothpaste as recommended for a minute with each tube and twice a day and you will notice the difference almost immediately. Crest Pro-Health not only whitened my teeth but my mouth looks and feels so much fresher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The look and feel of my teeth noticeably whiter and brighter. I have used whitening strips before but if you have sensitive gums like I do this is not a great choice but because you are applying the toothpaste and whitening solution directly to the teeth you don&#x27;t have to worry about that happening. There is a slight after taste that lasts for an hour or so but after that it&#x27;s fine and you no longer notice the taste.I love this product and can&#x27;t believe the results.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few weeks now! My teeth are as white as ever! Love the way this works. There is no sensitivity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product as part of a promotion all reviews are my own</li>
            <li> Crest sent me a trial of their Pro-Health HD product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now, and I am enjoying it overall. I typically use Sensodyne Whitening Toothpaste for my sensitive teeth, but I have not experienced any extra sensitivity since using this toothpaste. My teeth have definitely been staying nice and white, and it really doesn&#x27;t take me much longer to brush my teeth using this over my normal toothpaste. I actually enjoying using this two-step process because it feels like I&#x27;m making a difference with my teeth based on the small amount of extra effort that I&#x27;m putting in to brushing. I like to cook a lot, and when I make something at home, I always think that it tastes better because I put all of that work into making it myself. The same concept applies to Crest Pro-Health HD, if you put a little extra effort into taking care of your teeth, you&#x27;ll really appreciate the outcome even more. The whitening really works with no real hassle. My two criticisms would be that the sensitivity gel does not have the best taste. Actually, it barely has a taste, and you can hardly taste it with the toothpaste in your mouth, but, if you do taste it, you may not enjoy it, and I wish it were a little better tasting because of that. Secondly, I use Listerine Zero mouthwash, and for whatever reason, I get a very dry feeling on my gums and tongue when using my mouthwash after the two-step whitening system. Overall, if you are looking for a whitening process for your teeth, I like having the Crest Pro-Health HD system and would recommend it to anyone who takes pride in the results they get by putting a little extra effort.</li>
            <li> I was was reluctant to to try this tooth paste.  I am very happy to report that the results were great.  My breath felt cleaner after the first brushing and my teeth were whiter after just a few days.  There are two different tubes in a package and you brush with each for a minute so just two minutes total which is the amount of time you should be brushing with any tooth paste.  You will see whiting after a few days with maximum whiting at approximately two weeks. My whole mouth feels clean and healthy.. I volunteered to try this product and I&#x27;m glad I did. I received a free sample from Crest.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this through Bzzagent and have been using for about a week.  I prefer  my toothpastes to have a little more flavor and a little more foam. These had little flavors and little foam.  I also am a working mom so I usually have to brush teeth quickly, the fact that I have to  reload something else( step 2), seems like a time buster to me.  Recommendations 1)  1 application to do it all 2) more taste 3) more foam!  Overall not bad, just not my preference. I haven&#x27;t seen enough improvement with whitening yet, but I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> After receiving my sample from BzzAgent I tested out the product for a week.  While my mouth definitely felt cleaner and my teeth were whiter, the taste and feeling were difficult to bear.  My gums became very sensitive and Step 2 left a terrible after taste.</li>
            <li> I tried this toothpaste as a buzz agent.  It is really great!  The two step process takes a little more time but my teeth feel cleaner after brushing.  The biggest difference seems to be at the gum where it seems to be able to clean better than my usual toothpaste.  The flavor is pretty mild on step 1 and definitely freshens on step 2.  I will probably buy this product again and you should give it a try too.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I was provided this product by Crest to review - I am no way compensated for my review, positive or negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great experience with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Backstory: I have extremely sensitive teeth - experienced the worst pain of my life during and after a Zoom session, the strips hurt me, and everything made for sensitive teeth hasn&#x27;t made much of a difference. I have pretty white teeth to start with, but I do drink diet soda and red wine. Also certain lipsticks make them look yellower at times. So I&#x27;ve always wanted that movie star white but haven&#x27;t been able to attain it. I think I could be on my way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1: Brush with the toothpaste for 2 minutes&lt;br /&gt;Step 2: Brush with the polish for a minute&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow - my mouth feels fresh after I use this. It&#x27;s like the feeling you get after a cleaning at the dentist. My teeth shine, and it lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;After only 1 week, my teeth are starting to look whiter. My husband pointed this out, and I noticed in in pictures. Confident that as I continue to use this system they will only get whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with my Sonicare toothbrush which makes it easy - I use the &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; setting for Step 1 and the &amp;#34;polish&amp;#34; setting for Step 2.&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I did experience a little gum sensitivity the first couple of days, but I&#x27;m past that now. My teeth feel great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is going to be my (and my husband&#x27;s!) new routine going forward. Will definitely be purchasing this when my sample runs out.</li>
            <li> When I first heard Crest was coming out with something new and revolutionary, I thought to myself, \\&quot;what can be revolutionary about a toothpaste?\\&quot; If you&#x27;re thinking the same thing, let me tell assure you: Crest Pro-Health HD is unlike anything I&#x27;ve ever tried before. I started using it just over a week ago, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with the way my teeth have felt. If you&#x27;ve ever left the dentist wondering why your teeth can&#x27;t feel that clean every day, I would strongly consider giving this toothpaste a try, because somehow it manages to do exactly that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1 is a purifying cleanser, and it is a much more abrasive formula than your average, slightly chalky toothpaste. I had no problems at all remembering to only use this for a minute, because it leaves a residue on your teeth and a dry, almost numb fluoride feeling that lets you know you&#x27;re ready to spit it out and move on to step 2. You aren&#x27;t supposed to rinse your mouth between steps, and it&#x27;s easy to understand why once you&#x27;ve used the system: step 2 is a smooth gel, and once you start brushing with it, you really begin to feel that great, clean feeling as it polishes your teeth. The whole process only takes two minutes total, and you don&#x27;t need to use very much of each product when compared to regular toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really is a life-changer for me: I thought this might be a gimmicky product, but at this point I can&#x27;t imagine using regular toothpaste again. Thank you, Crest!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free through Bzz Agent and I&#x27;m glad I did. I was skeptical when I first started using it. Using each product for 1 minute was a change in my routine but it really doesn&#x27;t take any more time than what I was doing before. It does not taste as minty as the toothpaste I was used to using but it does make my mouth feel clean. The clean feeling seems to last longer with this toothpaste than with others and I feel like my teeth do look whiter, although no one has commented on it yet. I feel like the product size is on the small side for the price though.</li>
            <li> Clean, clean, clean. This toothpaste / whitening combo is a neat concept. My teeth feel super clean however, I did not like that you can&#x27;t spit. That&#x27;s a lot of toothpaste spit to keep in your mouth for 2 minutes. I was trying desperately not to gag on all the stuff in my mouth. I am using this product as a free trial from Crest :)</li>
            <li> I have always been apprehensive about any sort of whitening program, fearing that I would either be stripping away important layers off my teeth, or that my teeth would end up glowing in the dark like Ross. But then Crest sent me their Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste to try, so I decided to give it a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled with the results. Ignoring the fact that teeth, or anything in real life, can&#x27;t be upgraded to HD, I have been using this toothpaste for the past week. I can say that I have noticed my teeth do appear to be whiter, but even more so, my teeth have never felt cleaner. I love the way my entire mouth tastes and feels after I brush. I feel fresh, clean and confident. So thanks for sending me the sample Crest, you more than likely have a customer for life.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free sample and was skeptical - 2 minutes of brushing sounded like a long time and I haven&#x27;t really been a Crest fan in the past.  Crest HD changed my mind.  Brushing 1 minute with step 1 and then 1 minute with step 2 and hours later my teeth feel as clean as if I just brushed them or just came from the dentist office.  As for the whitening, I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference yet.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a week so far, but having that fresh clean feeling is well worth it!</li>
            <li> This product is great. The 2 step process is really simple, 1 minute for each item, 2x a day and the whitening effect is really noticeable. The flavor is great and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One issue I did notice was white spots on my gums. This irritaiton was probably from the whitening agents, as I&#x27;ve noticed this in the past (white strips, trays, etc). After stopping using the prodcut, the irritation did go away. I&#x27;ve been extra careful not to brush my gums to much and haven&#x27;t noticed the white spots as often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product - just be careful if you have sensitive gums. Much more effect than white strips, trays, rinses, etc. Plus it tastes great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was sampled as a promotion</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest products for a long time but this product is really a new innovative way of cleaning and whiten your teeth. I was glad that I could try out the Crest Pro Health HD two step system for BzzAgent. It is a really simple two step system: first you brush your teeth with the step 1 toothpaste followed by step 2 by adding the whitening gel to your toothbrush and brush for about one minute. This is so much more easy to do and to use than the whitening strips or other whitening systems because you don&#x27;t have to wait half an hour or longer to see the results. It&#x27;s just easy to do while your brushing you are cleaning your teeth and whiten them at the same time. After using it for a couple of days my teeth and mouth felt a lot more clean. Like after going to the dentist when you have your teeth cleaned and stains and discolorations on my teeth are fading. I can&#x27;t wait what the results will be after a couple of weeks. I just really like this two step system. Easy to use and fast results!</li>
            <li> No difference from my regular whitening toothpaste.  I used it for a couple weeks and checked with a teeth white chart before and after, no difference.  The package says 6X whiter teeth after a week versus ordinary toothpaste.  I assume they mean non-whitening, but who knows what they mean.  And 6X whiter?  Any way, it just did not help me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste comes in two tubes.  I followed the directions very carefully.  I used one for a minute and then tube two for a minute.  I made sure not to rinse my mouth in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first tubes active ingredients are Stannous Fluoride 0.454%.  The second tube lists full ingredients of Water, Glycerin, Hydrogen Peroxide, Carbomer, Disodium Pryophosphate, Flavor, Sucralose, Sodium Hydroxide.  The whitener is just standard Hydrogen Peroxide in a gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it I feel this product is no better, nor worse than any other whitening toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure, I got this product free from Crest, via the Bzz marketing company, and to continue receiving products I need to submit reviews.  I doubt I will get any other Crest products after this.  Human nature is to give a better review when someone gives you something, i.e. they where nice I should be nice.  Human nature also wants to continue getting free things.  Makes me wonder about all those glowing reviews...  Edit:  Been many, many months now and it seems I have been dropped from the program of getting free products to review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you say my review is unhelpful, tell me why and I will edit the review  After all, I am trying to help people.</li>
            <li> When I began using this product, I was worried about 2 things: 1- I have very sensitive teeth that usually hurt when using whitening products and 2- I have a filled tooth in front that usually looks darker than my other teeth, not always responding to whiting products. I&#x27;m very happy to say that I felt no pain or sensitivity with this product and saw nice whitening results, even on my filled tooth! This product is much easier to use than whitening strips and you can just replace your current toothpaste with it. Not only are my teeth whiter, but they always feel cleaner after a brushing. I defensively recommend this product and will be using it again!&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product free thanks to crest</li>
            <li> Different but works. I received this toothpaste as a free product from Crest vis BzzAgent and I must say, i do like it a lot. My teeth seem whiter and my fresh always feel fresher; however, it comes with two tubes - and we as a society have been trained to use one. i consistently forget to not wash out my mouth after the first tube, so it ends up defeating the purpose</li>
            <li> I had noticeably whiter teeth after one week of use of this product. I use an electric toothbrush so I simply brush one round with the cleaner and a second round with the whitener. My teeth feel substantially cleaner however I&#x27;m not sure if that is due to the excessive brushing or the product. Friends have commented on the whiter smile after two weeks of use. Although this product has not made my gums sensitive like other whiteners I am still not a fan of the taste and consistency. It is not terrible but it just doesn&#x27;t have that same texture as&amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpaste. There is a bit of grittiness to the cleanser. I had the opportunity to try this product for free thanks to crest.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved this product!  I was part of a panel to review the product with Bzz Agents at no cost and was very happy to be part of this project.  After the first seven days I noticed significant whitenting on the surface of my teeth. (see photo)  In addition, after only a month of using the product continuously (day and night) I had my bi annual cleaning with my dentist.  The hygienist commented on the reduced amount of scaling she had to perform to remove plaque and tarter and asked if I was doing anything different.  I mentioned the Crest Pro Health HD cleaning system and she was very impressed with the results after only one month.  I&#x27;m looking forward to my next appointment with 6 months of usage of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I highly recommend this system, but caution that it must be used day and night to see the results.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the good people at BzzAgent and Crest, I was able to give this product a test run for free!&lt;br /&gt;Although I cannot say with any scientific certainty that this toothpaste does in fact make you teeth whiter, but what I can say is that it makes your teeth and mouth feel brand spanking new.  It&#x27;s like that great feeling you have when you get out of the dentist office with your newly polished pearly whites...except you didn&#x27;t have to go thru all the pain and uncomfortableness of actually going to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best of both worlds...no pain AND clean teeth.  Sign me up!!!!</li>
            <li> I got this item free to try it and I love it! Works great, super easy to use, no funny tastes or feeling when you are done, my new favorite whitener!</li>
            <li> Over the past couple of years I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth aren&#x27;t as white as they once were, and I&#x27;d wondered about ways to refresh my smile. High-end whitening treatments aren&#x27;t in my budget at the moment, and I hate the sticky mess of whitening strips, so I was excited when I received a free sample of Crest Pro-Health HD from Crest and Bzz Agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially I was concerned that adding a step to my brushing routine would be frustrating during my busy mornings, but the process only takes a few extra seconds. Within a few days of brushing morning and night with Crest HD, I definitely noticed a difference in my smile. While I don&#x27;t know that it compares with the brightening of a professional treatment, Crest HD definitely gives me the extra gleam I want. I&#x27;m no longer self-conscious about letting my back teeth show in a big, toothy grin. After this supply of the toothpaste runs out, I&#x27;ll probably return to regular paste for awhile, but as soon as I need a whiter smile, Crest Pro-Health HD will be my choice.</li>
            <li> So I was given the opportunity to try Crest Pro Health® HD™ for free.  Normally those types of toothpastes will make my teeth sensitive.  This did not do that.  There are two steps to the process, but it was very easy and didn&#x27;t take that much more time and well worth it.  I have noticed wither teeth in the 6 weeks that I have been using it, as well as fresher breath.  My daughter who loves to point out things, had been telling me how yellow my teeth look (she is 5, so very honest).  Now she told me they look white again!  Yay.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using the two step system for about 2 months now, thanks to Crest and BzzzAgent. I definitely do think the first step gives a better clean than a regular toothpaste. The clean lasts through the night and if I forget my morning brushing or don&#x27;t have time, the clean feeling lasts well into the afternoon . With regular toothpaste my teeth are feeling fuzzy before noon. I can&#x27;t attest to the whitening, but that may be due to the fact that my teeth are already pretty white from using the Crest whitening strips. So if you definitely want a longer-lasting, cleaner feeling mouth, try this!</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro Health HD to sample and review, for no charge.  One week in and, yes, I can see a difference.  My teeth were quite white already, but I can still tell a difference.  It is a two step process.  Brush with Step 1, which is a purifying cleanser that strips away plaque (who wouldn&#x27;t want that!?!), for one minute.  Then spit but DO NOT rinse.  Add Step 2 to your brush - the whitening &amp; polishing gel - for an additional minute. Then spit and rinse.  Two minutes to a clean, sparkling smile.  It feels a bit like I&#x27;ve just walked out of the dentist office.  I have an electric toothbrush so it&#x27;s easy to know when each minute is up.  Only complaint - I normally scrub my tongue at the end of the two minutes, but the whitening gel (obviously) isn&#x27;t meant for the tongue.  My solution is simply to brush my tongue at the end of Step 1 and again after I rinse after Step 2.  If you&#x27;re trying to whiten your smile, give this a shot!</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of products over the years and nothing made a difference until now. I love tea and Cola which definitely diminishes a smile quickly. I have only been using Crest Pro-Health HD for a week and the results are unbelievable. Not only has it whitened my teeth, it has cut my brushing routine in half and eliminated morning breath. I received my set for free from Crest as a bzzagent but would pay any price for these results.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!  At first I thought, really!, two steps!  I can barely get one step done on most days before but now, after feeling the incredible clean feeling after the two steps, I will NEVER go back!!  The whitening is also a huge advantage!  I drink a good amount of coffee everyday and after a couple weeks with this product, my employees were even noticing my smile whitening.  I would recommend this to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m supposed to mention that I snagged this product free as a BzzAgent, which is good, really, because I might not have discovered it otherwise. This just doesn&#x27;t compare to the single tube toothpaste I&#x27;ve always used. I feel more confident, and my teeth really do look whiter.</li>
            <li> I got this for free from BzzAgent to try out. Not sure if I see a difference or not. You have to brush your teeth twice - once with each paste. And the tube design is weird - one flip top and one screw cap. From a design standpoint, that really bothers me.</li>
            <li> The Crest Pro-Health HD toothpaste works really well! I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week and have seen dramatic results. I even have my husband using it too!  I saw some lightening after the first time using it!&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that there is some sensitivity, but that would be the same for any whitening product.&lt;br /&gt;I think overall for the price, you cannot beat it!  I would pick this over white strips any time!</li>
            <li> I got a free sample to test out so it was worth a shot but after using I don&#x27;t see a reason to spent that type of money for toothpaste baking soda does the same for me</li>
            <li> I would give this product 5 stars, however, I didn&#x27;t like how dry/thirsty it made my mouth feel while using the product.  It also kind is a pain to use both products given.&lt;br /&gt;But...it works...  My mouth/teeth felt cleaner after using just like I would after getting a cleaning at the dentist.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week and I definitely do notice a difference in whitening.  I don&#x27;t ever use whitening products, so if you already do you probably won&#x27;t notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I am trying this free thanks to Crest and Bzzagent or I probably would not have purchased this on my own.  So YAY! for free samples.</li>
            <li> I have recently tried this brand, as part of a promotion from thr brand.  Aware that I have not tried anything other than a basic whitening toothpaste. I was pleasantly surprised when I didnt get the dirty teeth feeling by the end of the day. After a week of use I think I see a slight improvement, but dont have a fancy camera and side to side images of my before and after.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for a week now and I do like it. I can only use the product once a day due to some minor gum irritation (probably from the hydrogen peroxide). After a week of use I haven&#x27;t noticed any real whitening of my teeth, but they do feel really clean - even the back of my front, lower teeth which are the plaque catches in my mouth. The taste is minty and strong with an after taste of hydrogen peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do believe that any toothpaste would work better if used for two minutes so that may factor into the extra clean feeling. I did receive this product as a free sample from Crest via BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> This 2-step brushing system is great. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and have already seen results of a whiter smile.&lt;br /&gt;I drink coffee daily and also often opt for red wine over white when I drink, so I always feel the need to use a whitening system. Unfortunately, white strips are terrible for my sensitive teeth. Not only was I prone to cavities prior to using a motorized toothbrush, when using Crest white strips in the past I would get TERRIBLE zingers within minutes of me putting the strips on my teeth. They hurt so bad that the pain would make me feel like I could pass out. Fortunately, this two-step system is MUCH faster and works just as well. It also protects my sensitive teeth with the added fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;The only downfalls  would point out is that the second step tastes like hydrogen peroxide, but goes away quickly if you use mouthwash after. Also, it may seem tedious to have to use two different toothpastes when brushing your teeth - but it&#x27;s much faster than having to wear noticeable white strips for 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re going to brush your teeth daily, you might as well also use a product that contains fluoride and whitens your teeth!</li>
            <li> This makes my teeth feel so clean and mouth feel so fresh.  I&#x27;m a coffee drinker and within a week I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth already getting whiter.  All you need to do is use it 2 times a day.  The whole process takes about 4-5 minutes and my mouth feels great for hours.  My gums are a little sensitive so I don&#x27;t always use the whitening twice a day, but it still seems to be whitening.  It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> I had a chance to try this product free as a promotional testing opportunity.  I am so glad I did!  2 minutes of your day is all it takes to make your teeth dentist-cleaned clean!  My teeth feel smooth, fresh and look amazing just after the first brush!  And the longer I tried it over the next few weeks, the whiter my teeth became!  I loved it so much I had my husband try it too and he was amazed with the first brush to.  This is a quick, 2-step process.  Brush 1 minute with 1st tube labeled &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; and right after, without rinsing, brush 1 minute with 2nd tube labeled &amp;#34;2&amp;#34;.  Simple as can be.  No trays, no strips!  Just brush like you normally would in your daily routine and get dentist-office clean!</li>
            <li> Buying this when it first came out was just an impulse buy but it has an instant coupon so I tried it out. It turns out it does make your teeth a little bit more white.  My mouth has never felt fresher either.</li>
            <li> I have been a Rembrandt user for years but this kit works quite well. I have been using it for 4 days and do see whiter teeth with a bit of gum sensitivity others have mentioned. I do question the price on Amazon: $34? I purchased the 6.3 oz kit at Walgreens for $12.99.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a regular Crest customer, so when the company asked me to try and review Crest Pro Health HD, I was so excited. I had been wanting to do my annual Crest White Strips, but I was low on cash and hoped that HD would be just as awesome. After a month of using Crest Pro Health HD twice a day, here are my pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The two step process forces me to spend more time brushing my teeth, instead of rushing.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth definitely feel cleaner- there&#x27;s no film/coating as there usually is.&lt;br /&gt;My gums seem to be a little better as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I wanted to try this product strictly for the whitening. Unfortunately, HD has nothing on the Crest White Strips. You can see in my picture what my teeth looked like after 4 weeks of using HD twice daily. Nobody commented on my teeth looking exceptionally white as many people do when I use the Crest White Strips. :(&lt;br /&gt;According to Target, this HD system is about $13. That&#x27;s a little steep for toothpaste to me. I can buy a multipack of Crest toothpaste for that amount.&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of price, I would rather shell out the $40 for the Crest White Strips to get that great pearly look instead of hoping that this $13 toothpaste would work miracles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall, yes, my mouth feels cleaner, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t look as sparkly as Crest claims. You be the judge.</li>
            <li> That feeling right when you leave your dentist after having your teeth cleaned. That&#x27;s what I am getting with the Crest Pro-Health HD system. I call it a system because there are two steps: First, (the silver Step 1 tube) you brush for one minute with a fluoride-based gel. Second, you spit but don&#x27;t rinse from Step 1, and then brush for another minute using the second, blue tube. The second tube has a clear gel that has peroxide as one of its ingredients, and you see the bubblies on your teeth and between the teeth as you brush. I experienced no sensitivity, but my mouth feels so clean. Usually when I drink coffee and brush afterwards, I still taste coffee no matter how much I brush my tongue and gums. Using this product, all I taste is dentist-clean freshness! I snagged this product free as a BzzAgent, which is good, really, because I might not have discovered it otherwise. This just doesn&#x27;t compare to the single tube toothpaste I&#x27;ve always used. I feel more confident, and my teeth really do look whiter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a whitening solution - decades of diet soda consumption have made my once white teeth a little dingy.  While this product made my teeth feel clean, I didn&#x27;t see any difference in the color of my teeth.  I used the dual toothpaste system twice daily for just over a week.  The color of my teeth remained the same &amp; I didn&#x27;t notice any of the &amp;#34;sparkle&amp;#34; that other users mentioned.  So, while it&#x27;s a cool product/concept, it didn&#x27;t provide the advertised benefits for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product to try via Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li> I liked a lot of things about Crest Pro Health HD. It tastes good, my mouth felt clean, and I noticed whiter teeth after just a few uses. I did the two step process twice a day (morning and night) and by night two, I felt like it was working. By night three I was having sensitivity in my gums though. So I took a full day off and used my regular toothpaste and the sensitivity went away. I then restarted Crest Pro Health HD but this time I only did it at night. In the mornings I used my regular toothpaste. The sensitivity was gone and didn&#x27;t return but the results weren&#x27;t as prominent. My teeth still felt clean but I wasn&#x27;t getting the noticeable results I did before. I&#x27;ve been on the once per day regimen for 7 days. *I received Crest Pro Health free as a promotion. My experience an opinions are completely my own though!</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health HD is amazing.  I take my toothpaste seriously.  I brush routinely twice a day and find this product really helped with a cleaner mouth and amazingly clean teeth.  Crest Pro Health HD was easy to use, the taste was great, and it only takes 2 minutes.  I take my toothpaste seriously and I brush routinely twice a day.  Using it was like leaving the Dentist every time I used it; it was like my Dentist moved into my house.  Yes I did notice a difference, my teeth felt really clean and people always ask what I do to keep my teeth white. I believe the tartar build up was at a minimum and I feel they were whiter than normal.  No yellowish gleam.  I feel my mouth with morning breath was gone.  My teeth were amazingly clean every day.  I rate this product a 10.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Crest Pro Health HD</li>
            <li> I think this is really gross. I hated the tasted. But what was worse was the texture that was left on my teeth. The only benefit of this over whiten strips is I guess it takes less time.</li>
            <li> I am a bzz agent and recieved a full size product for sample. I am a heavy coffee drinker and had yellow staining. I&#x27;ve been using the product for 3 1/2 weeks now, morning and night as instructed. I am really pleased with the product. It doesn&#x27;t take any more time out of my brushing routine to use. Step 1 is a refreshing paste with tiny microbeads, that leaves a fresh minty taste and helps to fight plaque from forming step 2 is a clear gel. In the past many whitening treatments that I hace used irritate my guns, however this gel did not cause any irritation. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my free sample of this product and give it a try. From the first brush I am now hooked. My teeth feel like I just left the dentist&#x27;s office and it leaves that feeling for hours after I brush. I have also noticed a great difference in whiteness of my teeth. 6x as claimed I am not sure but definetly a difference. So why 4 stars instead of 5 not my favorite in the taste department but easy to use. I would definetly recommend to others and will also continue to use for my family.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that really makes a diffence in your smile.  It does the job it is supposed to do....whiten your teeth and freshen your smile. I got this product for free from Crest and was amazed at how it whitened my teeth after one use. It felt like I just left the dentists offfice after I had a tooth cleaning.  After a few uses I felt like it cut down on the plaque and whitened my teeth even more.  Bring on the coffee and red wine! No more guilt about indulging when you use this product</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try Crest Pro-Health HD Daily as a free sample from Crest and it is unique and effective. This is the most effective whitening toothpaste that I&#x27;ve tried before, and in just a little over a week, my teeth are a few shades lighter. I wish that I had a chance to go back and take a \\&quot;before\\&quot; picture to quantify the difference, but it is noticeable. I&#x27;ve had a little sensitivity, but I chalk that up to brushing for a little longer than usual. Still, a solid 4 stars for leaving a very clean \\&quot;from the dentist\\&quot; feel, and for the great whitening effect in about 10 days.</li>
            <li> I received this as a promotion and I was a little skeptical about changing to a longer two step process, but it seriously only took me two minutes, which was how long I used to brush my teeth for anyway.  It has been well worth it. My teeth have never been whiter or cleaner.  My breath even feels fresher longer. I am very impressed with this new product!</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to receive my free Smiley360 kit for the Crest Pro-health HD. I am a long-time Crest customer and am loyal to the brand. I first began using the new Crest Pro-health HD product approximately 2 weeks ago, and have noticed a slight difference in the brightness/whiteness of my teeth. I would expect to see an even more noticeable difference the longer I use it.&lt;br /&gt;The 2-step process is extremely simple and does not take too much additional time out of my daily morning routine (when crunch time really matters). The two step routine is essentially brushing your teeth with a dental quality toothpaste and a whiting gel. It&#x27;s quick and easy to move from one to the other - with no rinsing in between brushings.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product has multiple benefits: it from a brand that I trust, it&#x27;s a high quality/dental quality toothpaste, and it provides the added benefit of whitening your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have now completely used my Crest Pro-Health HD Two-Step Toothpaste System. I cannot believe the difference in my teeth from the time of my first review until now. As mentioned above, I noticed a slight difference in my teeth coloring at the two week mark. My teeth are much whiter and brighter, and I would compare the end result to the expensive whiting products purchased through dental offices. I will continue to purchase this product as my new, regular use toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;*I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received free crest pro health HD system through smile 360! It has been an amazing product! I was suprised at the quick results.</li>
            <li> I got to try out the new 2-step program for free through a promotion. I was so excited because I have been using crest products exclusively for years. Crest 3D white toothpaste and Pro Health mouthwash have been my go-to products for a long time. The benefits of the two part system are that I definitely have a clean white smile and less sensitivity than I did using the 3D white product, however, I have not seen it reduce or eliminate my morning breath. If you are dying for a product that will get rid of your stinky breath when you wake up, then this product may be a disappointment, but if you are just looking for a clean, healthy and white smile, then you will not be let down!</li>
            <li> I have tried other at home whitening products in the past. I always found that they tasted bad, made me gag or left a coating on my teeth that left them feeling less than clean. I received The Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two Step toothpaste as a promotion from the manufacturer to try. I was a little skeptical because other whitening toothpastes. But I actually found that this toothpaste was easy to use without the horrible whitening aftertaste.&lt;br /&gt;The first step toothpaste, the cleaning one, was like any other toothpaste. It was what I expected from Crest. A quality dental health toothpaste. It is important to remember not to rinse prior to the second toothpaste step. But the step 2 toothpaste was not bad tasting, and was effective for an at home product. I personally have a pretty bad gag reflex with some dental products and I did not experience this. It is unrealistic to expect a total transformation with this product but I did feel that my teeth were a little whiter and felt clean.</li>
            <li> I am trying this on a promotional offer. It works for whitening my teeth, but I would rather do it all in one application. This definitely beats using the whitening strips, but is still a hassle.</li>
            <li> Toothpaste is hard to review.  I&#x27;ve been using Colgate Total for a long time and happy with it. No cavities in years. However, I do feel my mouth is cleaner after using Crest Pro Health.  It tastes fine without tasting good or bad.  My wife likes it even more than I do and commented on it after just a few days of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for whiter teeth, her teeth seem to have responded better than mine.  Perhaps my teeth are just too far gone...  Probably worth 5 stars, but since the whiteness didn&#x27;t necessarily help me, I deducted a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free with no strings attached as part of being a Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. I&#x27;ve seen a definite difference.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting dramatic results from a toothpaste whitening system, but boy was I surprised! I noticed a difference with the first use. My mouth felt incredibly fresh and my teeth felt smooth and actually looked glossier! I think that the system is easy to use - much more time effective for me than white strips or trays, and I feel it had better results. I have very sensitive teeth and I didn&#x27;t find any increase sensitivity with this product. If you are looking for a way to brighten your smile and improve the overall health of your mouth, this is the way to go! #gotasample #bzzagent</li>
            <li> I got this for free via the Bzz Agent campaign.  Personally I thought it performed pretty well.  It left my teeth feeling clean and they did look whiter even after the first use.  My only complaint was that it is a little on the spendy side but it might be cheaper than purchasing the really expensive whitening strips.</li>
            <li> I was using another two-step toothpaste that was discontinued so I decided to try Crest Pro HD.  The other toothpaste had made my teeth very white already, so the Crest toothpaste only had to maintain that whiteness. Unfortunately it did not, after a month my teeth are noticeably dull compared to before using the Crest Pro. Also, why is this toothpaste so sweet? I reside in Florida where sugar ants can be a problem, but I never had a problem in my second floor bathroom with them and now when I see them they are making a beeline for this toothpaste. I understand that I may part of the population that the active ingredient may cause stains, but since I was using another two step toothpaste that was similar that whitened my teeth and maintained that whiteness I am disappointed that this product did not even come close.</li>
            <li> Crest HD lives up to its claims! I will admit that I was skeptical... Years ago I had tried the white strips and the whitener that you &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; on your teeth - both of which were cumbersome, messy, uncomfortable, and didn&#x27;t do a good enough job for the cost. So, when BzzAgent gave me the chance to try Crest HD for free, I took it, knowing I would never try it otherwise. I am so glad that I did! I could see and feel a difference after the first use. My teeth feel smoother than after leaving the dentist&#x27;s office and my teeth are definitely whiter.. To the point that I randomly notice in the mirror if I am just in a bathroom washing my hands. The directions do say to use this toothpaste twice per day, but as I have sensitive teeth, I have been doing once a day, just in case. I have not noticed any increased sensitivity or other negatives. So, even if other teeth whitening products have let you down in the past, definitely give Crest HD a chance.. Your first 2-minute brush could convert you too!</li>
            <li> I think that Crest Pro Health® HD™ is an awesome product at getting your mouth clean, while at the same time it does not work in the time-frame it boasts towards whitening. I really do not see that big of difference in the color of my teeth, but I did stop using it after a week. I felt fine at first, but after repeated use, my teeth and gums did start to feel quite sensitive. I know all whitening products can do this, but I need a toothpaste I can continually use without having to worry about having to stop and use a backup one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue to use this product as long as I feel my mouth is staying and becoming more clean and healthy. I do feel that my teeth and gums look and feel healthy, I just which sensitivity was not a side effect. I still would prefer the convenience of a two in one toothpaste versus a two step system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product free thanks to Crest and Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I got this product free from participating with BzzAgent.  Not a big fan of the &#x27;system&#x27;.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  Not a big fan of peppermint, would prefer a spearmint version.  The one big issue I have is that tube 1 has a flip top (great!), but the 2nd tube is a twist cap.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem at first thought, until you are in the middle of brushing.  So you finish the first step, and your toothbrush (and maybe your had) is wet, and now you need to hands to hold the 2nd tube and twist the top off.  But I don&#x27;t want to set my wet brush down anywhere, so either you try to twist with one hand, or keep the brush in your mouth, or put it in a cup or something.  Would have been much easier to put the flip cap on the 2nd tube as well, which is much easier to do with one hand.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try Crest Pro-Health HD for free through BzzAgent. When I first received my package, I was curious.  Why would I ever need two toothpastes?  Granted, one tube is technically a &amp;#34;whitening gel,&amp;#34; but I brush my teeth with it all the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first night I followed the instructions exactly.  One minute with Step 1, the plaque-removing toothpaste, and one minute with Step 2, the whitening gel.  I use a Sonicare toothbrush and am used to brushing each of my four quadrants for 30 seconds at a time, so I found myself annoyed and feeling rushed.  My mouth was getting the same total amount of brushing, but it was two rounds of hasty brushing instead of one round of thorough brushing.  I wasn&#x27;t impressed and decided to change it up going forward by doing a full two minutes on Step 1 followed by a minute with Step 2.  It seems a little ridiculous brushing my teeth for three minutes now, but at least my teeth feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the positives.  I absolutely love the flavor of the Step 1 toothpaste.  It&#x27;s a strong, wintergreen sort of flavor.  It makes my mouth feel fresh and clean.  The formula of Step 1 also does an amazing job making my teeth feel extra clean.  That&#x27;s not just because I brush for longer than the recommendation, either -- even when I followed the directions, I felt like my teeth were smoother and cleaner than when I use a regular toothpaste. The strong flavor also helps to cover up the flavor of Step 2, which is why I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s so strong and they tell you not to rinse between the steps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the negatives, well, I really don&#x27;t think my teeth are 6 times whiter.  I honestly haven&#x27;t really noticed anything perceptible, though maybe that&#x27;s because my teeth weren&#x27;t horrendously yellow to begin with.  My husband has been using it as well, and he has noticed a considerable difference in his teeth, so maybe it&#x27;s just me.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to use Step 1 without also using Step 2, as the active ingredient in Step 1 is known to cause yellowing of the teeth.  It&#x27;s kind of convenient that Crest has chosen to minimize that side effect through including a whitening agent.  The Step 2 also tastes terrible if you accidentally rinse out your mouth from Step 1 before you start.  Hydrogen peroxide is not a pleasant flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also think the cost is a bit extreme.  It cleans well, but would I really want to pay over $10 whenever I need toothpaste?  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s amazing enough to justify the cost.  I also am bothered that there are essentially two products but you can&#x27;t purchase them separately.  When you inevitably run out of one before the other, you&#x27;re going to have to go buy both.  Product will go to waste.  I&#x27;m not a fan of that.  I also just can&#x27;t get myself into the routine of remembering to use two different products.  Often I rinse before realizing I still need Step 2, and on a couple of occasions where I&#x27;ve been very tired, I&#x27;ve accidentally skipped Step 2 altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can get a good deal on this, or you have really yellow teeth you&#x27;d like to clean up during your daily toothbrushing routine, it might be worth a try.  I&#x27;m not wowed though.ngredient in Step 1 is known to cause yellowing of the teeth.

            <li> I am a BZZ agent and thanks to Crest, I was lucky enough to be one who got the entire Crest HD system for free. As part of my freebie, I have to use the product and then review it. So, far, so good. I am really liking the way that the Crest HD 2 step system is making my mouth feel. Step 1 strips the plaque from your teeth. Whether, the results are psychological or not, my teeth even feel cleaner when just waking up. The Morning Breath has decreased due to less plaque on my teeth. That alone is a plus in my books. I will continue to use the product for another month and then I will be able to tell you if my teeth look whiter. Keeping fingers crossed because I am very pleased with it so far!!!</li>
            <li> I received this free from a Bzz campaign, but that does not influence my review whatsoever.  I drink a lot of coffee and diet coke so my teeth are always tinged yellow.  I was excited to try this new toothpaste.  The 2 step process is unique, and I did have whiter teeth after about a week, but then they got fairly sensitive so I stopped using it.  I now use it 1 week a month just to help keep my teeth from getting super stained and I like it for that purpose.  After using it, my teeth are slippery and feel really clean, I just didn&#x27;t like the added sensitivity I had from long-term use.  I&#x27;d recommend it, but for short periods of time only.</li>
            <li> I got a Crest Pro Health HD from being a member of BzzAgent and from Crest, so I could review it. I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks and overall am pretty impressed. Its simple and quick to use, and only involves two steps. Step 1 is a sort of blue toothpaste to first clean off all of the plaque and bacteria in your mouth, and had a pleasant minty taste and texture. You brush with it for one minute then spit it out, not rinsing. Then you brush with Step 2 for the same amount of time. Step 2 is a clear gel with peroxide to whiten the teeth. I don&#x27;t like the second step as much as the first because it doesn&#x27;t taste as much and looks like glue. But I like how convenient and simple it is to able to just use these in lieu of your normal toothpaste everyday and how quick it is (only two minutes, one minute for brushing each step). Another thing I liked was how the directions were very clearly written on the backs of both tubes so you didn&#x27;t have to keep the box. On the first day, I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in the whiteness of my teeth but they did feel clean. After using it for as long as I have I can see how bright they&#x27;ve become.</li>
            <li> I am a Bzzagent and got this to try for free, thanks to Crest!  My teeth not only feel clean they look really bright and white.  I drink 2 - 3 cups of coffee a day, and this Crest has made it so easy to clean &amp; whiten my teeth.  It&#x27;s a simple 2 step, 2 minutes and you&#x27;re done!  Thanks for letting me try this out for free!</li>
            <li> I have been seeking a whitening product that was easy to use, with noticeable results. Voila! I found Crest Pro Health Daily Two Step Toothpaste. It is a two step process, where you use the toothpaste and a whitening agent twice per day. You normally brush your teeth twice per day, so this is not a inconvenience at all. But there is a noticeable distinguishable taste of the product. You get used to it, especially when you realize that it is actually whitening and polishing your teeth simultaneously. I gave it a chance for a week, brushing twice per day as instructed. I am pleasantly surprised at the results. My teeth look whiter, and noticeably cleaner. I would definitely recommend using Crest Pro Health HD Daily Two Step Toothpaste. It is quick, easy, and you get fast results. I received a product sample of Crest Pro Health HD Daily Two Step Toothpaste from BzzAgent. However, my analysis and opinion drawn from the results of use are that of my own.</li>
            <li> I scored a free sample of this product and am so happy I did !!  I am always looking for whiter teeth and I have gingivitis so I was very happy to receive!! You first brush with step 1 then spit then step 2. 2 min tops!  A great fresh and clean breath and whiter teeth and by the way taking care of gingivitis!!  A winning combination!  Thanks Crest for marketing this great product!</li>
            <li> Before using this I would always feel like my toothpaste didn&#x27;t get my teeth completely clean. And I&#x27;ve never been one for flossing. But after using this I can&#x27;t believe how clean my teeth feel. It&#x27;s almost unreal. It feels like I just left a cleaning at the dentist. I&#x27;d give this 100 stars if I could.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!  Easy, 2 step process that definitely results in whiter, brighter teeth.</li>
            <li> This stuff does exactly what you&#x27;d want it. I got it soley for the purpose of whitening my teeth and it did just that. Not only is my mouth healthier, but it&#x27;s also whiter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT That&#x27;s the last time I&#x27;ll get this product. It&#x27;s not that it didn&#x27;t work or was cheap, but it&#x27;s a pain to use every day. Instead of being excited to use this stuff, you&#x27;ll feel like it&#x27;s a chore. You won&#x27;t look forward to brushing your teeth because this 2-step process takes a long time. I&#x27;m on the last bit of it and I stopped using it and went back to regular toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s another thing, this stuff lasts FOREVER. Especially if you&#x27;re using it alone. It lasts more than a month and a half, which is good for the money. But the fact that it lasts this long and how long it takes each time you use it, I&#x27;ll never put myself through this 2-step system again. Not until next year at least. I feel like this stuff already cured my teeth and did it&#x27;s job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product but you&#x27;ll regret it if you bought it AGAIN back to back. Once you try regular tooth paste, you&#x27;ll become spoiled by it&#x27;s simplicity. All we need is fluoride, and tarter protection. Which normal toothpaste covers. Once you use Crest Pro Health HD, you only really need it once then you can continue using regular toothpaste. Your teeth won&#x27;t fall off from using regular toothpaste, don&#x27;t allow yourself to become too spoiled by this product.&lt;br /&gt;A cleaning at the Dentist and using this for a month and a half should have your teeth extremely healthy, enough that you can live without it for a year. So I recommend only getting it once a year.</li>
            <li> I received this toothpaste to review from Crest and I have to admit that at first I was skeptical. I thought that the 2 step process would be annoying and not worth the effort. I was so surprised when I immediately saw results. I love how coffee and tea stains don&#x27;t even appear anymore. The combo of the steps works really well to whiten and brighten my teeth. I also found that the hydrogen peroxide helped with my gums too. It is a little drying to my tongue and that takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> I received my kit as a promotion from Crest. I was skeptical at first because I wasn&#x27;t sure about using a two step brushing process. However, after using the products for a couple of weeks I realized the results are worth the labor. I did find it to be annoying at times, to brush one minute then reapply and brush another minute but when I looked in the mirror and saw the instantaneous results it made me smile! Also, it made me realize that before using Crest Pro HD I wasnt brushing my teeth long enough.  I was rushing the brushing process. My teeth have never felt so clean, even by the end of the day I was still feeling fresh. In the past I used whitening strips which made my teeth and gums super sensative and I had to stop using it. With this whitening system I had no sensitivity problems at all and see just as good results if not better than when I used the strips.</li>
            <li> From the first time I used this 2-step process, I noticed a big difference! My breath was minty-fresh, and I noticed a whiter, brighter smile within a week.  For 2 minutes a day, this is definitely worth it. I didn&#x27;t suffer the pain in my gums that I sometimes got from whitening treatments, so that was a big plus! Love this new paste!</li>
            <li> I recieved Crest Pro-Health HD for free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.  I love it!! This system freshens, whitens, and keep my teeth feeling cleaning all day.  I have tried to go back to other toothpaste, it&#x27;s just not the same!!  The system is easy to use and you will forget to brush your teeth because your teeth really do feel clean all day!!.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I received this free thru bzzagent to review. At first I thought, this is not to bad. I did notice a little change in the color of my teeth in the first couple days. After that tho, my teeth stayed the same color. I do drink a lot of tea and pop though, which may be to blame. The first couple of days my gums were also sensitive, but that resolved fairly quickly. I do not think my breath got any more fresh with this toothpaste than with regular toothpaste. I also wish the step number 2 opened like step number 1 which would have made it easier.</li>
            <li> I got this product as a free trial from bzzagent and I love it!! The two steps are simple and they do make a HUGE difference in how my teeth look and how my mouth feels!  I am so glad I had an opportunity to try this product... I will not go back to single step brushing again!!</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I tried Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste. It took a little getting used to at first with the different steps but I can clearly see the results. My smile is whiter and brighter and my mouth feels cleaner than ever before. I have even received a few compliments on my smile since I started the regimen.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking to boost the whiteness of their smile without doing anything drastic. I would also recommend it because of the ultra clean mouth feel you get after use.</li>
            <li> When I first got my Crest Pro Health® HD™ product for free to try from Crest via BzzAgent, I was a little hesitant about the two step process and if it would take too long or be too complicated to want to continue. After a few days I got the process figured out and how it works best for me. For example, I discovered I needed to use the 1st step longer than one minute to get a fully clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t really noticed too much of a difference in the feeling and look of my teeth after using Crest Pro Health® HD™, but prior to this I was already using a higher end toothpaste with whitening. It is definitely no worse than what i was using in terms of effectiveness. I do like the concept of the two step process, so each part can be formulated to really focus on either the cleaning aspect or the polishing/whitening aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few things that I don&#x27;t care for. It does take a bit longer for me to brush my teeth to go through the two steps than if I was using a single step toothpaste. Also, the 1st step is a thick gel which can make it hard to get it neatly out of the tube. I&#x27;m also curious to see if both steps run out at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Crest Pro Health® HD™ is a very good toothpaste system that gets done what it says it will do, as long as you don&#x27;t mind a slight bit of extra effort going through the two steps.</li>
            <li> I was able to give Crest HD a try for free. I have been using Crest Pro Health HD for about 2 weeks. I also occasionally use whitening strips or other whitening products to combat stains to my teeth from drinking coffee. I found that combining the Crest with my whitening routine was a great match. The Crest HD has done a great job at maintaining my whitening! I do think the HD has slightly whitened my teeth and probably could do so more with longer use but I feel that it has maintained my white smile wonderfully. I plan on continuing using Crest HD so that I can have to do less frequent whitening with the strips. I should note that I also have bonding on a few teeth and it works well on those teeth as well as my natural teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to keeping the stains away, the toothpaste leaves my mouth feeling fresh and has a pleasant flavor. I also feel that both tubes will last several months making the cost for the Crest HD very reasonable, especially if it means I can use the more expensive whitening strips less often.</li>
            <li> I was sent this toothpaste to try as part of a BzzAgent campaign, and as much as I really wanted to like it, it hurt my teeth.  Like EVERY other whitening product out there.  I liked that it had the two steps but like others, the taste was a turn off.  I wasn&#x27;t able to use it past a couple uses because of the pain, so I couldn&#x27;t tell you if it had an whitening affect at all.</li>
            <li> I received this toothpaste to try for free (thanks, Crest!) and I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like using two different tubes to brush. I like my routine to be quick. I used this toothpaste with my electric toothbrush and I really like the results. My teeth feel cleaner and my mouth feels healthier. It didn&#x27;t take long at all to follow the two step routine on a daily basis (the same time it takes to use my electric toothbrush...2 minutes). My husband tried it too and he really likes it. Who knew that you could have a smile in HD? This toothpaste also didn&#x27;t leave a film on my teeth like others that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I was sent a free trial of Crest Pro-Health HD through BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;After using the toothpaste for a few weeks now, I really like the 2 part system.&lt;br /&gt;Logically in makes sense - clean your teeth then polish &amp; whiten.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to admit, many of my teeth brushing sessions prior to using this product did not last the recommended 2 minutes. I find it much easier to convince myself to brush one minute with step 1 and one minute with step 2. Psychological trick?  maybe.  But, my teeth are whiter!</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste for about 2 1/2 weeks now, and I am really liking it. I received a free sample from BzzAgent, so that is how I got started using it. Pro Health HD is a two-step tooth brushing process. First you use the cleanser to brush your teeth for one minute, followed by another minute with the perfecting gel. I do spend a little longer brushing my teeth than I used to, but that is probably good for getting out any food particles and plaque anyway. After brushing, my teeth felt markedly cleaner and sleeker than with my regular toothpaste after just the first use. I definitely noticed a difference in the feel. Crest Pro Health HD is also supposed to help whiten teeth. Mine have gotten a bit whiter, but there hasn&#x27;t been a stark difference. My girlfriend did mention that she could see a change. I definitely recommend Crest Pro Health HD, although I would not pay full price for it because it is a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> Full disclaimer, I received a sample of this to test. If you are looking for your own at home fresh from a dental cleaning, this is it. You will feel the difference immediately. Your teeth feel polished just like after a dental cleaning and your mouth just feels clean and fresh. Then after a few days a definite improvement in the whiteness. Be sure to follow the directions and only leave it on as long as noted. I had some gum bleeding the first time due to that.</li>
            <li> Crest HD shines! I got to try Crest HD for free via BzzAgent and Crest.  At first it seems like too much to add to your routine.  However, the first application of toothpaste tastes good and takes care of your teeth.  Your teeth feel clean afterwards.  The second application of gel, tastes just okay, but it whitens your teeth.  It is easier than applying strips to your teeth and cheaper than whitening systems.  Crest HD freshens your breathe too!  I definitely recommend Crest HD and it does not take anymore time when replacing your regular toothpaste as part of your morning and nighttime routine.</li>
            <li> I got this to try from Bzzagent.The daily 2 step crest pro-health HD system works great. For only 2 minutes in the morning and at night I&#x27;m getting a healthier brighter smile. The smell is great and not harsh to the nose. I was a little skeptical of using this because I have sensitive teeth. This product worked. I followed the directions which were very simple to follow. My teeth look whiter after just using it in a week. This is a 2 step process with toothpaste in one tube and whitening gel in another tube. It&#x27;s package nicely with both tubes together. I believe my teeth and gums are healthier. My mouth is definitely benefiting from the 2 step system. Both smell great. It doesn&#x27;t take long and it&#x27;s very simple. This is a product worth recommending to others. I&#x27;m looking forward to whiter and healthier teeth. I drank a lot of coffee that stains your teeth. I love fruits but they&#x27;re high in acidity. I&#x27;m all for toothpaste that will help me to continue eating and drinking the things that I love.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Crest and Bzagent for giving me a chance to try it.</li>
            <li> We recently picked up a free sample of the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two Step Toothpaste from our BZZagent status.  My wife and I have been testing this stuff for about a week and we have to say that we absolutely love how this product leaves our teeth feeling.  I have been to the dentist before and paid a fortune for a whitening treatment.  That is now a thing of the past.  For just under $15.00 my WIFE AND I now have whiter, brighter, cleaner teeth and better smelling breath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are about to leave on a cruise and when we received our sample, we figured it would be a great time to try it out and make a change!  We are completely and utterly floored with how fresh this product leaves our mouth!  Everyone has a few minutes in the morning and night to make this product do what it is designed to do and that is to transform your teeth!  We are super excited to take pictures on our cruise not being embarrassed by the yellow that used to linger on our teeth!</li>
            <li> It’s been years since I’ve whitened my skin. While I love having white teeth, I hated the sensitivity caused by whiteners and worried it was eroding my enamel.  Then BzzAgent sent me a new product - Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste System.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was interested to try it when it said that it’s formulated for deep cleaning and advanced whitening that goes beyond your normal toothpaste.  I like that this is incorporated in your normal brushing routine, no messy strips or trays or a bad taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first toothpaste is a cleanser that deep cleans, strips away plaque and helps reverse gingivitis while fighting cavities. The second paste whitens and polishes teeth by removing surface stains.  After the first day, my teeth felt clean, just like I had got a cleaning at the dentist.  I was skeptical when the product promised a whiter smile within a week.  But I was so pleased when my spouse noticed the change.  And best of all, no sensitivity!  My teeth and gums feel great.</li>
            <li> I tried Crest Pro-Health HD for free thanks to Crest and BzzAgent. This product makes my teeth feel healthier and my smile look happier! I can not use the Second Step daily because it &amp;#34;burns&amp;#34; my gums causing white spots and extreme sensitivity, I do Step 2 maybe three times a week. However, Step One I use daily because the fluoride helps to make my teeth healthier and stronger. I do have to say that My teeth are three times whiter then when I began this product, and that is not using it as the directions suggest. I am a smoker, coffee drinker, and love soda but after using this product for four weeks my habits are not noticeable on my teeth!</li>
            <li> Love this! Not only does it make my teeth white but it makes my teeth very smooth and feel like I was just at the dentist and got my teeth cleaned!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Crest Pro-Health HD two step whitening toothpaste for a couple of weeks and have been been loving the results.  I received this whitening kit from BzzAgent to test and review.  From the very first use I could tell that this tooth whitening paste was different from all of the rest I have tried.  First, it tastes pretty good.  I have always hated the baking soda and peroxide toothpastes that left a weird after taste in my mouth.  With the Crest Pro Health HD system both steps leave a clean, fresh taste in your mouth.  Second, it is quick!  You use a small dab from each tube for 1 minute.  No sitting around with gels or liners in your mouth while you &amp;#34;wait&amp;#34; for the ingredients to get to work.  Third, I love how clean my teeth feel after I use this toothpaste.  And although I wouldn&#x27;t describe my teeth as being as white as this page, my teeth have gotten whiter.  My only complaint (if you can even call it that) is that I wish both tubes had flip caps.  Tube 1 easily flips open for minute 1.  Tube 2 has a screw on/off cap and when you are already a minute into brushing your teeth it is hard to usncrew it and cap it back up while starting to brush for minute 2.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for free via BzzAgent and Crest. I was a fan of Crest ProHealth in general, so when this new whitening product came out, I was very curious to try it. I&#x27;ve tried many whitening products in the past - bleach trays from the dentist, white strips, etc. - and always thought it was too much of a hassle. Overall, I give Crest ProHealth HD a thumbs up!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It is so easy to use and hardly changes your brushing routine. Just adds one step - the whitening gel after your normal brushing. 1 minute extra! No yucky trays that you are sleeping in.&lt;br /&gt;-The flavor isn&#x27;t bad for the toothpaste and the whitening step just tastes like peroxide. No biggie.&lt;br /&gt;-My teeth were visibly whiter after only a couple days of brushing! I used it for a week straight and felt great about the shade of white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The feeling of the toothpaste kind of dries your mouth out... like chalky a little bit. But quickly goes away once you rinse.&lt;br /&gt;-I have slightly sensitive gums/teeth, and they did seem more sensitive as the week went on using Crest ProHealth HD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the product is great, and once I finished my week of whitening, I now use it occasionally to maintain the whiteness. Due to my teeth sensitivity, I swap it out for Crest ProHealth sensitive shield every few days. But I love that I can use Crest ProHealth HD to brighten up my teeth on any given day and it&#x27;s so quick and easy!</li>
            <li> I was able to sample this 2 step toothpaste through bzzagent. I was excited to try this product because I am a fan of Crest whitening strips. Brushing with 2 toothpastes takes some adjusting. I also found that after brushing with step 2, my mouth felt a little dryer. I will most likely only continue using this toothpaste if the results are beyond good.</li>
            <li> At first it seems inconvenient to use two toothpastes each night, but it actually seems to make a difference and the two-tube thing becomes a normal part of your routine. I tried this for free as a sample from Crest when they were rolling out the product. I&#x27;m a heavy tea drinker, and it seems to protect against staining that comes along with that.</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent, I got a package of Crest Pro Health HD to try for free. I absolutely LOVE the first step of this teeth whitening system. It makes my mouth feel fresher than any other toothpaste I have ever used. The second step, however, kind of negates this super-fresh feeling. I don&#x27;t want to skip the second step, however. As for whitening, I have not noticed any at all- only fresher breath.</li>
            <li> I  got this as a free sample via BzzAgent to try this product. I am very impressed with this two-step whitening system.  Worked very well and it did a great job of whitening my teeth.  Had no gum sensitivity issues at all and noticed results after the first use!  I plan to continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> I have always used a sensitive tooth product without all those added goodies, now I can have all the extra benefits.&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is I&#x27;ve found the last toothpaste I am ever going to use !</li>
            <li> Generally a smoother feel after I complete the process and although I&#x27;ve only used it for a short amount of time, I see a slight improvement in the color.  It is quite annoying to use two toothpastes but this does force me to do it for two minutes because I want to get the full effects. The taste is good, not too overpoweringly fresh which I do prefer to have incredibly fresh breath.  I would be pleasantly surprised if it does whiten 6x as much as other toothpastes without the harsh chemicals of bleaching trays but have my doubts.  I am trying it out for free as part of a promotion from Crest.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two Step Toothpaste System from Crest as part of a promotional campaign to test the product and give my honest opinion.  My husband and I both decided to use the product and compare our results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like the two step process of brushing.  However, I found out while timing myself (1 minute for each step) that I have obviously been cutting my brushing shorter than I should have in the past so I’m glad that the process helped me become more aware of that.  Step 1 of the process is no different than any other toothpaste and tastes great.  My husband and I both had no issues with this step and I felt like my teeth were clean after this step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2 started off bad when my husband squeezed the tube like normal and the thinner gel shot out.  Take note, this step has a much thinner gel so don’t squeeze the tube much at all unless you want to be covered in tooth paste.  The taste of this step is not nice at all.  And unfortunately the flavor stuck around after I finished my 1 minute of brushing and then rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first comment my husband and I both said after we used the system the first time was our teeth felt squeaky clean.  I loved it!  After the first week and certainly after the 2nd week I could definitely see a difference in the color of my teeth.  My husband and I both agree, we will probably purchase this Two Step System every few months to whiten our teeth since it is a little pricey.  All in all, I am very impressed!</li>
            <li> I got a package of Crest Pro-Health Daily Two-Step Toothpaste from Crest for free to try it out. The day I got it I used it right away, and put it in the center of the bathroom counter and encouraged my husband to try it too. He looked at it and instantly said it looked too complicated. I explained that you brush one minute with the first, spit but don&#x27;t rinse, then brush a second minute with the second step. I also showed that the instructions were on the back of the tube, in case he forgot. I have been using them for a week, but I don&#x27;t know if he has tried it yet.&lt;br /&gt;So the taste and mouth feel (particularly of the first step) are not great. It is a bit wintergreeny - which is my least favorite flavor. It might come in another flavor, but that&#x27;s what I have. The second step tastes a smidge salty, but makes your teeth feel really clean (like after going to the hygenist) - so that makes me very happy. Although I could be sure that there was a difference, a friend came by today and the first thing she said when she hopped out of her car was, &amp;#34;Wow, your teeth are so beautiful.&amp;#34; That alone would get it four stars. I think it is a lot more convenient than trying to remember to do white strips, and I think it is as effective at whitening. I know that the price is high for toothpaste, but low if you consider the cost of white strips and toothpaste. Although this is a two-step process, it does not take any more time than regular brushing, and within a week, the difference is being noticed. I would definitely buy this product.</li>
            <li> Stars: 4 out of 5&lt;br /&gt;Review:&lt;br /&gt;I like the way this product felt in my mouth. It left my mouth feeling clean and refreshed. The taste was a little strange (a little medicine taste) but it seemed to clean my teeth well and my mouth felt fresh. It might have been my imagiantion but I felt like my teeth were whiter just after one use.  Great stuff!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Headline:Features</li>
            <li> This is a nice change from trays and strips for whitening and easy to work into your daily routine. Loved that it was not only whitening but under the Pro Health brand so good for your teeth!</li>
            <li> This two step toothpaste was easy to use (I thought it would be a pain to brush twice but it&#x27;s not).  The toothpaste left my tooth feeling extremely clean and smooth.  I don&#x27;t think my teeth have ever felt this smooth even after a visit to the dentist.  I saw an immediate result in the whitening of my teeth however I did experience sensitivity in my teeth to cold water/food.  I experience sensitivity whenever I use any teeth whitening product.  *I did received Crest Pro-Health HD for free as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> WOW!!! Awesome toothpaste. It use it with my Sonic toothbrush and my mouth feels like I just came from the dentist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of whitening products and I thought this one probably wouldn&#x27;t be any better and I was skeptical of my willingness to brush twice each time.  But, my expectations were seriously blown away when I got the chance from Crest to review this product for free as a BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;Step 1 (a thick blue traditional looking sparkling toothpaste for cleansing) and Step 2 (a clear/whitish gel for whitening) each take 1 minute of back to back brushing.  Considering other whitening products require much more than 1-2 minutes to complete, it is pretty ingenious of Crest to just sneak it into a slightly longer brushing routine!&lt;br /&gt;While the step 1 paste is a bit thicker and grittier than traditional toothpaste, I&#x27;ve felt that my mouth is much cleaner.  There is no minty flavor like one would expect but the flavor isn&#x27;t unpleasant.  I have noticed that some foods and drinks taste a bit off within 1-2 hours of brushing.&lt;br /&gt;The Step 2 gel doesn&#x27;t have any discernible taste and quite surprisingly my teeth were actually whiter after the very first use.  This is what I&#x27;m most pleased about since I&#x27;ve never tried any product with this quick or good of a result.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchased this one again and my husband keeps trying to steal mine!</li>
            <li> I really really like this Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste.  My mouth feels cleaner with just the first step than any other toothpaste, even the Crest Pro-Health regular toothpaste.  An added bonus is the whitener!  I have very sensitive teeth and have used gels from dentist offices before, and those have always brought out my sensitivity.  This second step gel does not leave me regretting the fact that I am whitening my teeth.  I have noticeably whiter teeth after about a week and a half.  I have been using for 3 weeks now, and they continue to get whiter.  I would/will purchase this again.  If not for the whitener (and added plus), but for the step 1 toothpaste!  Thanks to Bzzagent.com, I received this for free, and am now a convert to the HD Two-Step Toothpaste by Crest!</li>
            <li> Had seen advertisements and decided to order. It&#x27;s only been a few days of morning and night bruising but I&#x27;m noticing a difference already!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. It is extremely gentle and an asset to anyone&#x27;s brushing routine. I have very sensitive gums, so finding a whitening toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t bother my gums is QUITE difficult. Great product by Crest! I used this as a FREE trial from Crest, so I was able to try it before purchasing... I will definitely purchase in the future!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing - way easier to use than whitening trays and so so easy to incorporate into my daily brushing routine.  I used to always think I had to wait until my teeth were &amp;#34;dentist-clean&amp;#34; to start a whitening program, but this product proves otherwise.  Within a few days I could see results - brighter and whiter and the fresh taste in my mouth was an added bonus. Who ever expects teeth whitener to taste pleasant?!!!!!  I did receive this product as part of a promotion from the brand but my comments are my own.</li>
            <li> I received this in my bzz kit to try for free so I have been using it for nearly a month. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my teeth, however I should note that I do all of the things one shouldn&#x27;t do if they want pearly whites.  I smoke,  drink coffee,  tea,  and red wine. So, I&#x27;m sure there isn&#x27;t anything wrong with the toothpaste.  I may just be too much to overcome.</li>
            <li> Got to try this product for free thanks to Crest, and I have to say it does make my teeth feel smoother and cleaner, and I noticed a slight whitening effect as well. My teeth are already fairly white from the other products I use throughout the year, but this product maintains the whiteness as a part of my brushing routine rather than having to use another product in addition to brushing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Crest Pro- Health HD for a little over a week. In the beginning there was an after taste that I wasn&#x27;t too pleasant. Step 2 left some kind of film feeling on my teeth but I guess that&#x27;s the stuff that makes your teeth white. Because after only 1 week I noticed a difference in the color of my teeth. It was definitely slightly whiter from using this product. I did not feel any sensitivity or discomfort from this product. Brushing twice in one setting is definitely helpful because it forces me to brush longer. I have been very happy with this toothpaste. Definitely will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this from Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li> I received a brand new full size Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste set last week thanks to Crest and I must say, I&#x27;m very impressed.  In just one week, my teeth were one shade lighter, they felt cleaner, and my breath has never felt so fresh.  The only Con I encountered was that it left my mouth a little on the dry side but that is a small price to pay for a great smile.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to review this product courtesy of Crest and will continue to use it when my sample runs out.  I don&#x27;t write many reviews so that should tell you how much I like it.  My teeth are very sensitive so other tooth-whitening products are painful to use.  This system works much more slowly so I didn&#x27;t get any increased sensitivity.  The results are MUCH more gradual than white strips but that&#x27;s ok for me since this is supposed to become part of your daily routine.  I think I&#x27;ll still use the strips for important events but will keep using this to offset my coffee addiction.</li>
            <li> I was given a free trial of this product and my spouse and I both used it. Our teeth are noticeably whiter and we haven&#x27;t had any issues with increased sensitivity. The two step process doesn&#x27;t take much more time -- you do step 1, spit without rinsing, and then do step 2. We like it and recommend it!</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this product through Crest and BzzAgent, and have been brushing with the Crest Pro Health HD for over a week now.  I have to say... this stuff is awesome!  I&#x27;ve tried strips before which I found to be cumbersome and inconvenient.  They also made my teeth super sensitive.  This stuff makes my mouth feel fresh and, after a week of use, my teeth are noticeably whiter and brighter!  This stuff is cheaper than the strips too, which is a bonus, and you can whiten during your normal toothbrushing routine which is important when every minute counts during the morning and evening crunch time.  I will be buying more, especially now that my husband is hooked too!</li>
            <li> I received  Crest Pro Health HD as a complimentary trial from Crest by being a BzzAgent.  I have to say it is wonderful.  My wife is a seasoned dental hygienist and upon my most recent examination, she stated she could tell I was flossing daily when sadly, I still only floss once a week!  Not to serve as a disclaimer for the need to floss, by any means, but I am stating that for My Mouth, this product works that well!  I have received more compliments on my beautiful white smile than I have in a long time, and I have even used professional level whitening kits from the dentist.  The 2 step process is not any more cumbersome than the usual two minutes of time it takes to brush your teeth daily.  It leaves your mouth feeling fresh, clean and polished just as advertised.  I highly recommend this product, and that&#x27;s from the mouth of the husband of a professional dental hygienist!</li>
            <li> Great Product. As stated Step 1 does leave your mouth feeling a little dry, but rinsing with water or mouth wash takes care of that problem. It really does leave you with a &amp;#34;fresh from the dentist&amp;#34; feel.</li>
            <li> works good, could use more product in the second tube</li>
            <li> As part of a free trial pack, I received the Crest Pro Health HD pack a few weeks ago.  My first couple of brushings, I was expecting more action, but I started out using smaller amounts than I might normally.  I didn&#x27;t want to overwhelm my mouth, so I slowly worked up in amounts of toothpaste from there until I could feel an effect.&lt;br /&gt;The Step 1 is a fairly mild flavor, I assume to not offend different tastes.  Too little, and it loses the flavor quickly, but hitting the tipping point and it lasts for the full brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Step 2, at lessor amounts, was hard to even notice anything else was there.  The flavor was a little more astringent, but not bad.  As the amounts increased, finally hitting that &amp;#34;sweet spot&amp;#34;, I could feel it taking it&#x27;s effect.  Not bad, just noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;You might think to use half the amount of toothpaste on each step, equaling a full amount you might normally.  But instead, think of these as two separate brushings, each requiring the full amount(give or take a bit) that you would normally.  This is where I was initially unimpressed, then as the amounts increased, so did my opinion on the product.&lt;br /&gt;One question I saw being asked was, is this an every-day toothpaste.  For myself, I think the answer is no.  I don&#x27;t have generally sensitive teeth, but there are some spots that are responding a little more sensitively than I&#x27;d like.  I think, unless you&#x27;re a heavy smoker/coffee drinker, you probably don&#x27;t need it all of the time anyway.  Once you get the base staining taken care of, you can let your mouth rest, and just start an upkeep routine mixed with your normal brushing cycle.  This is purely my opinion on the matter, as I have no official answers to relay.&lt;br /&gt;To the questions of does this actually work, I have to say most definitely.  In just the two weeks of brushing, even starting slow and working my way up, I&#x27;ve seen noticeable improvements in the color of my teeth.  Due to the sensitive spots(probably due to recent dentist cleaning), I had to stop for a little while, but the old staining is not returning.  Step 1 does a great job of cleaning initially, which helps Step 2 get to all of those places that are harder to reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price of $38 that I&#x27;m seeing around(unsure on Amazon&#x27;s final price), would make me choke on my toothbrush if it were my normal daily toothpaste.  However, now having my initial cleanings/whitenings completed, I can stomach that price tag for a weekly maintenance for myself.&lt;br /&gt;My only caution would be those with either sensitive teeth, or sensitive gums/areas, is to take it slow.  Start off with smaller amounts initially, and work up to your comfort level.  Instructions/suggestions to this matter would help really round out the product, and would prompt me to update to 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, if you are at all considering a whitening product for your teeth, this would be the one I suggest.  A very simple substitution for your normal brushing routine, and you&#x27;re on your way to a whiter brighter future.dentist cleaning), I had to stop for a little while, but the old staining is not returning.

            <li> This is some awesome stuff. I got it free from BzzAgent so that I could review it, and I think it is the best. Makes you brush longer since you have two parts to complete which alone will get your teeth cleaner. I highly recommend using this product if you want whiter teeth and a healthier smile.</li>
            <li> I love that this is a pro health and whitening in one. The pro health is important to me to keep my teeth healthy and cavity free. I also want white teeth to better my appearance! I am pleased with the results of this after a few weeks of use. It also subconsciously makes me brush longer instead of quickly getting through the brushing process to speed up my morning routine. I am happy that it makes me slow down and do a good job brushing my teeth with the two step process. I&#x27;m a BzzAgent and received samples of this product.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health HD made my teeth noticeably whiter each time I brushed.  The two step process was simple to use and didn&#x27;t take too much extra time in the morning and evening.  However, the toothpaste slightly burned my gums each time and left temporary white spots on my gums.  Overall, it is a decent product for a decent price; however, I think I will stick to my whitening trays in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am received this product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> I did some product testing for Proctor and Gamble years ago. They are a research intensive company. The have people test formulas and get feedback. When Bzz Agent a word of mouth marketing company asked if I wanted to try a new Crest product I quickly agreed.  A friend tested the product for me, and she loved it. It has two pastes. One cleans and the second whitens.  She put a tiny bit of the first paste on a plate (sometimes for fun she mixed in a tiny bit of the flavored crest BE toothpaste, then she dipped her brush in...and using a soft bristled brush, began with the gums and brushed with NOT too much pressure, in a gentle arc. She put the stannous flouride paste on evenly. by dipping the brush, there was not a big need to spit. After brushing for a minute, she then poured some whitener on the brush and covered the same surfaces for another minute. This step is to polish the teeth.  Based upon other reviews (and her new crown) my friend decided to use this once a day for a week, then slowly move up to twice a day. She found a clean mouth, a shiny smile and now enjoys smiling. She said &amp;#34;It makes me happier.&amp;#34;  Crest was the first toothpaste to use stannous flouride and it is estimated a half billion cavities have been avoided by using Crest.  Two step Crest takes two minutes to use. Go slow and see if this works for you.  My friend loves it!</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to test this product for free because I am a Buzz Agent. I probably wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it if I just saw a commercial or seen it on the shelf in the store. I am not into complicated procedure when it comes to my morning routine, but this is very simple. After given the opportunity to actually try it, I would buy the product. Lately I seemed to get a nasty taste in my mouth early on in the morning. I almost felt like I had to brush my teeth again within the hour. I have to say I don&#x27;t get the yucky taste/feeling in my mouth after having some coffee in the morning. My mouth seems fresher a lot longer then before. The whiting effect has made my teeth brighter. I am a coffee drinker and was concern that they weren&#x27;t as bright as they had been before. I have more confidence in my smile and breath.</li>
            <li> I received the Crest Pro Health® HD™ Daily 2-Step System free from BzzAgent and Crest (thank you!). I don&#x27;t necessarily enjoy having TWO steps to complete with each brushing, but it&#x27;s definitely been worth it for the results. I truly believe I have a whiter smile thanks to this product. I also want to point out that, to me, it tastes like regular toothpaste, as I noticed others complaining about it&#x27;s taste. I don&#x27;t have a problem with Step One or Step Two&#x27;s taste. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health HD does offer a clean feeling, but I didn&#x27;t notice much whitening over 6 weeks. It is also a bit of work to have to add another toothpaste while you&#x27;ve already been brushing your teeth. A one-step process would be much easier.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in time with a good quality. I used it for a week and it really made my teeth whiter :)</li>
            <li> I received his a free tri from crest. The two step process is really simple, my toothbrush has a two minute timer on so I just have to pause it halfway to switch steps.  I really like the intensity of the first cleaning step, it does kind of dry out my mouth but leaves a stron clean feeling as well. I drink coffee everyday and do notice a sufferance in whiteness. Highly recommend giving it a shot.</li>
            <li> Unlike other teeth whitening systems, this new kit does not require sticking strips of plastic on your teeth or biting down on a plastic tray. Crest HD can be used at the same time of your regular teeth brushing routine! I had the opportunity to try this out from Bzzagent and I really like this system. I have receeding gums which leaves my the teeth area at the gumline exposed and causing major sensitivity with hot/cold products. I was afraid that this whitening method would aggravate the sensitivity issue but it has not! I have used Crest HD for a couple of weeks day and night and still no sensitivity issues! There is a stubborn stain between my teeth that I have been using to gauge the effectiveness of Crest HD and I can say that the stain has become fainter. Myteeth do look brighter but not blinding artificial white which I appreciate!</li>
            <li> I tried this product for free - thanks to Crest! I loved it! I can definitely notice a whiter and brighter smile!</li>
            <li> Feel like my oral health has definitely improved since I started using this</li>
            <li> Aside from whitening toothpaste, I&#x27;ve never tried to whiten my teeth. I drink coffee daily, and red wine at least once a week. Recently I noticed my teeth were not as bright or white anymore. So when I was offered the chance to try Crest Pro Health HD for free through BzzAgent.com, I figured it was worth a shot. The whole two step brushing process can get a little annoying when you&#x27;re super tired and just want to get to bed, but it&#x27;s worth the effort. In the two weeks I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste system, my teeth are noticeably brighter. I only wish I had taken photos before I started. In addition to the results, the taste is refreshing and my mouth feels very clean.</li>
            <li> So, full disclosure, this stuff does not leave a pleasant minty fresh taste...and I have already whitened my teeth before, which is why I waited so long to write a review...BUT after a visit to my dentist, I was ecstatic that for the first time EVER I was plaque-free!! They usually (and quite painfully) have to scrape my teeth when I go in for a cleaning. It&#x27;s so bad, that I always take pain meds before I arrive (and little good those do!). I have never been to a dentist and left without them telling me my plaque is bad. Which is both gross and embarrassing! So I was most definitely whistling a different tune when my hygienist told me how beautiful my teeth looked and gave me a clean bill of health with no scraping whatsoever! I received my first box as part of a promotional campaign via bzzagent, and I promptly stopped by Target on my way home and bought more! It&#x27;s a bit pricey (almost $14) for toothpaste so definitely get it here on Amazon, but I suppose it&#x27;s not really JUST toothpaste, is it? I&#x27;ll pay that any day to get the results I did (pain-free) from my dentist!</li>
            <li> I think its a decent toothpaste but as a whitener I&#x27;m unsure. It definitely promotes brushing your teeth more and longer however I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now, twice a day, and have not noticed any changes in whiteness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*received for testing purposes</li>
            <li> I received this toothpaste to try as part of a BzzAgent campaign and I had problems with it. I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth but this system caused me discomfort. My mouth felt gummy and soft. The second step I couldn&#x27;t use the entire 60 seconds. I tried using each step for 30 seconds every other day but I couldn&#x27;t do that for 30 days. This process is not worth it for me and I stopped using it. I did feel like my mouth was clean but it also felt uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I received the Crest ProHealth HD two-step toothpaste system as a member of BzzAgent, and I have not gone back to my Tom&#x27;s since.  I feel like I&#x27;m getting closer to a dentist&#x27;s office clean than I was with my original toothpaste, and think that this is keeping my teeth in better shape (aesthetically and actually) in between office visits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it is a two-step process, which messes a bit with my electronic toothbrush regimen.  Since my toothbrush already operates in a 2 minute cycle (it buzzes every 30 seconds so you know to change quadrants and then double buzzes at the end of the 2 minutes so you know you&#x27;re done) it wasn&#x27;t a challenge to brush for the full 2 minutes.  But it&#x27;s a pain (read: I feel like it lessens the battery life of my toothbrush) to start and stop it mid-cycle when I am switching between steps 1 and 2.  The alternative is to just stop brushing and put the step 2 on while it&#x27;s buzzing but you just lose a few seconds.  Sounds nitpicky but it&#x27;s definitely an extra step and you lose something - either time of brushing or battery life - along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that&#x27;s truly my only complaint!  I really enjoy the step 1 paste - like the taste of it, how clean my teeth feel afterwards, and the overall feel.  Step 2&#x27;s taste took a little getting used to - it is more medicinal/typical of other whitening products I have used, such as Crest White Strips - but I don&#x27;t notice anything off-putting now and love that it has whitened my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been use crest toothpaste for decade, but this type are not selling here.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s shame that i&#x27;m a smoker, but this item really good, make my teeth more cleaner.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product to try out as part of a BzzCampaign.  I have been using it for a few weeks and have mixed feelings.  Pros -  I do feel like it leaves my teeth feeling clean and smooth after use, which is great.  I haven&#x27;t noticed dramatic whitening changes, but do feel like my teeth look nice and bright after use.  Cons - the two step process is not that bad, but the second tube is tough to open / apply while using my electric toothbrush.  I also think that step 2 has a really unappealing taste.  I am prone to sensitive teeth and have not had a major reaction to this product, which is good, but I am only using once a day just to be safe.  Bottom line is I am not sure I would pay the price to buy this myself.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I saw the BzzAgent campaign for Crest Pro Health® HD and was able to try this product as part of a promotion. I drink a lot of coffee and tea so I use whitening strips on my teeth a few times a year.  When I got my kit in the mail, I wanted to start using it right away!  After reading through the directions, I was a little concerned about not being able to spit during the two minutes I was required to brush my teeth because I usually do a few times but I decided to give it a go.  How it works is you brush your teeth with Step 1, the purifying cleanser, for one minute and then add Step 2, the perfecting gel to your toothbrush without rinsing or spitting, and brush for another minute.  The tubes are clearly labeled so there is no concern about mixing up which tube goes first and two minutes is the recommended brushing time. I put Step 1 on my toothbrush and began brushing. I use a Sonicare (electric toothbrush) to brush my teeth and it is awkward having to turn the toothbrush off to add Step 2 but that is what I did. One nice thing is my Sonicare has a built in timer for two minutes. When that time is up the toothbrush turns off. Even when I turn it off briefly to add Step 2, it still keeps track of my two minutes. I was a little relieved when the two minutes was up and I could finally spit!! The taste of the toothpaste and the gel are not bad. I wish they were a stronger mint flavor but at least they are not chalky. I have been using Crest Pro Health® HD for about two weeks now and I am very pleased with the results. My teeth have definitely become whiter and the stains are becoming less noticeable. I am getting compliments from people about how great my teeth look and I am smiling with more confidence.  Overall, I enjoy using Crest Pro Health® HD, would buy it and use it again, and would recommend Crest Pro Health® HD to my friends and family. The “not spitting” and stopping to add the second step to my toothbrush are not so awkward anymore and have just become a part of my natural routine. It is definitely easier that putting the strips on my teeth. I would always get the strips twisted, not put on correctly, or wouldn’t remember to put them on until I was out the door and then you have to wear them for 20 to 30 minutes! The Crest Pro Health® HD is just  2 minutes a day and will quickly become a part of your everyday routine!have just become a part of my natural routine.

            <li> Amazing results with this toothpaste. My teeth were an off white yellow from tea, but after just a week, you can see an improvement. I loved it. Another bright spot is that it leaves your mouth feeling ridiculously clean even without following with a mouthwash. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I got this last week and I have noticed a big difference. I am more confident while smiling and love it, but there is a down side. To be completely honest the first step makes your mouth feel like a cats tongue and has a funky taste. The second step is a little painful, not too bad. It did leave a white spot on my gums (after every brushing)that goes away shortly after. I am going to continue using it and ask my dentist if this is causing problems. I do recommend it though because it works just like it promised. I am really happy with the results!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product that does not make my sensitive teeth too sensitive.  At first, I did not like the 2 minute requirement, but quickly got used to it.  I do think my teeth have whiten a shade or two, but not nearly as much as I was hoping.  I will continue to use for a couple more months in hopes that they do.  I started using this product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> I was super skeptical when Crest generously sent me a sample of the Pro Health HD to try. It seemed weird to me, to have to brush my teeth in two steps. Well, fear not! It&#x27;s actually very painless. It&#x27;s just a matter of putting the toothpaste (step 1) on the brush, brushing halfway (1 minute), spitting it out without rinsing your mouth, then putting the whitening gel (step 2) on the brush and brushing for a minute. It literally takes about 4 seconds longer than if you were brushing with a traditional toothpaste. I noticed my teeth lightening up by the third day, and that&#x27;s no exaggeration. By the end of two weeks, my teeth were noticeably whiter! The best part is I didn&#x27;t even have to use strips or trays (which I hate using, but are the only things that ever seem to work). This is a great new product! Give it a try. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product to try for free from Crest and BzzAgent. I really enjoyed the feeling after using this product. My teeth felt clean like I&#x27;d just left the dentist office. I noticed a difference after just one use. However the two minute system took a toll on my gums and I had to stop using after a few days. I have a sensitive mouth and while my teeth didn&#x27;t have the usual pain from whitening products my gums couldn&#x27;t handle the brushing. I would suggest using a very soft brush if you have a sensitive mouth. Definitely worth giving a try.</li>
            <li> I wish I could say that I liked the Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System... I&#x27;ve always wanted to try a whitening product, but never have because of the price. I was thrilled to try this product as part of a promotion from the Crest through BzzAgent and was pretty happy with it the first two weeks. I didn&#x27;t notice much difference in the whitening itself, but the packaging said to use it for 30 days for the full effect. I saw some reviews where people complained about the way it felt in their mouth or tasted, but I really felt like it did a good job cleaning and didn&#x27;t have any issues with the texture or taste. If you&#x27;d asked me during my first two weeks of use if I would recommend it I would have said yes. Unfortunately, after about two weeks of use I started to notice my teeth were extra sensitive and were starting to be sore by the end of the day. Years ago I suffered from extreme tooth sensitivity and used Sensodyne or other sensitive toothpaste for years to overcome the sensitivity. The pain continued for a few days and I mentioned it to my husband. He suggested it could be from the harsh whitening products, that it probably stripped whatever protection I had, causing them to become sensitive again. I bought the Crest sensitivity toothpaste, started using it instead of the Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System toothpaste and felt a difference within a day or so of use. The only thing I can think is that my husband was right that it stripped my teeth during those two weeks of use. Because of this I unfortunately will not be recommending this to anyone or continuing to use it. I am disappointed to be sure, but for anyone out there with a history of sensitivity, this may not be the product for you!</li>
            <li> I started using this almost a month ago and like it a lot.  I received it free as a promotion to try it out and tell my friends what I thought about it.  I can honestly say that my smile is brighter and I am super happy with the results.  I like that it has two toothpastes you use back to back to help clean my teeth.  One of the things I was not a fan of was how dry the first tooth paste made my mouth feel, but after using the second that feeling goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Bzz Agent Opinionated here, with the latest on Crest Pro Health® HD™.  Please note that as a Bzz Agent, I was sent a free kit as part of a promotion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, I was skeptical.  I&#x27;ve tried ALL kinds of stuff on my once-pearlier whites.  I&#x27;m older, my teeth are older...ya know how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, I really LIKED this two-step process.  Admittedly, I &amp;#34;ugh&#x27;d&amp;#34; at the thought of adding another step to my routine, but my teeth and mouth felt cleaner after the very first use, and the whitening was clearly evident.  I am more than pleased with the results, and my husband began using it when he noticed a difference in my smile as well.  All-in-all, this is a great product and I&#x27;m really glad I had the opportunity to try it.  I&#x27;m on the fence about whether or not I&#x27;ll continue using it regularly or just as a spot-use here and there, but it is definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li> I was at the dentist in January and had some early gingivitis following pregnancy. I received Crest ProHealth HD to try, and since the box claims that it will improve gum health, I thought I should really make an effort to use it.  I went back after using Crest ProHealth HD for about a month and my gum inflammation had gone down and gingivitis was reversing! I definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> Although I hate having to do two steps, this toothpaste system has actually changed my life. Due to not having insurance, I stopped visiting my dentist over ten years ago. Although it is humiliating to admit, my teeth have really paid the price! My breath is bad, my teeth have visible cavities, and my wisdom teeth have erupted and started to decay. I usually do not smile, and chew gum like it&#x27;s my job. I don&#x27;t like talking one on one to people because I know my breath is bad. I was skeptical about this toothpaste, assuming that my teeth are too great a mess for any store paste to make a difference. I was WRONG! This toothpaste system cuts the plaque down and has improved my breath. I also have really brilliant white teeth now, and I am an avid Dt. soda drinker. The real positive that came from my free promotional kit (I got it free from Crest through a Bzzz promotion!), is how it allowed me to like my smile! I took a great stride and even scheduled a dental appointment for me t week because I am encouraged that there is hope! I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My husband and I began using Crest Pro Health HD as soon as we received it free from Crest. We were both simply amazed at how white our teeth were after the first use! We have continued to use it daily, and our teeth have never been whiter, even though we have used special teeth-whitening products in the past. Our teeth feel cleaner and healthier. My teeth have a nice smooth surface as well. We have found our new toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how well this is working!  I got a free sample from Crest through bzzagent and was very skeptical.  But, after using it for about 2 weeks, my teeth do look whiter and feel smoother.  I am a little concerned that it may be wearing away my tooth enamel and plan to look into it, just because they now feel so smooth.  My only complaint is that the taste is not great, especially the gel taste.</li>
            <li> Did not see a difference and did not like taste of the 2nd step.</li>
            <li> After using this product for just over a month as part of a promotional thing, it was hard to tell if there was a difference from before I started using the product.  At times, I thought my teeth were whiter, but then looking at pictures from before I started using the product, I didn&#x27;t really see a difference.  Certainly no other person mentioned a difference in my teeth color.  Honestly, I tend to use products that use natural ingredients, and will probably revert back to a toothpaste that uses less man-made chemicals.</li>
            <li> I was given this product as a free sample from BzzAgent and I&#x27;m glad I got to try it! All in all I liked this product. My issues with it were minor compared to the result. I would forget to bring my phone in the bathroom sometimes to time myself ( one minute for the polishing paste and one for the whitening gel) so I would have to guess how long I had been brushing. I also started to develop some gum sensitivity and I really don&#x27;t think it freshened my breath, however my husband had no complaints. Overall my mouth felt cleaner and my teeth were whiter, there was a noticeable difference for sure.</li>
            <li> I was happy to be invited to this campaign (from Crest) as I love being able to try the newest dental products out on the market.  So I first tried step one.  After I brushed it on my teeth it felt really weird. It made your teeth feel very rough even though this toothpaste had a lot of grit in it and is very abrasive.  Another problem with step one is the stannous fluoride.  It can stain your teeth which I suppose is why they use step 2 to whiten any stannous fluoride stain.  I then tried step 2.  Step 2 was a lot better.  It is pretty much pure hydrodgen peroxide which is used to whiten teeth.  I loved step 2 as it made my teeth feel super clean which I assume is why they made step 1 as step 1 makes your teeth feel very rough.  I liked how step 2 actually did help make my teeth more white as well.  After a couple days of using both Step 1 and 2  I ended up using my normal toothpaste I use on a daily basis and then also step 2.  I feel like anyone can you their own toothpaste preference for step 1 and then use the step 2 product for whitening. I am also not a fan that Crest has not removed the blue micro beads in their toothpastes.  This beads get stuck in your gums and do not deteriorate. Another reason why I axed the step 1 toothpaste. Also how does Crest expect for someone to really use 2 toothpastes, when most people barely even use one! Just curious.  I don&#x27;t think this product is going to last long on the market especially for $12. It was a good thought, and ok product, but it is not something I would go out and buy when I can use my favorite toothpaste and my whiten trays/whitening strips than use two toothpastes.</li>
            <li> i was excited to receive this to try out as a bzzagent. I have used a few different kind of teeth whitening products before, this one by far is the easiest one to use. We all brush our teeth everyday anyway, brush them with a toothpaste that whiten at the same time save so much time and hassle. I have used the whitening strips before, I basically need to stand in front of the sink the whole time to prevent dripping. With this Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste, even though is a 2 part steps, it still only the usual 2 minutes route. I do agree with other reviewer that I wish the step 2 tube will be better if the lid is flip instead of screw.</li>
            <li> teeth are not whiter after use.  I tried for three months, using it as directed.  No change, though had irriatated gums because of the chemicals in this.  Don&#x27;t get me started with the cancer causing chemicals that Crest uses.  oy gevalt my friends,</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to! I could see that my teeth were whiter after just one day of using it. The hardest part is remembering not to rinse in between the 2 steps, but that doesn&#x27;t even matter once you see your teeth getting whiter. Crest&#x27;s system cleans and whitens with no more effort than normal brushing. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a whiter smile! Thank you, Crest (and BuzzAgent) for the free sample - will definitely be buying this!</li>
            <li> Ok so im a bzz agent.  Got it free. Still, two steps?  Yeah worth it! Brighter teeth and fed her breath for sure!  This heavy coffee and tea drinker thanks you!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I first heard about this 2 step brushing process. Really? We can put a man on the moon, but I need to brush my teeth with 2 different pastes to get a healthy smile and white teeth? I started using the system and realized that this is a very good thing. Just like a lot of things in life, 2 stages is important. You aren&#x27;t going to wax your car without really getting it clean first, right? The first step is cleaning your teeth with this system. The texture of the paste and the minty freshness makes my mouth feel clean, and I notice it most with better smelling breath in the morning. The second step is a clear paste that helps whiten and polish the teeth, and when I&#x27;m brushing with this paste it feels like it&#x27;s doing what it needs to do. I&#x27;ve noticed my smile is looking a lot better. Cleaner and whiter teeth for an overall healthy mouth. Thanks for sending this to me Crest!</li>
            <li> Full disclosure:  I received a free sample of this courtesy of Crest (thanks Crest!), but, rest assured, my review is exactly as it would be if I&#x27;d bought it with my own hard-earned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, if you&#x27;re wondering about the two-step process, it&#x27;s not that big a deal. I have a heck of a time getting up and out of the house in the morning, and the extra step is really not a big deal at all.  After the first few days, I noticed my gums were a little sore.  I actually found myself trying to remember if I&#x27;d recently replaced the brush head on my Sonicare, and if maybe I&#x27;d bought a firmer brush.  I realized I hadn&#x27;t done that, so I think it might have been the paste - however, I traveled for a couple days and used whatever I had in a TSA-friendly little tube, and when I came home and went back to the HD, all was fine.  No sore gums since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really like about this is the right-from-the-dentist feeling it gives me.  And the feeling lasts throughout the day.  I think my teeth are looking pretty nice and white, too.  (without that unnatural glowing white look that some people get these days, from whatever they&#x27;re using).</li>
            <li> The biggest bonus of this product is the clean/fresh feeling that you get after using it. I haven&#x27;t experienced that with any other oral hygiene product and for someone who loves oral hygiene, that&#x27;s a pretty big bonus. The downside? 2 steps. Most people don&#x27;t even take the necessary 2 minutes you&#x27;re supposed to spend on your teeth, so adding an extra step is a real-life deterrent. I actually do take the full 2 minutes (most times) and I even felt the 2 step thing grind on my nerves a bit. Some days I didn&#x27;t even do it because it was a hassle. However, when I did consistently use it, I noticed several people (including my dental hygienist!) tell me my teeth looked really white. I regularly use another competing whitening toothpaste and received this to try for free, so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because it whitens better or just does a better job of creating a more brilliant luster. Either way, you get positive results and the clean feeling is a really positive bonus - enough to deal with 2 steps in the end.</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro Health HD for free as a BzzAgent and thanks to Crest. I was given two tubes of paste. As I applied the first step to my brush, I observed that the thickness of the paste made it susceptible to clogging of the tube and general messiness. It made it difficult to close without cleaning the opening where the paste exits. I did appreciate the flip top opening, though. No more losing the cap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first I used as a traditional paste and brushed with it for one minute. It made my teeth feel squeaky clean. The directions told me not to rinse, but to spit and immediately apply the gel of the second tube to my tooth brush. This agent didn&#x27;t foam as much as the first. After one minute of brushing with Step 2, I rinsed. My mouth felt noticeably cleaner with these two steps than with my usual tooth paste (Sensodyne).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Crest Pro Health for this paste month, I have experienced no increase in tooth sensitivity, but I also have not seen any increase in whiteness. The dual step program does seem to encourage me to brush for longer, but I until I hear word from my dentist, I don&#x27;t believe this tooth paste is exceptional in whitening properties (I do regret not taking before/after photos).  I was impressed with the fact that the 2-step system has produced a very positive change in my tooth brushing habits. It&#x27;s as if having a longer process has convinced me that I need to take better care to do the tooth brushing procedure with more seriousness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be recommending this product to friends and family and can see myself purchasing it when I run out.</li>
            <li> I love love teeth whitening products.  When I saw this and was given the chance to try it I just had to give it a try.  I did receive this product as a promotion from the brand.  Let me tell you if you try this you will not be disappointed.  I have tried almost EVERY whitening product out there and here is one that actually works!  I noticed a difference in just two days.  Try it and see. You will love it!</li>
            <li> Gives me the feeling that my teeth are super clean.  I&#x27;ve definitely seen a noticeable difference in the whiteness of my teeth, I go to the dentist soon and we&#x27;ll see if I get the gingivitis talk. I&#x27;m hoping that using Crest Pro-Health HD will help there too!!  Luck for me I got to try it through a free promotion, but will be using this on the regular moving forward.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a Mentadent girl, but I was given a package of Crest Pro-Health HD for free from Crest to try, so I went for it. I&#x27;m really impressed by how well it works! The 2-step process is unique. The first step cleans your teeth and removes old plaque. I felt a sort of fizzing sensation when using it that I wasn&#x27;t used to, but it wasn&#x27;t unpleasant. My mouth felt great after brushing with it. Next, I used the second step - a perfecting gel - that sort of polishes your teeth and removes stains. It left my teeth feeling incredibly smooth, like after going to the dentist. I really liked that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One big difference that I noticed was that my morning coffee didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; to my mouth and leave that gross feeling like it normally does. It&#x27;s almost like the toothpaste created a protective barrier. I felt more confident after using this toothpaste and I really feel like it cleaned my teeth better than my usual brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like (and what&#x27;s keeping it from getting 5 stars) is that it&#x27;s a 2-step process and that the formulas are in 2 separate containers. I don&#x27;t have a huge bathroom vanity, so for me, having to store 2 tubes of toothpaste is a negative.</li>
            <li> I have been a Crest toothpaste user for a long time but was looking for something to kick up the whitening a notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given the Crest HD system to try for free from Crest.  I was surprised that I noticed a marked improvement in the first week.  I was skeptical at first since it was two steps, but the results were worth it and it really didn&#x27;t take much more time that regular brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can recommend this to anyone and most of all, no sensitivity problems, which I was worried about too.  An added plus is no more morning breath!</li>
            <li> Ahhhhhmazing!! I have tried numerous teeth whitening products and this is by far the best!! Leaves your teeth sparkling clean and fresh. I felt like I just left the dentist chair after a professional cleaning. I received this as a sample from bzz.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product as a BzzAgent member. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.  I wasn&#x27;t sold on it when it arrived.  I couldn&#x27;t figure out how toothpaste would be able to whiten my teeth in a week.  However, using this product quickly changed my mind.  What a simple thing!  All I have to do is brush my teeth like a normally do with one additional step and my teeth will be whiter!  No trays; no sticky film to put on my teeth.  Just brushing my teeth.  I will be a regular purchaser of this product from now on.  I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Crest Pro-Health HD from Crest &amp; BzzAgent. At first, I was a little skeptical. However, after using it for the first time yesterday, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised. My teeth feel cleaner than they have in quite sometime -- it&#x27;s definitely a dentist clean feeling. I can&#x27;t wait to see how healthy and white my teeth (and gums) get over the next few weeks. Definitely going to stick with this regime!</li>
            <li> Crest HD is amazing! After just one use I could feel a difference! This toothpaste makes your teeth and gums feel so much better, cleaner and healthier. I received it free through a crest promotion and I am so glad I did. I don&#x27;t know that I would have tried it otherwise. This toothpaste removes the plaque and grime that all other toothpastes are claiming to be removing as well as whitens. I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been relatively impressed with Crest Pro Health HD.  I received a sample of it for free, otherwise I may have never tried it based on the price. It has actually been a positive experience with it.  I have been using it for at least 2 weeks now, maybe closer to 3 and my teeth look a shade whiter.  I wouldn&#x27;t say I saw the difference of some of the reviews on it, but I also think my teeth are also naturally not as white. The process is very easy to brush with the first and then switch to the other tube for the whitener.  I actually find I don&#x27;t rinse as much after finishing with the whitener like I do with regular toothpaste, my teeth/mouth feel fresh.  I would definitely recommend to anyone to at least try it to see if it works for you.</li>
            <li> Step 1 - the purifying Cleanser, is way too intense of a clean.  Honestly, while using it, you feel like your entire mouth is being stripped of everything that has ever lived there. In theory, that should be a good thing, but it feels too abrasive to be healthy.  When adding the second step, the gel, it begins to feel a bit normal again.  Its almost like they took normal toothpaste, separated the gel from it, and made something that used to be 1 step and complicated it. Overall, I am not impressed by this product. #gotitfree from crest through #bzzagent</li>
            <li> I am always looking for new ways to lighten and brighten my teeth, and was thrilled to receive the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two Step Toothpaste free from Crest.  This is a two step system.  The first step is to clean your teeth.  This paste tastes great, freshens your mouth, and makes everything feel super clean.  The next step is the whitening polish, and you can feel it working on your teeth.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now, and while I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference in the whiteness of my teeth, I do feel like my smile is brighter and my mouth feels clean - like after a dentist visit.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to have fresh breath, clean teeth and a brighter smile.  It doesn&#x27;t take any longer to use both products, and the Crest name alone tells you that its a quality product.  Give it a try - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> It may be doing a good job of cleaning my teeth, but it burns my tongue in the process. It has an overpowering flavor.</li>
            <li> Right off the bat I liked the recycled packaging of the Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste. However, I didn&#x27;t like having a extra tube to make space for on my bathroom sink. The paste had a surprisingly nice mild taste that wasn&#x27;t overpowering at all. It tasted like it had baking soda in it and it foamed quickly, causing me to spit sooner than usual. My teeth felt really clean when I was done, like just coming back from the dentist. The gel didn&#x27;t have much of a taste to it, which was fine. I think it will get old using two different products each time I brush my teeth. I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times so far, so if it seems to make a difference, it might be worth it. We&#x27;ll have to see. I was able to review this product courtesy of Crest.</li>
            <li> I love this system. I have been using it for a few weeks and it has definitely improved my teeth. I did notice that within a couple of uses my teeth appeared whiter and healthier. Family and friends have complimented me on my teeth and asked what dentist I used for my whitening treatments.  I did have a bit of discomfort with Step 2 at first but it abated after a use or two and it was nothing compared to the sheer pain that I experienced with whitening strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample product as a member of BzzAgent but my opinion was in no way influenced by having received a free product.</li>
            <li> I got to try this toothpaste free from a program run by Crest and I am so happy I did.  I was very skeptical at first that it would work any better than other toothpaste.  I was wrong.  There are two steps, a cleaning step and then a whitening step.  My teeth feel much cleaner after the cleaning step than after using other toothpaste.  After using both steps, my breath is fresher too.  I didn&#x27;t think the whitening step would do anything, but after using the toothpaste for just over a week I got compliments on my teeth and I noticed they were whiter too.  I know this costs a little more than regular toothpaste, but it is worth is.  It actually whitens unlike others that just say they do.  I don&#x27;t need to but another whitening product any more and it is one less thing I have to worry about now.  I am going to keep using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I recently received this product for free thanks to Crest and I&#x27;m so happy that I did! I have to say, I was a bit skeptical about this product when I first tried it because other systems don&#x27;t seem to work, they just make my teeth more sensitive,  but I&#x27;m actually very impressed after using it for just over a couple weeks! I could totally tell a difference after the very first time I used this product, I honestly felt like I just walked out of the dentist office, my teeth were squeaky clean! The two step process takes a little bit longer than my normal routine, but it&#x27;s worth it. I feel like my teeth stay clean all day long. I have been using this product for about two weeks now and just this weekend someone commented that I have very white teeth! Yay! I&#x27;m getting married this September and will continue to use this product, I even have my fiance using it too!</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health HD is really an amazing product. It is one that is truly intended to provide advanced cleaning, cleaning that is so advanced that you feel like you have just been to the dentist&#x27;s office for your annual cleaning.  The first time that I used this product, I truly wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from it. After all there are tons of products out there that make similar claims. They whiten teeth and freshen breath. However, this product truly does work. I felt it the first time I used it.  After my mouth literally felt cleaner and fresher. I felt like I just had a professional cleaning.  That clean feeling lasted for a long time as well (throughout the day and into the evening) . I felt throughout the day like my mouth was still fresh and had a lingering minty taste. The only drawback that I can see so far is the fact that this kit involves two steps but its worth the extra time for the clean that you get from it!  Also cheaper to do this than have the dentist do a professional whitening job and works better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this product 5 stars!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would order this from Amazon!!! Original sample came from BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> I love the Crest Pro Health HD that I received free from Crest through BzzAgent to try!  I notice that my teeth feel much cleaner.  This is a 2 step process where you are supposed to brush for 1 minute on each step.  I&#x27;m not sure if my teeth are so much cleaner because of the long brush time, or the product, but I like how clean it makes my teeth feel.  I noticed that my husband&#x27;s teeth are much whiter after using this product too.  I don&#x27;t see the yellowish stains on his teeth, or notice any visible plaque anymore.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I received it from BzzAgent to try out and review. It makes my teeth feel really clean and definitely whitens them.  The process is a little different, considering it&#x27;s a two step process, but I like the results. I use it with my Sonicare toothbrush and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of crest pro health from being a buzz agent. I really feel a difference with this toothpaste. It gives me the dentist clean feeling even after the first time I used it. After about a week I believe my teeth did get whiter. I few friends asked if I had my teeth whitened.</li>
            <li> I was selected for a free sample of this product and have been using it for a week. And while I&#x27;ll agree that there is no better whitening product out there the way it makes my mouth feel after using it is a bit off putting. It drys my mouth out completely and leaves a chemically taste. However, if you only care about white teeth then 5 stars all the way.</li>
            <li> Works great, whitens teeth, leaves your mouth feeling fresh</li>
            <li> So I received the Crest HD toothpaste for free to try through bzzagent. I&#x27;m a dentist, and I have always been a very loyal Colgate total user. I was not a fan of the crest prohealth toothpaste because the after taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basics: two step system - step 1 has the active ingredient in it. The stuff that really cleans the teeth. It is the same stuff that&#x27;s in crest prohealth. Use this step for one minute. Spit the excess out. Step 2- the &amp;#34;polishing&amp;#34; step. Has similar ingredients to other whitening toothpastes. Spit and rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros--- as a dentist, it&#x27;s great that it gets people to brush for 2 minutes. It definitely has left my mouth feeling very clean. The bad aftertaste from the prohealth that I disliked is gone after using the second step. I do believe my mouth feels cleaner and smoother...even more than my Colgate total. (Never thought I&#x27;d say that being a loyal Colgate user)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons-- initially, I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the taste of the second step but I&#x27;ve totally gotten used to that. Whitening toothpastes don&#x27;t really whiten the internal part of your tooth. They are better at removing the surface staining. Read the fine print...they all say that. Whitening is dependent upon concentration and time. So you really aren&#x27;t going to get whitening from any toothpaste. If you want true whitening you should see your dentist for bleach trays or use white strips like crest white strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall-- a great toothpaste that leaves your teeth feeling very clean and polished. Not going to leave you with whiter teeth in my opinion. I&#x27;ll add to the review later if I see results.</li>
            <li> Crest sent me their new product ( Crest Pro HealthÂ® HDâ„¢) to try out and to give my honest feed back. Crest Pro-Health HD is a daily two-step system designed to enhance your oral care routine. With just two minutes of brushing, youâ€™ll actually feel the difference from the first use. I honestly felt every time I brushed I had just went and had my teeth cleaned. My mouth felt cleaner and healthier! I had that fresh clean smile....and breath! I tried the product out for 2 weeks straight...I also took my &amp;#34;teeths&amp;#34; picture every morning after I brushed for 6 days...so that I could compare the white teeth I already had to the whiter celebrity bright white I was wanting to achieve from this product. The product says you will see a difference in the color of your teeth in 6 days.&lt;br /&gt;The taste of the product is similar to that of baking soda, METAL and mint.&lt;br /&gt;I did brush my teeth after the Crest Pro-Health HDâ„¢ with my Crest Completeâ„¢ because I wasnt sure if I could brush with my tongue and the roof of my mouth with the Pro-Health ...I did try a couple of times but I didnt like the after taste of METAL so I always re-brushed with the Crest Completeâ„¢.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the Crest Pro HealthÂ® HDâ„¢ to anyone who is wanting a cleaner, healthier mouth!&lt;br /&gt;Looking back to the teeth picture I took ....my teeth are the same color... BUT I do not drink coffee, smoke cigarettes, drink soda and RARELY drink tea so I do not have the light stains that come from these products SO it might actually whitening teeth that endure these products...based on the reviews that I have read it does whiten...according to them.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It makes your teeth feel like you just left the dentist all day long! I have also seen that my teeth are incredibly white. I am a definite fan of this product.</li>
            <li> All I can say is AMAZING! I have always wanted whiter teeth. I even bought that light kit you see in the infomercials. Unlike many other teeth whitened, the crest HD system does not leave your teeth sensitive. And, in just one week I am already noticing results!</li>
            <li> We received a product package free from Crest and tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;After a week&#x27;s time my teeth were whiter colored and my mouth really was feeling more fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;The process which takes about twice as long as my previous brushing means is not at all a burden once you undergo the effort and the results speak for themself. While not cheap per se compared to plain toothpaste this is definitely superb and well worth the extra cost for cleaner brighter smiles. And in the end we all want to smile more often, dont we?</li>
            <li> It is effective, but I won&#x27;t recommend it if you are suffering from mouth ulcers.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to be selected by BzzAgent to try out a full size sample of Crest ProHealth HD toothpaste.  I love the toothpaste, it will be a bit pricey when I go back for more, but because I am not a huge fan of flossing it is totally worth it!  My mouth feels very clean and I feel as though I wake up with a cleaner mouth.  I didn&#x27;t notice a huge whitening transformation, but I do not drink coffee so my teeth were fairly white to start.  Also I didn&#x27;t take a before picture so there may be more of a change, but I just didn&#x27;t notice since it was gradual.  I also received permission from my dentist to use it on my son who is under 12.  We use it with him every other day.  He gets major plaque build up between dentist appointments, we started this regime prior to the last visit and it really helped to reduce it.  We are hoping now that his teeth are clean again that using it will keep the build up to a minimum.  So far so good!</li>
            <li> Love the Crest HD. I saw results in just a couple of days.  There&#x27;s plenty to use for later when necessary</li>
            <li> Thank you Crest! I was able to try this product for free, and I am forever grateful!I love this toothpaste. It&#x27;s so easy to use. The two steps, at first I thought would be a pain, but super easy! After the first step, my teeth felt a little weird, but once I did the second step, it was a world of a difference. My teeth felt polished, I could feel how clean they were. I have definitely noticed a difference in the whiteness of my teeth. I always thought tooth whitening would make my teeth extra sensitive, so I never did it, but this doesn&#x27;t bother my teeth at all!! It makes them feel extra clean and polished. My husband remarked that my teeth were looking whiter. It&#x27;s such a simple system! I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I tried using Crest Pro-Health HD after receiving a free trial from Crest through Bzz Agent. I used it faithfully for over 6 days and I did not notice a significant difference in the whiteness of my teeth. I was afraid that the 2 steps would take longer than I wanted, but that wasn&#x27;t the case. It was easy to use and my mouth did feel very clean afterwards. I&#x27;m not sure if I noticed it feeling cleaner than after using my usual toothpaste though.  My biggest problem with Crest Pro-Health HD was that both Step 1 and 2 made my mouth feel very dry while I was brushing and that was unpleasant. Also Step 2 had a strange taste to it that I didn&#x27;t enjoy. I stopped using it shortly thereafter and went back to my regular toothpaste. Also I&#x27;m not sure why Step 1 has more in the tube that Step 2. I am afraid that I will run out of Step 2 before I finish Step 1. I give it 3 stars because it did clean my teeth well, but I can&#x27;t get past the dry sensation and the taste of Step 2.  I&#x27;ve never tried any other whitening techniques so I don&#x27;t really know how well this compares.</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two Step Toothpaste for free through BzzAgent, and I loved the idea of it.  It was easy to use, fast and steps were clearly marked.  It only took a minute with each paste, then rinse and spit like any other toothpaste.  There were no strips or mouthpieces.  My teeth felt extremely clean and smooth after using it.  The taste wasn&#x27;t bad, with only a minor sting like that of mouthwash.  My problem us that I have sensitive gums and this product is not really designed for people with sensitivities.  It even states on the box that white spots may appear on your gums as the product is working.  I found that it made my gums even more sensitive so I discontinued use.  But if you do not have sensitive gums or gum recession, then I recommend trying this.  It is one of the fastest, easiest ways I have tried to whiten teeth.  Had I not had an issue with the sensitivity, I would have continued using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro Health® HD™ Toothpaste for the past two weeks.  I am so happy with the results!  My teeth are whiter, they feel healthier and my morning breath is gone.  I am thrilled with the cost and the results that I have gotten using Crest Pro Health® HD™ Toothpaste! I received a sample of this Crest Pro Health® HD™ as part of a promotion from the brand.  I plan to buy it in the future on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a person that loves going to the dentist to get my teeth cleaned.  I just love the feeling of super, deep cleaned teeth.  I had the opportunity to try this product free and I was so excited to do so.  The two step system is very easy and fast--just 2 minutes of brushing and your teeth have that just-from-the-dentist super clean feeling.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, and my teeth look and feel better!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste actually works as advertised! The first bottle cleans your teeth with a grainy textured material. The second bottle freshens and whitens! I tried out this Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste that I got through BzzAgent and can see my teeth are whiter after two weeks! My teeth feel amazingly clean. The process takes no longer than normal tooth brushing. I highly recommend this product by Crest!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is great! The cleanest my teeth have been in a long time! I am very picky when it comes to toothpaste. I thought the two step process would be a hassle but it was easy and the two minutes actually flew by. I have an electric toothbrush with a timer mounted on my bathroom mirror which made the process easier as well. So there are two steps to this toothpaste:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1- The fluoride paste. I&#x27;m not gonna lie, it feels weird at first. It feels kinda rough or grainy on your teeth and gums but don&#x27;t worry the next step will polish it away. The taste is minty but not overwhelming. After a minute, don&#x27;t rinse with water. Just spit the toothpaste out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2- The whitening gel. This step whitens and smooths and polishes your pearly whites! After a minute, you rinse and spit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After both steps it feels like you just went to the dentist, it&#x27;s that clean! I am so fortunate I was able to try this for free thanks to Crest!! I am now a ProHealth HD customer for life!</li>
            <li> I received product free as a BZZ Agent #sponsored, I&#x27;ve tried products for healthy teeth and whitening separately and have not stuck with any of them mainly because they didn&#x27;t work as expected. I&#x27;m pleased to say that the two step Crest Pro Health HD is simple, effective,and delivers fresh breath that last for days, whiter teeth without sensitivity or grayling my teeth. My husband swiped it an loves it too! My teen son, we&#x27;ll let just say morning breath is a lot more tolerable and not an issue after a few days of continued use. I don&#x27;t have to worry about my coffee or favorite garlicky foods lingering on my breathe either it&#x27;s is a great new morning routine and I am ordering more for me and my family at my expense right away. Coupons here on Amazon and coupons.com it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from Crest for being a Bzz Agent, and I was eager to try this two-step system. Crest has always been a leader in toothpaste and mouth care, and this new addition is an example why. The two tubes work separately yet together to create a dynamite smile. One tube removes plaque and cleans your teeth, and the other tube polishes and whitens. My mouth felt clean all day...and still feels clean every day. The system seems a bit pricey, but a little dab of each does the job. And the results are so worth it. Thanks Crest HD for my new smile!</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health HD a Rookie in the whitening arena.  I received a full sized product as part of te BZZ Agent campaign going on right now.&lt;br /&gt;I was eager to try tis product solely because of the reputation of the Crest brand and was looking forward to great results.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the second I put the first step in my mouth, I knew it was over.  Gritty and flavorless... ok, they want to scrub the tartar and stains away. There is another step that will freshen things up.  No!  After one minute, you do not rinse.  simply spit out step one and move onto step two.&lt;br /&gt;At this point, my mouth feels awful; dry and puckered.. strange for toothpaste.  I moved onto step two.. this is the whitening part.  It does nothing to freshen your mouth after the first step or even as a good tooth brushing would. It did not even hydrate my poor puckered mouth. My teeth did feel polished.  Most likely fro the first step grit.&lt;br /&gt;I was going to continue a few more days, until I was warned by a dental hygienist that the active ingredient in step 2 could actually stain my teeth!  What is the point?&lt;br /&gt;That was it.  The entire kit was tossed in the trash.  I would have done the same if I had paid full price for it.  I have used other over the counter whitening systems with much better results.  I would not recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I have always been self conscious about my smile.  I&#x27;ve used my fare share of toothpastes from various brands.  Most recently, I was using Crest 3D but stopped after my dental hygienist commented on the plastic beads in gums at my last appointment.  Several of my friends have tried this toothpaste with great results.  I had tried the As a BzzAgent, I was excited to receive this product for a free trial.  I noticed the feeling of cleaner teeth after the first brushing.  The taste took me a few brushing to get used to but I hardly notice it now.  After nearly a week of use, my years of abuse (tea) appear to be disappearing.  Best of all, no plastic beads! I can&#x27;t see myself using any other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This is a two-step process, and the two tubes are clearly labeled and are easy to use.  You use each step for two minutes and don&#x27;t rinse between steps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1, the cleaner:&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;I like the taste, scent, consistency, and mouth feel.&lt;br /&gt;The OK:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how different it is from other gel toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2, the whitener:&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;The whitening gel is thick enough to stay on the toothbrush and is easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;The not so good:&lt;br /&gt;My gums where I use the product in step 2, which is the front area of my top and bottom teeth, are very sensitive and uncomfortably tingly for about a half hour after I finish the process.  At that point they are still sensitive, but it starts to subside.&lt;br /&gt;It is not a strong burning feeling, but definitely not comfortable.  After about an hour the discomfort has subsided, but the gum area around the teeth is white for about another hour.&lt;br /&gt;I realize that whitening agents often cause tingling and discomfort.  My gums are generally sensitive, and this issue may not happen to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;If not for the discomfort from the whitening gel, I would have rated this product at 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very good:&lt;br /&gt;After the hour of discomfort has passed, my mouth feels clean and refreshed.  The best part is that my teeth are noticeably less dingy and less beige.  I actually noticed a slight difference in the look of my teeth after just two days. My teeth are not really yellow anyway, but they are certainly brighter and have a better hue after using this product for a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, the brushing with each step for two minutes twice daily seems to be an appropriate time for good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for seven days in a row.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it with both a manual toothbrush and an ultrasonic  model.&lt;br /&gt;I do not use an oral irrigator, mouthwash, or eat / drink for at least an hour after using the product.  This is just for my testing period.&lt;br /&gt;When my testing is complete, I plan to continue to use this product, providing my gum sensitivity does not worsen.&lt;br /&gt;I will most likely use step 1 twice daily, and use step 2 just once, to assure my gums are not overly irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:&lt;br /&gt;I am a BzzAgent and received the product at no charge.  I am not obligated to give a positive review, and my evaluation is honest and is based on my own personal experience.ng period.&lt;br /&gt;When my testing is complete, I plan to continue to use this product, providing my gum sensitivity does not worsen.&lt;br /&gt;I will most likely use step 1 twice daily, and use step 2 just once, to assure my gums are not overly irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:&lt;br /&gt;I am a BzzAgent and received the product at no charge.

            <li> I received a sample of the Crest Pro-Health HD system from BzzAgent and was excited to try it out.  I&#x27;m always looking for healthy ways to achieve a whiter smile, and this seemed like it might work.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a two-step system, with a paste (step 1) and a polish (step 2).  It&#x27;s a little less convenient than one tube, but no big deal.  It actually helped me ensure that I brushed for the full two minutes!&lt;br /&gt;I did notice a slightly whiter smile after one week, and continued to use it into a second week.  Then I began to notice some tooth sensitivity that I had not experienced before.  I felt like the system was pretty abrasive on my teeth, so I switched back to my regular toothpaste for a few days, and the sensitivity cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;I would use this for a &#x27;refresher&#x27; for my smile, but long term, I think it may be too harsh for my teeth.</li>
            <li> Overall, I like this whitening toothpaste.  Pros include:  Great price, great results, easy routine and the whole process is much more comfortable than whitening strips.  The only con is that I don&#x27;t find the toothpaste as refreshing as my regular product.  It&#x27;s fine, and my mouth was definitely clean, but the whitening is the stand out feature here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given the opportunity to try this for free from Crest Pro Health HD through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I love how clean my teeth feel after brushing with Crest Pro-Health HD, but I really haven&#x27;t seen any whitening after a week of use.  It is also kind of a pain having to use two separate steps without rinsing in between.  I might continue using this product based on how clean my teeth feel but would like it better if there was only one step, or if it whitened better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure, I got this product free from Crest, via the Bzz marketing company, and to continue receiving products I need to submit reviews.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is AMAZING!!!! When I floss after using it I get NOTHING. I just had my dental cleaning tonight and the hygienist was shocked by how clean my teeth were - he said it was the easiest cleaning he&#x27;s ever done and I was out in 15 minutes! I don&#x27;t love having to use two different steps in the brushing process but for such great results it&#x27;s worth the extra step! I was able to try this free with BzzAgent but will gladly pay to keep using it in the future!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure about adding another step to my toothpaste routine, but it is really easy to adjust to. After step 1, you can spit (not rinse) then add step 2 and keep brushing. The first step is like a normal frothy toothpaste and the second step is a whitening gel used as a toothpaste. I like the separation of the tooth care and whitening; it feels like it is more specialized. BzzAgent sent me the Crest Pro Health HD set to try for free.</li>
            <li> I am switching my toothpaste to Crest Pro-Health HD.  I received this toothpaste through BzzAgent and I love it!  My teeth feel cleaner and they are definitely whiter.  It is also much easier to use than I imagined.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Crest Pro-Health HD system on and off for well over a month now.  I say on and off because I have pretty sensitive teeth and I find that when I use this consistently, it does aggravate my sensitivities.  However, if I only use it a few times a week, I&#x27;m okay.  It&#x27;s too bad that I can&#x27;t use it every day because I really do like how it works and how super clean and smooth it makes my teeth.  It also leaves my mouth and breath very fresh and pleasant.  The two step process is easy to do and doesn&#x27;t end up taking any longer than my normal routine, so that&#x27;s nice.  Overall, I think this is a great product, but would caution those with sensitive teeth since they might not be able to use and enjoy it as much as others.  Crest provided this kit to me to try for free.</li>
            <li> I would like to provide my review of the Crest Pro Health HD teeth whitening system. I should start by saying that I have been a Crest Pro Health user for quite some time now. And, over the years, I have used two different Crest teeth whitening strips. And, while I have always used Crest and been satisfied with their products, I was not a big fan of the whitening strips. I personally don&#x27;t find them to be convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After receiving a sample of this product as part of a promotion, I captured two images of the packaging - one of the kit itself and one of the two tubes. Why two tubes? There are two steps to this whitening process. Step One is a cleaning process with stannous fluoride for gingivitis reduction. The substance looks a lot like a normal toothpaste. It is blue in color and is a bit thicker than my standard toothpaste. Step Two is the whitener, which is a clear substance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions indicate you should use Step One for one minute, then rinse your brush BUT not your mouth, then use Step Two for one minute. This surprised me a bit because I brush longer than two minutes. So, I found myself brushing with Step One a bit longer than directed, maybe an extra minute.  Because the taste of Step One was pleasant, I did not feel rushed or anxious to get to Step Two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applying Step Two to the brush, I learned to use caution when squeezing from the tube because the substance comes out from the tube much quicker and easier than with Step One. I found Step Two to taste very much like the same substance used with the Crest whitening strips. Because I had cleaned my teeth already, I used a light brushing motion with Step Two, gently applying the whitener to my teeth. After one minute of brushing, I would rinse my mouth and brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest claims to give you a 6x healthier mouth and 6x brighter smile after using the system for one week. I did use the product for a solid week and probably all but one day. I don&#x27;t think I had a 6x whiter smile, but there is no question my smile was/is a few shades whiter. I absolutely feel like my mouth is healthier with this toothpaste. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d feel that way if I only used the one minute of brushing as directed by Crest, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon sells this product for nearly $28, which is less than a Crest white strips pack. Plus, you&#x27;re getting the toothpaste here as well. I think this is a fairly-priced product that gets the job done. And, when you are talking about personal appearance and hygiene, the Pro Health HD from Crest has proven to be a reliable product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my wife try the whitener for two days. Her smile is already perfect, so she doesn&#x27;t need much help. Her only feedback was that she found Step One to be more dry or gritty than her toothpaste.a 6x whiter smile, but there is no question my smile was/is a few shades whiter. I absolutely feel like my mouth is healthier with this toothpaste. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d feel that way if I only used the one minute of brushing as directed by Crest, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon sells this product for nearly $28, which is less than a Crest white strips pack.

Her smile is already perfect, so she doesn&#x27;t need much help. Her only feedback was that she found Step One to be more dry or gritty than her toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I received the Crest Pro Health HD for free from BzzAgent. Even though it is a 2-step process it really takes no longer than using regular toothpaste. The first step removes plaque and has the flavor of a normal toothpaste. The second step is to polish and whiten your teeth. I did not give this product 5 stars because of the flavor of the second step. The hydrogen peroxide flavor it too overpowering for me. My teeth feel clean for the whole day!</li>
            <li> After receiving this product as a sample for free from Crest, I was excited to see if it really was worth buying in the future.  The taste wasn&#x27;t to bad and the whitening effects were pretty good.  The taste it left in my mouth the next morning was not.  Not sure if I will be purchasing this in the future.</li>
            <li> I recieved this as a free trial for a survey that I was partiipating in and I love this product so much more than I ever imagined that I would. I noticed results in just two days and everyday my smile is brighter and whiter. I plan on using this from hear on out beause I have yet to find any toothpaste that even comes close to being as amazing as Crest Pro Health [HD]</li>
            <li> I received this for free from BzzAgent to test out. I am always willing to try new things to get my teeth whiter.  The two step process did not extend my tooth brushing time anymore than usual, I applied the whitening gel without rinsing, and I can honestly say I am thrilled with the results after only a few days.</li>
            <li> I tried a package of Crest Pro-Health HD for free from Crest. Here&#x27;s what I thought:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Must easier to brush your teeth for two minutes (1 minute per step) than annoying whitening strips or trays&lt;br /&gt;- Step 1 tastes good - minty fresh&lt;br /&gt;- Removed a lot of my slightly-yellow teeth (from coffee, soda, red wine, etc) stains&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Somewhat expensive (but all whitening products are)&lt;br /&gt;- Gave me some tooth sensitivity (this happens to me with every whitening product I&#x27;ve tried, so I think it comes with the territory)&lt;br /&gt;- Not a &#x27;miracle worker&#x27; - won&#x27;t make your teeth Hollywood white or professionally white&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given all of these pros &amp; cons, I give it 4 stars because Crest Pro-Health HD works as well as other products in its class but has the extra benefit of not being hard to use.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is really, really nice. I received a full size product to test and review as part of a campaign. Previously, I used Colgate Total and was pretty happy with it. I&#x27;ve been using Crest HD religiously morning and night for about 6 weeks. You really do notice a difference within the first use. The more impressive part is that you continue noticing that difference throughout the usage. The main difference for me is how my teeth feel. They feel like I just came from a dentist cleaning....you know, that slick, smooth feeling you get when you run your tongue over your teeth. That is a constant now. And my mouth still feels fresh when I wake up in the morning. Not super fresh, but no morning breath...which is cray cray.&lt;br /&gt;So the campaign is ending today and I didn&#x27;t think there was much of a difference in the whiteness of my teeth, but I took a pic and compared it to a pic I took 6 weeks ago. Ummm...wow. There is a noticeable difference! For some reason I didn&#x27;t notice it until I saw the before and after.&lt;br /&gt;The two step process becomes such an afterthought after using it a few time. No big deal at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only part of this product that is a big deal is the price. Whoa. For some reason, I thought the retail price of this was $14...I was way off. $20+ for toothpaste is kinda crazy. These aren&#x27;t big tubes either. After 6 weeks, I&#x27;m almost through both tubes (annoyingly, I have a lot more left of step 2 than step 1).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to keep using this product going forward, but dang....the price is steep. I guess I&#x27;ll need to keep an eye out for sales!</li>
            <li> Received a full size sample of Crest Prohealth HD from the maker.  It was amazing.  My teeth were whiter and they felt like when you come out of the dentist office.  It is definitely a product worth purchasing.  I will be buying this in the future.  Thank you for choosing me to try out the product.</li>
            <li> i love crest pro health HD!  from the first time i used it, my mouth felt so clean and my teeth so smooth - like i just got a professional cleaning from my dentist.  the really cool part, too, is that when i awoke the next morning  my teeth still felt smooth , not the least bit fuzzy like how they can feel sometimes.  i also have sensitive teeth and usually use sensitive toothpaste, so i really wanted to give it a few weeks before i reviewed to see if i had any unpleasantness or return of sensitivity and after 3 weeks, i have found it works great and have had no issues.  being that the process is a 2 part brushing system, i was worried it might be kind of a pain, but it&#x27;s not at all - the hardest part about using this system is remembering not to wet the toothbrush before starting or inbetween steps 1 and 2 - after a few days, it wasn&#x27;t an issue at all.  one of the claims is less plaque (i have a dentist appt in 3 weeks, so i will update then on this aspect) and another is whiter teeth - i definitely have noticed a difference, but to really make sure, i asked my husband to use it, as well, so i could see HIS teeth and yes, it does whiten.  i can only expect that with more prolonged use, more whitening will occur.  i really love this product and definitely recommend it!  just so you know, i received this product as a trial from the manufacturer, but have received no, nor will I receive any, compensation from them.  this is my honest and true opinion and i will be purchasing this product regularly</li>
            <li> I received Crest ProHealth HD as a promotion from Crest to test and review. This toothpaste is a 2 part system and is not just another teeth whitening gimmick. Since I started using it, I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on how white my teeth are. I didn&#x27;t notice how white my teeth were getting, I only noticed how yellow everyone else&#x27;s teeth looked! I would recommend Crest ProHealth HD to everyone, the world deserves a brighter smile! The 2 part process includes clearly labeled tubes, you use step one for a solid minute, that cleans your teeth and strips stains while leaving your enamel intact, then step two whitens and polishes your teeth. I started getting compliments after using this for 3 days.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I periodically use Crest White Strips and this product goes hand in hand along with it great. I can really see the difference, no issues with sensitivity and no tale-tell sign of whiting along on the edges of my teeth. It&#x27;s a win-win!</li>
            <li> I tried Crest Pro-Health HD as part of a BzzAgent campaign and I have to say I really was impressed. It is a two-step cleaning process, which I didn&#x27;t mind if it worked as well as it does. You brush for one minute with the first step and then one minute with the next step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For me, I felt like it gave that fresh-from-the-dentist clean feeling, and that lasted each day. Also, each day after brushing the night before, I woke up with fresh breath! A definite bonus. :) Plus, my teeth are bright and white, which of course makes me feel good about myself. I felt like this product worked exactly as advertised and I can&#x27;t wait to go to the dentist to show it off! Fresh breath, white teeth, and that clean feeling all the time are all great things in toothpaste. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Thanks to the folks at BzzAgent, I&#x27;ve been able to try the new Crest Pro-Health HD for the last 6 weeks or so!  I have to start by saying that I was not expecting much out of this product.  Several years ago I tried a different Crest mouthwash that left a metallic aftertaste - and I&#x27;d been a &amp;#34;Crest hater&amp;#34; ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has been a pleasant surprise for me!  My teeth feel much cleaner, and I&#x27;ll probably continue to buy this toothpaste.  I took before and after pictures of my teeth, but unfortunately the whitening steps of this product didn&#x27;t do much to change the color of my teeth.  I never had a &amp;#34;wow those look brighter&amp;#34; moment either.  Maybe it&#x27;s the 4 cups of coffee a day...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way I&#x27;m very happy with the product, and the whitening part may be a &amp;#34;your mileage will vary&amp;#34; type of deal depending on the type of stains you&#x27;re trying to whiten, and your individual body chemistry.  I would absolutely recommend this toothpaste to a friend just for the excellent cleaning ability, and chance that it&#x27;ll whiten better for them than it did for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically fluoride paste followed by peroxide paste. It doesn&#x27;t work very well. My Listerine Whitening rinse is far superior (if I use it twice per day for one full minute before brushing).  $20 is a huge rip off.</li>
            <li> As a BzzAgent, I receieved Crest Pro-Health HD from Crest to try for free.  The two-step process is very simple - brush with the cleansing purifier for 1 minute (you may spit, but not rinse after this step) and then 1 minute with the whitening gel (you can rinse after this step).  After the very first use, I noticed a very clean, fresh from the dentist feel throughout my whole mouth.  After just a few days, I noticed my teeth were a bit whiter.&lt;br /&gt;After using the product 2 times per day for a few days, my gums became a bit irritated so I started using the Pro-Health HD only once per day and my usual toothpaste the other.  Over the last 3 or so weeks, I&#x27;ve tried to go back to twice per day, but it still seems to irritate my gums so I will stick with once per day to get that fresh from the dentist clean feeling and keep my teeth a bit whiter than without.  I haven&#x27;t had any comments from friends or family, but I have noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> I recently recieved a free trial product of Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two Step Toothpaste.  I was hesitant to try the new toothpaste as I have tooth sensitivity and had before this toothpaste found a toothpaste that worked really well with my sensitive teeth, made my mouth feel clean and gave me fresh breath.  It was really hard to find a toothpaste that I really liked.  I read the instructions on the box to make sure that I was using the toothpaste correctly and gave it a try.  I used the first step, white tube, made sure not to rinse and then finally finished with the second step.  My sensitive teeth were just fine.  I didn&#x27;t feel any sensitivity even more my smile looked brighter and my mouth tasted fresh.  The real test was waking up the next morning to see how my mouth felt and smelled.  It was great, I did not have morning breath and my mouth still felt great!  I went to the dentist recently and was told that my mouth looked great.  I will definitely use this toothpaste again.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive my BzzAgent sample kit of Crest ProHealth HD.  Have been using for a couple of weeks now, and my teeth feel nice and fresh, however I thought they would be whiter.  The product is very easy to use- just brush with the paste for a minute, spit (but don&#x27;t rinse!) and brush for another minute using the gel.  I like the minty taste and how it makes my teeth feel, but I honestly was expecting my teeth to be whiter after using it for this long.  White strips would definitely give better results if your only goal is whiter teeth, however if you just want a healthier-looking smile and fresh breath then this product is great.  I will continue to use it, and hope that over more time the whitening effects will improve.</li>
            <li> I received my kit free from Crest for being a BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;When i first received it, i was surprised on having two tubes, i couldn&#x27;t understand, why this couldn&#x27;t be one tube. After using it now for two weeks, i can safely say that it somewhat helps in keeping my teeth whiter. I had a cleaning before i started using it and therefore it was a bit hard to know if it was actually working, but it looks like it is kinda working. It leaves a good taste in the mouth also. I like this product and it could be my replacement toothpaste from now on. The best thing about it is that it forces me to brush my teeth for 2 minutes, because you use each tube for a minute.</li>
            <li> Was able to try this free thanks to Crest and BzzAgent and am VERY glad I did. I pretty much replaced my normal toothpaste with this (and I was using Crest Pro Health Whitening with Scope before!) In my opinion, the clean feeling I have after I brush with Crest Pro-Health HD is worth the extra cost compared to &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpaste. I used it this morning (~ 6:30am) and my teeth still have that clean smooth feel right now (~ 4:30pm). The first step does have a different feel and taste but the second step takes that all away. I highly recommend at least giving this a try, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Tried it for free and am I ever glad I had the opportunity! No hype here. You&#x27;ll see a difference in whiteness after just one use but really start noticing the difference after about 10 days of brushing 2X day. Your breath is fresher, teeth are whiter and brighter and you entire mouth feels clean all day.</li>
            <li> The most noticeable change will be during the first use. I was sent this exact kit by Crest through BzzAgent to review. My husband and I couldn&#x27;t believe how much whiter our teeth were after using it the first time. We looked at each other in amazement after seeing it in the mirror. While I&#x27;m sure the product still worked in whitening, it&#x27;s more of a maintenance thing after that since you won&#x27;t see such a big difference anymore compared to the first time. It does the job of a regular toothpaste in keeping your teeth fresh and clean but it also does an effective job in whitening it. This is the perfect alternative for me than to go get my teeth whitened at the dentist office. I have tried other teeth whitening products before and have never seen such fast and clear results like I do with this product. I certainly would buy it again and highly recommend it to others in giving it a try.</li>
            <li> I was eager to try Crest Pro-Health HD, as I was noticing my teeth were looking a bit yellow. I received a free trial thanks to Crest and BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;Ideally, we should all be brushing our teeth for 2 minutes anyway, but actually timing the two steps made me realize I&#x27;m not even close. If nothing else, I&#x27;m glad that Pro-Health HD made me realize this.&lt;br /&gt;Step one of the process feels very thick and gritty. I am always glad it is over. The second step tastes a lot like the Crest White strips. It is hard to spread evenly across all of my teeth. In between the two is a little awkward; you are to spit but not rinse as you &amp;#34;load&amp;#34; your toothbrush with Step 2.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that my teeth looked whiter within a week.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I had a dentist appointment right before I tried this product, so I can&#x27;t speak to how it helped with plaque.&lt;br /&gt;I am excited to finish out Pro-Health HD to really see results, but as of now, I would recommend this product because it makes my teeth feel very clean after I use it. I am more confident with my smile now as well. This is a good alternate if you don&#x27;t enjoy white strips!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste provides me with cleaner and whiter teeth without having to use the gross strips or visit my dentist. I noticed within a week or so of using this system that my teeth were whiter and they stayed cleaner longer after I used the toothpaste. It is pretty simple though it took some getting used to. Brush for 1 minute with Step 1, spit but don&#x27;t rinse, brush for 1 minute with Step 2, and then spit and rinse. I loved these detailed instructions so I knew I was using the products properly. And the timing is a breeze with my sonic are. The toothpaste has an ok flavor, not very minty (I hate mint) and step 2 really doesn&#x27;t have any flavor that I can tell. It is easy to use these products in the mornings when I wake up and in the evenings before I go to sleep and I will continute to use them and recommend them to my friends and family. I did receive a free sample but will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> Crest has come out with an even easier way to whiten teeth, clean teeth and remove bad odors from your mouth.  Gone are the days of painting your teeth and keeping your mouth open, so that the painted whitener will dry.  Gone are the days of placing strips over your teeth and leaving your mouth open before you fall asleep.  Crest Pro Health HD is the answer to clean your teeth, whitening your teeth and freshening your breath.  Just go to your local @Walgreens, CVS, @Walmart, @Target store and look in the dental aisle for Crest Pro Health box.  It will come with two tubes of paste.  If that sounds like an extra step, it is, but it is well worth the minute effort.  It takes less than two minutes of your time to brush with the first toothpaste, spit and then brush with the second paste.  In no time, Your teeth will look brighter, it will be cleaner and your breath will be fresh.  I love the way that my teeth look and feel.  Take the time to give back to yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;note: As a bzzagent, I was given this product to evaluate.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this on Amazon but I am using it now. Maybe it&#x27;s because there are two pastes so I brush twice as long but I am having great results with this product. My teeth are whiter and cleaner than they have been in a long time.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health HD has changed how I brush my teeth.  I like the quick and easy steps to also get my whitening in and I have noticed a major difference.  Whitening in the past was time consuming and caused sensitivities. My teeth feel fresh from the dentist clean and are several shades whiter.  Only four stars because I feel that the fresh breath feeling fades faster than regular toothpaste but I realize there are other solutions to counter that and cleaner/whiter teeth is the priority with this product.  I went on vacation and took a trail size regular Crest toothpaste with me a definitely noticed the difference the week I had off from Crest Pro-Health HD.  I plan to continue using for daily use.  I started using this product for free from a Crest trial.</li>
            <li> I have to start off by saying that i love the feeling of clean teeth and i am always changing up the toothpaste i buy to see if i can find something better and better. I am IN LOVE with this tooth paste and will never go back. I cant get over how clean my mouth feels. Its comparable to going to the dentist and having a fresh mouth after cleaning. Also i feel like the level of plaque that i have in my mouth has decresed. I am beyone happy with this product. i did receive this product to try for free, but the reviews that i am sharing are all my own. Super Super Happy! Thank you Crest!</li>
            <li> This product works really well.  I received a free sample from Crest, and have been surprised at how well Crest Pro-Health HD works.  The two steps are not a big deal at all.  The toothpaste started to make my teeth noticably whiter after just a few days. But the best part is that after just a week or so, my once very sensitive teeth were not bothering me at all!</li>
            <li> I am usually someone who just buys whatever toothpaste is on sale, but when I received and offer to try a free sample of this one, my wife convinced me to try it.  I was a little skeptical that the 2 step system would be complicated, but it was actually very simple- one minute with step one, one minute with step two.  Step one felt like a typical toothpaste, but it did feel like it was cleaning.  Step two was slicker and smoother.  Both tasted fine, and went well together.  I did actually have a dentist appointment about a week after I started this regimen, and the dentist asked what I was using, so something must have been noticeable.  I am not sure whether it whitened any more than other whiteners, since it seems like most toothpaste nowadays does that, but my teeth felt clean and smooth, and my wife likes how I taste, so a winner in my book.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive gums and this toothpaste did not irriateate my gums. Most whitening toothpasts will do that. I like the cleansing feel that you get after step one followed by the whitening in step 2. I would recommend this for anyone with sensitive gums looking for a whitening toothpaste. I did receive a free sample for Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> The Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste System is so easy to use and very effective!!  It only takes two minutes each morning and night for a clean and bright smile!  I begin brushing for one minute with the purifying cleanser.  Then, I add the Perfecting Gel to my toothbrush and brush for one minute longer.  After I rinse, my teeth feel so smooth and clean.  My smile is so bright and white from the Crest Pro-Health HD.  I love the results and how easy it is to get and maintain a nice, clean smile!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Crest Pro Health HD from BzzAgent/Crest.  I must admit that I was a little skeptical at first as I have tried many whitening toothpaste, strips, mouthwashes, etc. I was excited to try this product!&lt;br /&gt;Crest Pro Health HD comes in a 2-tube kit. I used the Crest HD for two minutes and twice daily. Used Step 1 for one minute (did not rinse), followed immediately by Step 2 for an additional minute.&lt;br /&gt;Step 1 tastes fresh and is similar to a regular toothpaste. Step 2 is a clear gel and tastes a little like peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;I DID see a difference in the color of my teeth after only a few brushing. They were certainly whiter! This is great to use if you are sensitive to the whitening strips (like I am). I also like it because it is very gentle on my gums. I went in for my 6-month teeth cleaning and my Dental Hygienist EVEN noticed that my teeth were whiter.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it comes in 2 tubes....it is kind of awkward to open the second tube while your brushing....wish they could some how combine them together into one tube!&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing this product in the future and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I could not be happier in just a few days i noticed a difference in my teeth. The two step system cannot be any easier.Step 1 Purifying Cleanser helps strip away plaque, Step 2 Perfecting Gel polishes and whitens teeth. My mouth feels cleaner, i do not wake up with the usual morning breath. I can smile with confidence now! Very satisfied will recommend to family and friends.  #Sponsored #GotItFree trying it free thanks to Crest and #BzzAgent</li>
            <li> I love this product. I received it as a promotion and was able to try it for the past month. It provides a fresh, clean feeling every time and it whitens teeth. You have to be committed to the two steps in order to see results. I use a Sonicare toothbrush and have it on the 1 minute setting so that I know when it beeps, it&#x27;s time to apply the second tube. I always feel confident after brushing with this product - fresher breath, and whiter teeth. I know this product is a bit more costly, but it&#x27;s worth it for the results you get!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a loyal Aquafresh user, but when BuzzAgent gave me the change to try this out as part of a promotional campaign, I was curious.  What makes this product unique, as the name says, is that it is a two-step process designed to get teeth both cleaner (by stripping away plaque) and whiter (by polishing teeth).  So far based on my experience it does seem to, in fact, do both (although I have yet to have a dental cleaning so whether my dentist says anything will be the true test for me).  At first I will admit I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the two step process since I really, really don&#x27;t enjoy brushing my teeth.  At first it did take some time to get used to, but after a couple of weeks it felt like second nature.  For me the reason to keep doing it was how my teeth look and feel.  I do agree with previous reviewers that I&#x27;m not sure this whitens dramatically better than other whitening toothpastes.  I&#x27;ve found that if I want really, really white teeth nothing beats the system I got from my dentist (mouthpiece + whitening solution).  However, I still like to use a whitening toothpaste for maintenance when I&#x27;m not actively whitening my teeth with the dentist&#x27;s system and this is perfect for that.  What I&#x27;ve enjoyed the most is how clean my teeth feel.  It&#x27;s hard to describe, but when I run tongue over them they feel really smooth and clean, almost like when I&#x27;ve just had them cleaned at the dentist.  I also haven&#x27;t found the taste of these products to be off-putting, which is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve really liked these.  As mentioned the true test will come when I have my next appointment but for now I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro Health HD Toothpaste for one month now and the difference it has made in the brightness of my teeth is nothing short of remarkable! I began using Crest Pro Health HD right after my last teeth cleaning at my dentist so I started with a clean-slate.  Using this amazing toothpaste has prolonged the after-the-dentist clean look to my teeth and has even brightened my test since that last polish by my hygienist! I am a daily coffee and tea drinker so my teeth usually don&#x27;t remain bright and shiny too long after a visit to the dentist.  This time, however, since using Crest Pro Health HD, my teeth look as though they have been whitened professionally at the dentist&#x27;s office! Many people have commented on the brightness and whiteness of my teeth over the past month so I know the product is working when friends notice the difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the improved whiteness of my test, Crest Pro Health HD has made a tremendous difference in the way my teeth feel. This system comes with two different tubes of toothpaste. The first tube or step one does an amazing job of removing that awful fuzzy feeling that my teeth develops over night and during the day between brushing. It seems to do the job because of the somewhat gritty-nature of the paste. The second tube or step two polishes my teeth and leaves them feeling smooth and squeaky clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about one month since I began using Crest Pro Health HD and I have about half of both tubes still left to use which means it seems to last a long time and is worth the reasonable price to pay. I am a believer in this teeth-whitening system because it&#x27;s easy to use - replacing my regular toothpaste with Crest Pro Health HD has been an easy switch - once that I am thankful that I have made. Thanks to Crest for inviting me to try this product for free!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste works really well for me and my husband. I received it from Crest/BzzAgent to try and provide my honest feedback and my husband decided he wanted to try it too. After a few weeks of using both steps twice per day, we have both noticed that our teeth are a shade or two whiter, which is great! My favorite thing about this toothpaste is how clean my teeth feel after. I love that after the dentist clean feeling and this toothpaste is the closest I&#x27;ve ever got to that at home. I would definitely recommend this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Over the past few weeks, I was given the opportunity to try Crest Pro Health HD for free thanks to Crest. I&#x27;ll admit that I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how to feel about it at first. The past few times I tried Crest products, they had terrible flavors (either too minty that my mouth burned, or too weak so that it tasted like baking soda). Plus, two steps? I&#x27;m a busy, working parent; there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d have time for that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I noticed right from the first time brushing that the flavor was great, and it left my mouth feeling really clean for quite a long time afterward. The two steps surprisingly took about the same time as normal brushing, so that wasn&#x27;t a big deal either, like I had anticipated. My biggest challenge with the two steps at first was making sure I didn&#x27;t rinse in between, but even after 2 days or so, I got the hang of that too. And by the time I had been using it a full week, I started noticing that my teeth are, in fact, much whiter. My teeth normally get very sensitive with whitening products, but I haven&#x27;t had any sensitivity with using this toothpaste. Overall, I&#x27;ve been completely, pleasantly surprised by the effectiveness of this great toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, my biggest concern with this product is the price. It is fantastic, but for everyday people, it&#x27;s a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to like this as much as I do.  I received this as a free sample and,  due to the price,  probably wouldn&#x27;t have considered purchasing it. Now that I&#x27;ve been using it I probably would buy it again. My teeth are much whiter and feel very clean. Initially my gums were very sensitive after using it however since I lightened up on the pressure when brushing it&#x27;s been fine. I&#x27;ve used the product with both my Sonicare and with a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I got to try this product for free for my opinion. It is a good whitening toothpaste. The system is a two step system, the gel coat can be a bit thick and gummy. However, it does leave your mouth feeling clean. Overall, it is a nice whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free sample from Crest. I was really excited to try it! The package states that you will have &amp;#34;6X whiter teeth in one week&amp;#34;. Now that is pretty exciting! However upon further inspection, the fine print states &amp;#34;than other leading brands&amp;#34;. OK, so my expectations of getting 6 times whiter teeth in just a week went out the door immediately, but I was still hopeful they would be significantly whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first 7 days of using this product, my teeth sure were whiter. I wouldn&#x27;t say they were 2X whiter, but certainly whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has now been a month, and I&#x27;ve found that the routine of simply brushing for one extra minute with the second tube of paste was quite easy compared to the other methods of having to use a mouth tray, or strips. In fact it is no issue at all; Incredibly convenient! I&#x27;ve also found that what this product is great at is maintaining teeth that are already white. My wife would use the mouth trays, which would really do great at making her teeth white. It has been a month, and she hasn&#x27;t used a tray since, yet people are telling her how white her teeth are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears that this product is OK at whitening your teeth some, and perfect for maintaining already white teeth, at the expensive just one extra minute each time you brush.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt, my mouth feels clean and fresh! From the first time I used it, I immediately felt a difference. This mouth does not have a trace of plaque. There is that old saying, &amp;#34;The tingling means that it is working,&amp;#34; and you can tell that this toothpaste is working. When applying Stage 1, the instructions note to brush for 1 minute and not to rinse. Rinsing is tempting, as the toothpaste is very gritty and sticks to your teeth. Stage 2 is the whitening gel that must also be brushed for 1 minute. I was happy that the gel did not have an overtly chemical taste. I give this product points for very easy instructions and not a long time commitment to use. I used this duo twice a day for 7 days. The box claims that I will have 6x whiter teeth in 1 week. I barely notice a difference. But, my teeth feel remarkably smooth and clean. My only concern for this product is that I feel the toothpaste is very harsh. The gum line on one of my teeth seems to have started to recede ever so slightly which is something I will need to speak to my dentist about. The product really gets your mouth clean, however, I am skeptical if the aggressive cleaning power is realistic for every day use. After a 7 day trial, I now rotate between my regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I received this through BzzAgent. All opinions are my own. I though the product was decent for what it claims to do. I had been using a standard whitening toothpaste that didn&#x27;t seem to be doing much on it&#x27;s own, but I&#x27;m generally skeptical of whitening claims in general. Step 1 of this product really did leave my mouth feeling clean. I certainly felt that dry mouth feeling that others have mentioned, but it went away completely with Step 1. I alternate between a regular toothbrush and an electric, and I used less of the product with my electric toothbrush (about a pea sized amount). And, since I&#x27;m neurotic, I would brush for 2 minutes for each Step when using the electric. I didn&#x27;t mind not being able to rinse my mouth out between steps, but it did bother me that I would brush my tongue after Step 1, and then have to rinse my toothbrush before Step 2 (which I feel like would defeat the purpose of not rinsing - it wiped out most of the residue I assume you want on your teeth before the whitening step). Step 2 was your average whitener. It didn&#x27;t bother my gums or teeth but would on occasion tingle or have a slight burn. My teeth felt sparkling clean after both of these steps, but I was in the bathroom for about 10 minutes when all was said and done :) I think the price is slightly high for a toothpaste, especially if you just buy a standard one with baking soda. I liked that it did not seem abrasive to my teeth, but I don&#x27;t know that it really does what it claims. I supposed I may buy it again to use in between real whitening treatments as a way to keep my teeth bright, but I dont think it will MAKE your teeth white on its own. A good product, and one I will buy again, but I doubt it will replace my standard one...</li>
            <li> So the add claims this is &amp;#34;Crest&#x27;s biggest breakthrough in toothpaste since fluoride..&amp;#34; Really?? (sarcasm intended!!!). I have to say that I would never have thought any toothpaste product out there would be that different than the others (at least among the national, reputable brands). So needless to say, I was very skeptical when receiving this product as a free trial through BzzAgent. Anyway, as other reviewers have stated, the feeling after using this product is VERY similar to the feeling after visiting the dentist for your regular cleanings. Produces a very smooth slick finish and it just feels like your teeth are much cleaner than ever. The only reason for my 4 star rating versus a 5 is the claim of whiter teeth by use of the product. I have to say, I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the whiteness of my teeth, but the clean feeling will keep me using this product. I have a Dentist cleaning scheduled in a month, so I&#x27;m really curious to see how that goes. Hopefully this product truly is doing what it feels like it&#x27;s doing and eliminating more plaque than my previous paste. I&#x27;ve always preferred Crest products, and now this will be my new toothpaste of choice! I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by this Pretty Amazing Stuff.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been a &amp;#34;Crest Kid&amp;#34; my whole life but had never really strayed beyond just their typical toothpastes as I&#x27;ve always been happy with them - mostly the whitening and baking soda &amp; peroxide.  However, Crest presented me with the opportunity to try Crest Pro-Health HD I was excited to add something new to my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest Pro-Health HD is a two part system.  First you brush for a minute with the purifying cleanser and, without rinsing, follow that with the second step which is the perfecting gel.  Wow!  I was really impressed and could tell a big difference the first time I used it!  The purifying cleanser has kind of a foamy feel in your mouth.  I can&#x27;t really describe the taste; it&#x27;s not at all minty but is sort of fresh.  After a few seconds, it starts to feel almost like it&#x27;s literally scrubbing your teeth.  The feeling is a little gritty though there is no actual grit.  It&#x27;s kind of strange, but nice.  Once you&#x27;re done with that you&#x27;ll use the perfecting gel which clearly is peroxide based as you can feel it bubbling in your mouth.  There were many places on my gums (I&#x27;m embarrassed to say) where it bubbled up white as peroxide does on an infected wound.  Yuck but I knew it was doing what it needed to do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results were fantastic!  My teeth were incredibly shiny - like beauty queen with Vaseline on her teeth shiny!  After continued use, I could definitely tell a difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  I didn&#x27;t see the 6X whiter results Crest claims you may see, but my teeth were pretty white to start with;  I did see a noticeable change so I was pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a couple of things I was not crazy about which were pretty minor.  The first is that there is no minty taste which I am used to with toothpaste so it was a bit strange not having minty breath but my breath and mouth was definitely fresh;  just not minty.  Secondly, and this one is kind of random, as mentioned, you follow the first step immediately with the second step with no rinsing in between.  The first step came in a tube with a flip off cap.  The second step, however, came in a tube with a screw off lid.  So, I&#x27;m standing there with toothpaste foaming all over my mouth and hands and toothbrush trying to screw off the second cap.  I  know it sounds stupid, but it really was kind of an inconvenience.  I&#x27;m sure there is some reason, but it would be nice if the second step came with a flip top lid too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am extremely happy with this product and will likely continue to use it.  I don&#x27;t have a check up for a few months, still but I&#x27;m looking forward to hearing if my dentist can tell a difference.the second step with no rinsing in between.

            <li> I started using this toothpaste thanks to a free sample from crest. I figured it sounded easy enough and since it requires brushing, it wasn&#x27;t anything extra I had to add to my routine.  I also liked not having to bother with the strips, remembering which way they go on and having to throw them away because they get stuck and wadded up.  No waste here!!&lt;br /&gt;I also found that my teeth did not get sensitive like they do with other whiteners.  I usually have to stop using after a time because they make my teeth way too sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;The bonus- all of my teeth got whiter. I took pics but I&#x27;m horrible at taking of myself and they didn&#x27;t turn out great. But I assure you, all my teeth got whiter - unlike the strips that only hit certain teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Also enjoyed the taste. It&#x27;s not overly minty. Still leaves your breath fresh with no extra steps in your everyday routine.  Highly recommend.  I&#x27;ll continue to buy even after my sample runs out.</li>
            <li> You will notice a difference quickly with this Two Step Toothpaste. You have to brush you teeth twice but each step does wonders. Toothpaste is very high quality and leaves your mouth feeling fresh. Whitening paste works very well and you can quickly see a difference. I will continue to use this duo and love the why it has changed the health of my teeth! Highly recommend! (received this product as a promotion from the brand)</li>
            <li> I drink tea everyday, so my teeth is a little yellowish and I was pretty excited when I got the package. Anything to whiten my teeth at such a cheap price (compared to going to dentist) is always good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package comes with two tubes. The first tube is like a typical toothpaste. After brushing your teeth with the first paste for one minute, you spit it out (DO NOT RINSE per instruction) and brush with the second toothpaste. The second toothpaste was a little uncomfortable to me in the beginning. Maybe because my gum was a little sensitive. However, after using it a few times,  things get back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks and I see that my teeth is a little whiter but it&#x27;s nothing too drastic. My husband doesn&#x27;t even see the difference. :( But for the cost, I would think it&#x27;s worth it but don&#x27;t put your hope too high..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer. I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> I received the Crest Pro Health HD system to sample from @Crest through @BzzAgent.  I loved the idea that I could potentially have whiter teeth without the cost of going to a dentist.  I used the product for three days, twice a day and then took a couple of days off from using it.  My teeth, gums and mouth felt so clean after using the product but my gums had become sore and sensitive and even burned somewhat.  After taking a couple of days off, I started using the product again and have been using it twice a day since.  My gums no longer feel sensitive and my entire mouth feels clean.  I have noticed a difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  The change has not been earth shattering, and I wasn’t expecting it to be, but I am pleased with the improvement I have seen in the color of the teeth so far.  I was not sure I would like the two step process, and it took me a couple of times after step one, not to rinse.  The taste is minty and clean.  I would recommend this product for use by adults only.</li>
            <li> I am trying Crest HD for free thanks to Crest and I have been using it for several weeks. I am so impressed with how much whiter my teeth are.  It works much better than other whitening products I have tried and is very easy to use!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about having to use two steps to brush my teeth.  I am not sorry I tried this product.  It does not take any longer to brush your teeth, but you get superior whitening results.  On top of that you get a fresh, clean mouth and a healthy mouth that lasts for hours and hours! Hello fluoride! Bye bye plaque! Bye bye dingy teeth. Hello confident white smile!!  FYI: I got to try this free thanks to Crest, but I am reviewing it honestly.</li>
            <li> What I really like about this product is that it gets ALL of your teeth. I have used strips in the past, but they only get the front of your front teeth. With the paste and gel I feel like I am getting my entire mouth clean. The product did take some getting used to. It kind of irritated/burned my mouth the first few days, but that did go away. It has also made my teeth a bit sensitive. All in all, I feel like it is making a difference.  It is very easy to use, just two minutes twice a day.  While my teeth are not white/white, they are whiter/brighter than before. I have to brush my teeth anyway, so why not use something that helps get them whiter. I feel more confident to smile and show off my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I received Crest Pro-Health HD for free as a trail from BzzAgent. Receiving this product for free has not influenced my review in anyway and I was not encouraged to write a specific review.</li>
            <li> First, my initial use of Crest HD was provided by Crest.&lt;br /&gt;I will not bore you with going into how to use it. Follow the directions provided.&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Nice taste, although I prefer a more &amp;#34;Minty Taste&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the clean feeling of your teeth after using.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are definitely whiter.&lt;br /&gt;My recent dentist visit showed less plaque build up.&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Price! Although, since it appears it is improving my Dental Health, it may prove to be inexpensive!&lt;br /&gt;Second step.. This too may be a good thing, as it has me brushing longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I buy/ use it again? Yes!&lt;br /&gt;You can find it here on Amazon or at you local Wal-Mart, Target, etc.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste free from Crest and Bzzagent for testing purposes.  I love how clean my mouth feels after using this toothpaste.  It feels almost as clean as when I leave the dentist after my cleaning.  However, I wish the product allowed my mouth to feel more minty fresh.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is different than most in that it comes in two tubes. At first this was a little daunting, but it actually helped me to brush much longer than I usually do (I&#x27;m a slacker and never really brush for the full 2 minutes you are supposed to). The first toothpaste is super foamy, I liked the flavor of it and I felt it did a great job cleaning my mouth. The second tube is a polishing paste which kind of deflates the foam and polishes your teeth whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I really think it makes them 6x more brighter? No, probably not. I&#x27;m sure under a microscope maybe it does but it&#x27;s not that noticeable in my opinion, and I used it exactly as prescribed. I do have to say I feel like I have a cleaner healthier mouth though. I get canker sores on occasion and while using this toothpaste I have had much fewer which is definitely a pro for me. I do think my teeth look a little whiter which is good but it&#x27;s not am major concern to me as my teeth don&#x27;t need major whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d recommend it and I think I&#x27;ll continue to use the Crest Pro-health line as I like the toothpaste. I&#x27;m not sure if I will purchase the product for the whitening aspect though. I did receive this product as a free sample through BzzAgent as part of a promotion from Crest.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health HD did a great job whitening our teeth. The taste was pretty good and the process to use it twice a day was easy. We noticed whiter teeth in about 7 days and they continued to get whiter into the second week. The only issue I had was sensitive teeth with the product. I was the only one that had this issues. You will find this with most whitening products.</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro Health HD from BzzAgent to try for free and have been using it for a couple weeks now and I love this product. You only have two steps to whiten your teeth and in reality you are only brushing your teeth twice. The first step is to brush with the cleaning toothpaste, which tastes just like crest toothpaste. The second step is to brush again with the whitening toothpaste, which also tastes a bit like crest toothpaste, and a bit more jelly like but it didn&#x27;t bother me at all. And that is it. After a week of using Crest Pro Health HD I noticed a difference in my smile and teeth color, and now after 4 weeks, I have noticed a huge difference....my teeth are really white and other people are even noticing. I recommend this product for anyone that wants an easy way to whiten your smile without jumping through the hoops other products want you to do. I really liked that you didn&#x27;t have to keep the product away from your lips while using it. I have used whiteners in the past that burn your lips if it gets on them. This system is really easy an yields great results. I got Crest Pro Health HD free to try from BzzAgent, but I have already gone out and purchased another one and have made it a part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I was able to try a free sample of Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste and I really liked the results I saw. I started noticing a difference in the brightness of my teeth within a couple days and it only got better over the following weeks. Unlike most toothpastes it requires a little effort to use. There are two bottles and you brush with step 1 (the cleaner) for a minute, spit out the toothpaste (don’t rinse!), then brush with step 2 (the whitener) for 1 minute. I have a Sonicare toothbrush that beeps every 30 seconds so it was easy for me to know when I need to switch from top to bottom on my mouth or switch toothpastes. If I were to use a manual toothbrush I could see this toothpaste being a pain. The only real complaint I have about this toothpaste is the fact that you have to stop midbrush to switch toothpastes. If you can get over that, then this is probably the best toothpaste I’ve used. I’ve tried some whitening toothpastes that are really bitter but this one tastes really good! It has a good texture too. After step 1 your teeth are left feeling a little gritty, but step 2 seems to polish the grittiness away. I would definitely recommend this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive the Crest Pro-Health Daily Two-Step Toothpaste from Bzz Agent to try and review. I have tried several whitening toothpastes prior to this one and never noticed any difference.&lt;br /&gt;Crest Pro Health comes in two tubes and requires brushing twice which seemed slightly inconvenient at first but I quickly got used to it once my mouth and teeth started to feel cleaner and look whiter. I also noticed that my morning breath seemed better and I didn&#x27;t have a sour taste in my mouth. My husband also used the toothpaste and was very happy with how his teeth looked and how clean his mouth fell.&lt;br /&gt;I do have to warn everybody about one thing - the taste wasn&#x27;t the greatest and brushing second time without rinsing first didn&#x27;t help either.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise I would recommend Crest Pro Health HD Daily Two Step toothpaste to everybody that cares about the health of their teeth.</li>
            <li> this is literally the best toothpaste ever. my teeth are so white with just using this &amp; no white strips - LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I have tried other whitening products before. I have done strips and gel in a mouthpiece. Both of those just made my teeth feel gross. With crest pro health it was easy to use and comfortable because it was like part of my regular mouth hygiene routine, you just brush with each. It also left my teeth feeling much more clean and shiny.  Thanks for this free sample, Crest.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this out free thanks to Crest and BzzAgent. I was pleasant with the long-lasting fresh breath in the morning as well as the clean and refreshing feel of my teeth after using this set. My teeth felt bright and strong after just once use.</li>
            <li> I saw that my teeth were beginning to look somewhat yellow. So I bought this product and use it at least once a day. My teeth are now whiter. As an extra benefit, the tube that has the whitener tastes good.</li>
            <li> First time I used this two step process I could immediately tell a difference of &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; than from my regular toothpaste.  It doesn&#x27;t take any longer to brush than I usually do.  Great Product.</li>
            <li> Although I found that this product did whiten my teeth to a degree, I gave it 3 stars because it didn&#x27;t whiten like it promised. It only takes off the surface stains which are minimal. Also, the 1st step was very harsh on my gums and I felt it burned my gums.</li>
            <li> Felt like I just came back from the dentist after use.  it is not a toothpaste I would use every day though  it was a little rough on the gums but I love the way my mouth felt after using it.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and promotes good brushing. The two minutes each morning and night helped me establish a better routine. The products were nice tasting too..not too much and not too little. Enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Years ago I switched from Listerine to Crest mouthwash and my teeth became so stained that the dentist had to use a special ultrasonic cleaning system on me to get them off. Please know that apparently there is just a small percentage of people who experience this. This product, Crest Pro-Health HD does the same to my teeth. Please know that there may be just a small percentage of people who experience this....and I am one of those unlucky one. For example, my husband did not experience this problem.&lt;br /&gt;I did not experience any sensitivity and my mouth felt very clean.&lt;br /&gt;This morning I saw this product at CVS sold for $12.99...so I am not happy with the price at which it&#x27;s offered currently through this vendor plus shipping.</li>
            <li> Both of these products (fluoride anti-plaque toothpaste and whitening gel) have a wonderful, &amp;#34;peppy&amp;#34; taste and the whitening is awesome!!nO would recommend these products to anyone wanting whiter, protected teeth!!</li>
            <li> These products were easy to use, tasted good, and really whitened my teeth!</li>
            <li> I saw results within the first few uses, and simple to use with great outcomes!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product as I have been looking for a newer whitening item. I am sorry to say, that I do not see any difference from what I was currently using. The product is easy to use and the taste is minty. With the polish, I can really taste the peroxide even after rinsing</li>
            <li> I used the Crest Two-Step toothpaste and loved it! It was easy to use and only took a few minutes. The results were better than I expected. I have tried several different products with little to no positive results but Crest Pro-Health HD Two-Step Toothpaste actually did what it said it would do! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I was given crest pro-Health HD to try out. This product is great! I love it! Yes, it is a 2 step process, each step only lasting one min, for a total of 2 minutes, which is the recommended amount of time to brush anyways. The first step is a purifying cleanser aka anti cavity fluoride toothpaste, that after you brush for one min, you spit but do NOT rinse. This leaves your teeth gritty and mouth kind of dry- this feeling is similar to when the dentist polishes your teeth and your teeth feel gritty or sandy. Step 2 is a perfecting gel which you brush your teeth with it for 1 min and then you rinse. The perfecting gel is meant to whiten and polish your teeth. Both of these &amp;#34;steps&amp;#34; or pastes out together leave your mouth feeling sooo clean, as if you just got your teeth polished by the dentist. The fresh minty breath and clean feeling lasts almost all day and I noticed my teeth already looked whiter, with just one application! I plan on using crest pro-health for now on! Bye bye old regular toothpaste, hello crest pro-health HD and hello to a healthier, cleaner, whiter smile! Do yourself and your teeth a favor, give crest Pro-health HD a try, you and your teeth will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> First impressions:  Wow, did I just get my teeth professionally cleaned??  After just one use it felt like I just got out of the dentist and the just brushed feeling stuck with me most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it a few days I noticed I had developed a healthy brushing routine (brushing the full 2 minutes), and I was looking forward to brushing so I could get the whole mouth clean feeling it provides.  I started using it with my Oral-B power brush (after my dentist recommended it) and it just keeps getting better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just a few days I noticed my teeth were noticeably whiter already.  I just got out of the dentist this morning and they said my gums were a lot healthier and the signs of gingivitis I had were gone!  I&#x27;ve also noticed I have a lot fresher breath that sticks with me.  Amazing product I will definitely continue to buy and recommend!</li>
            <li> I received my crest HD fhas an excellent from Smiley 360 a week ago, Crest has always had a fabulous product but I must say this is phenomenal  A noticeable change in my teeth much whiter and brighter, there is no chalky dry mouth feeling and the freshness lasts for several hours. Excellent job Crest I will continue to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angelique&lt;br /&gt; &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m supposed to mention that I snagged this product free as a BzzAgent, which is good, really, because I probably wouldn&#x27;t have tried it otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am not impressed.  I find it kind of a hassle to have to use two different two pastes every time I brush my teeth.  I also find that the appearance of my teeth has not changed since I started using it.  Finally, I like my mouth to feel minty fresh and this product doesn&#x27;t have a strong taste.  If I was not given this sample, and had to buy it, I would have been quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a sad fact I learned about myself from trying this toothpaste: I am too lazy to use two tubes. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m interested in a whiter smile, and I&#x27;m a big fan of Crest in particular for helping me achieve that, but after only 4 days, I started skipping step 2. There are just too many mornings where I don&#x27;t have that extra minute to brush, essentially, twice. I do like how clean my teeth felt, but I can&#x27;t say I saw any big difference in whitening. If they could somehow combine these two formulas (or even go with one of the divided packages that keep the formulas separated put still come out together) I would absolutely use this, but realistically, I now know I won&#x27;t be diligent enough to use both steps consistently to get the benefits. I&#x27;ll stick with my Crest white strips twice a year and my regular Crest Pro Health toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I never would have purchased this product before I got it free from Bzzagent.  Seemed like twice the work every time I brush my teeth.  It is actually not that much work and even when I am in a hurry it forces me to brush my teeth for the recommended 2 min.  My teeth are definitely whiter!  I wish the flavor was better, my teeth feel very clean after I brush, but I do not have that minty feeling in my mouth.  My husband has been using this toothpaste as well and loves it!  We will definitely be buying it after we use this one up.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste keeps your mouth super clean all day though eating and drinking . It&#x27;s like a plaque blocker it&#x27;s super awesome must give it a try</li>
            <li> Today is day 4 for me of using this product and I am really liking it! I feel like I am keeping my teeth &#x27;fresh from the dentist&#x27; clean every day. I love knowing the floride paste is keeping my teeth strong and cavity free. The two steps take some getting used to, especially since you are not supposed to rinse between them, but it takes no longer to brush than normal toothpaste and is now very normal. I have not noticed any whitening yet, but it is early yet. I recieved the toothpaste as a part of a promotion from crest, but I plan on making this my normal routine.</li>
            <li> I received the Pro-Health HD Daily kit for free through BzzAgent to try. Like other reviewers, I was skeptical, but soon found out that this toothpaste really does work to whiten teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first paste you use is like a typical minty toothpaste, while the second one is a thinner clear gel with a peroxide scent. I use my electric toothbrush to help me time the application of each paste (it beeps every 30 seconds) and find both pastes pleasant enough. After I finish using the second paste, my teeth are noticeably whiter--like I&#x27;d just used strips for 30 minutes. Only it took just 2 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I have any complaint about this toothpaste, it&#x27;s that the second gel doesn&#x27;t leave a minty fresh taste in my mouth. This is easily remedied with a post-brush swish of mouthwash, though. I&#x27;ve never had a toothpaste that whitens this well. Absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the time it takes to do that extra step. I was a bit skeptical at first (as I am with most new products I try). However, this system by Crest really does the job it promises to do. I have noticed that my breath feels fresher, my teeth feel cleaner, and my teeth are definitely whiter. Definitely give the Crest Pro-Health HD system a shot! I received this as a BZZ Agent, but I will continue to buy it because I love it so much.</li>
            <li> When I received my free trial from Bzz agent I was fairly skeptical  because of the amount of time Crest HD recommended to whiten your teeth was only 2 minutes a day.  I have done the whitening strips and trays and they are in your mouth  a much longer amount of time than 2 measly minutes.  The brushing experience was exactly what you would expect. The toothpaste has a pleasant minty taste and the whitening part tastes like the whitening strips. ( I am not a fan of the taste but anyone can do it for a minute).  Some reviewers have mentioned pain and or burning which I have not experienced at all.  I have seen a change in a week and will continue to use the product to achieve even whiter teeth.  Many people have also mentioned that your teeth feel as if you just left the dentist.  You do have a nice clean feeling when done, but I think that most people do not typically brush for a full 2 minutes like they should.  I did not notice a huge difference from what I usually feel when I am done brushing my teeth.  Overall impressed by the time I have to put in and the job that this product does.</li>
            <li> Somewhat works. I cant tell the difference but my family notice it.  2 steps teeth brushing can get tiring though.</li>
            <li> I had been procrastinating about trying some of the myriad of products on the market that promise whiter teeth but have been turned off by the thought of trays with messy goop, strips, expensive trips to the dentist, etc. BUT NO MORE!!  I received a free sample of Crest Pro-Health HD 2-step (Thanks CREST!!) and it takes no more time than regular brushing!!  Although I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 days I can tell that there is a subtle difference in the whiteness of my teeth already!!  I&#x27;m super excited to see what they will look like after a couple of weeks!!  I have a Sonicare brush with an automatic timer that beeps after one minute so I just pause my brushing after the first step - spit and load the brush with Step 2 (remember - no rinsing after Step 1!) and finish the cycle.  Couldn&#x27;t be any easier!!  And even though my sample was free the price that the product is listed at is VERY reasonable compared to the other products that offer similar results with considerably more hassle!  I&#x27;m a FAN!! And I will be purchasing!! Note:  I usually use Sensodyne toothpaste for some sensitivity issues I have but so far, after 3 days, I don&#x27;t seem to notice any worsening.  I figured if I did have an up-tick in that I would back off to using it once per day and alternate with the Sensodyne to settle it back down.  But I&#x27;ll figure out some sort of plan regardless!!</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent and Crest, I tried this product for free!&lt;br /&gt;I am really happy with this toothpaste! It has a great minty taste, and leaves my teeth feeling clean after each brushing. I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference with how much whiter my teeth have gotten, which I haven&#x27;t seen with other similar products.</li>
            <li> Please note, I was sent this product for free by Bzzz Agent to try it and review it. The opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am fairly critical when it comes to new products. I expect results and a positive user experience. I am rarely surprised by products. That said, this is a little bit of magic in two tubes. Unwrapping the box, my initial thought was this may be a bit too time intensive for me. I also doubted I&#x27;d see results in a week - nothing in my experience works that quickly. I was wrong on both counts. The use is quite simple - you squeeze a bit of tube number one on your toothbrush and brush for one minute - spit it out but don&#x27;t rinse. Then you use a bit of the second tube, brush for another minute, spit then rinse and you will really have dental hygienist clean teeth. It adds, perhaps 20 seconds to your dental routine. I noticed a difference after the first use. And it&#x27;s continued to improve. I tend to get an accumulation of plaque behind my lower teeth and on one where it&#x27;s a bit crooked. The single tooth seems plaque free. The area behind my bottom teeth is vastly improved. And I saw this once month overdue for my cleaning! The plaque removing tube one is fantastic and really works well but its the HD polish tube number 2 that makes this product a game changer. Again, after one use my teeth were brighter and cleaner. After a full week, I cannot believe the difference. I don&#x27;t feel a need to use whitening strips or any other brightening product on my teeth. As for the actual use - the taste is great, doesn&#x27;t linger like some tooth products do. Doesn&#x27;t feel overly harsh or burny on my tongue or lips. Leaves nice fresh breath after. And a little goes a long, long way. Overall, this product is amazing. I&#x27;m glad I have it and plan on rebuying as soon as I can.</li>
            <li> When I got a free sample of this product I wasn&#x27;t sure I would truly see or feel any difference. I couldn&#x27;t be more wrong. I feel and see a noticeable difference even after just one week of use. My mouth feels more clean and that feeling stays with me throughout most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;The only down side I have to offer about this product is that it really dries out your mouth while you are using it. It goes away once you are able to rinse after the second phase but it is just annoying enough for me to bring it up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many tooth whiteners before.  They all do an okay job at tackling my surface stains, but I&#x27;ve never gotten results as white as those pictured on the packages before.  Needless to say, I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything better from this new Crest product, despite it&#x27;s promises.  Well, I have to admit, I was underestimating it&#x27;s power.  In only seven days, my teeth look as white as they used to look before I started drinking soda, tea and coffee!  My smile truly is like new.  There are a few cons to the product which users should be aware of: 1) it&#x27;s a two-step process.  It doesn&#x27;t add that much time to your brushing routine, but it is something you have to get used to.  2) I found that my gums were sensitive to the ingredients and I started developing some irritation when I was using the paste to brush my teeth every time that I did (which is usually three times a day.)  When I limited my use to only once and made sure to rinse thoroughly after, the irritation went away.  Just think - only using this product one time a day for seven days and my mouth looks AMAZING!  I am very glad that Crest chose me as a recipient of a sample product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not impressed by this tooth paste. I received it free as a part of a BZZAgent campaign and having 2 tubes is too much. The first tube leaves my mouth dry and gritty then the second tube is so thin that the brush scrapes across my teeth like nails on a chalk board. I would not purchase this. I am grateful for the experience to try this product, but it is not for me and my family.</li>
            <li> As a Buzz agent I had the opportunity to try Crest Pro Health HD for free thanks to Crest. The package included two pastes for a two-step process. I would prefer a one tube product and although it is not much more time consuming was not thrilled with having to do a two-step process. The first is a purifying cleanser that “helps strip away plaque.” To me, stripping seems damaging, but let’s give it a shot anyway as it indicates this can provide 6X whiter teeth in one week (vs. ordinary toothpaste). After using step one, I did not feel like I had that minty fresh breath; however, it did leave my teeth feeling clean, almost as clean as after a professional cleaning. You do not rinse, but then use step two, the perfecting gel. This step tasted similar to teeth whitening strips, in my opinion. I would prefer to have been left with invigorating, minty fresh breath.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was a little nervous to try this since I do have sensitive teeth, but found that my teeth were whiter by about two shades in a little over a week and I did not have high sensitivity. I would most likely continue to use the product alternating between this and a sensitive tooth paste. I feel like it did do a good job whitening and cleaning my teeth, but feel the after taste was not what I was used to or wanted.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste was more complicated to use being it is a two part process. I felt like it helped with morning breath but had to stop using it due to my gums became very sensitive. I have had this happen before with other tooth pasts so its not just crest. I did receive this as a promotional product in return for my review.</li>
            <li> Have used a lot of products to try to whiten my teeth without much success. Strips take too much time and don&#x27;t cover the entire mouth, and toothpaste really doesn&#x27;t work that well for me. But then I received a free sample of Crest Pro Health HD from BZZ Agent. It takes 2 min. each time,twice a day and  I got a fresh clean feeling and whiter teeth. I did experience some sensitivity when I first started the product,but I cut down to once a day for a few days and it went away. Noe I use it all the time and love it!</li>
            <li> I like this and it works....BUT The two step thing its pretty annoying. If they could could combine this into one paste or have the gel and the paste come out side by side a la Mentadent toothpaste that would be delightful. I don&#x27;t like cluttering my bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product free to test as part of a promotion from Crest as I am a bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I think this product is ok I received it from BzzAgent for free and I think its OK because I am already lazy to brush my teeth and I have to use 2 toothpaste? But it does seem to make my teeth feel smoother and cleaner.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth, so I can&#x27;t really use many of the whitening products on the market. And most whitening toothpastes don&#x27;t really whiten that much (at least not the ones that I have tried). I love to drink tea, coffee, and wine... so my teeth color isn&#x27;t always the whitest. However, since using this product, I have definitely noticed a whiter smile. I give this product 5 stars because: A) my teeth are whiter, and B) it whitens my teeth WITHOUT causing tooth sensitivity.... This system has two steps, the first is a toothpaste (that I wish tasted better and didn&#x27;t leave my mouth feeling so dry) and I second step that I believe is the whitener. This product works and I was lucky to receive this product for free to review and I am glad that I did because I now have a whiter smile :-)</li>
            <li> I have been trying the Crest Pro Health HD for free for a month and I can attest to the overall results achieved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It leaves your mouth feeling exceptionally clean. The step 1 cleanser leaves a great refreshing taste and eliminates bad breath completely. The flavor of the toothpaste tastes great as well, without having an artificial flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I have seen noticeable results in the whitening process that Crest Pro Health HD claims. Using the step 2 gel, you can feel it working right away with the hydrogen peroxide in it. It does leave a film on your teeth but that is a sacrifice I don&#x27;t mind making to get whiter results. If some have sensitive teeth, I can see where this might be an issue. I used an electric toothbrush with the Crest Pro Health HD kit and have been happy with the results. I will continue to use this and see if I can achieve whiter results while keeping a healthy mouth!</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health® HD™ leaves your mouth feeling extra clean and your teeth looking polished and white. Try it and you won&#x27;t be disappointed. I tried it free thanks to Crest and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. Two easy steps to a healthier mouth you can be proud to show off.</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste for a few weeks now. After brushing, I have noticed that my teeth do feel cleaner and I have noticed that they are somewhat whiter.&lt;br /&gt;I had a dentist appointment while using Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste and I noticed there was considerably lest scraping involved.  That is always a good thing!&lt;br /&gt;I am not crazy about the flavor.  I prefer a fresh minty flavor that I didn&#x27;t get with Crest.  I don&#x27;t think that would stop me from using this brand.  It is important to me to keep my teeth as healthy as possible and I can live with the flavor if that is what Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste will do for me.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use. You brush with Step 1 for a minute, then without rinsing continue onto Step 2 for another minute.  Then you&#x27;re done!  It&#x27;s also great to use with my sensitive teeth.  I have used other whitening systems and they usually make my teeth very sensitive to the cold.  I have not experience this with Crest 3D White Brilliance.  Would def recommend.</li>
            <li> I started using Crest Pro-Health HD about a month ago. I think it works great! My teeth feel healthy and they look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am only giving it 4 stars because it is a bit frustrating to need to use 2 different tubes of tooth paste. I think it is absolutely easier then dental trays or other whitening products but regular tooth paste is easier then a two part system.  If you have the patience to use 2 tubes, this is a great toothpaste. My teeth feel cleaner and they look much whiter. My wife has noticed a difference in my smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fine folks at Crest provided me this sample so I could test it out.</li>
            <li> I received this as a promotion to try for free. I will admit that my teeth feel so clean and smooth after using it and my breath is so fresh! The toothpaste is a two-step process where you use the first paste for one minute then switch to the second paste for an additional minute. After using you rinse and feel how clean your teeth are. After a few uses, you can notice how white your teeth are getting. I would recommend this to anyone looking for good plaque control, cavity control, fresh breath and whitening all in one product.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the look, feel and taste of this product from Crest Pro Health HD line.  He enjoys his whiter smile while still indulging in his morning and afternoon coffee addictions.  He has no tooth or gum sensitivity and uses it twice a week for the results he gets.  His teeth are noticeably whiter and I love that, too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for nearly 2 months now and have LOVED the results!! Yes, 2 minutes of brushing, twice daily, can be daunting, but it&#x27;s totally worth the time. My mouth feels so much cleaner and fresher after I use this and my teeth have gotten so sparkly and white. I was given this to try as a BzzAgent and have been really impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> I was very fortunate to receive this Crest Pro-Health HD whitening set free to test and review from Crest through Bzzagent. Getting this product for free does not influence this review. Honestly, I didn&#x27;t believe this toothpaste would make much of a difference. I&#x27;m an older person with some tooth discoloration that I thought I would just have to life with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a situation that not many of us have when we  start using a new product that could make a visual difference in appearance. I went for my first appointment for a crown and told the dentist and his assistant that I was going to try this toothpaste. Exactly two weeks later, I went for my permanent crown and they said they could see a difference. I do have dental work on my top front teeth, but not on the bottom and those teeth always looked a little darker, especially since I&#x27;m a coffee and tea drinker. Those bottom teeth as well as all of my other teeth are now visibly whiter, and having the dentist notice the difference drove home the point that this stuff really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that said, this is very strong stuff. You brush with the step 1 paste then, while your teeth are still coated with the step 1 paste, you brush with step 2. The combination of the two has a very strong taste, not very pleasant. If you get any on your chin, if you have sensitive skin, you&#x27;ll see some redness. But I&#x27;m willing to put up with the taste to have such a difference in my teeth. When this runs out, I&#x27;ll be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for free thanks to Crest.  I had a difficult time with the taste.  I have only used it a few times due to the taste.  However, my mouth feels much cleaner after using this product rather than regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I love Crest Pro Health HD.  I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my smile.  I got it free to try from Bzz Agent and Crest.  It did take some getting used to as it is a 2 step process but after a couple weeks, I really noticed the difference.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier and will be purchasing Crest Pro Health HD to continue my whitening process.  I love my new smile!</li>
            <li> I recieved this product for free as part of a brand promo, and I have been using this for a week and I have seen improvement. It is working but takes some time. Gels work faster but are more intrusive to your normal brushing routine. Whiting toothpastes just do not seem to work at all. This is a good in between, and for the prize on Amazon it is worth picking up, just realize it is going to take a little time.</li>
            <li> The main reason why I was really curious to try this product was because of the 6x teeth whitening advertisement. Previously I have used all types of toothpastes and chemicals to get my teeth as white as I can. I used white strips, whitening mouth wash, toothpastes, and even some natural remedies and all of those do not compare to this product. Until I had the opportunity to try this product for free. I feel like my teeth are not only whiter but my mouth is cleaner too. The product says that it takes about 6 weeks to achieve maximum results and I am only 2 weeks into using the product but I could feel a difference from the first use. Step 1 is a cleansing step, its a more gritty type of taste to really scrub the teeth clean but the taste is not bad at all as you would tend to expect from a cleanser. As soon as you are finished using step 1 it feels like you just got a cleaning at the dentist, teeth surface feels clean and smooth. Next step is the whitening step. I should first note that I hate the taste of other whitening agents because they taste very chemically. This gel does not taste very chemically to me. I was able to tolerate the taste for the 1 minute that it takes to brush and I feel that although it wasn&#x27;t pleasant it wasn&#x27;t a terrible taste either. I will continue to use this product for another 4 weeks to get the full effect but if my experience continues to go as it has been then I think I have found my new toothpaste system.</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro--Health HD from Crest to try out the product.  I really wanted to love this product and be able to ditch my bleaching routine that I do every 3 mos or so.  Unfortunately, I found this to perform much like other whiting toothpastes.  I use other crest products as well.  The paste reminded me of when my mother used to mix peroxide and baking soda together when I was a child to brush her teeth.  I found it to give me dry mouth.  My husband tried the product and liked it very much.  He felt the product really cleaned the plaque from his teeth.  I will stick with bleaching and a regular Crest whitening toothpaste.  I did like the fact that step one is required for one minute and then step 2 is required for one minute assuring I get at least a 2 minute brush in twice daily! Picture on Right is before and picture on left is after one week of use.  Pretty much the same.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste actually works as advertised in the first application! The first bottle cleans your teeth like the grainy stuff at the dentist and then the second bottle freshens and whitens!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried out this Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste that I got through BzzAgent and can see my teeth are whiter after the first application!!  My teeth feel amazingly clean and the process took no longer than normal tooth brushing.  I would recommend this to everyone!  You can pick it up @Target, @Walgreens or @Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue to use this toothpaste combo!</li>
            <li> When I first got the Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste I noticed how although the packaging is a little over kill for toothpaste it was eye catching and extremely easy to open.  After opening the package, I was immediately overwhelmed by the minty scent and was therefore a little worried about whether or not I would be able to use the toothpaste as I&#x27;m not a fan of overly minty toothpaste.  I was also initially worried about the two step process required with this toothpaste and wether or not that would fit into my morning routine as a busy working mom!  I first tried the Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste about a month ago.  The first step fluoride toothpaste was not overly minty flavored, it does get a little foamy though, but the texture was not something that would deter me from continuing to use it.  The second  step toothpaste is the hydrogen peroxide toothpaste which is more of a clear gel.  I did not have any of the possible side effects, such as burning or irritation that can go along with this toothpaste.  The second step toothpaste doesn&#x27;t really have any flavor to it at all, and therefore you don&#x27;t really get that fresh minty feeling when you are all finished with the brushing process.  Overall, I was very satisfied with my first experience of using the Crest Pro Health HD.  I didn&#x27;t feel that the process of having to use two different toothpaste affected my morning routine by more than 30 seconds!  I also couldn&#x27;t believ how incredibly clean my teeth felt after just one use!  I felt as if I had just left the dentist office from getting my teeth cleaned.  I have only been using the Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste once a day instead of the recommended twice a day, but I still feel I&#x27;m getting great benefits from this toothpaste.  I definitely feel that my teeth are whiter even thought I&#x27;m still drinking 20-32 ounces of dark soda almost every day as well.  I would absolutely recommend Crest Pro Health HD to all my friends, family, coworkers and even strangers in the toothpaste aisle at the store! Thanks Crest for such a great toothpaste product! I got this product for free from BzzAgent and Crest, but I will definitely be buying this great product once again!he toothpaste aisle at the store! Thanks Crest for such a great toothpaste product! I got this product for free from BzzAgent and Crest, but I will definitely be buying this great product once again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste for a few weeks now.  Mostly I like the toothpaste, but there are a couple of things I dislike.  I was fortunate enough to get to try it for free thanks to Crest and Bzzagent.com.  I really like the way my mouth feels after step 1.  It leaves you with a very clean feeling due to what I can only think to describe as the &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; in the toothpaste.  It reminds me of the paste the dentist uses to clean your teeth and your mouth feels very similar to that after step 1.  I also like the taste of step 1.  Step 2, however, I am not a fan of.  The jelly texture is just plain weird in my mouth, and the taste of it is pretty yucky.  It reminds me of the gross taste that goes along with whitening strips.  Fortunately I only have to subject myself to the yucky taste for 1 minute instead of 10 or 15 with a strip. I also get to rinse at the end, so the lingering taste of step 2 is pretty mild.  Overall it&#x27;s a good product in my opinion.  My mouth feels clean, and my teeth do appear to be a bit whiter after a few weeks use.  I don&#x27;t think I could stand to use it for every brushing as the two steps are a bit time consuming but I will likely purchase another round in the future.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth so I was a bit worried about this tooth paste. I remember using a white strip after a dental exam and the pain was awful. Yet, I went to the hygienist and tried this that same night and was pleased I had no issues. I understand some people will love a product and others will say eh. I myself love this easy two step toothpaste. My mouth feels cleaner, my teeth are brighter and the taste isn&#x27;t harsh or leave an aftertaste. It is a bit pricey but at the same time last longer and worth the extra for a better clean mouth. You can also find coupons. If you buy white strips and toothpaste you will add time and money to your routine so why not just get this easy kits that in three minutes you can be done? I received my kit from Crest through Bzzagent. In no way has receiving it free influenced my thoughts other than the product being something I would buy again.Edited to say I have bought this again and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It gives you a feeling of deep cleansing, being refreshed and a sparkling white smile. I felt as though I could see an improvement every time I used it. This product works for whiting and it also made my mouth feel overall more healthy. The value is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I must sayI love having white teeth. As soon as I was presented with the opportunity to sample the Crest ProHealth HD for free I jumped on it. The packaging reccomends getting a professional cleaning prior to so I made sure I scheduled a cleaning before even opening the box. From the very first brush my teeth felt smooth and I loved the minty fresh breath! After using for a few days my teeth are definitely noticeably whiter! A few of my friends actually asked if id had a professional whitening. This is definitely a cheaper alternative to teeth whitening.</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro Health HD for the past week, and I love the results.  I got it for free via Bzzagent.  There’s almost a afterglow where my teeth feel nice and clean.  It’s a good feeling.  The process to brush your teeth takes longer than 2 minutes because you have to spit, apply the next toothpaste and then start back up again.  If it were all in one process, that would be ideal, but the results make the extra step worth it.  I’ve noticed that my teeth look whiter.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for about a week now.  I received it free from bzzagent to try and review.  It is a good product, but I do not see much difference whitening wise.  The first step is a pleasant taste, while the second is definitely a flouride taste - so it is good that the first step is there.  I have a hard time using both steps without spitting, but am getting the hang of it.  Overall good product as all crest products, but not sure how much whiter my teeth will be.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t use crest but since I was sent this to try by Crest and Buzzagent I thought I would give it a shot.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I could believe the 6 x whiter in a week tag but I have to say I noticed whiter teeth after the very first brushing.  Sure you have to use two different products but they still have you only brushing for 2 minutes just like my dentist recommends.  I was also pleasantly surprised by how clean my mouth felt.  It leaves your mouth feeling very fresh and my teeth were shiny like i just left the dentist for a cleaning.  I am very impressed with the quality of the product and I will definitely continue to use this after my free sample is all used up.</li>
            <li> I tried the Crest Pro Health HD as part of a promotion through Crest, with the intention of seeing if it would in fact whiten my teeth. This has proven difficult after years of coffee drinking. What I found was a system that was surprisingly easy to use, just brush your teeth as normal, then follow up with the gel for another minute, simple as that. I felt a cleaner, healthier mouth immediately with the first use. My teeth began to look less stained within days. A week later the results were noticeable to those who didn&#x27;t know I was using the product. This system takes away the uncomfortable whitening gel trays that ooze gel all over your mouth, or the strips that are supposed to stay on for what feels like an eternity. It is nothing more than simply brushing your teeth. And the clean, healthy feeling is what will keep my using this product. My mouth feels great!</li>
            <li> You HAVE to try this stuff! Who knew toothpaste could be so amazing? I was lucky enough to try this HD system as part of a promotional subject from Crest through BzzAgent.  I received my package at the beginning of February after coming off an entire year of a teeth straightening system where I wasn&#x27;t allowed any whitening products.  Do you know how hard that was? I am obsessed with a good white smile so it was a long year.  How lucky was I to get this opportunity with Crest after such a long year, I had to take advantage.  My auto toothbrush timer is set for 2 minutes, guess what you need for this system? Two minutes, that&#x27;s it! Step 1 cleans my mouth for one minute, and step 2 polishes away at my teeth for another minute, then my toothbrush pulses and I know I&#x27;m set to roll.  I can say with out a doubt that my smile has whitened in the last couple of weeks and I&#x27;m looking forward to the results with the end of the tubes :)</li>
            <li> Loving it!  Want that just left the dentist feel PLUS whitening?  This is the product for you!  I received my first box free from BzzAgents.  My teeth are noticeably whiter (like I used a bleaching tray but without the weird spots) and they feel super clean!  The two steps took a few days to get used to but it&#x27;s not a big deal and SO worth the results. If want clean, healthy, white teeth then this is for you.</li>
            <li> I really like using Crest Pro-Health HD Daily. It is must easier than the strips for me. I brush my teeth anyway, it isn&#x27;t having to add an additional step or do something different. You get the same tingling as you do from the strips and equally as impressive results.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING. I have tried all types of whitening and have even considered getting ZOOM teeth whitening at the dentist.  After the first day, I could tell my teeth were whiter.  Unlike other toothpastes that claim they &amp;#34;whiten&amp;#34;, I really like how there&#x27;s 2 steps. You clean and then you use the step 2 gel to polish/whiten. It only takes a fraction of the time as white strips and you still get much better results. I don&#x27;t usually post reviews but I was so amazed with the results that I had to!</li>
            <li> Got to try this new toothpaste dou through BzzAgent and I must say I am impressed. My teeth feel cleaner and look whiter and while it is a two step system it is simple to follow. Step 1 is great as it has a grittiness to it that really cleans my teeth and a great mint taste, Step 2 mostly tastes like the whitening strips that I have tried so not great but it definitely seems to be working. So definitely recommend giving this a try for a whiter, brighter, cleaner feeling after brushing.</li>
            <li> Prior to this great BzzCampaign of Crest Pro Health HD, our family purchased tooth paste that was normally sensitive and/or lacking the whitening aspect. My husband and I have very sensitive teeth and every time we used a whitening toothpaste our teeth became painfully sensitive. Yes, I would love white teeth, because everyone knows that their teeth could use a bit of whitening, especially mine. I love my coffee, which does a number on teeth. Needless to say I was a bit skeptical about this BzzCampaign but excited to try this new product. I thought it was neat this this toothpaste has a 2 step program. Brush with each toothpaste for one minute and then rinse. The first toothpaste is the cleaner, which really seems to do a good job with the cleaning. Brush for a minute and then after that do not rinse and use the whitener. Brush for a minute and then rinse. Two things I noticed right away with this method. One, it gets me to brush my teeth for the 2 minutes, like the dentist recommends and secondly, my teeth did not feel the whitening aspect which normally hurts my teeth. It feels like with this system the first toothpaste helps coat your teeth to prevent the sensitivity. Great method Crest! I have only used this toothpaste for about a week and already noticed slight results, actually my husband noticed right away! We will see how my teeth look after the toothpaste is used up!&lt;br /&gt;I looked up the price at our local retailer, and it was $12.99 for the system. This seems like a good price because you get the whitener and toothpaste without the sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;Crest Pro Health HD seems like the way to go for whiter teeth! Also, this means I can have white teeth and enjoy my sweets (with my sweet tooth!)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know for sure if it worked, but it sure felt like it did.  I got to try some of this when my girlfriend bought it.  Brushing my teeth twice was not my favorite idea, but my teeth definitely felt clean.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the claims of it working in 6 days. Now that iv&#x27;e tried it, I&#x27;m noticing small improvements across my teeth. It&#x27;s nothing dramatic, but just slight whitening. When you get down to it, it&#x27;s still just toothpaste. And you can only do so much without professional whitening, but this does live up to its claims and works adequately. It&#x27;s a bit of a hassle for the two step process, I wish it was just a one-step product. Why do I need to brush twice? It was simple to use and see the results though. I think the price, at $15.99 (more on amazon) is a tad too expensive. I&#x27;d like to see it down to $9.99, that would make it more accessible for a broader range of people. I received this as part of a promotion to review.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste system! My teeth feel so smooth after I brush....just like I had been to the dentist. The taste is not like regular toothpaste, but the results are great. I would definitely recommend this to someone looking to whiten their teeth while achieving a healthy smile.</li>
            <li> I am a BzzAgent and I was given Crest Pro-Health DH Daily Two-Step Toothpaste to try for free, and then I am to give my honest opinion about the product.  I have to say that I really liked this product.  I did see a noticeable whiting of my teeth within a couple of days which of course I like!  I also really like how clean and polished my teeth and mouth feels after using this product.  First you use step 1 to brush your teeth.  You can spit but you do not rinse.  After a minute, you can add Step 2 to your toothbrush to whiten your teeth.  I think the first step gets the plaque off of your teeth.  My whole mouth just feels to clean and polished when I am done.  I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 as I have had my teeth professionally whitened at the dentist.  I have a plastic mouth holder fitted to my mouth that I can use the dentist&#x27;s whitening product.  Obviously the dentist has a an upper hand in the whitening department BUT even using the dentist products, I have to leave it on for 30 minutes at a time.  Crest Pro-Health Daily Two-Step Toothpaste does a great job and it works over a few days.  I do recommend it!  I saw a difference and the price is great!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample to try and have quickly gotten use to my new two step routine. After one week my teeth were noticeably whiter. Crest Prohealth HD is a good value because I can prevent cavities while I whiten my teeth and remove surface stains. I no longer have to buy whitening strips and struggle with trying to keep them in place.</li>
            <li> This is a fun product: an oral hygiene adventure! Step one is your typical toothpaste- fresh and clean and minty (although it&#x27;s a bit difficult to apply to the brush). Step two is the unique part- it&#x27;s the polishing step, and tastes a little fruitier. In combination they leave the mouth feeling clean and scrubbed. I took the \\&quot;one-week\\&quot; Crest challenge with a free sample, and I gotta say, my smile is looking pretty good.</li>
            <li> I received a free Crest Pro Health HD kit as a BzzAgent to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It always seems that everyone else except me has shiny white teeth. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of whitening toothpastes and strips -they worked ok, but the brightness always was temporary, never lasting the promised months of whiteness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to try the new Crest Pro Health HD kit see if It could be the ONE. You know, the thing that FINALLY works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know you&#x27;re supposed to brush your teeth for 2 minutes, but I usually lose track after the first minute and probably don&#x27;t brush as long as I&#x27;m supposed to. But with this kit, you&#x27;re supposed to brush 1 minute with the fluoride paste, then add the polishing gel and brush again for another minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes me pay more attention to my brushing time, so I think I actually brush longer when I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And after the first use, my teeth did feel very clean. The texture of the brushing did change after adding the polishing gel. Were my teeth any whiter? After a full week&#x27;s trial, did I see the 6X brightness, as promised on the box? I&#x27;m sure my teeth were whiter but maybe not 6X... maybe 2-4X. However, it may have more to do with the extended brushing. And I did think my side teeth were more noticeably less yellow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I did see an improvement using this product after only a week. My teeth seemed cleaner and brighter. Maybe not drastically whiter, but that may come with long-term use. Definitely better than regular whitening toothpastes!</li>
            <li> Since this product claims that you will have 6X whiter teeth in one week, I used it for one week both in the morning and at night before I wrote this review. I do think my teeth were a bit whiter but not 6 times whiter. To be fair, my teeth were already pretty white and clean as I just had a cleaning about a week prior to receiving this product to try for free from a Bzz campaign. When I first received this product, I thought the two steps were going to be a pain or take too long but I really didn’t find that it was too hard. It takes a bit longer to brush than with a regular toothpaste but I found I was willing to perform the two steps. It did take some getting used to but it was really only a couple of days until I settled into the two-step routine. One thing to keep in mind is that the second step gel is a bit watery so I found that I usually needed to keep the brush upright as I applied the gel because it had the tendency to run off the side of the brush. The gel also comes out fast so you don&#x27;t need to squeeze it very hard. Overall I liked it and didn’t mind the two steps. The reason I removed a star, though, is because my mouth didn’t feel very fresh and minty as I would like after brushing.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter has always been obsessed with her teeth and kept complaining wanting to have her teeth professionally&lt;br /&gt;whitened so I decided to let her try the crest pro health HD Daily two step system and I decided to try it as well, boy am I glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;It worked amazingly well! It&#x27;s easy , fast, and priced very low! If you are thinking of purchasing go ahead because it&#x27;s well worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> After using my Crest Pro Health HD for a week after receiving a free kit to try from Crest, I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth feel cleaner throughout the day and morning breath seems relatively improved. Unfortunately, the reason that I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth feel cleaner is because I&#x27;m a lot more aware of my teeth because they&#x27;re painfully sensitive when I drink anything hot or eat anything cold. I&#x27;ve experienced similar problems in the past with whitening strips, so I would say that if you&#x27;ve also had problems with whitening products that this is not the product for you. I&#x27;ll switch to a routine of using this every other day to see if I can have some of the benefits without all of the side effects, but that makes for a lot of clutter having three different toothpaste tubes on my bathroom sink. I wish they made this in a sensitive formula.</li>
            <li> For someone who is conscious of clean teeth, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this product out! I received the package and immediately wondered why there were two tubes in the container.  The container itself is sleek, albeit a little bulky.  The packaging could have slimmed down a bit, but it still wasn&#x27;t overwhelming.  When I peeled back the top cover, the two tubes were situated in their special spot.  The grooves inside the packaging where the tubes lay are ergonomical to the tubes.  The packaging of the tubes seem to be made of a thin material (aluminum perhaps).  Because of this thin material, there&#x27;s a lot more toothpaste in the tube than what you would normally come to expect from a regular tube of toothpaste.  I read the instructions and it is a two step process - you brush for one minute with tube 1, spit, brush for another minute with tube 1, rinse and spit, and you&#x27;re done!  I took a before picture and decided I would take another picture after six days.  My teeth are average in color.  I typically tend to drink one coffee or one soda a day.  I do get a little plaque build up on the back of my three bottom teeth.  The package says that you can expect whiter teeh in six days.  I did just as instructed and once I was finished, my teeth/mouth had that &#x27;just left the dentist&#x27; clean feeling.  I loved it! After six days of using both tubes twice a day, I can tell you my teeth were whiter and better yet, I don&#x27;t have any plaque build up behind my bottom teeth at all! That was a big surprise for me.  The only con I have is that the two step process isn&#x27;t as convenient, even if you are only brushing your teeth for a total of two minutes.  After my fourth or fifth brush, my gums were a little sore.  I realized that I was brushing my teeth too hard.  I think I&#x27;ve brushed my teeth too hard in the past in order to get rid of plaque build up, but realized that I didn&#x27;t have to put in that much work with Crest Prohealth HD.  Flossing my teeth to get rid of the plaque build up wasn&#x27;t an option - there was no plaque build up at all.  Although the two step process isn&#x27;t as convenient, it is worth it; especially since this is much easier than putting a tray of gel on your teeth or even using whitening strips.  Seeing my results after six days, I plan on continuing to use Crest Prohealth HD.sn&#x27;t an option - there was no plaque build up at all.

            <li> I received  CREST PRO HEALTH® HD™ for free from Crest for being a BzzAgent- I have been using  the product for about 3 weeks and I got to say I like it,  I am not sure if my teeth are getting whiter but they definitely gleam with a shiny sparkle and feel super smooth and polished though out the day.  I am not wild about having to wash for two minutes and I only brush my teeth once a day but  for the results I have been getting so far the product is worth the extra effort.</li>
            <li> I just added one extra step and a few minutes to my normal routine and in a few days not only did I notice a difference but my  friends and family did too.&lt;br /&gt;Tastes a little weird compared to my normal toothpaste, but after a few days I didn&#x27;t mind it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received Crest Pro Health HD as a part of a promotion from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> Using this for two weeks now and I do feel like my teeth are cleaner and brighter. But it does require more time. You have to brush your teeth twice in the morning and twice at night and when are really tired and just want to sleep - sometimes you miss your one shot toothpaste. #gotitfree as a part of a bzzagent packet to try it out.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive a free sample of this product, and I have been really happy with it! I&#x27;ve been using it over a week and really like that my smile seems brighter, but without any of the sensitivity associated with many whitening products. I am able to use Crest Pro Health HD twice a day with no issues. The taste is minty fresh too!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I received this system free from BzzAgent to try and review, because I am a fan of Crest toothpaste, but this toothpaste surpasses any others I have tried. I actually enjoy the first step because the taste is so pleasant. It has a nice minty flavor that is not at all overpowering, it reminds me of some of my favorite gums. Step two is the unique part, it whitens and polishes your teeth. After that step, I felt like just had my teeth cleaned by the dentist. My teeth felt so slippery! After about two weeks of use, I happened to catch myself in the mirror and thought &amp;#34;Oh my teeth look whiter today,&amp;#34; without even remembering that I was using a special toothpaste. (I always use a &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; toothpaste and it usually doesn&#x27;t whiten, just  maintains the whitening I get from other products. I had put this toothpaste in the same category so I was surprised to see actual results.) After another two weeks later, my teeth are even whiter and brighter! I have never had results like these unless I was using strips that made my sensitive teeth hurt. I am so excited to finally have a pain free whitening product!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It is my new go to toothpaste of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two step process seemed like it might be a hassle at first, but it&#x27;s actually simple and I don&#x27;t spend much longer brushing than I used to.  I can see the whitening difference and I&#x27;ve only been using it a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flavor on this toothpaste isn&#x27;t as sweet as other Crest toothpastes, but now that I&#x27;m used to it, those taste TOO sweet.  I also feel like it is a good toothpaste for sensitive teeth; it isn&#x27;t harsh at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get to try this product FREE courtesy of Crest and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Crest set for two weeks. Crest does boast up to  6x whiter teeth in a week, but there are definitely conditions that go with that promise. First, it does work. My teeth are a bit whiter (pretty stained from coffee and medications over the last 50+ years), but I&#x27;m only using it once a day, not the prescribed 2x per day. The whitening gel is pretty potent (most are) and for those of us with hard enamel and sensitive gums, twice a day really isn&#x27;t possible, aminly because they want you to brush a full minute with each tube, 2 minutes total. A full minute with whitening gel isn;t going to happen, I barely make 30 seconds. Even with that I take a day or two off and just use my ProNamel. Reason is, the whitening gel is like brushing with Vicks VapoRub, lol. SERIOUS cold burn happens, although after a couple days you get used to it. Beware, that very first day it was as if I brushed with liquid nitrogen, the cold burn was pretty nuts. But by day 3 it was doable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I decide to go through a professional whitening session, then I will definitely use this set to maintain every few days. if you&#x27;re used to whitening products and aren&#x27;t a wimp like me, then yes, it works, because even the on-again-off-again one-a-day schedule I&#x27;m doing is showing an improvement, in both whitening and the way my gums feel. The healthy-mouth part of this is working I realize, hard to tell the first few days.</li>
            <li> I eagerly looked forward to trying this product after receiving it to test. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I believed using two products would make a difference...it did! My mouth felt cleaner after the first use. After using the dual system for a weeks my mouth/teeth felt cleaner, healthier longer throughout the day. I woke up without feeling I needed to run and brush my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I did notice a modest amount of whitening but not anything bold or significant.&lt;br /&gt;The taste and texture of both products is appropriate and pleasant, not too overpowering. The interesting part of the process is my lips and mouth do not feel dry after brushing as they sometimes do with other toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;My only question is do the 2 products together cause the healthier cleaner feeling or is it the fact that now I am brushing double the total time? The answer does not matter to me as I am very pleased with the results and will continue to use both HD products.</li>
            <li> I got to try this product out for free from Crest-Using two toothpastes is definitely weird at first, but after getting used to the two steps, I can say I am a huge fan of this new toothpaste. The first paste really cleans and the second gel whitens. Multi-benefit and great results. My teeth are whiter than they would be with just regular whitening toothpaste! I&#x27;m a fan and I am a teeth obsessed! I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> A simple two step process will lead you to a healthier and cleaner mouth. Crest has out done themselves with this new process. Who doesn&#x27;t want a fresh breath with whiter teeth. I highly recommend this great duo. You are just two steps away.</li>
            <li> I received Crest® 3D White™ Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free as a promo from Bzz Agent.  I was asked to try and review it.  It is an easy two-step system.  Brush with step one for one minute, then brush with step two for an additional minute, easy enough.  The first few days was extremely painful from brushing with step one.  It seem to have irritated my gums to the point it was almost unbearable to brush!  I pushed through the pain and I have to say I am glad I did.  Although I haven’t seen much change in the shade, my teeth feel extremely clean all day!!  I can say that I have noticed the stains lightening up a b it.  I will continue to use the product to see if there is any more change in shade.  I am a heavy tea and coffee drinker so it may take a bit more time to see any change.  I would give it 3 1/2 stars but I can&#x27;t so 3 it is.</li>
            <li> I have been trying this product for a few weeks and notice a subtle difference. I am thinking however, that everyone is different as I have heard better and worse results from others. I do know that I don&#x27;t mind the taste, and I don&#x27;t mind doing 2 steps. I will use mine until it is gone, but that will likely be it. I don&#x27;t see myself buying this again. I would like to thank Crest ant BzzAgent for the opportunity to try this :-)</li>
            <li> I got Crest Pro Health HD free to try thanks to Crest.  The product worked well to whiten my teeth a little after a 7 day period.  I wouldn&#x27;t use this as a daily toothpaste as it requires 2 separate toothpastes.  I would use this to make my teeth whiter every couple months. The first agent tastes like wint-o-green lifesavers, and left my mouth feeling dry.  The second agent was a gel which reversed the dry sensation, and had no taste.</li>
            <li> I am trying this sample for free thanks to crest however all opinions are my own.  I am used to a more pronounced flavor of toothpaste, but when I tried this the flavor was more mellow and I actually really liked it alot.  You can still feel your mouth getting clean without being overpowered.  My teeth seem to be whiter too and that is a huge plus.  I do not want to spend thousands of dollars at the dentist to try and keep my teeth white so this is a much cheaper option.  What I didn&#x27;t like, but can understand is that you have to brush for what seems like a really long time and there are two parts to this system.  I know I really should be brushing longer but you know the deal we are all in a hurry these days and don&#x27;t seem to take the time we need on the important stuff.  I feel this one is important.  These teeth have to last me my whole life and to keep them healthy and white is what matters to me, and this is stuff is the bomb.  Use as directed and it will actually work for you.</li>
            <li> I recently received a free trial of Crest Pro-Health HD two step toothpaste from BzzAgent on behalf of Crest. My teeth have a bit of surface staining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was a bit skeptical about the effectiveness of an over the counter whiting system. My teeth are sensitive, and I have had issues with whiting products before. Crest Pro-Health two step far exceeded my expectations. I did not have any sensitivity issues with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that the 1st step product did feel grittier than toothpaste I am used to, but it was not bad, just different. After using the product for seven days, my teeth were visibly whiter. I have nothing but good things to say about the product, and highly recommend it to anyone with teeth sensitivities looking for a whiting product. For only a total of 4 minutes of time per day, it makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li> I got this product free from Crest and I love it!  I will definitely buy it in the future.  My teeth feel really good after I brush.  They looked whiter within a few days of starting using it.  I did feel a bit sore for a couple of days and thought I would have to discontinue.  I stuck with it though and it went away.  I think it was actually the plaque at the gum line being removed.  I have a cleaning next month and I think I am going to get a great report!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this toothpaste when I got it free to try from Crest and BzzAgent. Unfortunately I have not noticed a difference in my teeth after using it for 3+ weeks, and for the hassle of going through the two-step process every morning, I expected more. Not to mention the fact that the second step of the process tastes kind of gross and not refreshing like toothpaste should be. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This two-step system is unlike anything I&#x27;ve ever used before! I love that the whitening is part of a system because it&#x27;s easier to make into a habit.  It takes some adjusting since I&#x27;m not used to having 2 tubes and taking more time to brush.  I also HATE that you can&#x27;t rinse between step 1 and 2.  My mouth feels very fresh and minty clean after brushing.  I haven&#x27;t personally noticed a huge difference in whiteness but I also didn&#x27;t take before and after pictures like some others.  I was able to test this product free thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li> My teeth definitely feel cleaner longer with using this Crest HD.  I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth are whiter, but it doesn&#x27;t work any better or worse than others with stains on bonded / capped teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*product provided to me free of charge to review.  All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Got this as a free trial from Crest then also bought another on my own so my wife could use it.  It works really well.  A little bit of a pain at first to stop brushing halfway through but it&#x27;s worth the results. It has definitely whitened my teeth.  It costs less than having to buy whitening toothpaste, whitening mouthwash, and whitening strips.  It seems to have done the job better than all of those combined. Would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference in just 5 days of use!! I can honestly say that this is one of the BEST products I have used in a long time that has amazing results. You really should give it a try</li>
            <li> This product is better than most I have tried</li>
            <li> I was able to try Crest Pro Health® HD™ for free from Crest and I love the results.  While the first step leaves your mouth feeling gritty (you instinctively want to rinse after this step, but don&#x27;t!), it&#x27;s quickly smoothed away during Step 2.  My teeth look whiter and brighter after just two weeks and my mouth feels cleaner than when I brush with &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpaste.  I&#x27;m anxious to see my dentist to show him the results.  Loving the newer, whiter smile that I&#x27;m getting, two minutes at a time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product four stars because I would prefer a one step process simply for convenience. With that being said the product delivers what it claims in terms of whitening, plaque reduction, and freshening breath. I have sensitive teeth and have not noted any issues as I have with other whitening products on the market. I have used this product for a week now and honestly I cannot comment as yet as to whether or not my tooth sensitivity has improved. I cannot speak on the gingivitis as well as I have healthy teeth and gums. I did note that the tooth paste is more of a gel in terms of density, so be careful when first opening and using so you do not squeeze too much of the product out. I also noted that there is a definite heavy peroxide after taste but quickly subsides after rinsing in step 2. All and all I am pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable trusted brand to whiten your teeth and promote a healthier smile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week now, as I got to try it free, thanks to Crest. I have weird pockets of discoloration on my teeth (mottling), so I am not brave enough to include a before/after of my smile. Plus, I&#x27;ve been trained by dentists to realize that OTC whitening products will only help me so much. However, I do (after brushing 2x per day, for 1 week) notice some improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, there are also many more benefits to this product than the whitening. The clean feeling I get from using step 1 of this product alone is so close to the &amp;#34;just left the dentist&amp;#34; clean feeling. I think the price for these two products is pretty fair, so I&#x27;d definitely consider using it as a part of my oral health longer-term.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t want to have a clean and bright smile with white teeth?  I am the first to admit that I am willing to try anything and even extra money to get my teeth white and Crest&#x27;s new Pro Health HD sure does what it promises.  It is an innovative way to get a brighter smile without having to use any of the inconvenient strips, trays or overnight treatments that often produce minimal results.  Thanks to BzzAgent I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to try the new toothpaste for the past three weeks and have been more than pleased with it.  I actually noticed a difference within a few days and my teeth are only getting whiter.  I thought teeth could only feel this clean when leaving the dentist, but after using this toothpaste, I feel as if I just left my dentist&#x27;s office.  I also have sensitive teeth and have never had success with whitening strips or the trays that you leave in you mouth for 30 minutes at a time because they always hurt my teeth.  However, this new toothpaste and whitening gel combo did not cause any irritation.  The only downside and why I only gave it four stars is that there is 4.0 oz of toothpaste, but only 2.3 oz of the whitening gel.  The instructions say to use the whitening gel right after the toothpaste, so if you don&#x27;t ration out the whitening gel correctly you&#x27;ll be left with extra toothpaste once you run out of whitening gel.</li>
            <li> I have some porcelain veneers so when I was given the opportunity to use this product for free from Crest. I told my husband it was OK for him to try it out instead of me - he asked me, I didn&#x27;t ask him BTW.  He works with the public and government officials.  A lot of face time with people.  We started with a day 1 photo and after another week, a new one.  I really didn&#x27;t think it would be much different because I see him every day but seeing the difference after one week - oh yes, big difference.  I use it too because I like the way it makes my mouth and teeth feel clean.  It doesn&#x27;t do much for &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; teeth but the real stuff - it is GREAT.  We are 2 weeks into it and they are even better than the first week.  I&#x27;ll post the first two photos so you can see the difference.  I&#x27;ve gotten him many other teeth whiteners but he said this by far is the easiest.  Brush for one minute with the first step, another minute with the second.  Really nice fresh breath that lasts and his teeth are looking good.  We will use this again for sure and it can only get better after another week based on what we saw after only one week.</li>
            <li> I was given this product free to try by Crest through the website BzzAgent and at first I was skeptical of using 2 different tubes to brush my teeth everyday. I have a young baby and a super busy life, adding an extra step to my daily routine is not always easy. However, when I saw that you only brush with each step for 1 minute I realized that it takes maybe 5 extra seconds over traditional toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a 2 step process, the first tube they say is what brushes away plaque and cleans your teeth. This step has the taste and consistency of your average toothpaste. I was caught a little off guard though that the warnings on this tube explain that some of the ingredients could cause white spots that your dentist could remove. However, after using for 2 weeks, I&#x27;ve seen no extra staining. I imagine this is rare and the warning also says you can help avoid them by thoroughly brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2nd step is a clear gel with a slight bitter taste although it&#x27;s barely noticeable. The consistency reminds me of hair gel. This is the &amp;#34;polishing and whitening&amp;#34; step. This gel produces no foam, it&#x27;s just gently spread over your teeth. I brushed in small circles during this step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial thought when I was finished the first time was &amp;#34;wow, my teeth feel crazy smooth!&amp;#34;- a feeling that I continue to notice after every time I use this 2 step process. By the 2nd time I used it I could definitely tell a difference in whitening. By the end of the first week, I saw a very marked difference. I am a HEAVY coffee drinker and as a result I usually see light staining at the corners of my bottom front teeth and slight brown lines on the backside of my bottom front teeth. After that first week I was checking the staining and there are NO brown lines on the backside of my teeth and the slight yellow at the corners of the bottom &amp;#34;canine&amp;#34; teeth is barely visible. I have a dentist appointment in 2 weeks and I think they will be pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The only down fall to this (besides the possibility of leaving white spots) would be that I experienced increased sensitivity in my teeth after the 2nd or 3rd time using it. After the initial week of using only this, I started switching it up and using it every other day. I have sensitive teeth usually anyway so it may just be a side effect of people who already have that condition as my husband who does not experience sensitivity said he felt no difference. Although he had a bit of a hard time adjusting to not &amp;#34;rinsing&amp;#34; after the first step before starting the 2nd step. I&#x27;m not sure what happens if you do rinse between steps but the directions instruct you to just spit after 1 minute of brushing with the 1st step and then you add the 2nd step (the clear gel) and continue brushing for 1 more minute. Since you are supposed to brush for 2 minutes with regular toothpaste, this was not cumbersome, adding unnecessarily to your brushing time. Like I mentioned earlier, MAYBE an extra 5 seconds to add step 2 to your toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a product I&#x27;m probably going to incorporate into my regular regimen, probably using it at night every other day. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend./&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The only down fall to this (besides the possibility of leaving white spots) would be that I experienced increased sensitivity in my teeth after the 2nd or 3rd time using it.

            <li> I really wanted to love this, but I had to stop using it because it was tearing up my gums with its abrasive material. Although it did make my teeth feel cleaner, I can&#x27;t necessarily say they were whiter because I only used it for 5 days. It caused my teeth and gums to hurt a lot, and I couldn&#x27;t stand it, so unfortunately I needed to stop using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: product received for free to try from Crest</li>
            <li> I received sample of Crest Pro Health HD for free to try through BzzAgent. I decided to use Crest Pro Health HD for a few days before I wrote this review. The product boasts 6x healthier and whiter teeth in a week.&lt;br /&gt;First, let me comment on the packaging. &amp;#34;Regular&amp;#34; toothpaste comes in a rectangular box with a smaller footprint than this toothpaste comes in. Due in part to the two packages of toothpaste instead of the normal one. Also, the packaging makes the product stand out, with a masculine-looking blue packaging scheme. However, I did find the box a bit hard to open, even with the pull tab on one of the corners. I feel that perhaps the packaging could be easier to open and maybe a bit smaller.&lt;br /&gt;Second, taste and effect. Since this is a two step process, brushing will take twice as long as before, but I didn&#x27;t really notice this too much. Step 1, the cleanser, has a nice wintergreen-type flavor.I like the Crest alcohol free mouthwash. I was highly concerned when I saw all the negative reviews that there must be something wrong with me. But it tastes great and doesn&#x27;t burn.  I like this because I don&#x27;t really like the peppermint-type flavor of a lot of other toothpastes. It also felt a bit grainier than other toothpastes, but maybe this is because I couldn&#x27;t rinse after I brushed. Step 2 is a polisher, a gel paste. This gel had a very medicinal flavor which I didn&#x27;t find pleasant, but it wasn&#x27;t off-putting too much. It also had that mouthburn type of reaction that you might get with a strong mouthwash. After finishing with Step 2, you can rinse. I just rinse with some water and my mouth does indeed feel fresher and cleaner after I brush with this product. I haven&#x27;t noticed, however, if my teeth are whiter, so I might give the product more time to see if I can notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I received at free sample of Crest Pro-Health HD from BzzAgent.  I have been using it for a few weeks and can not get over the fact of how much the toothpaste drys out my mouth.  I usually use Crest with scope and don&#x27;t have this problem.  I have not seen much of a change in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference. Got it free thanks to @BzzAgent and Crest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for the last 2 weeks and I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely not your average toothpaste...and the results are phenomenal!&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive teeth and I&#x27;m impressed with this gentle alternative to whitening strips. I haven&#x27;t experienced any sensitivity at all after using the product 2 times a day for 2 weeks, yet my teeth are noticably whiter and brighter. Compated to whitening strips I also find this system much quicker and easier and just as effective.&lt;br /&gt;What I love most about the 2 part system is that my mouth feels so much fresher for a lot longer than I&#x27;ve ever experienced with other toothpastes. For this system, You brush with the step 1(plaque remover) for 1 minute and then you spit (don&#x27;t rinse!) and follow up with step 2, the whitener &amp; polisher. Once I do this routine &amp; floss at night I wake up the next morning feeling like I just brushed my teeth! My husband was so impressed he took my kit &amp; now I have to stock up again! Amazon has great pricing on this kit if you&#x27;re shopping around.&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky enough to try this free as a Bzzagent, and I will definitely continue to purchase it in the future! Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This is such a simple and easy way to whiten and brush your teeth at once! It takes 3 minutes, as opposed to a typical 15-20 minute for whitening gel strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first tube is your &amp;#34;plaque stripping&amp;#34; paste... it brushes your teeth clean. You immediately follow up with tube 2, the whitening gel. You brush for another minute and then rinse clean. Simple as that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few days, I was already noticing results. I have sensitive teeth, but this product hasn&#x27;t bothered my teeth nor my gums at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got to try this as part of a BzzAgent Campaign, meaning i got it for free. However, I will absolutely be purchasing it on my own as soon as my sample runs out. Definitely check this out!</li>
            <li> I received my trial of Crest Pro Health® HD for free from Crest and am happy i chose to participate in this program.&lt;br /&gt;It is a two step process that is quite easy to use and takes no more time than normal brushing.&lt;br /&gt;You first brush your teeth with  step one  then just spit it out, no rinsing at this point. You use the second product which is a polisher.&lt;br /&gt;At first i wasn&#x27;t sure about the way my mouth felt but it did feel extra clean. I had no gum issues and after using this product I can see a difference which i am quite happy with. I plan to continue using Crest Pro Health® HD but perhaps only a couple days a week instead of twice a day.</li>
            <li> Leaves teeth and gums feeling really clean. I have noticed some whitening effects but it is early days yet . I have only used it 4 times.</li>
            <li> I received a set of the Crest HD free from Crest to try it.  I actually really like it.  It is a two step process but it is really only one extra minute morning and night.  Not a big deal.  The first tube is the toothpaste that does a really great job of cleaning my teeth.  They feel really smooth all day.  I know some other toothpastes claim to do this but Crest HD really does.  My teeth are not getting fuzzy and I have been eating candy some days, which usually does it.  My breath also seems fresher.  The second tube is the whitener and polisher and I really think that my teeth are getting a little whiter.  They were getting a little yellow since my last whitening and this has definitely brightened them up.  I think it is necessary to have the second step because the hydrogen peroxide can stay by itself and not react with anything else until you are ready for it to do its job.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this. Just after the first use I noticed a great change in the color of my teeth. After the first week of regular brushing, twice a day, a lot of people started noticing how white my teeth were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought it would be a hassle of incorporate a two step process for brushing my teeth, but it&#x27;s really not that inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no clue if it makes all that much of a difference but I brush with a sonic care brush. Alone the brush works really well, combine it with this toothpaste and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest Pro Health HD twice per day for about the last four weeks (I received it for free as part of a BzzAgent word-of-mouth marketing program). From first brush, my teeth felt clean and my mouth refreshed. And about a week in, I had a regular cleaning with my dentist who said my teeth looked great - though with only a week of use, I&#x27;m not sure how much of my passing marks could be attributed to the toothpaste (though I had been using Crest Complete Multi-Benefit previously, of which I am a big fan). Over time, I haven&#x27;t noticed any further improvements. My mouth doesn&#x27;t feel necessarily healthier (though, admittedly, that would be tough for me to gauge by feel) and my teeth don&#x27;t look particularly whiter. Additionally, I don&#x27;t like the taste of the whitening gel (almost saccharin) and a two-step process is really annoying with an electric toothbrush. Previously, I&#x27;d brush in four quadrants for 30 seconds each. Now, I brush in each quadrant for 15 seconds, twice. Plus, I have to stop in the middle to add the gel. Brushing my teeth is already a chore - why make it more difficult? TLDR; makes my mouth feel good, but the inconvenience of using with an electric toothbrush means I won&#x27;t continue to use it once it&#x27;s done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I was not sure what to expect when I first got the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste from Crest to try for free. I&#x27;ve been a long-term Crest user and enjoy the Crest Pro-Health brand, but truthfully, I could not see the point of buying what was probably just a more expensive product in the brand to do the same thing. Now I can say I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth have long been a thorn in my side. I am a mouth breather and the dentist is always yelling at me as it affects my teeth and gums. No matter how much I brush my teeth, I still wind up with plaque and calcium build-up on and around my teeth. Which in turn leads to a lecture and some yelling, and that just makes me dislike going there. As I said above, I&#x27;ve used Pro-Health for some time, but always the regular products of the line. And I thought that was as good as it was going to get. After trying the new HD Daily-Two Step Toothpaste, I can see how wrong I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That first night that I brushed, I could feel a difference in the feeling of my teeth. They had that squeaky feeling I always associate with visiting the dentist and have a cleaning done, something I&#x27;ve never had with my regular toothpaste. Each use has continued bringing that clean feeling and my mouth feels fresher. The only downside is this toothpaste does seem to make my gums bleed more than regular toothpaste, but I&#x27;ve also read that that means it&#x27;s working on healing them and it&#x27;s something one should expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have to give this four stars though because while it definitely is giving my mouth a cleaner and healthier feeling, the whitening isn&#x27;t doing what I expected it to. While my teeth aren&#x27;t as dull, they just don&#x27;t seem any whiter. But in the long run, a healthier mouth is more important to me than whiter teeth, and so it gets four stars.</li>
            <li> I received this from BzzAgent and LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!!  I&#x27;ve used the white strips and these are more effective and not nearly as time consuming.  Only 6 days 2x a day and the difference is NOTICEABLE.  My husband is hooked now too and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  The taste is fine and there&#x27;s no sensitivity like I had with the strips.  I&#x27;m sold</li>
            <li> Full disclosure, I received this as a free promotion from the brand.&lt;br /&gt;While Crest HD isn&#x27;t a BAD product, it just isn&#x27;t right for me. I find the 2 step process a bit too time consuming for my rushed mornings. I also find the price a bit of a turn off. (though much cheaper that whitening strips). I also did not think I saw much difference in the whiteness of my teeth. I do have some veneers that cannot be lightened so I try not to use whitening products much, in fear I&#x27;ll end up with a mouth of bright white teeth with 2 dingy looking front teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good: it does feel like you just walked out of your dentist office. My teeth feel super smooth and polished after using it. I am not sure how healthy this is in the long run though.</li>
            <li> Used exactly as recommended for three weeks.Too much hassel for the results. I&#x27;ll go back to regular toothpaste for a third the cost.</li>
            <li> Only have used the toothpaste for 1 week and already can see that my teeth whiter. cheap compared to some other whiting toothpastes.</li>
            <li> As a Bzzagent, I got the chance to try Crest HD and love it!!!  Although it doesn&#x27;t whiten overnight like the whitening kits, it is a lot easier to use since all you are doing is brushing your teeth.  I can see a significant difference in my teeth and there is the added bonus that it freshens my breath and makes my teeth healthier by destroying plaque!  Looking forward to my next checkup!</li>
            <li> I got this for free as a part of my Bzz Agent kit and I LOVE IT! It&#x27;s so much easier than the whitening strips, since  it doesn&#x27;t require you to do what you aren&#x27;t already doing by brushing your teeth daily. This is so much better than other whitening toothpaste; it really makes my teeth whiter, cleaner and more polished! Definitely worth the price! Only problem is I have sensitive gums so if I use this twice a day for too long I start to get cuts along my gums. So I switched to using this before bed and another toothpaste in the morning.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really see a difference after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> not for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Disclosure: I got a set for free to try and review.  That being said, this really did make my teeth feel clean.  The second part tasted just like what my dentist uses and my teeth felt cleaner than just regular brushing.  I can&#x27;t tell that my teeth are any whiter, since I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough, but it&#x27;s a simple change and my teeth definitely felt nicer.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for a week.  I do think it whitens; however, for faster whitening, I would recommend the Crest Whitestrips.  There are two steps to complete the process of whitening and cleaning your teeth which should be done twice a day for the best results.  The product comes in two separate tubes. Tube 1 is the purifying cleanser.  To me, I love the taste. It reminds me of spearmint Lifesavers I used to eat all the time.  Tube 2 is the perfecting gel that does the whitening and polishing. Tube number 2 is cumbersome and needs a flip top cap like tube number 1. The cap for tube 2 has to be screwed on and off.  I like the product and it works, but the process takes time.  As far as it making your teeth 6 times whiter,  I have not seen that much difference in the shade of white that my teeth are.  I would say my teeth are only a couple shades whiter.  It may be that I need to continue this process for a few more weeks to see the real benefit.  Thank you to Crest for letting me test this product for free as a promotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Crest user from way back so I was so jazzed to try the Crest Pro Health HD system. I&#x27;m on Day 1 and this is the only time I have ever managed to get the &amp;#34;super dentist clean&amp;#34; feeling at home! Pretty excited about this process!</li>
            <li> I used this product because I received it free as part of a bzzagent campaign.  I have not used Crest in the past because I&#x27;ve always felt it makes my mouth feel too sugary.  Not so with Crest Pro Health HD.  It makes my mouth feel clean and fresh.  The two steps feel slightly unnecessary, but I have to say, I like the way I feel after using it.  I have not noticed a huge difference in the whiteness of my teeth, but my teeth were pretty white already.  Overall, I&#x27;d recommend trying it out.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when I first tried Crest Pro-Health HD but I have to say the results are pretty impressive! Especially the fresh feeling you get after the first use. My teeth felt SO clean!!! Just like after a dental cleaning! I have been using it for a few days but my teeth are already getting whiter. It doesn&#x27;t require any more time than your usual brushing so it will fit perfectly in your busy routine.&lt;br /&gt;I got to try this product for free thanks to Crest and Bzzagent, and I&#x27;m glad I did because I was able to discover a quality product! I will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> Trying it free courtesy of BzzAgent and Crest. I like the new Crest ProHealth HD, because I feel like it has caused my teeth to get extra clean, become smoother, and helped me have a shiny smile. It does get a little tedious to have to do two steps, but I figure in the long run it will be well worth it. The taste and smell are pleasant also. I have noticed a difference and I&#x27;ve been using it for around 5-6 days!</li>
            <li> I got this product for free on Buzzagent.com, and I absolutely loved using Crest Pro Health HD! It not only made my mouth feel clean, but made my smile whiter! Love it!</li>
            <li> My mouth feels great!  I was excited to get to try the Crest Pro Health HD system for free thanks to Crest.  It&#x27;s a 2 paste &amp; gel system and the instructions are easy to follow.  The total length of brushing doesn&#x27;t change, you just take a quick spit halfway and add the step 2 gel to your brush and continue brushing for another minute.  My mouth and teeth feel so clean and fresh after brushing it is a noticeable difference.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a change in color yet (I really wish I took before pictures!) but my smile seems brighter.</li>
            <li> I was initially not very confident on the outcome but after trying it I was simply impressed.  I honestly didn&#x27;t think it was possible for my mouth to feel this clean just from brushing my teeth.  It was just a 2 minute job and the outcome was just fantastic. It was as good as professional cleaning.  My wife made a comment on the first day itself that my teeth are brighter and whiter.  I am not going to my old paste now.  I feel this is a great product for perfect oral hygiene. Thanks BzzAgent for sending this as a free item to me for trying.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! I can definitely notice the difference in whitening from this toothpaste, even more so than other whitening toothpastes. And, the best part is, it doesn&#x27;t take any extra time! It&#x27;s simple to use, and I noticed results within a week.</li>
            <li> When I first received this kit I was a little nervous as I have super sensitive teeth and I was afraid that this system would cause pain in my teeth. I also read some reviews on Amazon and had read some similar things. I decided to give it a try anyways. If it hurt then I would stop using and my husband could benefit from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using 1 time a day (at night) and I have experienced no tooth sensitivity in the past week and a half. My husband actually told me he sees a difference in the whiteness of my teeth so I would have to give high praise for this product. I think I will continue to hold off only using once a day, but the results thus far have been great. Thank you Crest for letting me try this item for free as a part of BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim, and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I&#x27;m a coffee/wine drinker so my teeth are not the brightest they should be..but with 2 days of this I was shocked at how much whiter my teeth were. It&#x27;s been a week and it looks like I used the whitestrips!&lt;br /&gt;It makes your teeth feel squeaky clean.. But the only down fall is the 2 step system..a little time&lt;br /&gt;Consuming but to me very worth it.</li>
            <li> gotten this item when it was initially listed, it went for $45&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t work jack much, despicable now it&#x27;s just $13</li>
            <li> after two weeks,it works！</li>
            <li> So, I tried a new Crest Pro Health product through BzzAgent, and if you are looking to have a super clean mouth, you should try it! Crest Pro Health HD promises a brighter smile in 6 days. I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference in the whiteness of my teeth, but I did feel like I had a much cleaner mouth after each brush! Crest Pro Health HD is a two-step process. Step 1 cleans your teeth and Step 2 is supposed to do the whitening. After brushing with Step 1, my teeth feels cleaner, but the toothpaste leaves a gritty feeling on your teeth since you aren&#x27;t supposed to to rinse until after Step 2. It&#x27;s pretty much a basic toothpaste and gets the job done. Step 2 is actually what makes my mouth feel super clean. Maybe it&#x27;s because of the whitening chemicals?? I don&#x27;t know, but after I brush with Step 2, my teeth and mouth feel amazing! The only real con I noticed was that the toothpaste made the corners of my mouth a little sore, dry and cracked, kind of like any type of whitening can do. Maybe I brushed for too long or something, because I am sure that it could be prevented. Like I said, after 6 days, I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference, but my teeth are already pretty white. I wonder how they will look after another week!</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro-Health HD to review from Crest and have been using it for a few weeks now. I absolutely love it and definitely prefer it to whiten my teeth over whitening strips. It works just as well to whiten my teeth and the perks here are that it&#x27;s much faster, only 2 minutes in the morning and 2 minutes in the evening, plus you can whiten your entire mouth, not just the front teeth where the strips are applied. My mouth feels really fresh and clean after using this system and I really did notice a difference in the brightness of my smile after just the first use. I still have a lot of product left after probably 3 weeks of use so you get a lot of bang for your buck, too. Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Overall this product only accomplished half the job.  After 2 weeks of brushing twice daily with this product I didn&#x27;t notice any change in the shade of my teeth.  Also, both steps (especially step 2) have a pretty strong taste of artificial sweetener.  The positive aspect was that my teeth did feel especially clean after brushing, which lasted until I woke up in the morning.  Not sure that the extra clean feeling was worth the 2-step brushing process.</li>
            <li> I received this as part of a bzz kit and have to admit I was hopeful but not overly optimistic.  The 2 step process worried me a bit, I hate to add too much extra time.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  The whole process only takes a couple minutes which isn&#x27;t much beyond what I normally do.  It&#x27;s not an overwhelmingly minty flavor which I do tend to prefer and it doesn&#x27;t really foam up, but, my mouth did feel extremely clean.  My teeth felt so smooth, like after a visit to the dentist.  I can&#x27;t say I noticed a huge change in the whiteness.  But I was satisfied with this product overall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan, I love this system, because it has given me a lot of power over the cleaning of my mouth, and that I really feel a seense of ownership. It&#x27;s made my teeth healthier and whiter already! Thanks crest and Bzzagent for the freebie! I love using it!</li>
            <li> I received the Crest Pro-Health HD Toothpaste for free and was asked to review it. When I received the product, I was not very impressed with the flimsy packaging, but though hey it was free I best give it a try. Am I ever happy I did. I have never used a teeth whitening product before, as I was told they just taste nasty. What a pleasant surprise - the first step is a minty winter green flavor with a very minute amount of grit in it. It polished my teeth, and they were SO smooth after the first use. They did however have a dry sensation and you are not to rinse in-between steps. The second tube is the whitening stage. It is a clear jell with from what I can tell no flavor. Which is perfectly fine as you do not rinse the mint out from step one. Within 2 uses I could see my teeth becoming more white. I have now used the product for two weeks and WOW! I have the smile of a star! My gums feel healthier, my teeth are becoming plaque free and my smile is sparkling. I am a coffee and diet soda drinker, and the light brown staining seems to be disappearing more and more after every use. Thanks Crest for coming out not only with my favorite toothpaste (Crest with Scope), but now a teeth whitening product I will always have on hand.</li>
            <li> Crest HD smile is exactly what this paste will you with.  I was a skeptic at first since this was a two step system thinking it was going to take more time than I wanted to add to my routing but realized it actually didn&#x27;t take much time at all to not only protect your teeth the way you normally wood with toothpaste but to also whiten with the gel.  I would&#x27;ve never tried this on my own without getting this for free to test out through Bzzagent.  I even got my husband to test it out.  And we both agree that it does leave your teeth glossy and gleaming bright.  I do appreciate that it also did not leave my teeth sensitive the way whitening strips do.  I would&#x27;ve give this five stars but I took a star off because I felt that this would have been better if step 2, the whitening gel was a flip cap.  Step one is a flip cap, but step two is a twist off and once you have already started brushing your teeth you need to get your hands dry to get the cap off.</li>
            <li> I got Crest Pro Health HD to try free through BzzAgent.  It&#x27;s the first two-step product I have tried.  I had just whitened my teeth with Crest Strips so they were looking pretty white before I started with this product.  I will say, this toothpaste has maintained my whitened teeth and I am a daily coffee drinker.  I was having to use the strips monthly.  My teeth felt very clean and smooth but I&#x27;m not sure that the benefits outweight the hassle of the two steps.  You have to use the first step for one minute and then spit but don&#x27;t rinse and then use the second for the next minute.  I use this product with my Sonicare, which keeps track of my brushing time for me, but I think it&#x27;s just a little bit of a hassle to have to use two products.  I&#x27;ll continue to use this until it&#x27;s empty, but I&#x27;m not sure I will buy again.  Time will tell.</li>
            <li> Speaking with friends about teeth whitening I told them that if they can bear the taste/aftertaste of peroxide in their mouths morning and evening, then go for it. Although it works I did not enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> You should know at a high level this product does work better than most toothpaste if your looking for whiter and cleaner feeling teeth.  I think Crest has the right idea with this product but advertising 6x whiter teeth seems like a bit of a stretch.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a bit over 2 1/2 weeks now and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen those results.  That said, I do think my teeth are slightly whiter.  Maybe it will take some more time.  I also believe they feel cleaner overall.  Another downside worth noting is that you need to switch out tooth paste 1/2 way through the routine.  It just gets a bit annoying doing that every day, twice a day.</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent and Crest I got to try this for free, but these opinions are my own.  First, I have to say I love how easy this is to use especially on a regular basis although you do have to get used to not rinsing between the two step process.  Secondly, I do feel a difference in how my teeth feel after brushing where they feel much smoother and cleaner than a lot of other toothpastes i have used.  It&#x27;s also another benefit that i think this product is good for sensitive teeth because I have sensitive teeth and have no problem using this product.  However I think the biggest con is I don&#x27;t feel this product whitens significantly the first time you use it or even after using it for awhile.  I do think this product would be good for maintaining whiter teeth since it seemed to help me from making new stains which is good because I am an avid tea drinker.  Overall, I would recommend this product on a regular basis but I think to have even whiter teeth another product could be used first.  But, it&#x27;s also the best product to use if you are looking for the quickest way to whiten teeth since 2 minutes is significantly shorter than the usual 60 minutes.</li>
            <li> I received a full size sample of this as a member of bzzagent.  I have been trying to whiten my smile for what seems like forever.  I really wish i took a before picture.  I truly believe my teeth are whiter!  I am happier to smile wide now.  This is a 2 step process, which i was like, ugh, who has time in the morning for one more thing.  First you brush and &amp;#34;exfoliate&amp;#34; your teeth then don&#x27;t rinse and use the whitening toothpaste.  very easy and I do believe it works.  I really didn&#x27;t taste much for the whitening paste, which is good since most don&#x27;t taste that great! awesome.  I will buy it again.  I even told my dentist about it</li>
            <li> Im having a great time using this system that I got for free thanks to Crest. I have tried another product and it involved using a tray and a gel that stung if it got on your gums. This is so easy because all your doing is brushing! So far I have seen some difference in my teeth and gum lines. Dont know how long your supposed to use the system but I can see it being an every 6 month type of deal.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first tried this. I mean really.... 2 bottles? Well I&#x27;ll tell you that ONE use and I could see a HUGE difference!! I have never seen a difference in anything with one application. Even my 11 year old son keeps taking it upstairs. I had to buy one for him. If an 11 year old wants it and says it works what does that tell you?!?!?? try it for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps I did get this free to try from Buzz agent to try and post a review on Amazon. -</li>
            <li> Before trying the Crest Pro Health HD; my teeth were quite yellow to the point I didn&#x27;t really like to smile that much. Even when taking picture, I would usually smile with my mouth closed. After trying this product, I was AMAZED at how white my teeth turned out to be. It definitely gave me more confidence to smile all the time. Thanks Crest for letting me try this out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a busy mom and at the thought of a two step process I was like oh boy however it was quite a quick process and the the sensation was actually quite pleasant. After the first use I felt and saw a difference it was absolutely amazing my teeth felt as if I just finished having a cleaning by the dental hygienist are you kidding! me that silky smooth run your tongue over your teeth feeling after brushing my teeth with a regular toothbrush not even my sonic brush I was floored after only 3 times I saw and significant change in color and I am a coffee drinking night nurse so this was a very pleasant surprise.  Even my 12 year old who does not sugarcoat anything noticed and commented on my teeth now that&#x27;s saying something</li>
            <li> I have been using the Crest Pro Health HD system religiously for about 6 weeks and honestly, I can&#x27;t say that I really see any noticeable difference over using my regular Crest products (Generally a Crest Pro-Health w/Senstivity user).  I did receive the product as part of a Buzz Agent campaign and I was really excited to give it a try, but overally not impressed.  The process is a bit cumbersome given that you brush with the regular gel for 1 minute followed by the whitening gel for another minute (granted using a sonicare with a timer helps) but then you end up getting toothpaste everywhere by handling the bottles after brushing, etc.  For me, it&#x27;s not worth the effort especially given that I am not seeing any noticeable whitening occurring and I have used the whole product at least twice daily.</li>
            <li> I got to try this brand for free as a buzz agent.  I normally wouldn&#x27;t spend this much on toothpaste so it&#x27;s my only disappointment.  I didn&#x27;t notice a huge whitening effect but did have a noticeably cleaner smile.  After switching back a couple days to crest paste toothpaste, my teeth felt grimy by the end of the day where the HD clean lasts!!  I notice a squeaky sound while I brush.  Some reviews noted brown spots on the teeth, I have experienced none.  I&#x27;d also recommend the Oral B toothbrush with the rubber circles in the middle to use in conjunction with the paste.</li>
            <li> I recieved this as part of a promotion to try the product. This however did not affect my opinion and results. After using the Crest Pro Health HD I was very impressed with how it managed to whiten my teeth. I&#x27;ve never used whitening product because to be honest I had no interest but due to my bad habits my teeth had yellowed sigficantly. This toothpaste defenitly made a difference. My wife noticed right away! I managed to go about 2 shades whiter. This would be perfect for someone maintaining a whitening. Even with my teeth being so stained it managed to whiten...I whitened my teeth with my dentist yesterday and plan to use this from now on. I think it will help get my money&#x27;s worth by maintaining the whitening. This is a great product...2 easy steps to whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> At first it was a bit of a pain brushing with 2 different toothpastes.  But having a sonicare, it&#x27;s easy to tell when 1 minute is up and it&#x27;s time to switch.  The most important thing about the toothpaste though is that I definitely notice my teeth are whiter now.  Not &amp;#34;whitened at the dentist&amp;#34; whiter, but there is definitely a change.  The toothpaste does what it says.  I hadn&#x27;t thought about less morning breath until now, but I do thin kmy morning breath is less nasty too :)</li>
            <li> Step 1 and Step 2 equals a brighter smile! Its as simple as that. It might seem a bit tough at first but once you get the hang of it you&#x27;ll wonder why you ever brushed your teeth the other way! Once you start step 2 you can feel the difference from other products out there. Keep on brushing with 1 and 2 from Crest Pro Health® HD! Full disclosure, I received the product free as part of a promotion from Crest!</li>
            <li> Granted the two step process takes longer than just using a toothpaste ... BUT, I love the fresh mouth feel. I haven&#x27;t used long enough to see significant whitening, although I think some progress is being made !!!!  Definitely worth a try !!!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest I was able to try this for free through BzzAgent.  I have been using this product for over three week now. I waited to see if there was any noticable color change. What I found with this is the following...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taste is nice, refreshing and minty without the &#x27;fluoride&#x27; taste.&lt;br /&gt;It definitely makes your teeth feel clean and smooth and since you&#x27;re supposed to use each tube for one minute this meets the recommended brushing time of 2 minutes...&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t seem to effect the sensitivity factor like other fluoride products.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that kept me from giving this the full 5 stars is that I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference with whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy brushing!</li>
            <li> I really liked this toothpaste!  I received a free sample of it from BzzAgent and I have been using it for about two weeks and I have really been liking it!  I like that is it two steps, the first step gets your teeth clean and the second step is just for whitening.  I think it makes sense to get all the tarter and plaque off of your teeth before trying to whiten them. I think that&#x27;s more effective than a toothpaste that claims to do both these things at the same time!  This toothpaste makes my mouth feel very clean and leaves a good taste in my mouth.  I have only been using the toothpaste for about 2 weeks so I have only notice a little bit of teeth whitening improvement but I am hopefully for more improvement as I continue to use it!</li>
            <li> As a BzzAgent, I received a free sample of Crest Pro Health HD. The teeth cleansing system is an interesting experience. It is a two-step process. First, you brush with what is basically a &amp;#34;cleanser,&amp;#34; and then without rinsing, you brush with a &amp;#34;whitener.&amp;#34; I am not a huge fan of the Crest &amp;#34;flavor.&amp;#34; This product has an okay flavor.... probably a 3 out of 5. What I really like about the process is how clean it leaves your mouth feeling. However, what I don&#x27;t like is that the toothpaste leaves a strange sensation.... almost like drying your mouth out. That part isn&#x27;t great. I do not think my teeth look much whiter, but they definitely don&#x27;t look worse either.</li>
            <li> Let me preface this with I got the product for free through the company and Bzzagent. For a free product it works great, but I would not pay $13 for it online or in store. The packaging is the coolest part of this product and I love that the tubes are different allowing me to easily distinguish between the two steps. Step One tastes great and I do feel it does the job most any toothpaste would do at getting my teeth clean. Step Two doesn&#x27;t taste like much at all - it is a thin clear gel. The two step process is easy to follow. I like how it gets me to actually brush my teeth for a full two minutes since I am paying attention to the two steps - I am not confident that usually do that. I didn&#x27;t really notice much color change to my teeth. Maybe because my teeth weren&#x27;t so bad to begin with? Its an OK product, I would say if you want to try it once and see for yourself go ahead but personally I will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand and I was really excited to try it out. I mean, who doesn&#x27;t want whiter teeth? I really liked the first step, the toothpaste seemed somehow better than regular toothpaste. It was really hard to remember not to rinse my mouth when I was done with it, but it didn&#x27;t take long for me to get in that routine. At first I didn&#x27;t like the second step very much. I didn&#x27;t like the taste of it and it left white spots on my lip where it touched (like hydrogen peroxide does to your hands sometimes). But it worked really well! I definitely noticed a difference in the whiteness of my teeth. I definitely prefer this 2 step process to using just regular whitening toothpaste. I never saw much of a difference with just toothpaste, but I could feel and see a difference with this!</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of use, and following the directions to the letter, I can confirm that I indeed feel and see a difference. After use my mouth and teeth feel better and very clean - and the feeling lasts for a while. The whitening aspect, while slower to see results, are beginning to become apparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to those looking for a &amp;#34;one-stop shop&amp;#34; for teeth hygiene and appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW: My use of this product was made available for free from Crest - but I&#x27;ll buy it anyway.</li>
            <li> When I first received this product, I was hesitant as this was a two step process.  Brushing my teeth can seem like a pain, despite being a very important health routine, and I was even more skeptical about my free sample of Crest Pro Health® HD™when I saw it was a two step process. Really? Another step to add into my morning routine??? Wrong.  The entire process took literally two minutes and really impressed me after my first use.  Not only did I notice my breath felt fresh and my mouth had an overall cleaner feel, but I could tell my teeth were truly whiter after one application. The best part of my experience so far with Crest Pro Health® HD™? The comments I&#x27;ve been receiving from my friends and family.  They are noticing my teeth are whiter and are begging me to let them in on the secret.  Of course I&#x27;ve let them in, and we all agree that we will never again buy a leading brand toothpaste that claims to &amp;#34;whiten&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;freshen&amp;#34; because they simply do not hold up to their promise like Crest Pro Health® HD™!</li>
            <li> What I like about Crest Pro Health® HD™ is that it is an easy two step system that only takes two minutes (vs. some of the whitening strips that you have to leave on for 30 minutes). You can use the tooth whitening system the way that you use your toothpaste or gel - and I like that it does not foam like crazy (I have an electric toothbrush and some toothpastes go all over the place). First you apply the purifying cleanser for one minute - do NOT rinse with water afterwards! I like the nice minty taste of it. Afterwards you apply the perfecting gel for one minute. I wished the gel was a little bit more minty - but otherwise it is good and does not irritate my gums. I cannot see that my teeth are six times whiter as promised after one week (but I use a good electronic toothbrush that usually removes stains and plaque pretty well) - but my mouth feels clean and healthy without the hassle of whitening strips and normal time involvement as I always brush for two minutes. The cost is lower compared with whitening strips and the system should last approximately two months. I like that you get a full money back guarantee if you do not like it. I am trying it free thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li> I received this system to try for free. It does definitely make your teeth whiter, however I have noticed my teeth/gums are a bit more sensitive since using it. For &amp;#34;toothpaste&amp;#34; it is a little pricey, but as long as I don&#x27;t have continued sensitivity I will definitely keep this in my oral care rotation.</li>
            <li> Overall I really like how clean my teeth feel after using this. Almost the same as after a dentist visit! I don&#x27;t find that it takes much more time than regular brushing, but it really does make my teeth feel polished. As far as whitening, I haven&#x27;t noticed anything amazing there, but I&#x27;m still going to give it some time. My teeth are too sensitive for whitening products like Whitestrips, but I have no adverse reaction to this system, so I will stick with it and see if with time it will have some whitening effects. The best part for me is really the polished feeling, and I look forward to my next dentist visit next month to see if they notice any difference. I received the product as part of a promotion from Crest, and was very happy to try it out. I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Got the opportunity to try this for free with BzzAgent and felt free to offer my feedback- good or bad.  Happily, I liked this product and will probably use it more often, perhaps every other toothpaste purchase.  I drink a lot of coffee and dark soda and noticed a difference in my teeth&#x27;s appearance in about a week.  Got compliments too, which was unexpected.  Besides the whitening aspect, I liked that the two step process made me spend more time brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> I received a free full-sized Crest Pro-Health HD to try and review as part of a promotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been consistently using Pro-Health HD for over a month, and I&#x27;m satisfied with the result and am impressed with the amount of toothpaste and whitening gel that comes in the two tubes. I break down my review into the two main product benefits: cleaning and whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning: 5/5 stars. The toothpaste (Step 1) cleans my teeth the best of any toothpaste I&#x27;ve used. My teeth feel clean and polished after the instructed one minute brushing, almost like leaving the dentist&#x27;s office after a professional brushing/polishing. I&#x27;m left with a very fresh, minty mouth afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whitening: 3/5 stars. As a casual coffee and tea drinker (one or two cups a day combined), my teeth tend to get minor stains, especially if I forget to drink water right after tea or coffee. The combination of the deep cleaning toothpaste and the whitening gel works to remove those minor stains and I can have another cup without feeling too guilty about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whitening gel, however, works about the same as whitening strips. My teeth are slightly whiter, but not by much. Fortunately, the Crest Pro-Health HD kit is more affordable than the whitening strips or a professional whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 4/5 stars. In just two minutes, I have a much cleaner mouth and teeth that feel polished, and the added bonus of a hint of whitening. Having to use two different products in one brushing isn&#x27;t so bad once you get used to the routine. Also, like with most whitening strips, the first few times I used it my teeth and gums were a little sensitive for a few days, but everything feels fine now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the sucralose ingredient in the whitening gel leaves an after-taste that&#x27;s too sweet, but can be mitigated with a good water rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price you pay, you get decent value out of the kit since you would end up paying much more money by buying a separate toothpaste and whitening strips. It&#x27;s certainly worth a try. Maybe it&#x27;ll keep you smiling.separate toothpaste and whitening strips. It&#x27;s certainly worth a try. Maybe it&#x27;ll keep you smiling.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free from Crest . I was really surprised how well this product works. It doesn&#x27;t take up more of your time, but there are habits that need to be adjusted. I have used this product for a month. You are not suppose to rinse in between the two. I accidentally rinsed in the mornings where I am half asleep. I didn&#x27;t give up on the product because it really provided my teeth protection. I felt like the second coat is like a sealant that products against staining. Also, I have pretty sensitive teeth after having braces 2x in my life, one in Jr. High, and another time in college (because I don&#x27;t follow directions and wear my retainers), but this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. Its mild enough like sensodyne. I highly recommend everyone to try it and see if it&#x27;s for them. I personally think this is a great product.</li>
            <li> While switching paste half way through the process is a bit of a nuisance, it&#x27;s a small price to pay for the benefits. I have been complemented on my whiter teeth, and my favorite benefit is having fresher breathe when I wake up each morning. I was able to try this product for free, thanks to BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health® HD toothpaste works pretty good and is easy to use. You use it like regular toothpaste ,except there are 2 steps. It&#x27;s basically like brushing your teeth twice in a row, you just have to remember to time yourself a minute for each step and don&#x27;t rinse in between. The steps aren&#x27;t difficult, but a little tedious, having to time yourself and remembering not to rinse in between. Overall I think it works pretty good.It makes your teeth feel clean and whiter after a few uses. I received this free to sample thanks to Crest &amp; BzzAgent. #Sponsored</li>
            <li> Thanks bzzagent for giving me a free sample to review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is worth the money. Eays to use as brushing your teeth. Whitens to a natural white removing surface stains, buildup etc. cleans the teeth to a squeeky clean. Very very affordable. Great thing to add to a routine before a big event for a week.</li>
            <li> I received this toothpaste as a free sample from Crest and I love it. Although it is a two step process, I like that I spend the two minutes that you should to brush your teeth. My mouth feels cleaner and I have noticed my teeth are whiter after using it just in a few days. I would recommend this toothpaste to anyone!</li>
            <li> I received this kit free to test as a BzzAgent.  It&#x27;s a 2 part system.  The first part of the Crest Pro-Health HD Toothpaste kit is a cleanser.  It contains the Stannous Fluoride that dentists recommend.  It cleans teeth and removes stubborn plaque.  The 2nd step is the polisher, and it whitens teeth.  Not with harsh chemicals, but with hydrogen peroxide.  I used the kit for over a month.  I know my teeth are cleaner in general.  Most of this is due to the 2 minutes required to brush for the Crest Pro-Health HD Toothpaste kit to work.  One full minute for each toothpaste.  My breath doesn&#x27;t  feel as horrible in the morning, either, which meant that germs were being killed, as it is the plaque which causes bad breath. I&#x27;m not sure how much whiter my teeth look to other people.  but I think that they are slightly whiter. The reason I didn&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars is that if I brushed for 2 minutes using ANY toothpaste, my teeth would be cleaner, my breath fresher.  Another aspect that I liked about this kit in particular is that the whitener was not harsh in any way.  I did not feel any tooth sensitivity, which is what I feared.  But that never happened with this.  A downside was that it is time consuming to use, if you follow the directions and brush for the full 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest, I got to try Crest Pro-Health HD for free! It is by far the best whitening toothpaste system I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve always been afraid to try whitening strips because I have some tooth sensitivity. This product didn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive at all. After about three weeks, I&#x27;m starting to see some solid results (photo isn&#x27;t very good, but I think my teeth look great!). I absolutely love the clean feeling it gives me as well. The taste is a great too! As far as ease of use, it&#x27;s awesome. Doesn&#x27;t take me any more time than regular teeth brushing. :)</li>
            <li> Began using this the first day I received it.  WOW!  My teeth whitened at least 2 shades after the first brush.  2 weeks later, I&#x27;m completely satisfied.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh smell of the toothpaste, and it did some work the first week, then it just like other toothpastes....Guesss it is not for me.</li>
            <li> Not helping.. It&#x27;s been 3 weeks and I don&#x27;t really see any difference</li>
            <li> I loved this toothpaste/whitener system because my teeth not only look whiter, but they really do feel healthier, and I&#x27;ve only been using it 3 days!  In fact, as I&#x27;m writing this, it&#x27;s been 9 hours and 2 meals since I brushed this morning, and my teeth still feel clean.  Crest sent me this full-sized system to review for free as a member of Bzz Agent, but I love it so much that I visited the toothpaste aisle of my local Target (although you can also pick it up at your local Walgreen’s, or Wal-mart store, too) just to make sure I can get my hands on it when I run out.  The system consists of 2 tubes: the first is like a typical toothpaste, and the 2nd is a clear whitening gel.  Both solutions have a pleasant taste and are easy to use.  The process takes only 2 minutes (as regular brushing should) and is uncomplicated.  I&#x27;m so excited to see the results as I continue to use this system.</li>
            <li> I tried this for 3 days and with every use I felt numbness along the gum line. Very uncomfortable. I did not get the squeaky clean and smooth feeling like other Crest toothpaste I used in the past. No difference in the whitening. I found the two step process a bit cumbersome because of the no rinsing after brushing for a full minute. I was gross out a bit to apply step 2 and to put it back in my mouth to continue brushing for another minute. I was dying for that rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Crest, I got this product for free through BzzAgent and I&#x27;m glad to have the opportunity to try the product before buying.</li>
            <li> I was not sure what to think or expect when I signed up to try this product through BzzAgent, but it was a pleasant surprise!  BzzAgent sent me the product to try for free, and I began using it immediately.  I take great pride in my smile and am always perusing the dental isles looking for something that will be even better.  I was so amazed how clean my teeth feel after using Crest Pro-Health HD, and its not difficult at all to use the two step process.  My teeth stay fresher longer and feel squeaky clean after using it with the freshest breath!  I even notice that my smile seems brighter and I&#x27;ve always had white teeth, but there is definitely a difference there too! I will continue to purchase this product on my own following this campaign through BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> Tried and got sores on lips and sore gums</li>
            <li> thought that it was very refreshing and I was most impressed with the cleaning property of the toothpaste. Crest PH Advanced is a product I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two Step Toothpaste System from Crest and have tried it and like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s not much different than my old routine which was Crest Pro-Health for two minutes with an electric toothbrush.  With this new system, I’m more mindful of cleaning each tooth during the cleaning phases and polishing during the last phase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fresh and clean feeling but have mixed reviews about the whitening.  I didn’t have the whitest teeth to begin with, so maybe there’s no much left for me to do but wear a brown tie. *sigh*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Make sure to spit and rinse since there’s a warning on the container not to swallow the gel. (i.e. Call Poison Control)  You laugh, but I had college housemate who used to eat his toothpaste gel thinking it gave him fresher breath.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free. I was curious to see if my teeth would actually have a change. I am pleased to tell you that since trying out this product I have noticed a change in the color of my teeth. I love this product!</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, this two step toothpaste really is worth the extra effort and cost. I received the Crest Pro-Health HD kit for free from Crest but I have actually switched from Sensodyne to Crest Pro-Health as I really was impressed with how clean and white the toothpaste made my teeth. I also have very sensitive teeth and was worried that using a &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; gel would make my teeth sensitive. However, it hasn&#x27;t made my teeth more sensitive at all but they are definitely whiter! Even though it&#x27;s expensive, I&#x27;ll probably buy this kit every few months because I really liked the change.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest for providing me a free sample, it gave me a chance to try something I normally wouldn&#x27;t buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most noticeable difference after brushing that I can tell (vs other toothpaste) is the smooth, polished feel. After about a week of brushing - I noticed that my teeth were indeed whiter. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brushing twice vs whitening strips is much more convenient to me. It also tackles the job of giving all the teeth a good treatment vs just the front that strips typically do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One downside to this system is the cost, it is more than I would typically spend on toothpaste, but were I to replace some alternative whitening solution (such as strips), then I can see spending a little more to replace it.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try the Crest Pro Health HD system, but with sensitive teeth I was afraid my mouth could not tolerate it. I was given the opportunity to try this product for free through BzzAgent. I have slight discoloration, and have tried other whitening products in the fast, but could never last more than a day due to sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;I only replaced one brushing a day with the system, which consists of 2 steps. I did not find it to be at all time consuming, as you just brush as usual with step one, spit, and brush with step two. Easy. I was surprised that my teeth sensitivity did not worsen. I was even more surprised to see a noticeable whitening in my smile after only 7 days.&lt;br /&gt;I also really enjoyed the cool mint flavor, and found that it made my mouth feel cleaner than traditional toothpaste. I am definite going to continue using this system, as I finally found a way to whiten my smile and keep my mouth comfortable.</li>
            <li> Received this product free to sample and I absolutely loved it. I am a coffee and wine drinker so my teeth definitely needed a little sprucing up. This product did a great job whitening my teeth and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Using whitening strips can be a pain and professional whitening can get expensive. This is a convenient, cheap, and effective way to whiten your teeth while doing an everyday task that we all (hopefully) do anyway. I will be a continuing customer for this product.</li>
            <li> I got this product as part of a campaign from the manufacturer.  I was skeptical at first but after the first week, I noticed a difference.  After two weeks my wife started to notice a brighter smile.  That was enough to sell me on the product.  Great job!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;I Tryed crest HD and was not happy with product, It burnt my gums and I was unable to brush my teeth for 2 days !!!! I was very excited to try the product , but after the first use of it I realized this product is not for me ... Thank you #smiley360</li>
            <li> I got to try a free sample of this product provided by Crest. I am only a reviewer and in no way work with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was unsure about adding another step to my morning brushing routine. I read the instructions and it clearly said to use step one for 1 minute and step 2 for the same. Since the total 2 minutes is the same as a typical mouth cleansing time, I was back on the bandwagon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1 leaves your mouth feeling a little dry and a bit like you bit into a not quite ripe banana. Without rinsing my mouth, I move onto step 2, which immediately relieves that dry mouth feeling. Step 1 is the normal toothpaste looking product, while step 2 is a clear gel, which was unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the flavor of both and definitely leaves my mouth (and teeth) feeling clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish that there was a way they could have had one packaging, much like a two part epoxy that you squeeze the plunger separately to expel the paste. I feel that in a hurry to pack for a vacation and only grab one of the tubes, thus leaving me with only a half clean mouth.</li>
            <li> I figured this would be another failed attempt at getting brighter teeth and fresh out of the dentist chair feeling. Wow, I was so wrong. This system really does work. After 1 week I noticed a difference and so did my husband, that&#x27;s saying a lot that he notice my teeth! I did have a tad bit of sensitivity in the first week, but that went away week 2. I love the super clean feeling this system leaves me with. I will say my only issue is I really wish step 2 was a flip top cap like 1. It&#x27;s kind of a pain to have to untwist a cap and deal with that when you have your toothbrush in hand and  your trying to do it all on that step. Love this product though and it will by toothpaste system from here on out. I can&#x27;t say enough about it and how easy it truly is to get fresher brighter teeth and mouth with this! #HealthyObsession #Sponsored</li>
            <li> I expressed to my office personnel that I received Crest ProHealth HD from BzzAgent and even though at first I thought that I would not like having to take the extra time to utilize 2 toothpastes as it became a habit it appeared to take as long as any other teeth brushing routine.  One very important thing for me to utilize toothpaste is that it has to taste OK and not be too strong and this program was just like the other Crest products and tasted very well.  After the initial cleaning of toothpaste you can tell the grime is off of your teeth and to further top that off with a polisher and whitener my teeth felt like they had just left the dentist office.  Over the course of the week I did actually see some whitening of my teeth even when some of my teeth are veneers they even became more polished.</li>
            <li> I found that it really helped me with sensitive teeth! Cleaned my teeth well and I will definetly buy when I am done with the sample you have provided me. love it!</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this product. It had a different taste than what I typically am used to in my mouth. I am very pleased with this product. It is a feeling like when you first leave the dentist&#x27;s office after having a thorough cleaning. The whitening is great also. I feel like a whole new person with this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;The directions are very clear on each tube which definitely helps when one is half awake in the morning. It didn&#x27;t take any longer than it usually does to take care of my teeth in the morning. I liked that very much as mornings can be a bit hectic. I will definitely be recommending this product to those I know. I will also continue to use it as I am so very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to try Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste for free thanks to Crest. Please be assured the opinions are all mine.</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro-Health HD Daily for free because I am a BzzAgent and have the opportunity to review some products.  I have always been skeptical about quick fix whitening claims in the past.  I have now been using the system for a month and I am starting to see the benefits.  My teeth look whiter and feel smoother.  It is a two step process so be prepared to double the time it takes to brush your teeth in the morning, but you get use to it after the first week.  The results also will not happen overnight.  It took about a month to notice my brighter smile, but you will notice your teeth feeling smoother much sooner.  I love the way my teeth feel now.  I use to only get that feeling after visiting the dentist.  If you are dedicated and prepared to put in some time to whiten your smile, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The concept behind this product is that you can brush and whiten in the same amount of time it takes to brush -- 2 minutes. Just use the two products in lieu of your regular toothpaste. The first tube is a toothpaste, and the second is a whitener. You just spit (but don&#x27;t rinse) after using the first product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes: This disciplines me to brush for a full two minutes. My teeth feel really clean after using it. There is a slight aftertaste after using the whitener, but it&#x27;s certainly not as bad as other whiteners and can hardly be noticed. It&#x27;s easy as compared to strips, trays, etc. It&#x27;s affordable. It&#x27;s not messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes: My teeth were pretty white to start with, so I haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference. But, I would imagine it would be more effective if my teeth were more stained to begin with. Laziness. That is totally my fault, but I have a bit of a mental block about using two products when I brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely going to keep using this product until it&#x27;s gone and will then decide whether to buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure I got a free trial of this product from Crest, but my review is entirely my own opinion.</li>
            <li> I received this toothpaste as part of a BzzAgent campaign and have been using it for nearly a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste definitely works, my teeth feel cleaner and whiter after only the first week of use.  After week 3, my teeth look like they were professionally whitened.  Step 1 is a bit strange the first time i used it because of the gritty texture, but you get used to it  after a while.  It also gets less gritty after a while, probably because there is less plaque to clean out from regular use.  The best part about this is that your teeth are whitened without experiencing any of the tooth sensitivity that people typically report after using other whitening products.</li>
            <li> Got Pro Health HD free from Crest to try and quite happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;First of all it has new-old stannous fluoride which is helping with gingivitis so when you wake in the morning it doesn&#x27;t feel like germs had party in your mouth. My teeth never felt that clean!&lt;br /&gt;Second thing it really whitened teeth from what i see - not considering it as the biggest breakthrough but seems to me like whitening was gentle - so quite happy here too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why 4 stars you would ask? Plain simple - With 3 dollar off with coupon it&#x27;s twice the price of regular Crest ProHealth toothpaste i usually buy&lt;br /&gt;Without coupon it&#x27;s 2.5 times more to pay - happy with the product but price point kinda ruins it</li>
            <li> I have been using a free sample of Crest Pro Health HD for almost two months now and am really enjoying this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;Previously I had been using a toothpaste specifically for sensitive teeth, so I was concerned going into this trial about an increase in sensitivity.  I am happy to report that over my time using this product I have not experienced any increased tooth sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I have noticed for this toothpaste is that it feels pretty dry, but after rinsing with water and mouthwash it goes away.&lt;br /&gt;I started using the sample of Crest Pro Health HD that I received from Crest soon after I had my teeth whitened so I didn&#x27;t not notice my teeth getting any whiter.  I have noticed that over the almost two months I have used this toothpaste my teeth have not gotten any darker which had always been a problem.&lt;br /&gt;Some people will be turned off by this being a two part toothpaste.  I got used to it pretty quickly, using an electric toothpaste with built in timer made keeping track of the time easy.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up really liking this toothpaste, my main concern of tooth sensitivity was not an issue and my mouth has felt clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I think Crest Pro Health HD is a great  two part whitening toothpaste system. I&#x27;m 73, I drink coffee everyday and I smoked for over fifty-five years. I quit smoking over two years ago and my teeth will never be brilliantly white. I was pleasantly surprised that the Crest Pro Health HD whitening system that BzzAgent sent me did make a difference in the brightness and whiteness of my teeth. It was not as complicated to use as some whitening systems I have tried in the past. It was not as messy and did not require whitening trays or extensive amounts of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1 is the fluoride toothpaste that helps guard against cavities and gingivitis. This is the  part that is spit out and not rinsed out with water. It helps to remove the plaque and stains on the teeth. There was one warning on the label that I found ironic. The warning on the label was &amp;#34;products containing stannous fluoride may produce staining of the teeth.&amp;#34; That did not happen with me and I noticed that the two part system actually helped to remove stains from my teeth. Since everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different, that warning may have to be there in case it applies to a certain segment of the population. This part literally only takes one minute and it tastes minty so it&#x27;s pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2 is the Perfecting Gel, the whitening gel that contains hydrogen peroxide. This part also takes literally one minute but it can be rinsed after that minute. Part 2 is the polishing gel that really helps to whiten the teeth. It also has a pleasant minty taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really liked the Crest Pro Health HD two step whitening system. It really does not take very long to do each day, literally four minutes per day, two minutes each time. Under five minutes per day to make teeth whiter and brighter seems reasonable to me. I use Crest Pro Health products on a regular basis and I think this two part system is my favorite new Crest whitening system.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothpaste and brightener.  It has done an incredibly job whitening my teeth but as a toothpaste alone it might be worth a try.  The toothpaste itself is very thick but does an excellent job scrubbing your teeth.  After you brush your teeth feel clean and there is little to no after taste or dry mouth common with other options.&lt;br /&gt;The 2nd tube is a polish and brightener.  It does a great job but will also show if you don&#x27;t brush to your gums.  After using it for a week I realized I needed to get closer to my bottom gums but the difference in color. I received this as part of a free trial.</li>
            <li> I received sample of Crest Pro Health HD for free to try through BzzAgent. I decided to use Crest Pro Health HD for a few weeks before I wrote this review. I thought it was a bit pricey for my usual toothpaste but even though I use a whitening toothpaste, this is much better. I did see some slight whitening effect after two weeks. I will say that my mouth feels cleaner for longer though. When I compare this to whitening systems, the costs seem much better and I will definitely keep using it for that reason. The two step system was a bit to get used to for me since you do not spit the entire two minutes.</li>
            <li> While I feel like this system did give me the results that it promised, I couldn&#x27;t quite get used to using the polish step everyday.  I used to use whitening strips.  I guess this is a step above those considering the time commitment.  I received the toothpaste as part of a bzzagent test.</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent, I was able to try the New Crest Pro Health HD!  It took a little adjusting to the two-step process (I kept rinsing after the first step), but it is a really good product, overall.  I love how clean my mouth feels and how fresh.  Not to mention how much whiter my teeth are after using the toothpaste.  Overall my mouth feels cleaner, healthier and better.  I have been using it for over a month and while the containers are small, I can definitely tell the difference between before and after.  I am a heavy coffee drinker so maintaining my teeth healthy and white is important and a good toothpaste is necessary.  This does the trick!  Whiter teeth in less than a month with regular brushing twice a day, and no coffee yellow spots anywhere to be seen!  Totally a new favorite and will buy again after I finish these pack is finished.</li>
            <li> I got to try Crest Pro Health HD for free as part of BzzAgent and to make sure I really knew if it worked, I had to give it a while to try. After all, whitening your teeth can take time, and I wanted to make sure I could see any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I *think* my teeth are whiter after trying it, but it&#x27;s hard to say really. I will say that this system is pretty easy to use. You brush your teeth for one minute using the toothpaste, which is a little bit &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34; like so that it kind of polishes your teeth and gets them ready for the whitening gel. It&#x27;s not rough on teeth or anything, just a little more gritty than your regular toothpaste might be, again just in a way that preps your teeth for the whitening gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whitening gel is also easy to use. Once you brush your teeth with the toothpaste (step 1), you spit but don&#x27;t rinse and then apply the whitening gel (step 2) to your toothbrush and brush for another minute. Luckily I use a Sonicare that counts off minutes so I was easily able to switch between the two; however, I will say it was a little bit annoying to have to do two steps and switch back and forth. It&#x27;s not a super-huge deal or anything, but just an additional step when you compare this to something like a whitening strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whitening gel is fairly thick and doesn&#x27;t drip down much. You use it much like a toothpaste although of course it doesn&#x27;t foam. It can irritate gums and your mouth slightly if you&#x27;re sensitive--I had some whiteness on my gums that went away quickly and the packaging does warn you about this. My teeth never hurt at all when using this though. After using this for several weeks, I feel like my teeth were--maybe not *whiter* but a consistent level of whiteness that matched where I started. I drink a lot of tea and so to keep the staining down, that helped. I have used Crest&#x27;s whitestrips before and I feel like those actually are easier to use and keep teeth more visibly white, so I&#x27;m not convinced that this is a better system, but for someone who wants the convenience of just brushing teeth rather than using strips, this could work really well.that this is a better system, but for someone who wants the convenience of just brushing teeth rather than using strips, this could work really well.</li>
            <li> Loving BzzAgent right now. I was lucky to receive Crest Pro-Health HD to try out for free. I will be honest though, at first I thought that it would turn out to be just like all of the other &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; toothpastes found on the toothpaste aisle, I was proved wrong. Definitely an overall &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; feeling in your mouth. Love that feeling. However, the greatest thing is that the whitening actually works. I notice a change in the shade of my teeth after using it for now 18 days. It was a little difficult getting into the routine of brushing longer and rinsing etc.. but it is definitely worth it. After a couple of days, the routine sticks and becomes natural. I definitely recommend trying it out. It is an affordable way to whiten your teeth. Thank you Crest!</li>
            <li> I tried out the Crest Pro-Health HD toothpaste and whitening system for free, with a box that Crest sent me for free. The results I received were similar to those I’ve gotten using other at-home whitening products: 1-2 shades whiter on a teeth shade scale. This seems to be as good as I can expect, unless I get it professionally done at the dentist, which I don’t think I’ll be doing anytime soon. I didn’t quite get the ‘6X’ results Crest advertised, but my teeth are definitely noticeably whiter than they were before. Hopefully they’re healthier too (as Crest also says), but I don’t know how to measure that. I do know that I like the two step system. It’s easy to remember (once you resist your initial instinct to rinse after Step 1) and was easy to integrate into my already two-times-a-day brushing . So all I needed to do was add two more minutes to my current routine (one minute per morning &amp; evening brushing). Something that simple to do that provides similar results to other products out there that involve much more time and/or effort is good in my book. The only thing is the price – I wish it was at least $10 cheaper. Hopefully Crest will put it on sale from time to time. Or sell it in bulk at Costco, etc.</li>
            <li> I received this for free as a full-sized trial. I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for a few weeks and I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve really noticed much of a difference in my teeth. No one has commented on them, for example. I&#x27;ll admit that I haven&#x27;t been 100% diligent using this at every opportunity, but I will say that somehow the &amp;#34;two tube&amp;#34; system that they have makes me more encouraged to brush my teeth. It makes me feel like I&#x27;m being extra fancy to my teeth. Also, I didn&#x27;t have any sensitivity issues with my teeth, which can happens sometimes when working with whitening products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d switch over to this product, but then again, I&#x27;m not super concerned about the whiteness of my teeth. All I can say is that a two-tube system is kinda fun, but it&#x27;s decidedly just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(And if you&#x27;re a fan of animals, Crest is not currently a cruelty-free brand, which means that I personally would not pay money for this product.)</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about using this toothpaste duo due to the fact that I have used many products like it in the past.  A lot of toothpaste that I have used promised whiter teeth but never really delivered.  The Crest Pro Health HD system seems to include what other toothpaste have been missing to get the job done.  The product has a 2 step regimen.  The first step removed plaque, and buildup on your teeth and then the second step applies a sealer to prevent new buildup.  I do not feel like it takes any longer to brush your teeth with this process and you get incredible results.  I would recommend this to anyone that would like a dentist clean feeling every time you brush.  I did not see professional strength whitening but my teeth feel amazing and I have seen a noticeable reduction in buildup.</li>
            <li> I have been asked to try and review Crest Pro-Health HD toothpaste as a BZZ Agent. I have to say I was quite skeptical to about trying the product  for several reasons: 1.) I have never like Crest toothpaste.I didn&#x27;t care for the taste or the way their toothpaste felt in my mouth.  Weird, I know, just a personal preference . 2.) I am highly sensitive to Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. I can use it in small doses but I try avoid it and find toothpastes that don&#x27;t contain SLS as an ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;However my skepticism, I did decide to give the Crest Pro-Health HD a try. My opinion of the product, 4/5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;SLS is not a major ingredient in the tooth polish, but it does contain some. The good thing is that it didn&#x27;t contain enough SLS to cause a reaction to it! YAY!  The other MAJOR reason I like the product and will purchase it in the future is that I LOVE the way it made my teeth feel. Seriously, every day when I brush my teeth with the Crest Pro-Heath HD and my Oral B Pro toothbrush my teeth feel like I just left the dentist office. How great is that, right!?!  They are super clean and they last that way all day long, seriously.&lt;br /&gt;I knocked it down a star because I didn&#x27;t feel the product whitened as it claims. My teeth did not seem 6X whiter in 6 days. But there wasn&#x27;t a teeth whitening chart in the box...wonder why... after almost 2 months of using the product I have noticed my teeth to be whiter, however I still don&#x27;t feel they are 6X whiter.&lt;br /&gt;So, to sum it up, even though I have never been a Crest girl in the past I will purchase this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I was exited to receive Crest Pro Health HD for free from BuzzAgent. I think Crest Pro Health HD is a great way to keep teeth healthier and whiter. First of all i love slick and cool looking packaging. If you have tried whitening strips and had horrible sensitivity as a result this product is for you. I have fairly sensitive teeth but of course i still want them to be white. When i tried using colgate whitening strips i coudnt even keep them for a minute because i developed shooting pain in my teeth. After using Crest Pro Health HD for a month i have whiter teeth yet zero teeth sensitivity. Crest Pro Health HD will change the way you brush your teeth though. Its a two step process that should take two minutes. Step one is purifying cleanser that helps strip away plaque and leaves your teeth feeling clean and fresh. It also tastes great. Step two which has no taste is perfecting gel that polishes and whitens teeth. It took some time getting used to a two step process but i love it. I used to brush my teeth in 15 seconds and be done, now i consciencely take two minutes and as a result take better care of my teeth. I gave the product 4 stars because it does not dramatically whiten teeth but you will definatly notice the difference.</li>
            <li> Okay, positives first: Great packaging. The presentation would pull me to the product and grab Crest ProHealth HD off the shelf to take a closer look. Once open, the process was super easy. just brush my teeth like I normally do and wait to be blinded by my pearlies in just one week! It was a slight inconvenience having to brush the same teeth twice each time, but I figured it would still be easier than using white strips or and definitely less bother than using trays.&lt;br /&gt;Well… I went three better and gave it TEN days and… Nuthin.&#x27; I think I could have had better results with just a day or two of WhiteStrips. In fairness, I guess my teeth weren&#x27;t overly horrific to begin with - just a daily coffee to keep them from looking their best - so maybe the difference just wasn&#x27;t that noticeable. But they definitely were&#x27;t white by the time I finished.&lt;br /&gt;I love Crest. It&#x27;s the ONLY toothpaste brand I use. But this particular product didn&#x27;t knock my socks off. I got my kit as a free sample from Crest because I&#x27;m a BzzAgent.I would have been upset if I&#x27;d paid for it, myself.</li>
            <li> I love that this toothpaste provides me with cleaner and whiter teeth without having to pay hundreds of dollars to my dentist. I noticed within a week of using this two step system that my teeth were whiter and that they stayed cleaner longer after I used the toothpaste. I loved the simple and exact directions on the products. Brush for 1 minute with Step 1, spit but don&#x27;t rinse, brush for 1 minute with Step 2, and then spit and rinse. I loved these detailed instructions so I knew I was using the products properly. I always sing a song in my head for each minute of brushing and the time passes by quickly. The first thing I noticed when I first used the products is that neither of them have a harsh taste like many toothpastes have. Step 1 is light aqua and has a mild minty taste which was comforting to my mouth. Step 2 is completely clear of color and whitened my teeth beautifully after Step 1 cleansed my teeth of plaque. It is easy to use these products in the mornings when I wake up and in the evenings before I go to sleep and I will continute to use them and recommend them to my friends and family. I received a free product from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> Had to discountinue use of this product because it is EXTREMELY abrasive (step 1) and it was causing me to lose tartar on my teeth (which my dentist said is a bad thing). Contacting P&amp;G to file a complaint next week.</li>
            <li> After my niece who is a dentist recommended this,  I have used it ever since with excellent immediate visible results!</li>
            <li> LOVE my smile after I brush with the 2 pastes! I drink so much coffee my smile has dulled down, After 1 single use of this crest HD you see results! The only reason I gave 4 not 5 stars is I feel your mouth feels a bit dry after use, But I think the results out weigh the dry mouth!</li>
            <li> I recieved this product for free to use and review.  So far I have not seen any dramatic difference in my teeth color.  I do feel clean and fresh after brushing, and it does encourage me to brush for two minutes.  I probably wouldnt go out of my way to buy this product, but I have nothing bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> Love the new Crest Pro Health HD , I did receive it free from Crest, but truly and honestly love it!!  You brush 1 minute with step 1 and 1 minute with step 2, which is great because everyone should be brushing for 2 minutes....You teeth feel so fresh and clean like when you get a cleaning at the dentist..I highly recommend this product....have had  no burning of the gums or any other side effects that I have had with other whitening products..with this products I can use it twice daily (a.m. / p.m.) brushing...</li>
            <li> Buy it! Use It! Smile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Crest Por-Health HD Daily 2-Step toothpaste system last week to use &amp; review as part of the BZZ Agent program.  Step 1 is a minty cleanser, with the flavor you expect from the Crest brand.  Step 2 is a flavorless gel.  Though I’d rather have 1 step vs. 2 I used the product every morning &amp; evening per the directions.  Using an electric toothbrush with the product, my teeth felt as clean as after going to the dentist.  After a week, I do have a whiter smile.  I normally use Crest Whitestrips once a year &amp; now I can skip this process.  I do not smoke, I do not drink coffee, nor do I have heavily stained teeth - this product worked great for me.  The extra step is only a minute &amp; for the result, well worth it.  Buy it, try it, &amp; start showing a whiter smile!</li>
            <li> I got Crest Pro Health HD free through a marketing website. It came in easy to understand packaging, both tubes of toothpaste are easy to squeeze and come out easy without having a mess when it is time to close the cap. I hate to say, I was not a fan of the step 1 purifying cleanser, it also leaves a strange residue on your teeth and gums that feels quite chalky and dry. After I used it for a few times I got used to it, and now barely recognize that residue, but it comes as a shock when you are new to the product. The step 2 toothpaste is a gel that goes on smoothly and leaves your teeth feeling really good! It is much smoother than other products I have used, and seems to last longer as well despite normal daily wear and tear. A few days into trying this, I ran into another problem as well. My gums became very irritated from the constant brushing, they were sensitive and would bleed. I tried to keep it up, but it was rough to eat with them being so inflamed so I use the product once a day instead of twice and now have found my happy medium. I also did notice my teeth are whiter, this is not drastic and though my husband noticed, it might just have been because he was looking for it &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to summarize, the step 1 toothpaste does not taste or feel the best, and if you overuse the product you will get sore and irritated gums, but it is still worth it if you want smooth and white teeth!</li>
            <li> I have to say that I love this toothpaste, which I did get for free as part of a promotion from Crest.  I have to admit that I was a little hesitant at first, since it has 2 steps, but it is super easy and not a big deal at all.  I love the flavor of this toothpaste, especially the first step.  My mouth has never felt so clean or fresh!  And I also like that it prompts me to brush for 2 minutes-the recommended amount of time-something that I do not always do.  I also feel like my teeth are whiter, too.  And lastly, I have had to use a sensitive toothpaste recently because of tooth sensitivity, and using this toothpaste has not made my teeth more sensitive, so I&#x27;m happy!  I love this great tasting toothpaste, and would suggest it to anyone looking for a toothpaste that promotes a clean and fresh feeling mouth and whiter teeth!</li>
            <li> Not impressed enough to buy this again- makes teeth sensitive and can&#x27;t be bothered</li>
            <li> Love it! I received it free to try through BzzAgent. I was eager to try it because I&#x27;ve used a lot of whitening toothpastes in the past with lackluster results. Felt like I could tell a difference with the first week, no sensitivity issues like whitening products can sometimes cause.</li>
            <li> I received Pro-Health HD for a free as a promotion from Crest.  It is a simple process to use the two step process.  First brush with tube 1 for 60 seconds, spit, brush with tube 2 for 60 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tube one is like traditonal toothpaste with tube two for polishing and whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mouth feels clean after brushing, the polishing action of tube 2 makes my teeth feel just dentist clean.  The two step process encourages me to brush more thoroughly and for a longer time, which has to help with dental health. Whitening is a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only give the 4 stars because I prefer a MAJOR minty toothpaste flavor.  Crest Pro-Health HD has a pleasant taste, just less so than I prefer.</li>
            <li> I received this kit to try through Bzz Agent for free.  I was interested in this kit, because after a long cold winter of tea drinking my teeth were not looking so white. The system is a two step process which is easy enough to use.  I think it works well and whitened my teeth.  My hygienist also commented that my tartar looked great.  The only down fall is that I don&#x27;t really love the taste, it feels not as fresh as I like and has a bit of a chalky effect.  I will continue to use this system though as I have seen results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever rave about a toothpaste but this leaves my teeth and mouth feeling like I just got back from a cleaning at the dentist (minus the pain from being jabbed with a sharp tool in my gums). I received it free from Crest via Bzz Agent to try and review and this might be the first time I actually continue using the product after my sample is used up. I can&#x27;t speak to whether my teeth are whiter as I neglected to take a photo but I will say that it doesn&#x27;t hurt to use (which I find many other whitening products do) and my mouth feels incredibly clean after using it. It&#x27;s worth a try if you are on the fence.</li>
            <li> I was invited to try the new crest HD toothpaste kid. And I have to say I am impressed. I am a sucker for all things new and improved, and more often than not I end up just being a sucker.&lt;br /&gt;But the crest HD Kit actually came through for me. Let me tell you what I think&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a  positive side note : as a brand-new mom to a two-month-old let&#x27;s be real I&#x27;m not getting to the dentist as often as I should be. First thing after the birth I had to cancel my dentist appointment :-/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Enter the Crest Pro health HD kit.  Using step one of the kit literally makes my teeth feel as lickety slick, if not more slick and shiny then when I go to get a cleaning at my dental office.  I realize you can get that just from changing out with a brand-new toothbrush, but the different seem to be at the end of the day even after a few meals my teeth still felt likity slick-  that tells me that it really is removing any plaque buildup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the part two of the kit, although my teeth don&#x27;t feel exceptionally white, I will say I have noticed an increase in brightness in my smile. And trust me I have been taking lots of selfies of me and my baby as of late.  Let&#x27;s just say the only thing that looks pulled together is his cute smile and mine ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; On the downside :  for busy people, including me as a new mom I do have to admit that a two-step process can be a little painstaking at times…  Getting a shower every day is a luxury these days, so taking the time to open twice the amount of toothpaste tubes is a luxury in time that I don&#x27;t always have.  I also think that sometimes I hope that both tubes run out at the same time otherwise I will end up with white teeth and bad breath or bad breath and yellow teeth ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said I would recommend this product for people who are looking to try something new, want the lickety clean  teeth, and could use a smile tune up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Although I was provided a free sample of this product in exchange for my candid opinion, I will say that In the seventh grade I did a toothpaste research project for my science class testing all brands of toothpaste. And I stick by my findings now 25 years later. Crest is the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time you&#x27;re at Target Walgreens or Walmart- pop it in your cart and give it a shot :-)nge for my candid opinion, I will say that In the seventh grade I did a toothpaste research project for my science class testing all brands of toothpaste.

            <li> I received Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste as a promotion from Crest to try through BzzAgent.  I was excited to try a whitening product as I have never had my teeth whitened or used whitening strips.  I can absolutely tell you that your teeth will feel cleaner after your first use.  I have been using this toothpaste day and night for the past three weeks and I have noticed that my teeth are looking whiter.  I am a heavy iced tea drinker and I know that tea does stain your teeth.  So it&#x27;s nice to find a product that I can use daily to help combat this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I wanted to mention is that it doesn&#x27;t take any longer to brush your teeth.  You would think that a 2-step program would require more time brushing but this system doesn&#x27;t.  The cleaning paste is applied and you simple brush your teeth as normal for a minute.  You then spit out the paste and apply the polish/whitening paste and brush for another minute.  Then spit and rinse.  It doesn&#x27;t take any extra time to brush, just one more step in the process.  I am happy with this toothpaste and I am excited for the results once I finish my tubes.</li>
            <li> While I must admit, the Step 1 paste isn&#x27;t my personal favorite for flavor - the overall feel of my mouth and teeth after using this kit is amazing.  My teeth are definitely whiter and brighter and several friends have asked my if I paid my dentist for a treatment - nope!  Crest Pro-Health HD did all the work.  This is truly a great product, one of the best I&#x27;ve tried and I would like to thank the Crest brand for allowing me to try a kit free of charge.  I will definitely be purchasing this product for my daily use.</li>
            <li> I received this whitening system for free thanks to crest for testing purposes only. I wasn&#x27;t sure how it was going to work. I&#x27;m pretty skeptical about a lot of whitening products out there. I don&#x27;t have super yellowed teeth or anything but I do drink coffee/ tea daily and occasionally red wine. After using the system for a week I saw slight results. I only used it in the morning and used my regular toothpaste at night. After 2 weeks I noticed even more results. It took off some of the staining. I also can&#x27;t stand using those whitening strips so this product is perfect for me! I love it and would definitely recommend it and I can&#x27;t wait to see what prolonged results I will have!</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older my teeth have become super sensitive. I will say that when I first started using this kit my gums did hurt after I was finished brushing them. I was hesitant to try it again, but I gave it another shot and luckily no pain. I am not sure if it was my technique or if my sensitivity adjusted.  After brushing, my teeth feel incredibly clean. I compare it to the feeling of just leaving the dentist office from having a professional cleaning. To me that is CLEAN! As for the whitening I noticed with in a few days that my teeth were becoming whiter and I am a BIG TIME COFFEE DRINKER. As a mom of a toddler, COFFEE is a must to get me through the day.  I have tried a lot of different whitening tooth pasts over the years. And, I also have done the crest whitening strips, which worked wonderful but at what point in my day do I have time to put strips on my teeth and let them sit for an extended period of time? Very Rare!! . So for me to be able to get the same level of whitening to the crest strips in a much easier process is amazing. Thank you Crest® and bzzagent for the opportunity to try this product for FREE!! This is a cheaper/quicker way to get whiter teeth. I am so impressed with the fact that it only takes two minutes twice a day.  I will most definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I got it free through BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product, but it&#x27;s annoying that I have to brush my teeth twice to use it.  Wish it were simpler.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as mentioned. I received my free bzzkit through Bzzagent of the new Crest HD pro health 2 step brushing system with two pastes. The first is the regular paste and the second is whitening paste. I was a little skeptical of the 2 step brushing, but was pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to brush with this system. The breath was fresh and the teeth whiter with just a day of using this toothpaste. The only problem I have is with the taste of whitening paste. If that can be improved, I am all for the product</li>
            <li> Our entire family absolutely LOVES this new product from CREST. I first tried this when I received a free product sample as part of the BzzAgent program and after three days of use, I was so impressed with my results that I ordered three more to share with family members. I am very selective about the toothpastes and other oral products I purchase so, although I was willing to try this, I certainly wouldn&#x27;t be repurchasing if it wasn&#x27;t superior to the other products I use. This one is! I recently purchased two more sets for my personal &amp;#34;stockpile.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest Pro Health HD, is being touted as Crest’s biggest breakthrough in toothpaste since fluoride, and I am a believer! It is a 2-step process that takes the same amount of time as you generally spend brushing your teeth. I could tell a difference from the first use: my smile was brighter and my teeth felt so clean. Within a week of twice daily use, my teeth were definitely whiter and I no longer awoke each morning with &amp;#34;morning mouth.&amp;#34; WOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My naturally skeptical husband noticed the difference and actually asked to try it out. His whitening results were even more dramatic than mine and he is now a very enthusiastic convert to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are sensitive in spots but I have had zero discomfort with Crest HD. I think a bright smile is the best accessory and very important in the business world as well. This system offers that, but more importantly, it offers healthy teeth and gum benefits from a very trusted brand.</li>
            <li> I am doing a trial of Chest Pro-Health HD thanks to Crest and bzzagent.  It has been one week and I am seeing my teeth get whiter.  The taste was a little strong at first but it was easy to get used to.  The two steps does not bother me because it only takes up 2 minutes of my morning.  It makes your mouth feel clean in the morning and seems to keep breath fresh all day.  I would consider using this from now on if my teeth continue to get whiter and brighter.  Thanks Crest for the pretty smile.</li>
            <li> Normally, I am not a huge fan of Crest products, but this one was a pleasant surprise. I am a heavy tea drinker and my teeth get stained. After a week of using Crest Pro-Health HD, I have noticed a reduction in the staining and some whitening. This is actually a lot more pleasant than other comparable products. Most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t hurt or feel harsh at all. The flavor is very nice on the first step, though the second has a heavy hydrogen peroxide taste that&#x27;s not great, but not too bad.  The two step-process does take some getting used to, but once I got a hang of it, I realized it was much faster than brushing with regular toothpaste. I have no complaints about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a full-size sample of this product from Crest and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> This product will whiten teeth after a few uses. I use it with a sonic care which I believe makes it more effective. Did not entirely remove the worse stains but made a difference after a few use day and night.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try Crest ProHealth HD free recently... And I have to say, it is amazing!!! My teeth have never felt cleaner!! I was expecting it to be like any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried, but this product really surprised me!! It&#x27;s a little different having a two step process to brush my teeth, but it was definitely worth it. My teeth have felt much cleaner and healthier the last couple of days and I&#x27;m excited to how my mouth feels after a month with this toothpaste!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS TOOTHPASTE! i bought it at Target for $12.99 because i heard about this from numerous people and my dentist actually recommended this product for me. When you get done brushing with Step 2, your mouth is VERY minty because it is literally so clean. It feels like i just left the dentist office! My mouth feels so fresh and clean i dont even need to use my mouthwash. If i do use mouthwash its hard to even keep it in my mouth that long because of how minty my mouth is left after brushing (lol). anyways, i love this toothpaste so much! its whitened my teeth from this gross yellow and white spotted from having braces to a &amp;#34;less yellow&amp;#34; in the last week and a half. its actually whitening my teeth and its awesome! i recommend for anyone who is looking to whiten teeth and have healthier teeth!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste makes you feel like you just came from the dentist. My husband has been using the toothpaste and is happy with the results. It has been a week, and his teeth are slightly whiter. The taste is good, and the two steps are not a hassle at all. The hardest part has been remembering NOT to rinse before step 2!  One star off for the high levels of fluoride (I use fluoride free toothpaste), but I know fluoride has it&#x27;s benefits and seems to be doing what it advertises for my husband&#x27;s teeth. I will be back to post before and after pics in an update after 2 weeks of use. We did get the toothpaste as a sample to try from Crest. My husband will more than likely be switching to this brand since you can&#x27;t beat the feeling of just having your mouth cleaned by dentist every time you brush with it!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this whitening system, which I got to try from free from BzzAgent and Crest. I am a huge fan of the Crest Pro Health products already, and this didn&#x27;t let me down! I have noticed an increased yellowing to my teeth over the past few years. When I was younger, I used to try various OTC whiteners, like strips and gels. They always left my teeth sensitive and painful, so I would stop use before seeing good results. My husband also has yellow teeth, worse than mine, so he was ready to try it too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The system is very easy to use, and takes no longer than my regular routine. I felt sensitivity after my first use, but none at all since then, and I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks. My husband has a small white spot on his gums, which the box said could happen, and it was temporary. First, true to Crest Pro Health reputation, the toothpaste cleans better than any other on the market. I don&#x27;t feel any plaque on my teeth, even hours and hours after brushing. The taste of the toothpaste is great. The whitening gel tastes a bit like peroxide, but since you are using it on your brush without rinsing, the taste of the toothpaste masks most of the yucky taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks of use, I definitely see an improvement in the whiteness of my smile! For myself, I would give it 5 stars. Unfortunately, the results were not as profound with my husband, whose teeth need whitening more than mine. There is a definite difference, but I was hoping for more.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I expected too much but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I have to tell you this.  I gave up on anything that would try to &amp;#34;whiten&amp;#34; my teeth or make them &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; than regular toothpaste a long time ago.  I was offered an opportunity to try Crest Pro-Health HD from Bzzagent for free.  I declined to take part and not respond to the offer as I was pretty much fed up with strips, gel&#x27;s and so on.....  After a few days I decided to read what was required for this test.  It basically requires you to brush your teeth twice in a row.  Since it was only brushing your teeth I decided to join with low expectations.  Here is what I can tell you..  It did not &amp;#34;instantly&amp;#34; whiten my teeth.  It is more like an overall week long cleaning of your teeth.  There is not too much more to say except just brush your teeth &amp;#34;twice&amp;#34;.  Once with step 1 for a minute and then again with with step 2 for a minute.  Do this for at least a week and you &amp;#34;will&amp;#34; see a difference.  I have to plug Crest as I received it for free, but it is very much worth a try if you just want clean teeth and gums and a &amp;#34;somewhat&amp;#34; whiter smile.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health HD makes my mouth feel like it&#x27;s been to the dentist every day!* I feel so fresh and clean after using the product and the freshness that it leaves after brushing lasts most of the day. I have noticed that my teeth look whiter. I am an avid coffee drinker so my teeth tend to look a bit yellowed after a while. When using this product, the yellowish tint seemed to fade away. The only con is that the second step should have a flip-top lid as well, instead of a screw-on cap. Since you can&#x27;t rinse after step one, it would make it easier since you tend to only have one hand free when brushing. I love the product and am so glad I had the chance to try it. I would 100x recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Trying it free thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample thanks to Crest and I really like the product it was very easy to use, just brush like normal but twice.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a teeth whitening product</li>
            <li> I am the family skeptic. I hear about a product with magical claims, and dismiss them as marketing &amp;#34;mumbo jumbo&amp;#34;. So naturally, Crest&#x27;s claim that Crest Pro Health® HD™ leads to healthier/whiter teeth was hard for me to believe. But, I am pleased to say that their claims are sincere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 5 days of using Crest Pro Health® HD™ as directed, I saw a noticeable difference with the whiteness of my teeth. I was shocked! I even had to verify the results with my wife, and she was surprised. The next day I walked into the bathroom to find her using my Crest Pro Health® HD™. I had a &amp;#34;let go of my [breakfast waffle name here]&amp;#34; moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we both use Crest Pro Health® HD™ religiously, and our teeth are the whitest they have ever been. I have even noticed that the minor swelling I had in my gums is no longer visible. And the taste of Crest Pro Health® HD™ is far superior than any other toothpastes that I had used in the past. Digging deep to find something wrong, I could see that the step 1 stage could be a little harsh for folks with sensitive teeth &amp; gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really a great product, and it will be a staple in our oral care routine for years to come! Please keep in mind that I did receive this product free from Crest to try out, but I would never let that skew my opinion.</li>
            <li> In full disclosure- I received a free trial of this product from Crest.  However, I&#x27;m writing this because I liked the product, not because they are putting me up to anything or rewarding me in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste actually makes my mouth/teeth feel cleaner that any other I&#x27;ve tried.  The two step process really works to get deep clean and then a nice polish.  I was skeptical, but it does make a difference vs my previous toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend trying this product (even though it is a bit more expensive than normal toothpaste).</li>
            <li> When Crest offered me a free sample of Crest Pro Health HD I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work but I was willing to give it a try. I have to say I love this product and saw an improvement within 4 days of using it. My teeth are not super yellow but I do drink coffee and soda so there is some discoloration. I&#x27;ve received several compliments on how much whiter my teeth are now.</li>
            <li> Crest was kind enough to let me try this product for free through BuzzAgent!  I have been using this product for about a month and I can already see a difference not only in the color of my teeth, but also how fresh my mouth feels for extended periods of time.  I very highly recommend this product to anyone looking to change up their routine.  The only reason I scored it 4/5 stars is because I find it difficult to do the 2 step system any other time than at night before bed.  With my 3-nager I barely get to brush my teeth with 1 tube of toothpaste let alone trying to do 2 steps for 1 minute a piece.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see much progress even though I brushed my teeth twice a day.</li>
            <li> I LOVE crest products and have used the 3D tooth paste and white strips for years.  In receiving Crest 3D Pro Health tooth paste system as a free trial through BuzzAgent I was really excited to give it a try.  It consisted of a two step process that was super easy and no different than the daily process of brushing your teeth.  I believe that it is a great product for some people but it didn&#x27;t work out that well for me.  It gave me a strange aftertaste, turned the edges of my gums white after repeated use and made my mouth peel slightly.  I think that the whitening part of it might be slightly too strong for my mouth for regular use.  That being said, I did notice that it was starting to whiten/brighten my teeth and I feel like it would have worked well had I been able to continue to use it.  For now I will stick with Regular Crest 3D tooth paste but look forward to new Crest products!!</li>
            <li> For the past several weeks, I have been trying the new crest Pro Health HD toothpaste thanks to crest for sending me a free sample of this product. As the package arrived I loved the presentation. It comes in a cardboard base with a slot for each tube. Presentation- 5 out of 5!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the first tube which is step 1- of which you brush with for 1 minute. I really enjoy the flavor. It is quite a pleasant minty taste and leaves my mouth feeling fresh. You spit but don&#x27;t rinse with this step. The second tube which is step 2 is the whitening gel. There was not much taste to that gel but it wasn&#x27;t unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this toothpaste for several weeks now and to be honest I don&#x27;t see the difference in my teeth whiteness. As I said I enjoy the taste but I find it a bit of a pain to stop halfway through brushing to add a squirt of whitening gel when other toothpastes claim do do the same thing all in one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So would I buy this on my own, probably not. I will stick with my Colgate all in one whitening toothpaste but it was a good experience to get to try a different brand.</li>
            <li> *Please note that I received Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste from Crest via BzzAgent for free, and I am posting this review only after using this product.* I had high hopes for Crest Pro Health HD.  Although I am not a coffee drinker, I do enjoy drinking tea, and I could always use extra whitening power.  The directions were simple enough, and easy to time because I have a Sonicare toothbrush that beeps every 30 seconds so I knew when to proceed to the Step 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After committing a month to this regimen, this is what I&#x27;ve noticed.  My teeth are smooth, and clean, and seem to be whiter than normal, although nobody mentioned anything to me directly or seemed to notice.  Step 1&#x27;s Purifying Cleanser seemed to be like the Crest Pro Health Advanced toothpaste that I was already accustomed to using, and I found that to be enjoyable.  However, that is where the similarity ended because after the first minute ended and I proceeded to step 2, the pleasantness was undone with a weird chemical taste from the Perfecting Gel.  Not so perfect, in my opinion.  I am used to having a fresh, minty mouth after brushing my teeth, but Step 2 seems to eliminate the initial burst of freshness that Step 1 leaves.  It really is too bad because while having to go through a 2-step process isn&#x27;t the most convenient, I can deal with the extra step.  What I can&#x27;t deal with is anything leaving a bad taste in my mouth.  Literally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to like Crest Pro Health HD, I think I will be going back to my regular Crest Pro Health,  or at least until Crest can figure out a way to make a gel that leaves my mouth feeling fresh again.</li>
            <li> We received the Pro-Health HD Two Step Toothpaste from Crest using BzzAgent. Loved using this! Only criticism is that it seemed to have more of Step 2 than Step 1 product.</li>
            <li> I was already a fan of Crest whitening products before having the opportunity to sample this product for free from Crest. I have always found Crest products to be superior to other brands. However, I have very sensitive teeth, and teeth whitening usually comes at the expense of comfort. I have not found that to be the case with Crest HD. I have been using it for several weeks now and have not experienced any increased sensitivity or pain. I noticed that my teeth were whiter after the first use. Although I do not love the flavor of the toothpaste, it is comparable to the flavor of other whiteners on the market. I would recommend this product to those looking to quickly whiten their teeth at a very reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> I got this for free to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first use, your mouth definitely feels different. That&#x27;s not such a good thing but once your gums get used to the hydrogen peroxide. Once you get used to it, it feels clean and no more discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to my normal toothpaste I&#x27;m not noticing a big difference but I think it would take some more time for anything visible. I would give it a go for a couple of more weeks and then will decide if I will switch or stay with my old toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this one a shot, it might be for you.</li>
            <li> I tried this toothpaste free as a trial from BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;I did not like this toothpaste at all.  The first time I tried it, the taste and texture completely turned me off.  I did not care for the dual step process, it adds time to my routine and I would rather not spend extra time with my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;I did give it more of a trial, just in case my initial reactions were incorrect, but nothing changed.  I also did not see any change in the color of my teeth or the health of my teeth/gums.  I happily returned to my normal toothpaste, and I will not keep Crest HD in my medicine cabinet!  I&#x27;m thankful for the opportunity to try it, but I would not spend money on this product.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I have healthy and white teeth, and always have.  Crest has always been my toothpaste of choice.  With that said, I think the Crest Pro Health HD would be an excellent product if you are looking to &amp;#34;catch up&amp;#34; to where you think your teeth should be.  You have to be serious about it though.  When you brush with one tube of tooth paste, it is easy to get into the &amp;#34;apply, brush, spit, and rinse&amp;#34; routine.  I had issues with the &amp;#34;apply, brush, spit, apply again, brush again,  spit again, and rinse,&amp;#34; but if you are serious about whiter teeth, it&#x27;s a small sacrifice to use two tubes.  The first bottle of actual tooth paste was pleasant and nice to use.  The second bottle was definitely a polish that could make someone feel they are taking positive steps right away.  So, if you are looking to whiten your teeth, give this a shot (but if you&#x27;re teeth are already white, Crest&#x27;s other products could fill the bill).  Thanks for letting me try this product for free, Crest!</li>
            <li> This product is great!  I was sent a sample by Bzzagent in order to complete this review.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for 4 weeks now.  I love how clean my mouth feels and I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth are a few shades lighter.  I&#x27;ve always had problems with whitening products making my teeth super sensitive, but I have not noticed any sensitive teeth issues with this product which is great.  My teeth look a lot shinier.  Overall I&#x27;ve been very pleasantly surprised by this product.  Definitely worth spending a few extra bucks on a good toothpaste system!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff!!!!!  I really love how I don&#x27;t have to stick strips to my teeth and have the weird slimy residue like the Crest white Strips have.  I also don&#x27;t have teeth sensitivity that I get when I use the strips.  This change is a little more subtle.  In addition, I also LOVE the taste that it&#x27;s not too strong and your teeth feel clean and soft ALL day long!  I will for sure buy again! I got this Crest HD kit free through Bzzagent! I am so happy that they chose me for this trial!  SO amazing of a product.</li>
            <li> I received this free through BzzAgent. I only used it three times because the taste of step 2 was so horrible. My wife, who apparently has no taste buds has continued to use it for the past 3 weeks.  I do not see any difference in whiteness.  I am glad I did not spend money on this.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using the Crest Pro Health HD product. My mouth felt healthier, and my smile was brighter! I have noticed whiter teeth, and it only took a little over a week to notice. I received many compliments on my smile. I&#x27;m so happy I tried the HD product, and want to continue it as my routine brush. I love Crest for all there products, and this did not disappoint. I even had my boyfriend try and he instantly loved the clean and refreshing feel it left. I recommend this product to anyone looking for a new way to enhance their smile.Couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better smile!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro-Health HD for about three weeks thanks to a promotion from Crest.  Immediately I noticed a difference in the way my mouth felt, especially in the morning.  My teeth feel cleaner and my breath is fresher.  I also noticed whiter teeth within a week.  I was a Crest user before, but enjoy this product much more.  I use to have sore gums after brushing and occasional bleeding, but that has not happened since I started using this product.  I would definitely recommend trying it out!</li>
            <li> I got this product to try it out in return for my review. My reviews are 100% my opinion. We have a family wedding coming up and I got  crest pro hd in the mail  to try it out.  It came in perfect time, since I was already planning to get the white teeth strips. I was a little hesitant since it was a toothpaste and most toothpaste promote to whiten your teeth and they really don&#x27;t work, but crest pro hd really works. I started using it immediately and I started seeing difference in my teeth after a week. So far I love the product.</li>
            <li> I got to try this free in a Bzzkit.  The two step process doesn&#x27;t really take any more time that how I would typically brush which is good.  One thing that takes some getting used to is that you are not supposed to spit after using the first step.  The one improvement I would suggest is making the cap on product 2 a flip top as the cap is on product 2 - it is much easier to open one handed when your other hand is holding the toothbrush you&#x27;ve used for step one. The actual whitening results are noticeable which is why overall it is a good product!</li>
            <li> Before providing a review of Crest Pro Health HD teeth whitening system, I should start by saying that I have been a Crest Pro Health user for quite some time now. And, over the years, I have used two different Crest teeth whitening strips. And, while I have always used Crest and been satisfied with their products, I was not a big fan of the whitening strips. I personally don&#x27;t find them to be convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After receiving a sample of this product as part of a BZZAgent promotion, I reviewed the contents of the package as well as the instructions. Why two tubes? There are two steps to this whitening process. Step One is a cleaning process with stannous fluoride for gingivitis reduction. The substance looks a lot like a normal toothpaste. It is blue in color and is a bit thicker than my standard toothpaste. Step Two is the whitener, which is a clear substance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions indicate you should use Step One for one minute, then rinse your brush BUT not your mouth, then use Step Two for one minute. This surprised me a bit because I brush longer than two minutes. So, I found myself brushing with Step One a bit longer than directed, maybe an extra minute. Because the taste of Step One was pleasant, I did not feel rushed or anxious to get to Step Two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applying Step Two to the brush, I learned to use caution when squeezing from the tube because the substance comes out from the tube much quicker and easier than with Step One. I found Step Two to taste very much like the same substance used with the Crest whitening strips. Because I had cleaned my teeth already, I used a light brushing motion with Step Two, gently applying the whitener to my teeth. After one minute of brushing, I would rinse my mouth and brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest claims to give you a 6x healthier mouth and 6x brighter smile after using the system for one week. I did use the product for a solid week and probably all but one day. I don&#x27;t think I had a 6x whiter smile, but there is no question my smile was/is a few shades whiter. I absolutely feel like my mouth is healthier with this toothpaste. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d feel that way if I only used the one minute of brushing as directed by Crest, however.ere is no question my smile was/is a few shades whiter. I absolutely feel like my mouth is healthier with this toothpaste. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d feel that way if I only used the one minute of brushing as directed by Crest, however.</li>
            <li> I received this kit from Crest for review. I am a heavy coffee drinker so I do have some staining issues and some &amp;#34;morning breath&amp;#34;.In a nutshell, this product works! My teeth and mouth feel cleaner than ever! I wanted to be sure about the whitening aspect so I took before and after pics. After just one week there was definite improvement. After years of one-squeeze-brush-and-go, using a two part system is different but well worth it. Only time will tell how much more whitening will take place but it&#x27;s off to a great start</li>
            <li> I received this free from Crest through Buzz Agent to give it a try and voice my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I did not like the product.  I hated the taste.  The first step paste tastes like the diet gum from the 80’s with a hint of candy cigarettes.  It was easy to apply but not a great foamy feel.  The second step of gel I could not get through without trying to get the taste out of my mouth.  The second step gel tastes like the whiting strips.  It is also slimy.  I gave it a try for 2 weeks, I did not notice a big difference in my teeth.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro Health toothpastes for several years, so I was excited to get a free sample of Crest Pro Health HD from Crest (as part of a BzzAgent campaign) and try it out. After a few weeks with it, the jury is still out on whether I prefer it to my regular Crest Pro Health paste. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;* Leaves my teeth nice and clean&lt;br /&gt;* Tastes nice (but no different from anything else, really)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;* Gel. I don&#x27;t like gel toothpastes. I want this in an actual paste.&lt;br /&gt;* Switching pastes halfway through brushing is kind of a pain in the neck. Plus the two tubes take up more space in my medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;* No other flavors (yet)&lt;br /&gt;* After three weeks, my teeth still feel weirdly sensitive after every use. However, I have really short roots, so this might just be me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, while my teeth feel pretty and shiny, there are a lot of little annoyances that bother me about this toothpaste. Maybe I&#x27;ll buy it again if it comes in other flavors and in actual paste format, but for now I think I will stick to my normal Crest Pro Health toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Have you ever left the dentist office wishing your teeth could feel that clean everyday. I tried the CrestPro Health HD Toothpaste from bzzagent.com and was surprised how fresh my mouth felt. I was nervous that I would feel that 2 tubes of toothpaste would be too time consuming, but it didn&#x27;t take up as much time as I thought it would initially. The first step with flouride that strips away plaque feels like going to the dentist. The second tube is the perfecting gel. It had a slightly different taste and I did not notice a large difference in the color of my teeth. I did enjoy though the nice clean feeling on my teeth after use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for FREE thanks to Crest! I absolutely love the way this system makes my mouth feel. My teeth and gums have never felt cleaner and this leaves my mouth feeling fresh all day. I will step down to once daily after I finish the tubes I have. I have definitely noticed my teeth becoming whiter as well!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t suppose a bleaching product should taste good, but this one is exceptionally bad. I want to brush my teeth after using it. But it makes my teeth  feel clean and does help whiten even after only a couple of uses. And since the whole process only takes 2 minutes it&#x27;s tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product free by bzz agent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d seen Crest Pro Health HD in the store and even had it in my hand before. I would always put it back because I was scared that I would have a sensitivity to it and it&#x27;s not cheap for toothpaste, around $15. I was super excited when I received it for free in the mail from Crest to review. I have a sensitive mouth that can&#x27;t handle whitening products, especially in toothpastes. The mucosa in my mouth will peel off in layers. Colgate Total is the brand I was sticking with because the reaction wasn&#x27;t as bad, just slight shedding. The original Crest Pro Health whitening toothpaste was the worst for my mouth. It would peel off in thick layers and leave my mouth bloody and sore. This is why I was scared to try this product. I assumed it would be the same ingredients, but more concentrated, which would mean a more severe reaction. This is a warning that Crest has listed, so I know many consumers experience this reaction. I was still hesitant to try the product when I received it in the mail. There are 2 steps for the process. The 1st step is to clean your teeth for a minute with the stannous flouride toothpaste. It does a wonderful job at removing tarter and plaque. Plus, you are left with a fresh mouth all day and no more bad morning breath. The 2nd step is to whiten your teeth with the hydrogen peroxide gel. All you do is brush for 1 minute. Spit and do not rinse your mouth out at any point during the 2 minute cleaning. I keep the 2 steps with my toothbrush, so I don&#x27;t forget to use both products. It&#x27;s only takes a dab of each for a fresh and white smile. After a month of use, my mouth feels clean all the time and my teeth are whiter. I&#x27;ve never had results like this with only whitening toothpaste. I haven&#x27;t had much of a sensitivity to it either. My mouth has only shed 1 the surface layer once, which is the best I&#x27;ve experience since the whitening craze took over the toothpaste aisle. I will definitely be purchasing this product as my everyday toothpaste from now on. It&#x27;s worth every penny and is lasting a long time.It&#x27;s worth every penny and is lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> Amazing product provides a fresh from the dentist clean feeling. Whitens teeth nicely. Got lots of praise from my dentist during my last check-up using this product. Couple with regular flossing and mouthwash and you cant go wrong. Very nice.</li>
            <li> I think this product was great! It really promotes brushing teeth longer than 30 seconds which in my opinion  is much needed! After the first step my mouth would feel a little dry but once finishing the second step I was able to rinse and refresh things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed changes within 2 days(4 brushes) I have also looked for it in Walmart and feel it&#x27;s a great price point for whitening products!&lt;br /&gt;I would highly&lt;br /&gt;Reccomend this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been into whitening products: trays, strips, lights, goop, grit, gross odors/tastes . . . yuck! I&#x27;ve tried SO many of them.  They were expensive, took too much time to use, caused tooth sensitivity, etc. And after all that I endured, the results often weren&#x27;t even all that spectacular! It just wasn&#x27;t worth it, so I just went back to using plain old toothpaste. It&#x27;s tough to stick with a product that you don&#x27;t like, after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said,  I was recently offered an opportunity to try Crest Pro Health HD through a BzzAgent campaign. I admittedly hesitated because those awful experiences with other whitening products flooded back into my memory. However, I took the plunge and signed up for the  campaign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my BzzKit arrived with the Crest Pro Health HD kit, I was glad to see that there weren&#x27;t any crazy contraptions involved. The kit contains two tubes of paste, and after some quick reading, I was thrilled to learn that it&#x27;d only take about a minute of brushing with both pastes. That evening, I gave it a go, using a soft manual toothbrush. Step 1 is the cleanser which uses Stannous Fluoride to  deeply clean away plaque. That paste was pleasantly minty, a bit thick, and had smooth consistency. I really felt like it was powering through the plaque, as well as remaining bits and pieces of dinner I had that evening. Step 2 is a slick gel that uses hydrogen peroxide to polish and whiten teeth. As I brushed with it, my toothbrush was gliding around my mouth. It left quite a nice shine, and while it didn&#x27;t make my teeth spectacularly white on the first try, it did make my teeth look polished. The best part?! Using Crest Pro Health HD was no different than the act of brushing my teeth with any other toothpaste, so I predicted that it would be a whitening product that I could actually stick with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As promised, after a week, my teeth looked considerably whiter and shinier! And as I&#x27;ve kept using Crest Pro Health HD, my teeth have continued to look as good, if not better! Plus, my gums and teeth are looking and feeling much healthier. This kit has truly done wonders for my mouth,  without me having to do anything different in my routine -- it was as simple as switching my toothpaste! Thankfully, I&#x27;ll never have to use those dreadful other whitening products or paying for expensive professional whitening. I totally can&#x27;t wait to show the dentist my mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#Sponsored #GotItFree #BzzAgentinued to look as good, if not better!

            <li> Tried Crest Pro Health® HD free thanks to Crest. At first, I thought the two step process was extra work brushing (who wants to brush twice?) and I wasn&#x27;t too keen on the toothpaste flavor. However, after trying this for several weeks, I can now say that this isn&#x27;t any more difficult than my normal brushing routine. I might actually be brushing longer now than before. In addition, I&#x27;m now use to the flavor and don&#x27;t mind the taste anymore.</li>
            <li> I skeptical at first but I will say that this product actually does work. The reason I was concerned in the beginning is because I have sensitive teeth and a majority of whitening products I can not use for long periods of time. I started off using the product twice a day (morning and night) and the biggest thing I noticed first how clean my teeth were feeling and the whitening results came quicker that I thought. By the end of the first week could already tell were white and shiny. After three weeks there was a major different and I started to back off and only using once a day and my teeth still look great! I think this product is awesome for people with sensitive teeth! I was lucky to receive this product to try and review for Crest Pro Health.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product.  Thanks to Crest, I was able to try it for free!  My teeth were noticeably whiter, and my mouth felt very clean.  I liked the 2-step process.  This product does almost completely eliminate morning-breath.  I was also glad that it did not cause tooth sensitivity, which normally whiters do for me.</li>
            <li> I got to try the Crest Pro Health HD kit for free from BzzAgent. Although, I was a bit skeptical about having to do 2 steps instead of just one, the results are worth it! My teeth definitely felt squeaky clean, the way they do when you leave the dental office after a cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1 is the paste that contains fluoride and looks just like standard toothpaste. Brush with step 1 for 60 seconds, then spit. DO NOT rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2 is the polish which is a clear gel. Then add the gel to your toothbrush and brush for another 60 seconds. Then rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voila! Clean and polished teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Important instructions: You MUST use both of them and follow the instructions correctly. I learned this the hard way. I thought I could get away with just using the paste instead of the gel. DO NOT do this. You&#x27;ll be left with a really weird taste and feeling in your mouth. Take the extra 60 seconds to do step 2. Its worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product for free courtesy of Crest and BzzAgent. This two-step toothpaste definitely whitens your teeth effectively, but unfortunately, the whitening peroxide gel is too strong for my gums; when used two times a day a couple days in a row, it causes little annoying sores. The cleanser (first step) is also not my favorite, I found the feel of it in my mouth and the aftertaste to be very strange, almost dry and chalky. However, compared to other brands of whitening toothpaste, the Crest Pro-Health HD made the biggest difference in the whiteness of my teeth - so if your teeth and gums aren&#x27;t very sensitive, I&#x27;d say give it a go! You also only need a little bit, so the set is going to last you a long time.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure, I tried this product thanks to Crest.  I love the product itself!  It takes just two minutes; one with the pleasantly gritty purifying cleanser, and then after spitting but not rinsing, one minute with the perfecting gel added to the toothbrush.  The cleanser really feels like it&#x27;s getting work done and the gel smooths everything over; both are refreshingly minty.  Best of all, there&#x27;s no sensitivity like I experience with other extreme whitening products - no white spots on gums, no tooth pain, etc.  I really love the product, but I take one star off for two reason:  the price is a bit steep for an everyday toothpaste, so I wouldn&#x27;t probably use it on a regular basis, just &amp;#34;as needed&amp;#34; to give me a boost of whitening.  And two, it&#x27;s a bit inconvenient to have two containers.  I wish the product was in one container with two separate openings.</li>
            <li> So, I am at the halfway point through my usual testing period for these types of products. I got this from BzzAgent to test.  Toothpaste is super important to me and the aspects that are most important to me are taste, price, availability, ability to whiten, anti-cavity, packaging and ingredients. First, there are two separate bottles. Both of them have different caps. I use an electric toothbrush that is on a timer. This is a pain for me because Step one has an easy flip top and Step two has a twist top. WHY??? To make my life more difficult... NOT EASIER CREST!! Make them both flip tops, guys!!&lt;br /&gt;Next, price. Compared to other brands it&#x27;s right on target. Ability to whiten. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. I didn&#x27;t see a noticeable difference on the first use or on the mid-point either.  I use a whitening toothpaste without an extra whitening gel. So, I guess the whitening gel is in question. It doesn&#x27;t have to stay on any longer than the minute you use to brush it on so I am questioning it&#x27;s effectiveness. I am seeing my dentist in 2 weeks so we will see what he has to say. I don&#x27;t have problem teeth to begin with but I don&#x27;t have beaming whites either. If he notices a difference, that will be the test!&lt;br /&gt;I do love the taste. Neither product is chemical tasting or unmanageable to brush with. I do not like the ingredients as I would like to see more natural ingredients included.&lt;br /&gt;I will check in again towards the end of the testing period to see if I saw more of a difference!</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t use whitening products, since I have sensitive teeth, and the whitening agents usually cause increased sensitivity, but I thought I&#x27;d give Crest Pro Health® HD™ a try, to see what happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Crest Pro Health® HD™ for one full week, twice a day, following the instructions. My teeth are naturally not-that-white, and I don&#x27;t help things by drinking lots of tea, so I was hoping to see some good results after the week was up. I took a before picture, and started the trial. There are two different products in the kit - a cleaning toothpaste, which tasted and felt like a standard toothpaste, and a whitening gel, which, frankly, I did not like. It had an odd flavor - or maybe it was just a lack of mintiness that didn&#x27;t cover up the other flavors of the gel. It wasn&#x27;t an unpleasant flavor - more of just an odd _lack_ of flavor. But, I muddled through for the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the week was up, I took an &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; picture, and I could really notice a difference in my teeth&#x27;s whiteness. It wasn&#x27;t a _huge_ difference, but there was definitely some whitening going on. My wife could also see the difference between the pictures. So, yes, the Crest Pro Health® HD™ _did_ whiten my teeth as promised - not dramatically, but I think with extended usage, the whitening would become more pronounced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I also did notice the increased tooth sensitivity from using this product. So, even though it _did_ do a pretty good job of whitening, with a minimum of hassle, I&#x27;ll probably not be using it as my everyday toothpaste. I&#x27;ll probably put it in the rotation every few months - just to re-whiten a bit, but I need a sensitive-teeth toothpaste on a day-to-day basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, Crest Pro Health® HD™ delivered on it&#x27;s whitening promise, and if they ever do come out with a version for sensitive teeth, I&#x27;ll definitely give that one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I did receive a free sample of this product from Crest via BzzAgent)</li>
            <li> I got this product via BzzAgent as a part of a promotion from the brand. The product is awesome and like it promised gave immediate results within a week. It is a two-step brushing process and takes no more than 2 and a half minutes. It thoroughly cleanses your teeth while giving you a healthy feel and white brilliant teeth. It is a win, win, win! It reduces plaque and gingivitis too!.</li>
            <li> I am trying Crest Pro Health® HD™ product for free, thanks to Crest. I have been using it since June 12, 2015 faithfully twice a day. The oral hygiene aspect of the product is great. The fact that I must use it faithful helps reinforce the oral hygiene good habit. I am pleased that Crest continues to develop ever improved product offering. All of Crest&#x27;s Pro Health products are wonderful from my experience. #GotItFree</li>
            <li> When I initially received this package from BzzAgent, I was excited to try it out because I&#x27;d never tried a two step system before. I&#x27;ve read reviews saying that the two steps take too long or that it&#x27;s too much, but I haven&#x27;t really minded the two steps since, and have actually really enjoyed having them separated. Step one makes me teeth feel very clean, a just back from the dentist clean. Step two has a less noticeable immediate effect but, over time, has actually seemed to slightly lighten my teeth. Overall, it has made me feel like my teeth are cleaner once I am finished with both steps. I&#x27;ve had less morning breath and overall just a cleaner feel to my teeth both after brushing and throughout the day. The one flaw with this product is the packaging. Within a few days of use the top of the step one tube came apart, releasing toothpaste and causing the tube to be unsealed. The packaging of step two wasn&#x27;t much better. The product tends to puddle at the bottom of the lid, wasting product and making it very messy. If it weren&#x27;t for the packaging I would love this product, but the packaging makes me unsure I&#x27;d want to continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product free thanks to CREST and I loved it! After using it for less than a week you could see a HUGE difference. And my teeth feel SUPER clean as well. My husband had some big stains on his front teeth for years and after 2 weeks you could hardly notice them and now after 4 weeks they are pretty much gone!! Amazing!!! The kit comes with 2 tubes and you use each one for 1 minute. My only complaint is that the number 2 toothpaste has an unpleasant taste that I do not enjoy. I did figure out how to overcome the taste by not rinsing my mouth or my toothbrush after brushing with number one. It&#x27;s so minty it covers up any unpleasant taste. I used it religiously for the first 2 weeks twice a day. Now that my teeth are looking good I use this with my regular toothpaste occasionally to maintain my results. Since I&#x27;m super picky about chemicals I put into my mouth I like that I can still use my regular toothpaste and this together to keep my teeth white. I&#x27;ve used it now for 4 weeks total and my teeth are still looking nice and white! I was VERY happy with this product! I would give it MORE THAN 5 STARS if I could!!! Thanks Crest!!!</li>
            <li> I received Crest HD for free in a Bzzkit from BzzAgent and I love this product. I have been using it once a day for about a little over 3 weeks and I have seen a tremendous difference. A few shades whiter at least. Not only is my smile whiter but I feel my teeth being a lot cleaner too! No plaque build up which is great!!! So happy I got to try this and make this my new toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit before trying this paste, I had sworn off Crest for good. I had tried their Pro Health Complete mouthwash last year, and the stannous fluoride in left my teeth so badly stained that I had to visit my dentist for a professional cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;After trying this paste (after receiving a free sample from BzzAgent), it&#x27;s safe to say Crest has won me back. From the first use of this two-step system, I saw a noticeable difference in my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was the mild taste and great feel to the system. The mint taste is subtle without tasting too fake. The pastes themselves felt great on my teeth too. The first step, the Purifying cleanser, really clung to my teeth and had just a touch of grit that left my teeth with a polished feel. The second step, the Perfecting gel, had the whitening power that felt clean on my gums. If you have extremely sensitive gums, this step might be irritating to you.&lt;br /&gt;After just a few days, my teeth had less of a dingy yellow tone, and really have a nice natural white glow to them. To top it off, I just went in for my semi-annual cleaning today and my hygienist commented on the lack of tartar and staining on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Even though this paste contains stannous fluoride, I haven&#x27;t had any of the staining I experienced with the Crest Pro Health product I had tried. I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li> I received a product sample of Crest ProHealth HD from Crest and I am so happy with the results so far! My husband is a dentist so I have sampled a wide variety of toothpastes and I can honestly say this is the only toothpaste I have used that holds up to promises of long lasting freshness. I won&#x27;t say morning breath is nonexistent when I wake up, but it is definitely much better than normal. My teeth feel like I just had a cleaning all the time now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the whitening,  there is a definite improvement and I wish I had thought to have my husband compare my teeth to shade tabs before and after starting Crest HD. I have one tooth I injured as a child and this has caused it to  be slightly darker than my other teeth. I have been hesitant about in office treatments and whitening strips because I feared it would not respond well to whitening (and potentially just stand out more), but this product gives me hope for further improvement because it has already brought it shades closer to the whiteness of my other teeth. If just that one tooth had whitened, l would have been ecstatic so I am thrilled to have a complete smile of healthier, whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this product on behalf of Crest and  Bzzagent. I have always been a fan of Crest whitening strips and have received many compliments on my &amp;#34;glowing white teeth&amp;#34;. I began using this product in early June and now a month later I definitely notice whiter teeth and my most recent dental exam was the first of many with zero cavities! Maybe a coincidence but I definitely feel as though this product keeps my teeth cleaner feeling than any other toothpaste I have tried.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using the Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste for about two weeks now and we&#x27;ve both seen results. (I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand).&lt;br /&gt;I was a little worried about having to use the two step process, but I definitely think it&#x27;s worth it to spend a few extra minutes each day while brushing. My teeth are pretty white to start with, just minor coffee stains...I&#x27;m a two cup a day coffee drinker. I&#x27;ve noticed this past week that my teeth are starting to shine more and the stains are diminishing. However, it would have been nice to have received a tooth color chart to really know how much the whitening is progressing. Having been a Crest Whitening Strip user in the past, I do have to say that the Step 2 paste does taste a bit like the Whitening Strip gel...but definitely not as much as the strips. There is a big baking soda after taste that I feel is left if you don&#x27;t do a good job rinsing your mouth, however, I do think it helps with my overall mouth freshness. All in all, I really do think this product is working and I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I received a package of this thru Crest to try out and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this new Crest Pro Health HD system for a week and took pictures along the way to track if it truly whitened my teeth. I can say that I feel there was a subtle change, but nothing like advertised. My photos are attached, the after photo is a week later, with using this every day, with me in the red shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I still like the product and would consider using it again in the future since it gives me a fresh and clean feeling and is not gritty or lingering in my mouth all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one suggestion would be that they fix the cap on the 2nd stage tube to be flip to open, like the 1st stage tube, instead of a twist off. It just makes sense to have them open the same way, and flip to open is a lot simpler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another good product from Crest, but not great.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free thanks to Crest and after a few weeks of testing it out all I have are words of praise. You will get that extreme clean sensation during the day, your teeth will be brighter and after a few weeks they will be whiter (you have to use it twice a day and as directed). It&#x27;s even safe for sensitive teeth and will not interfere with previous dental work, unlike some products. What I love most is that polished feeling I get all day, just like stepping out of the dentist office after a checkup.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample from BzzAgent and after trying it my teeth have never felt so good. I feel like I just stepped out of the dentist office after having my teeth cleaned. They are visibly whiter and have less plaque buildup than my last visit to the dentist. I had less scraping and poking which was a plus for me.</li>
            <li> I started using Crest Pro Health HD about a month ago  after receiving a free trial from Crest and after 4weeks of constant use, there is no doubt that my teeth are at least 1-2 shades whiter. I am a constant coffee drinker and never thought anything short of professional (and expensive) techniques would whiten my teeth. The 2 steps are easy to follow and results are obvious. My only criticism would be that I wish both of the tooth pastes could be combined into one easy step. It would just make it more convenient for the consumer. All in all a good product with definite results</li>
            <li> I am a buzz agent and received a free sample of Crest HD 2-step toothpaste.  I hadn&#x27;t been to the dentist to get my teeth cleaned for a while and could feel a slight build up of plaque on a few teeth.  Before using the product my teeth were not very white.  After using the product my teeth are smooth and feel very clean, especially when used with my Sonicare toothbrush.  Additionally, the whiteness of my teeth has greatly improved.and I really like how all of my teeth, including the backside, are white and not just the front ones as when using a whitening strip.  I have used the toothpaste once a day for three weeks and have been very pleased.  I almost look forward to brushing because of the flavor and the clean feel!  One thing I would improve upon is the lid on the whitening tube.  The lid has to be twisted off and if not done before brushing begins it can be annoying to twist it off and find a place to sit it.  A flip lid on both tubes would be nice.  Overall, I would suggest this product to anyone wanting a clean fresh mouth and whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, product as expected</li>
            <li> No More Morning Breath!  Easy to use!  I received my Crest Pro Health HD free from Bzz Agent and I love this product.  You can get yours @#Target.  You will love the way your teeth feel like you visited the Denitist everytime you brush your teeth.  My husband started noticing my white teeth just a short time after I started using crest Pro health HD.  This is a two step product which is so easy to use.  Just use step 1 and brush for one minute then spit, but do not rinse and use step 2 and brush for another minute.  Then your done.  It&#x27;s so easy and you will love the results.  I hope you will join me in trying this Crest Pro Health HD.</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary from Crest and Bzzagent, but all opinions are of my own. I have been using this for several weeks now and I love it. I love anything I can use that will help prevent future stains on my teeth and keep them pearly white. The first step is basically like a toothpaste to cleanse your teeth and buff them clean. The second step is the whitening gel. My teeth sometimes feel a tad bit sensitive after using both but it goes away within minutes. I love how clean it makes my teeth feel and it is a great option to keep those teeth white in between cleanings.</li>
            <li> I got to try this for free from Crest.&lt;br /&gt;I admit that it really does make your teeth whiter, but certainly not 6x whiter.  I have white teeth to begin with, but they do get stained and I noticed that the surface stains were gone rather quickly.  The first step tastes great.  The second step was terrible.  Every time I use it I have to go back after I&#x27;m done with step 2 and either use mouthwash or brush my tongue again.  I like that it forces you to take the full 2 minutes to brush your teeth.  So many times I rush through brushing and this really made me aware of how long I should be doing it for.  I noticed a difference in brightness after 3 uses, which did not get brighter after the 2 weeks of usage.  I would probably use this before a special occasion, but definitely not as my everyday toothpaste.  I just can&#x27;t stand the peroxide flavor of the 2nd tube.</li>
            <li> I got this for free through BzzAgent and was rather skeptical because every specialty whitening product I&#x27;ve tried has made my teeth start to hurt after a couple of days, forcing me to quit whatever whitening regimen I&#x27;m on. I can&#x27;t even tell you how much money I&#x27;ve wasted on whitening kits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first part is a thick gel toothpaste that makes your mouth feel a bit dry. No big deal, just remember not to rinse! That was the hardest part, I  think. I actually count down 60 seconds to make sure I&#x27;m brushing long enough. I also make sure I get every portion of my mouth, so I work in quadrants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spit, then the second part is a whitening gel. It tastes slightly sweet and more or less like the gel in Crest Whitestrips. This part is easy, but after counting down 60 seconds for Part One, it does feel a bit tedious. However, per the American Dental Association, you&#x27;re supposed to be brushing your teeth for two minutes! (Did you know that? I didn&#x27;t!) So if you&#x27;re a better dental patient than I am, you&#x27;re probably already brushing for two minutes. Long story short, you&#x27;re not adding any more time to your morning rituals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now you can rinse! Totally painless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw whitening improvement after about a week, and my hypersensitive teeth have not become any more sensitive, even after a month of using this product daily. Additionally, I&#x27;ve had a couple of spots of gum recession regaining ground. (Now I&#x27;m wishing I had taken photos as evidence but don&#x27;t really feel comfortable getting that up close and personal with my phone.) My dentist will be pleased, I&#x27;m sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this product is a home run! Like I said, I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now, but I am nowhere near done with the product. Not even close. So while this is more expensive than regular toothpaste or even whitening toothpaste, it does last for quite a while and has excellent results. Additionally, it is generally cheaper than most of the whitening systems out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re like me and hate using whitening kits/strips due to sensitivity but find that whitening toothpaste just doesn&#x27;t have enough &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34; to it, Crest ProHealth HD is for you!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re like me and hate using whitening kits/strips due to sensitivity but find that whitening toothpaste just doesn&#x27;t have enough &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34; to it, Crest ProHealth HD is for you!</li>
            <li> I am trying out the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste as part of a free trial from Crest. So far it has done a good job of making my teeth feel clean, and my teeth are slightly brighter. I&#x27;ve been using it about two weeks now, and although it hasn&#x27;t made much difference in the darkest stains on my teeth, it does seem to have improved the overall look of my teeth. I drink a lot of coffee and tea, so I didn&#x27;t expect a big change. You have to brush with both types of toothpaste each time you brush, so this can be a little awkward, especially since the first tube foams up quite a bit, and the instructions also state that you shouldn&#x27;t rinse out your mouth in between each step. The first product has a nice minty flavor, but the second step has an unpleasant after taste that is slightly salty. I also noticed that my teeth seemed a little sensitive right after brushing, but this eventually went away. Overall the product does a good job cleaning, and an okay job whitening, considering it is an over the counter product and you are whitening while you brush without having to do any extra steps.</li>
            <li> I dont know about whiter, but feel cleaner.  My teeth feel clean and the two steps makes me brush longer.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any whitening, but I do drink coffee.  I think I&#x27;d buy it if I had a coupon.</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro Health HD for a few weeks now.  I have to say I was skeptical at first because it seems like toothpaste brands are always looking for a new gimmick.  I also thought that the 2 step process might be annoying since I have brushed for 2 minutes straight through my whole life.  While it is slightly more work to use Step 2 than to just brush with one toothpaste, it only adds about 15 seconds to the process which is not too strenuous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the Crest Pro Health HD I actually thought I saw a difference in the whiteness of my teeth, but I could not tell if I was just seeing what I was led to believe.  However, within a few weeks my teeth were noticeably whiter.  I only use Crest Pro Health HD once a day, at night, and I stick to my normal toothpaste routine in the morning because it did cause some sensitivity with my teeth.  I always have sensitivity when using whitening products though, so this was not unanticipated by me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome and I was very happy to try it.  I would probably not buy it all the time since it is so much more expensive than regular toothpaste (over $10).  I would buy it if I felt like my teeth were looking dingy or to start using before a big event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product free thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li> I started using Crest Prohealth [HD] Two step toothpaste middle of last month as a trial promotion from Crest.  I have to say there are a few unique things about it i was not really prepared for.  First off.  if you absolutely love drooling on yourself.  This is the toothpaste for you.  Ill explain why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste comes in a dual stage format.  You brush with step one, and prior to rinsing you brush with stage two.  Stage two is very tasty.  You often have to tell yourself &amp;#34;dont eat this, dont eat this dont eat it&amp;#34;  while brushing.  From what i can tell stage one is the abrasive cleaner, and stage two is like a hydrogen peroxide &amp;#34;polisher&amp;#34; to help pull out any stains.  AS an avid smoker i was pretty interested in trying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a month of use, and i started using this immediately after getting my teeth cleaned at the dentist for best results.  I honestly cannot notice any huge difference in whiteness.  But then again im not entirely sure i can or can not.  our bathroom doesnt have the best lighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, one of the best things about this toothpaste is it doesnt have those really little abrasive balls that everyone found out was getting under the gums and dentists were finding little plastic balls everywhere.  There is no trace of this what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the directions state.  Brush with step one for 30 seconds to 1 minute and without rinsing brush with step 2 for 30 seconds to 1 minute.  If you follow these directions you will drool all over yourself.  or at least i do.  Step 2 makes me uncontrolably salivate.  I cannot explain why or how but i could fill a swimming pool with the amount of saliva i produce with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, i enjoy the toothpaste.  You should check it out.  beware of ultra-salivation.</li>
            <li> Received this free to test through Bzzagent &amp; have used for a month so far. The 2nd step has peroxide in it so if you have sensitive or bleeding gums it will sting. However, once your mouth and gums get stronger &amp; healthier it doesn&#x27;t sting anymore. Another review said you could rinse with 50/50 peroxide/water &amp; it works just as well. I can&#x27;t agree 100% because the act of brushing it around your teeth and gums seems like more focused coverage to me. I already had a healthy brushing regiment and white teeth to start &amp; still experienced a noticeable difference in how clean the surface of my teeth felt. They were much smoother, like no residue at all was left behind. The whitening factor is noticeable over time but not a quick fix. But think about it, if a person has darker teeth to start the change will be more dramatic. It&#x27;s hard to get 6x whiter when your teeth are already pretty white. I could see this product being wonderful for smokers and heavy coffee drinkers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product but at $13 I&#x27;ll buy with a sale and coupon &amp; probably only use it for the morning brush. #gotfree</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference</li>
            <li> I realize that there are a million products on the market right now that promise to whiten your teeth, and if you are like me you have not found anything that actually works!  Until now! Crest Pro Health® HD has made a VERY visible difference on the whiteness of my teeth and I am so surprised! When I receive a Free Crest Pro-Health HD Kit  in the mail from Crest (thanks Crest!) I never thought that a toothpaste product would be able to make the change that I have seen in just a few weeks of using it.  It only takes 2 minutes to complete the process, so it doesn&#x27;t take any longer than brushing your teeth with normal, ineffective toothpaste; I actually prefer the two step method because it breaks up the monotony or brushing your teeth for 2 consistent minutes.  The very first time I tried Crest Pro Health® HD my mouth felt incredibly clean and fresh, and morning breath is a thing of the past!  You wake up with your  mouth feeling as clean as it did when you went to bed! The only thing I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of is the texture of the step 2 gel; after using the step 1 paste the step 2 gel is a strange consistency-I got over this quickly and I think anyone who uses Crest Pro Health HD will too.  I can&#x27;t wait to go back to the dentist because I KNOW that they will be impressed with how healthy my teeth and gums are.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste I have ever use. I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> 3 starts might be generous. I normally use the Colgate Optic White toothpaste but got this via BzzAgent (Thank you!) for trial/review purposes. I was super excited to try it because who doesn&#x27;t want whiter teeth but was disappointed to find that it didn&#x27;t seem to make that much of a difference. What it did do was make my gums super sensitive and I don&#x27;t usually have any issues like that. After a week or two, I couldn&#x27;t really take the gum abuse anymore and reduced my usage of this toothpaste to 1x a day (instead of 2) but have slowly weaned back 100% to my Colgate go-to paste. I have used the Colgate whitening pen (the one int he bottom of the toothbrush) in combination with the toothpaste and found much better results and faster results.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this stuff and had to buy it, after just one use of the sample I could tell a difference.  Causes some sensitivity for me but so do all the other whitening treatments I have used.  I could tell more of a difference with this than whitestrips.</li>
            <li> Really works and affordable price (even better that I got it for free - thanks for Crest). It only take 2 minutes (1 min each on each of the 2-step tubes).  But given the size of the 2 tubes, not very convenient to travel with.  Mouth feels cleaner but a strange feeling on gums which does go away  throughout the day.  Teeth color goes a few shades whiter after a week&#x27;s use.  I will see if how long it will last if stop using for a while. Definitely worth the try!</li>
            <li> I received this toothpaste for free, courtesy of Crest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest Pro Health HD is two toothpastes which you have to use consecutively each time you brush. This would not be a big deal if I found that it significantly whitened my teeth but it hasn&#x27;t. Granted, I like to drink black coffee and red wine (not at the same time) so getting my teeth whiter is a challenge. The toothpaste tastes fine. The texture of the second toothpaste (the &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; one) is a little more goopy than standard toothpaste and sometimes likes to fall off my toothbrush which is mildly annoying.  After using it for a couple of weeks I have not noticed my teeth being whiter but I have noticed that they feel a bit more sensitive than usual.  Not 100% sure that this is related to the toothpaste but it&#x27;s the only new thing that&#x27;s happening to my teeth so it&#x27;s likely. I give it 3 out of 5 starts because I feel like the toothpaste really wanted to whiten my teeth but it just didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really experienced noticeable results with whitening toothpaste.  Same goes for this product.  If you&#x27;re looking for a huge difference in the whiteness of your teeth, I don&#x27;t think a toothpaste is going to cut it.  That said, I do really like this product.  The step one leaves a strange chalky taste in your mouth, but it goes away after using step 2.  After step 2, there is a slight peroxide taste, but it doesn&#x27;t last long.  For me, it&#x27;s more of a symbol that it&#x27;s actually working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure: received this product as a free sample as part of a marketing campaign.  They did ask me to write a review, but I tried to be completely honest.</li>
            <li> I was able to try Crest Pro Health HD Daily two step toothpaste for free thanks to Crest. I was both weary and excited to try this product as I have tried other teeth whitening products and strips before. The two step toothpaste is easy to use and to me doesn&#x27;t take extra time. The first toothpaste is used to get rid of bacteria and plaque while the second one is a nice whitening polish. I love that neither toothpaste has a weird taste and my breath smells nice and fresh after using them. My teeth were noticeable whiter after a week and now I only use the toothpaste a few times a week to maintain their whiteness. Love that the toothpastes are strong enough to make a difference but not too strong that I feel that weird tingling sensation on them.</li>
            <li> I did check, how to make your teeth white, so on my searching I find this  Crest HD,, and this is really works, I have a  yellow color  Teeth, but since I try  this for a couple of weeks, I can see a Little bit,  changes  of my teeth,  it looks  whiter,,, and everytime I  finish brush my teeth,  it feels so clean,,,, I really love it, I can really highly recommence  this product,,, I hope this review can help you,,,</li>
            <li> I got this free.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it since it is easy and fast.  The 2 minutes seems long but it less time than other forms. Wish the results were more striking faster.  Make sure to rinse well or peroxide will make your mouth dry.  It is a decent cost for what you get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Crest Pro-Health HD Two-Step Toothpaste for over a week now and can see that my teeth are a lot whiter. It gets my teeth just as clean as the other Crest Pro-Health I was using before. Seems like a very good product to me.</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent and Crest for the promo trial of this great product!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always skeptical of products that seem so simple but make big claims. Two minutes twice a day to make my teeth noticeably whiter? No way, I thought. But I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing you should know about this product is that it does NOT taste like your regular toothpaste. Step 1 looks like that familiar blue gel, and it is kinda minty, but Step 2 is a clear, goopy gel that tastes like peroxide. You aren&#x27;t going to finish brushing with this product and feel kissably fresh. Plus, you may see tiny white splotches on your gums or tongue (do not be alarmed--this is totally normal.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you, though, what you give up in that minty-fresh feeling, you get back in spades. First, my mouth and teeth have never felt cleaner than they do after brushing with this product. I also didn&#x27;t experience any of the sensitivity that I have with other whitening products. What I did get, though, were noticeably whiter teeth. I started to notice a difference after just 4 days, and after a week my teeth were definitely a new pearlier white. Even my roommate noticed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very impressed, and I will be purchasing the Crest ProHealth HD 2-Step System again!</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try Crest Pro Health HD for free - courtesy of Crest. It is a 2 step process - you use Step 1 toothpaste for one minute as this is your plaque removal process. You DO NOT rinse after Step 1 - you then use Step 2 for one minute as this is the polishing step (then you rinse). Says it will get your teeth up to 6 x&#x27;s whiter - I only noticed maybe 1-2 x&#x27;s whiter - if that. I used this system for exactly one month. I brushed twice a day. My likes? Totally fresh breath, very clean when I run my tongue over my teeth, some improvement on whitening, simple to use. My problems with this system? Gets kind of annoying to have to switch using different tubes of toothpaste, no major whitening noted, Step 2 doesn&#x27;t taste great and it may irritate your gum line w/ the peroxide, I ran out of Step 1 in exactly 30 days and still had plenty of Step 2 so I couldn&#x27;t do the whole system anymore, not nearly the whitening I was hoping for, I like to brush my tongue and gum line so I&#x27;d have to do this separately or with another toothpaste (not with this whitening product), and it&#x27;s not sold at all stores. It does a great job of giving you a fresh from the dentist clean feeling, but the whitening? So, So.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received the toothpaste complimentary thanks to Crest and I am very impressed with it. It took a little getting used to a two-step process, but it was so worth it! My mouth feels so much cleaner and my breath feels much fresher and stays that way for a longer period of time. I&#x27;ve also noticed my teeth are whiter! I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Thanks to crest for me receiving a free sample of Crest Pro Health HD my breath was fresher and my teeth were whiter.  No one gets excited to brush their teeth as it is an automatic routine.  I would challenge them to try this product out as it left me feeling more confident that I did not have morning breath.  It is a quick and easy 2 minute process and the freshness lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I got a chance to try a free sample of Crest ProHealth HD and I totally loved it. A lot of the heavy duty whiteners require leave on strips that felt awkward and made my teeth really sensitive after I used them. I had tried other regular whiteners and while I&#x27;m sure they do ok, they simply don&#x27;t seem to make a big impact on the color of my teeth. Crest ProHealth HD was really easy to use - brush with regular toothpaste and then brush with a second tube of whitening and I&#x27;m all done. Maybe brushing takes a little longer, but I can spare an extra minute for the whiteness I get from this. It&#x27;s been a great product, I love what it&#x27;s done for my smile!</li>
            <li> First I&#x27;d like to say while i received this product free from Crest, my review is honest snd  speaks to only my experience. What I wish I would have done is taken a before picture. It was too late after the first use. My teeth  looked incredible!  I had always been told that I couldn&#x27;t fix my yellow teeth because the enamel was gone. With one use of Crest Pro Health HD , my teeth looked 5 times whiter, and when repeated use, I felt comfortable smiling. My husband notice a difference right away and I was always smiling and showing my teeth. The application is easy, essentially brushing your teeth twice with the two step process. Continuous use really is needed to keep up the brightness, but it&#x27;s well worth the time and effort. Excellent product,  comes highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I tried this item for free from Crest. I thought it was an ok product - my teeth were whiter but their Whitestrips do the same thing for my teeth and those are a lot easier to use. I wish this was a 1 step product as a toothpaste should be! It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re interested as my teeth were whiter after only a week of using. Not 6x whiter after a few weeks of use, but noticeably whiter.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the white strips.</li>
            <li> what I like: It&#x27;s easy and fast! 2 minute everyday to brighter whiter teeth. I think that I can do this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a 2 step process first step you use the step 1 toothpaste. It is clearly labeled on the tube so there is no need to need to remember which tube to use first. You have to brush with this for a full minute then Spit and NOT rinse. This was a bit difficult for me to remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2: again tube clearly labeled 2. put that on your non rinsed tooth brush and continuing brushing for an additional minute. Then you are done and you can now finally rinse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is fast and easy. I jury is still out on if my teeth are whiter or not. but because it is so easy I will continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;disclosure; I did receive this item free from Bzzz agent and in return I need to provide a review.</li>
            <li> Works like other whiting tooth pastes. I hate having to do two steps, and if you don&#x27;t use the gel the tooth paste makes your mouth feel weird. I don&#x27;t think I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect. I have used different whiting products in the past, but was not as pleased as I had hoped I would be. I was excited to be selected to receive a free set of this from Crest through BzzAgent because I had seen it in the store and advertised and was interested in if it would actually work. Honestly, if I had not have been given this for free to try, then I probably would not have bought this. I am so glad that I was because I really do love it! My teeth feel so clean and I can see a difference! I drink a lot of tea and coffee and surface stains really start to develop. I loved that this helped get rid of the surface stains. In fact, I noticed while on vacation and using just normal toothpaste that I didn&#x27;t feel that my teeth were as white as they had been. Once I got home and started using this again, it was back to being white! I truly love this and have been telling everyone about it. People may just be getting this in their stockings this year for Christmas!</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro Health HD Toothpaste for one month now and the difference it has made in the brightness of my teeth is nothing short of remarkable! I began using Crest Pro Health HD right after my last teeth cleaning at my dentist so I started with a clean-slate. Using this amazing toothpaste has prolonged the after-the-dentist clean look to my teeth and has even brightened my test since that last polish by my hygienist! I am a daily coffee and tea drinker so my teeth usually don&#x27;t remain bright and shiny too long after a visit to the dentist. This time, however, since using Crest Pro Health HD, my teeth look as though they have been whitened professionally at the dentist&#x27;s office! Many people have commented on the brightness and whiteness of my teeth over the past month so I know the product is working when friends notice the difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the improved whiteness of my test, Crest Pro Health HD has made a tremendous difference in the way my teeth feel. This system comes with two different tubes of toothpaste. The first tube or step one does an amazing job of removing that awful fuzzy feeling that my teeth develops over night and during the day between brushing. It seems to do the job because of the somewhat gritty-nature of the paste. The second tube or step two polishes my teeth and leaves them feeling smooth and squeaky clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about one month since I began using Crest Pro Health HD and I have about half of both tubes still left to use which means it seems to last a long time and is worth the reasonable price to pay. I am a believer in this teeth-whitening system because it&#x27;s easy to use - replacing my regular toothpaste with Crest Pro Health HD has been an easy switch - once that I am thankful that I have made. Thanks to Crest for inviting me to try this product for free!</li>
            <li> I received this through a BzzAgent Campaign free to try:&lt;br /&gt;I have been a Colgate girl my entire life.  I also didn&#x27;t quite know what to think about having to brush my teeth with TWO separate pastes!  So I was a little hesitant to try Crest Pro Health HD.  But I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;And I was impressed.  My mouth felt super clean.  Shiny, almost.  And after a few days, I could see a noticable whitening of my teeth.  It wasn&#x27;t nearly as annoying as I thought it would be, brushing my teeth &amp;#34;twice&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside that I found was that this stuff is STRONG!  If you have a sensitivity or a chipped tooth like I do, it will be a bit uncomfortable in that area.  It also feels a little gritty when you brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the record as being skeptical when it comes to a lot of dental hygiene product&#x27;s whitening claims. But, after receiving a free trial of Crest&#x27;s two stage product from BzzAgent, I have to say, I think I&#x27;m a convert. Crest&#x27;s Pro Health HD is made up of two parts. Step 1 is similar to your everyday toothpaste. It&#x27;s minty and fresh, and generally decent, bordering on good. Step 2 is where the Pro Health HD really differentiates itself, though. The &amp;#34;perfecting gel&amp;#34; reminded me of the kind of fluoride treatment you could formerly only receive at the dentist. It leaves my teeth feeling shiny (if that makes any sense), and the fresh tasting gel is just abrasive enough to polish my teeth -- or at least make me feel like they are. Brushing takes a little longer, which probably isn&#x27;t a bad thing, and after a few weeks, I&#x27;m actually beginning to see a slight improvement in tooth color. Whitening toothpaste has never made a noticeable impact for me, but this product did. In my book, that&#x27;s enough!</li>
            <li> I definitely had my doubts about how effective a whitening toothpaste could be, having tried other similar products in the past without much success.But Crest has pulled it off again! Took a bit longer than the advertised week for me to notice changes, but after about 2-3 weeks my teeth were whiter and brighter! Love that I can kill two birds with one stone - whiten without sacrificing a quality brush. I&#x27;ve had a few friends ask how I keep my teeth so white, and I gladly recommend Crest Pro-Health HD. Only potential downside is the two-step process, sometimes even the 2 minutes seems lengthy when I&#x27;m running late to work in the morning, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for a fantastic smile!!</li>
            <li> I was reading through the other reviews and most seemed not so good but, I can tell you this is a great product.  I recently received the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste from #bzzagent as a free trial.  I am so impressed with the product, the second day I used it my husband asked me what I was doing.  My teeth have mostly been stained from coffee, I don&#x27;t smoke or drink.  The first day my teeth were so much whiter.  I really couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better product for toothpaste.  I was previously using a prescription strength paste I received from the dentist, this left a gritty feeling my teeth never felt truly clean.  The crest pro-health leaves my teeth with a fresh clean feeling all day long.  I would highly recommend it and hope it helps you as much it has helped me.</li>
            <li> I got this from bzzagent and thought that it was too good to be true.  Yeah- the taste is something else in my book... however, it really works well.  My dentist was impressed by the change in my tooth color.  So was I.  I feel more confident smiling in pictures now.</li>
            <li> I got to try this for free as a part of a BzzAgent campaign, and I am really glad I did! This is now my favorite toothpaste. There are two negatives I have regarding this toothpaste. First, it does make your mouth feel a little strange - sort of like it is dry. At first, this was a weird sensation, but now I like it because it contributes to how clean my mouth feels. Second, I did not see much of a whitening effect in the 1 week the label promised. However, I kept using it and within about 2 weeks I started to notice a whiter smile. It isn&#x27;t as dramatic as whitening strips, but it definitely the most effective whitening I&#x27;ve ever seen from a tooth paste. I love the flavor and love how clean my mouth feels with this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Of all of the teeth whitening products I&#x27;ve used, this is absolutely the easiest. There are no messy trays or inconvenient strips to mess with, it&#x27;s a simple as brushing your teeth for 2 minutes like usual. The only difference here is stopping half way through to add a second paste to your brush. My teeth feel smooth and clean longer throughout the day, and I have the post-dentist feeling in my mouth every time I&#x27;m finished. It&#x27;s fresh, cool, and invigorating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know that I saw 6X the whitening in the first two weeks of me using this product, but I definitely noticed a difference. Especially as a major coffee drinker, I wasn&#x27;t expecting to see the same result, but I have been pleasantly surprised. Thanks to Crest for letting me try this product for free.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive the Crest Pro Health HD system as part of the BzzAgent campaign.  It seemed like a unique product and I&#x27;m normally a fan of Crest products.  As background, I am avid about flossing every day and brushing as well.  However, I do not tend to purchase and/or use products specifically for whitening.  I am not a smoker, although I do drink coffee a few times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crest Pro Health HD system uses a two step (and two separate tube) process.  As is, that seemed quite involved and time consuming, as a mom of a toddler who does not tend to have extra time for non-basic grooming!  However, I was willing to give this a try and wanted to give it a fair try.  I attempted to use this product exclusively for several weeks before writing my review.  The first step/tube has a slightly gritty texture and a light mint taste.  It is not unpleasant, although my husband did not care for the texture.  Personally, I tend to want a stronger mint flavor in my toothpaste.  The directions state to brush with the first step for one minute and then spit out the toothpaste without rinsing with water before using the second step.  The second step/tube is a very watery gel that I felt had a very unpleasant taste.  (My husband stopped using the second step after his first time brushing with it because of its taste.)  After the second step, the directions have you rinsing the product out of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not get used to the taste of the second tube although I used both tubes every time I used the product.  After the first few days, I ended up only using the Crest system at night.  I switched to my regular toothpaste in the mornings in order to have fresher breath.  The aftertaste of the second product felt bitter and did not seem to help with morning breath for me.  I also did not like the watery texture of the second product and weirdly had a hard time brushing with it for a full minute, as there wasn&#x27;t much substance to brush with - no foam, dripped out of mouth easily, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite using the product only at night (once a day), I actually did feel as if the product made my teeth feel cleaner.  The film that sometimes accumulates on the surface of my teeth did not seem to be there.  The buildup that sometimes occurs at the gumline did not seem to be there. And, although I did not take a before and after photo (nor do I think that it would truly show because of home lighting, etc.), I felt as if my teeth were slightly whiter than when I started using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week, I had my 6 month teeth cleaning at my dentist.  Although my dentist did not mention anything specifically about the condition of my teeth, I felt as if my appointment seemed a little quicker than it sometimes can be.  (I also did not tell my dentist about my use of this product, as I was wondering if it would be noticeable.)  Added to that, over the two months that I&#x27;ve been using the product, none of my friends or family members have noticed or commented on a difference in my teeth.  Of course, most of my own observations are purely anecdotal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, given the time that the product feels like it&#x27;s taking - I know you&#x27;re supposed to brush 2 minutes with regular toothpaste, but this feels longer having to use two products - and it&#x27;s price, it is unlikely that I will re-purchase this product.  If it were an all in one product, instead of two tubes, I would definitely reconsider given the perceived results.  However, the real kicker for me is the taste of the product.  I do not feel that it has helped with morning breath nor does it give me a fresh mint/clean taste after brushing.  For the price, I would go with another product for my teeth.dripped out of mouth easily, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite using the product only at night (once a day), I actually did feel as if the product made my teeth feel cleaner.

            <li> Once you get over the expectation that this should be a minty toothpaste and try it for a week or so, you will be impressed with the results!  I did not care for the initial feeling in my mouth that this left - almost like sucking on a lemon.  But, after seeing the results.  It&#x27;s worth it!  Since I received this as a BZZKit on bzzagent.com, I did not know the cost.  I would have expected this to cost around $25, like the strips I&#x27;ve used in the past.  For $13, this is definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> I tried this product for free but I would certainly pay for it.  I&#x27;ve tried many, many commercially available tooth whiteners, including strips, gels and toothpastes.  This is the first product that does what it advertises.  First, it&#x27;s very easy to use...you just brush your teeth twice.  Second, it leaves your teeth feeling very smooth and clean.  The other tooth whiteners I&#x27;ve used are bulky and taste bad when you have to leave them in your mouth for a certain length of time.  And they don&#x27;t make your teeth feel clean.  This product does it all and doesn&#x27;t gag you like other whiteners.</li>
            <li> Very great toothpaste. It left my mouth feeling very clean. And my teeth felt like I had just left a cleaning at the dentist office. The taste is great and minty. Im not sure if Im a fan of the two step process, I got a ton of things to do in the morning so I would have liked this more if it was just one tube to dealt with. I did recieve the product as part of a promotion from the brand to try.</li>
            <li> My dad is a dentist, so I am pretty picky with my toothpastes. I need to have that -just visited the dentist clean- feeling after I brush my teeth, or else I just don&#x27;t feel like the toothpaste is good enough.  I had been using a particular brand of toothpaste for 10+ years and had not found anything that even compared to it until I was able to try Crest HD for free as a promotion from the brand. Not only did it give me that clean feeling, but it also whitened my teeth dramatically (and I don&#x27;t have terribly stained teeth).  The product is a little more expensive than I would normally care to entertain for a toothpaste, but I actually do believe it is worth it - even if you use it for a month, take a month off, use it for another month, etc.</li>
            <li> pretty nice product... the withening toothpaste its pretty nice flavor... not to hard on enamel but pretty good overall i would recommend it for people with small stains in the teth otherwise the product takes way more time to work ... for me worked really smoth and easy ..</li>
            <li> Thanks to @crest and bzzagent I was able to try out  Crest pro health HD system for free. The 2 step process was easy to follow and add to my brushing routine. I was worried adding an extra step would be tedious but it was quick and easy. When using Step 1 purifying cleanser you can feel the difference immediately. It has a fresh peppermint taste and gives your gums a tingling feel. You can tell it is really cleansing. You are instructed to brush for 1 minute  and to not spit. You then apply step 2 the perfecting gel to polish and whiten. This also has a fresh mint taste. There is a different after taste that takes some getting used to but nothing terrible you can&#x27;t handle. After using this for a month, I can definitely tell my teeth and gums feel  clean and smooth. They are polished and look great. I have not noticed a significant whitening difference but look forward to finishing the set and to see if I get my desired results. The smooth polished feel is great.</li>
            <li> Noticably whiter teeth after only a couple of uses and my teeth feel cleaner than they have with any other toothpaste. Yes still annoying having to add a second toothpaste half way through but I think it&#x27;s worth it for the results. Biggest think I hate about this is that the first tube has a flip top and the second one you use has a twist top! Doesn&#x27;t make any sense just makes having to add the second toothpaste annoying! But still the results are impressive! Got it free to try thanks to crest and  bzzagent! Will definitely buy!</li>
            <li> Interesting product. Does exactly what it claims to do, but feels odd as it is a two step toothbrushing process. I really like how my teeth look whiter, but the taste is not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a free review copy from BuzzAgent to facilitate my review.</li>
            <li> Great product for non dentist office teeth whitening. Tastes good, no gritty aftertaste. Works well quickly and doesn&#x27;t make teeth sensitive to cold.</li>
            <li> Recieved this from BzzzAgents. Thought... Two step toothpaste... isn&#x27;t this overkill. Well, it isn&#x27;t! After using this with my Soniccare for a solid 3 weeks. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. Your teeth just FEEL cleaner and I am noticing that over time they are looking much better, too. After many years of coffee and some less than intelligent years of smoking, my teeth are actually whiter. I have a check up in a couple of weeks, I guess that will prove it out. I think it will go well!! Good Stuff!!!!!</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro Health® HD™ for free as part of a BzzAgent campaign.  This system is 2 steps,but really easy and quick to use.  Brush with step 1 for 1 minute (don&#x27;t rinse) and then brush with step 2 for 1 minute (and rinse).  Step 1 cleans, step 2 brightens.  Whitening is evident when used consistently, but I am not so sure about the &amp;#34;6x&amp;#34; claim.  Infinitely easier than whitening systems that require strips, tooth painting, trays and time.  Pricier than what I would usually pay for toothpaste, but as a replacement for toothpaste + a whitening product, definitely more affordable.  In addition to the whitening, this is a notable product for cleaning.  Definitely wake up feeling less like &amp;#34;morning breath&amp;#34; is an issue.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try another whitening toothpaste. I have tried other ones, and did not notice much of a result. I had the opportunity to try this for free, and was hopeful but not sure but would make much difference. I was pleasantly surprised to see that my teeth did, infact look whiter,  and they felt amazing after the deep cleansing toothpaste. I felt like I had just been to the dentist.  I am normally hesitant to spend this much $ on a whitening toothpaste,  but in this case, I would definitely recommend you try it at least once. Be sure to follow the directions and use at least 2x a day. Happy whitening!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, not perfect but pretty good. Its a two step process which you brush with  very gritty tooth paste first, spit (don&#x27;t rinse) then apply the gel by brushing your teeth with the step two finisher. I like the fact that because you are brushing the gel on I feel like all my teeth are getting whiter not just the front of the front. I saw results within the two week trail period which was promising. However, my only concern is the step 1 toothpaste reminds me a pumice stone material and concept buff off the stains then apply whitening gel. Which works but is it buffing off my enamel as well? After my two week trial I would brush with regular toothpaste then apply the whitening gel and I use the step 1 paste from time to time to give it that deep cleanse, just not everyday. Hope this helps It does work it is inexpensive and I feel like my whole mouth became brighter.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!! I am A Coffee drinker , And this works like a charm to keep my teeth looking white !! Best product out there. I got a free Sample From BzzAgent.com. And I will forever keep using this !! Thank You so much!!</li>
            <li> My teeth are already pretty white, so I didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference in terms of whiteness after using this product. Step 1 is pretty much like normal toothpaste and is very nice and minty tasting, but does leave my mouth feeling a little dry. Step two is a gel that tastes a little strange, but not unpleasant. Will continue to use and hopefully I can get my teeth a few shades lighter!</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. It has dramatically whitened my teeth in one month. It is so simple to use. Brush with #1 for one minute then #2 for one minute, then ta-da.. a healthy white smile and fresh clean breath. It has not made my mouth sensitive (which whitening products do), and I love the flavor. I will be buying this toothpaste from now on. I received this free from BzzAgent to review.</li>
            <li> Your teeth DO NOT get 6x whiter in 7 days.My teeth look the same and I used 2x a day for 7 days.</li>
            <li> My teeth have honestly never felt cleaner! This two step system has given me more confidence in my smile and breath while still being fairly easy to use. Yes this takes 2 minutes of your day, but I definitely don&#x27;t mind because the effect of this toothpaste lasts all day!</li>
            <li> Want some really clean teeth along with a bright white smile to match? Use Crest HD. The dual toothpaste - one that is a purifying cleaner and another for buffing and whitening - really gets the job done well.  So clean that it you will have a 6X cleaner and whiter within the first week of use. I will admit this toothpaste did such a good job cleaning and whitening my teeth it made them a bit sensitive so I had to cut back to using it only one time a day and a sensitive toothpaste the rest of the time.  (Note I got this product to try for free from Crest).</li>
            <li> I think that Crest Pro Health HD is a good product-it made my teeth a bit whiter and my mouth does feel healthy.  I did not notice a difference after my first use in regards to whiter teeth, but after a week or so, my teeth did appear whiter.  I gave it four out of five stars because I don&#x27;t think it really helped with morning breath and the freshness didn&#x27;t last that long after use.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It is fast and easy to use with visibly noticeable results just after the first use.  I received this as a sample to try out for free from Crest.  I will absolutely go buy more when this runs out.  It is super fast to use.  Just 1 minute of brushing with the toothpaste and then 1 minute brushing with the gel.  I saw a difference after the first use!  There are no messy strips or trays and no tooth sensitivity.  I am recommending it to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use most whitening products like trays or strips because they make me sick and a lot of the toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried just tasted nasty so I was excited to try this toothpaste. I received a free sample from Bzzagent and crest to try out and was immediately happy. It doesn&#x27;t require anything more than just brushing normally and my mouth felt awesome after the first use. With in days you could see the different and even my dentist commented on how great my teeth looked.</li>
            <li> Crest was generous enough to give me the Crest Pro Health HD kit to try for free through a Bzz Agent campaign. The toothpaste part of this two step product has great taste and is recommended by my dental hygienist.  The whitening gel portion of the Crest Pro Health HD did not seem to work for me, after one week brushing twice a day I saw no visible results (I would post pictures but they look exactly the same). My dental hygienist strongly advised me to stop using the whitening gel due to the fine grit which with prolonged use could damage the enamel on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I can say I&#x27;m a big fan of Crest products in general.  I actually can&#x27;t remeber the last time i purchased a differnt type of toothpaste or whitening product.  I was excited when the Pro-health HD was released and I was lucky enough to recieve it for free to try and review as a BzzAgent.  This two step whitening toothpaste is vastly different than toothpastes i&#x27;ve used in the past.  The hardest thing for me to get used to was the two-step process without rinsing in-between.  What can I say old habits die hard. The instructions are quite simple brush with tube 1 for 1 minute then brush with tube 2 for 1 minute.  I have noticed a whiter smile, although its not 6 shades whiter.  All in all a good product that I will likely purchase again.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel like they have been professionally cleaned and stay glassy smooth through the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always very skeptical of anything that whitens teeth. I also cannot afford to get my teeth professionally whitened. I received a free bzzkit from bzzagent with this product in it and I gotta say, I LOVE IT! My teeth have always had a yellow tint to it since I am a redhead and I&#x27;ve always been embarrassed by that! I used to use photo editors to whiten my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for only 3 weeks, I&#x27;ve seen major results! My teeth are a lot whiter than they used to be! The only thing that I&#x27;m not so fond of is the taste of the whitening! I love the taste of the deep cleaning toothpaste though! I am not a huge mint person, it actually makes me stomach churn when I smell it, so it&#x27;s nice for a toothpaste to have a change in taste and flavor! I will definitely be buying this product and telling everyone I know about it! Thank you Crest and Bzzagent!&lt;br /&gt;[photo is in no way edited or has been altered with]</li>
            <li> I got to try Crest Pro Health HD through Bzzagent for free. At first I was hesitant of having to do a two step process, but it only takes two minutes and is not any more time consuming than a regular one step process. My teeth feel great and cleaner than with my previous toothpaste. The toothpaste is more expensive than my previous paste, but I do plan on continuing with it even after I run out of my sample. I had a dental appointment about half way through using this product and my hygenist comentted on how clean my teeth were looking.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for free from Crest through bzzagent.com.  Unfortunately for me, it&#x27;s not a product I will plan to purchase.  After using the product, my teeth definitely feel fresh and clean.  When I first used it, I was a little surprised by the taste of step #2 - you can definitely taste the peroxide. But I quickly got used to that and didn&#x27;t find it bothersome.  The end result is a minty taste.  The first time using a whitening product and did not find any improvement in the color of my teeth.  In addition, the two steps became a bit cumbersome . . . had to track time used, don&#x27;t ingest, don&#x27;t rinse/do rinse, etc.  This isn&#x27;t really a product for me.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive Crest Pro Health® HD™ for free from BzzAgent.  I am a daily coffee drinker, so I am always looking for away to whiten my teeth.  I have used the teeth whitening strips, but have never been able to use it for a full week due to my teeth sensitivity.  I tried out this product 2 times a day for two weeks.  The toothpaste had a nice minty flavor and made my teeth feel smooth and fresh.  Next I used the perfecting gel, I could notice a whiter smile after just one use.  I was really impressed and did not have the sensitivity issues I have had with the whitening strips.  I will definitely continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> I liked the results from this toothpaste. It made my mouth feel clean and fresh. The whitening also worked well for an in home product., although I am not convinced that my teeth are 6X whiter like the product claims. I do wish  that there was a way that it could become a one step process, but two steps is not that bad for the results that you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to say thanks to BZZZZ  and crest for allowing me test this product for free!</li>
            <li> I wish I had taken a before picture of my teeth. I&#x27;ve been using this system for about two weeks now and my teeth really are whiter! I understand that this is a system, so different steps are needed to complete the brushing and whitening process, I just wish they could combine it into one paste. It would make it a lot more convenient. Also, I would love it if they made they product more minty and somehow made the fresh breath last longer like other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I got this product from bzzagent as a free tester from Crest. I was immediately impressed with the two-step system. The paste made my breath fresh and my teeth feel very clean. The only problem I had with the system as the whitening gel. While it did make my teeth a shade whiter it did so at the cost of bad gum irritation which made me stop using the product althogther. Just because it didn&#x27;t work for me doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not a great product. Crest has set the bar high enough where others can&#x27;t compete.</li>
            <li> Love the Crest Pro Health that I received from Bzz Agent. It is very simple to use unlike the whitening strips and it definitely works. My mouth feels healthier and looks much whiter than when I started using this over a week ago. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was the taste. Step 2 which is a gel like substance to whiten your teeth has a very sour after taste to me. But overall the product is my new go to toothpaste and whitener.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about the claims of &amp;#34;whiter teeth in just one week.&amp;#34; Surprisingly, this product lives up to the hype. My teeth really did look whiter after just one week. My mouth felt healthier, too. The best part was how quick and easy it was to use - didn&#x27;t take any longer than regular brushing. There were no strips or mouth guards to wear and there was absolutely no mess. This is my go to for a clean, healthy mouth and whiter teeth.&lt;br /&gt; was able to try this product for free from BzzAgent. All views and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> After using for 4 days, my mouth is full of sores, had to buy anbesol.  Discontiued use</li>
            <li> I really liked the flavor of the toothpaste.  It was minty and fresh.  It was not overpowering at all.  I have found that some minty toothpastes can be very strong in flavor that could even upset my stomach.  This was not the case here.  It was a refreshing mint flavor and the paste was not gritty at all.  It was very smooth.  I found that it cleaned my teeth very well and it didn’t leave any sort of bad aftertaste or grittiness.  I actually felt like it freshened my breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the gel whitener was not overpowering but I found it to be quite tasteless.  I found that it actually diminished the fresh breath that I just got from brushing with the cleanser toothpaste.  I didn’t like having to stop brushing, open a second tube and start the whole process again.  I have found that, when I am running late, I don’t use the Crest Pro Health® HD™.  I use another brand because it will be faster.  I found that my teeth got whiter but did not feel that they got 6x whiter.  I do like getting a better quality whitener from just a toothpaste versus using strips though.  Overall, I thought it was a good product and a good whitener.  I did get this product for free from BzzAgent but my opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I tried this product as part of a BzzAgent campaign. I am SO glad I did! Even though I keep to regular dental cleanings, in between my teeth can start to look less sparkly. The process doesn&#x27;t really take any more time than normal brushing, you just have to do 2 different processes, one right after the other. No big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, my teeth look whiter and my mouth sure does feel fresh after I brush with Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste.  Even when my free product is done, I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I use the mouth wash too and my teeth stay white and bright.  Often with the strips, I could not get the places closest to my gumline to bleach out and with this and the mouth wash, they are definitely whitening up!</li>
            <li> I like it but its hard to deal with the Dry mouth</li>
            <li> good tooth cleaning paste but weems like a lot of work for no noticeable difference in the color of my teeth, they are clean but no 6x whiter or anything like that</li>
            <li> Gives your teeth a great clean feeling.  Can&#x27;t say they are getting any whiter, but they feel awesome!</li>
            <li> This product burned my lips to the point of cracking and pain.  Unfortunately it took me a few days of eliminating products to figure out it was the toothpaste causing the problem.  After a week of not using it, and frequently and liberally applying everything from Chapstick to EOS to plain petroleum jelly, my lips are still itchy, dry, and somewhat sensitive.  I have been happy with every Crest product I have ever used except this one - I have not had a negative experience prior to this so I know it&#x27;s something specific to this toothpaste (I have used other whitening toothpastes with baking soda and peroxide for years so I&#x27;m not sure what exactly).  I do think it whitened my teeth somewhat (my teeth are already pretty white) so it gets one star.</li>
            <li> Saw no difference after using</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I have being using it for almost 3 a week, I receive it to try for free from BzzAgent and crest brand, and the results are visible already.&lt;br /&gt;Since the first use I could feel my mouth fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;After one week my teeth are whiter.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I am a coffee addict so I don&#x27;t have the brightest n whitest smile ever, and I have tried almost all of whitening toothpaste and strips out there. Even though strips do help a little but its nothing compared to crest pro health HD. I was using crest complete extra whitening +scope for more than a year now, n although it keeps my mouth fresh n clean all day but it was not helping with stained teeth. So I pretty much gave up on having white teeth, n didn&#x27;t even bother to try crest HD system after seeing ads on TV. But thanks to BzzAgent when I got the invite for Crest HD campaign , I thought &#x27;what the heck, Let&#x27;s try one more time&#x27; n I am so glad I did. After the very first use I could see the stains diminishing, n after only 3 uses I have pretty much the smile that I always wanted. This system is like a two step miracle. Anyone who has stained teeth must try Crest HD pro health system, you will never wanna go to dentist for whitening again. I am so excited to see my dentist again who was recommending for professional whitening. Thank u again BzzAgent for choosing me for this campaign because I was so skeptical after getting disappointed so many times by other whitening products out there that I probably would not have tried Crest HD n now I am never letting go.</li>
            <li> First off let me say that I did receive this product as a free sample from BzzAgent, but this is my opinion.  So far, I love this product.  I’ve used it for 3 days and have seen the difference.  I like it over the Crest 3D White Luxe Whitestrips Professional Effects which I did about a year ago.  The whitestrips overall seemed to work but not as well as this does.  There were parts of the teeth that the strips did not cover.  They were easy but I hated wearing them.  I love this process much better.  2 minutes and you are done.  I was surprised at how easy this 2 step brushing system was.  Also, you get between the teeth and touch all the teeth that you brush (which the white strips could not do).  It is important to follow the directions and not rinse after step one.  I noticed an improvement after one use.  I would not use this forever, but for periodically whitening the teeth (since I am a heavy tea drinker).  I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure -- I was given this product free by the manufacturer.  I was cautiously optimistic about this product, but have been very impressed since using it for about 2 weeks.  The 1st gel  cleans my teeth and gives me fresh breath and the clean feeling I like from a toothpaste.  The 2nd gel -- the whitening gel -- definitely gives my teeth superior whitening and sparkle.  It looks like I have been using professional whitening products.  What I really love about this product is that it is 2 easy steps and takes no more time than just brushing my teeth.  Every time I try a new whitening product, I forget to use it because it takes extra steps and time.  This product consolidates my whitening routine into my everyday brushing.  I love it!</li>
            <li> So I am using this for a Bzzagent project , got it free and I have to tell you this feels like I just went to the dentist. My whole mouth , teeth and gums feel incredibily clean and fresh. I have tried others and none compare to Crest Pro-Health 2 step HD. I will never use anything else</li>
            <li> I received this sample of Crest Pro-Health HD from BzzAgent to use and review.  I was originally hesitant to try this product as I have switched to mainly Tom&#x27;s of Maine or Trader Joe&#x27;s brand toothpaste without Fluoride (upon recommendation of my dentist and endocrinologist).  I was pleasantly surprised at how clean this product made my teeth and mouth feel.  I did experience some sensitivity in the first week but haven&#x27;t had any problems since.  I noticed some slight whitening the first few weeks but nothing very significant.  The two step process is easy and probably had me brushing for slightly longer than usual.  I did recommend this to coffee drinking friends to try to brighten up their smiles.  Look forward to hearing their reviews.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of Crest ProHealth 3D, and I am surprised how much I like it so far. Not sure about keeping up the two-step process for long, or traveling w TWO tubes of paste, but I do think my teeth are whiter. First time it&#x27;s happened without increased sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I was amazed that after the first couple days I really saw an improvement. I thought I was imagining it but I had co-workers compliment me! I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product works. At first I thought doing two brushings would be inconvienient, but at all. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth now. I can actually feel and see a difference so I see the need to brush more often.</li>
            <li> After brushing my teeth with Crest -HD I noticed how white my teeth were in one application. It also feels very clean.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and I will say that my teeth feel much cleaner but I only see a slight whitener to them at this point.I will however continue to use it since it does make my teeth feel cleaner and who know maybe i will see a bigger difference by the time i have finished the two tubes. I have permanently damaged yellow teeth due to tetracycline when i was younger so it is very possible that it just can&#x27;t correct my problem, but like i said your teeth feel better and cleaner when you use it so i will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This new Crest Pro-Health HD tooth-whitening system provides excellent whitening with no sensitivity. I got to try this as a bzzagent, and have learned it&#x27;s really easy to use. The two-step system consists of a whitening toothpaste followed by an activation gel. It adds another minute to your dental care, but it&#x27;s really worth it! The only downside of this, and the reason it didn&#x27;t get five stars, is the taste--be prepared for the bitterness.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that toothpaste can make my teeth whiter. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the taste. I would buy this product!&lt;br /&gt;Headline:&lt;br /&gt;Wow--this works!</li>
            <li> It took a few days to see a difference but once I did notice so did others. Step 1 wasn&#x27;t as minty as Im used to but I soon got use to that and liked it. The bubbly second step kept me brushing for the full 2 minutes so that&#x27;s a win win.</li>
            <li> I liked that it just replaced my current toothpaste. Unlike strips which are an extra daily step. The flavor was pleasing, not too minty. By the third day my teeth felt as clean as when I get done at the dentist office. I loved that. I think they are get whiter each day!</li>
            <li> I was given this product to try out and was skeptical due to the 2 step process, which is a pain; mainly because of storage of this product - both tubes do not fit in my toothpaste holder.  The first step is about 2 min of brushing and the tube is 1 minute of brushing.  My teeth feel dentist clean after this product, but I don&#x27;t know if that is due to me spending more time brushing or what.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in the white-ness of my teeth yet.  However, I do love the fresh from the dentist clean feeling in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I received the Crest HD toothpaste system yesterday from BzzAgent as part of a promotion for the brand, and brushed with Crest HD for the first time this morning and I definitely noticed my teeth looking a little whiter!  It was easy brushing with both, only adds a minute to brushing and if it actually whitens it is totally worth it. The polish (second bottle) tastes a little bleachy, but that is to be expected with whitening products.  If I continue to see whitening I will update the rating to five stars!</li>
            <li> Simply put... This Crest Pro Health HD stuff is amazing. I have tried numerous pastes, creams and “systems&amp;#34; that promised to give me whiter, brighter teeth. FINALLY ONE THAT REALLY WORKS! I received a sample kit from Crest and felt “why not. A little free toothpaste.&amp;#34; However I will be buying and strongly recommending this stuff. I could not believe the dramatic results achieved after just the first use. Wow! Guys at Crest.......you done good!!!</li>
            <li> I received a box this as a promotion from CREST. At first I was skeptical as I have tried whitening products in the past.  I usually quit due to them being time consuming and or that they taste horrendous!  This was very easy to use.  Similar to teeth brushing in general.  The taste is clean and not medicinal or chemically tasting.  I am a 39 year old mom with braces due to and accident and tend to hide my smile.  In a brief 4 days of use I already see progress and a brighter smile. It has helped keep my clear brackets clean and my bands and such clear and not dingy and yellowish.  I am so thankful for this product and will add to my future shopping lists!</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me. I had to stop using due to my gums turning white. After a few hours they would return to their normal color. It actually appeared to turn my rather white teeth, darker.</li>
            <li> I love this crest toothpaste! I received it free from BzzAgent and I recommend this product to everyone. Even though it&#x27;s a 2 step process, it&#x27;s easy and you are sure to see results. I used it the first day and I could already tell that my teeth were whiter healthier and cleaned.</li>
            <li> This is my review first my first brush...and WOW!  I am extremely impressed.  My teeth are clean.  My breath is fresh.  I think the most surprising result was how great my gums felt!  The step 2 paste was really interesting.  I&#x27;ve used the dentist whitening gels that go in the trays on your teeth and often make your gums, cheeks, and even tongue burn.  This paste has a similar taste and even the same result after a first use, but none of those side effects. AND only 2 min 2 times a day instead of the 10-30 mins a day with the trays!  VERY VERY impressive.  Way to go Crest.  I&#x27;m really exited to see what my teeth look after a week.  I&#x27;ll update my review then!  Disclosure -  I did receive this product as part of a promotion from Crest!</li>
            <li> I got the chance to try this toothpaste for free, thanks to Crest. I received the toothpaste yesterday and have so far used it twice yesterday and once today. I am already so happy with the results! After the 1st use I noticed a huge difference! My teeth felt so clean...just like after a dental cleaning. The 2nd time I used it was right before bed. I woke up this morning and my mouth still felt clean! I haven&#x27;t noticed if my teeth are any whiter, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect to notice a difference already. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after continual use! If you have any doubts about this, I definitely recommend giving it a try...you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I will give it another few days...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t like the taste of &amp;#34;Step 2&amp;#34; it taste like a whitening strip (which I hate). My gums/teeth also burned a little for the first three days. I can see the whitening effects but I&#x27;m not sure if this is the toothpaste for me, it may just be too strong for my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product through Bzzagent.  Over the past few days I have definitely noticed my teeth a couple shades whiter.  My husband has also tried it and noticed a difference after the first try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The first tube contains a paste that is recognizable as a Crest paste.  The taste was pretty on target too as a typical Crest toothpaste.  I do like the Crest line because it is a minty flavor that is more subtle than some other brands that I have found to be overly strong that they kind of burn my tongue and a bit numbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I followed the simple instructions and brushed for 1 minute.  I didn&#x27;t rinse as instructed.  That wasn&#x27;t pleasent only because rinsing is my favorite part!  But luckily step 2 was only seconds away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the gel in the 2 tube to my toothbrush.  The taste wasn&#x27;t my favorite and I knew the flavor but couldn&#x27;t put my finger on what it was.  I prefer minty paste or gel so the taste of the gel I wasn&#x27;t crazy about.  But it is also a moderate to mild flavor that certainly wasn&#x27;t a deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was only when going to bed did I realize the flavor of the gel was similar to Crest Whitening Strips.  I have only used them once years ago so I didn&#x27;t recognize the flavor immediately,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say with confidence that my teeth felt clean and whiter.  Since this was my first try with this combo it is hard to say how much whiter they will get.  I am pretty confident I will see a difference and am happy with the product so far.</li>
            <li> The two tubes seemed intimidating at first - wondered if I would actually use it... To my surprise it is really easy and kinda fun to use. My teeth feel super clean and I can feel my gums getting Treatment also. My breath isn&#x27;t as fresh as it is with my previous toothpaste but I don&#x27;t think I mind given that after just 2 days my teeth are brighter!!  Thanks for the free sample</li>
            <li> Received this product for free from Crest. I&#x27;m a week into the trial. AllI have to say is WOW. My teeth are noticeably whiter. AND my teeth feel like I just went to the dentist after EVERY BRUSHING. My husband is trying it too, and he has sensitive teeth and he likes it as well.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I tried Crest Pro-Health tooth paste. I got this sample from Bzz agent. I can not believe my self.  My smile begins with white teeth. For years I have been trouble with yellow color teeth and coffee stains.  Because of these I am so embarrassed with  my teeth.  After using Crest Pro-Health tooth I would not think of anything else. I am anxious to see what my teeth would  look like  next week.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest and Bzz Agent, I was able to try this item for free, and so glad I did! My teeth felt much cleaner after just 1 use! I felt like i just got back from a cleaning at the dentist. I have been using this product for a week so far and i am loving how white my teeth look! I would highly recommend to anyone who would like whiter teeth and fresh breath in no time!</li>
            <li> First of all, let me tell you that i received this product free to try from Crest.  Now let&#x27;s get down to the nuts and bolts of it.  Brushing your teeth is a pretty mundane task.  Not too much excitement or change.  Paste...Brush...Rinse and you&#x27;re done.  When I saw that this was a two step process, I was intrigued.  Never have I stopped midway to apply the second tube and continue brushing.  With that being said, I have noticed many positives and very few negatives.  My teeth felt great after I was done.  It leaves you with that after the dentist feeling where you feel the clean teeth more than usual.  I generally use a whitening toothpaste so I have not noticed any special whitening powers after a week of use.  Overall, the taste is good, not quite as minty as some other flavors, but still good.  I also could be imagining things, but I haven&#x27;t woken up with terrible morning breath which I would assume could be attributed to the cleaning powers of step 1.  The two main negatives that I have discovered is Step 1 leaves you with dry mouth.  You are supposed to spit after step one but not rinse.  I find my mouth to be extremely dry at this point and would love a drink, but have resisted to allow the paste to work as it is intended.  This dry mouth feeling does go away after step 2 so it&#x27;s not terrible.  Also, the design of the tubes are a bit odd.  Step 1 has a flip top which is simple to use.  Step 2 however has an oval twist top which is a bit cumbersome since this is being done in the middle of the brushing.  If Crest is trying to differentiate the two tubes so as to not get confused in the dark, it would make more sense to me to switch them and have the twist top for step 1 and the more manageable flip top for step 2.  Overall, I have enjoyed the product and would definitely consider purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about trying the HD Daily, as I&#x27;ve always been wary of any whitening formula used outside of a dentist&#x27;s office.  This one has won me over with the results, however, and it definitely works at least in the short term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the product for about two weeks, and my mouth does feel fresher and cleaner.  The promised whitening effects are also noticeable even after a short period of use, as my teeth definitely look better than they did even a short time ago.  The taste and feeling of tMy he toothpaste take a little getting used to, as does the idea of brushing twice, but the outcome is worth it.  I&#x27;m not sure whether my gum health has improved since starting application, but they feel good and it&#x27;s again one of the intended benefits of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern regarding the Crest HD Daily is that the cost of continuing long-term could be prohibitive for some, as it&#x27;s not an inexpensive product.  I did have previous concerns about the long-term effect on my teeth as well, but they&#x27;ve been greatly alleviated after some online reading.  This is an excellent choice for anyone looking for an easy-to-use whitening product.</li>
            <li> This two step toothpaste, plaque remover/whitener worked very well for my teeth; however, my wife, who suffers from chronically stained, maybe genetic oriented, teeth did much less so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth plaque like crazy: so I brush, rinse, fluoride, waterpick, multiple dental cleaning just to stay on top of it.  I&#x27;m willing to try a two step process, twice a day, and stick to it.  It definitely made a difference: less build-up, more white.  My wife felt an initial surge of encouragement the first few days, but then felt nothing else happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a certain potency or, may I say, stinging to the cleaning process, but a good rinse at the end with warm water remedies that.  May be too strong for sensitive teeth.  Overall, effective, and I like the way it makes &#x27;my&#x27; mouth feel.  Keep it away from children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean teeth are happy teeth!</li>
            <li> I will admit, I love having cleen teeth. I have the Sonicare diamond clean and until recently I used what I though was the best toothpaste around. I got the opportunity to sample the Crest ProHealth HD for free and loooove it! From the very first brush, I felt like I had just been to the dentist. My teeth felt smooth and I loved the minty fresh breath! My husband went in for a second kiss the first morning I used it. I also noticed my teeth continued to feel smooth all day and even after meals. I don&#x27;t mind the two step system and to clarify you can SPIT after step one, but no rinsing! It really doesn&#x27;t take any longer and you can really feel the difference from a one step brushing. Also, it has been 8 days and my teeth are substantially whiter! All my friends and family are asking what I have been doing because my smile looks amazing. I did knock off a star because it is a bit expensive for a toothpaste, but it&#x27;s so worth it. I won&#x27;t have to spend $50 on teeth whitening strips every six months and deal with the hassles of wearing them for 30 minutes a day. This is simply the easiest way to get a white smile that is truly clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> I was a bit suspicious of a tooth paste product that required 2 brushings, however, after a week of brushing with &amp;#34;Tube 1&amp;#34; then &amp;#34;Tube 2&amp;#34;, I am more than pleased at the whitening and smooth feeling on my teeth. I use an electric toothbrush and have found that it takes no longer than normal to use Crest HD.  The cleaning paste does an excellent job of getting that morning and evening scummy feeling off my teeth, while the polishing and whitening paste does a better job of making my teeth sparkle than others in a single tube.  Well done, Crest!!</li>
            <li> I am somewhat OCD with my teeth and what I use on them, but I can honestly say Crest&#x27;s Pro Health really impressed me! Not only did I notice it&#x27;s powerful whitening effects but I also noticed it&#x27;s over all health on my teeth as well. This is a great product that is worth a try and lucky for me I got it free from Crest all for being a BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Received it as a sample from thanks to Crest and Bzzagent. I was amazed that my mouth felt so clean! I&#x27;m not exactly sure how to explain it but the first toothpaste is very foamy and minty, the second step has an odd state but not horrible at all. Once you are done you feel as if you mouth is at its cleanest AND your teeth are whiter!!! Love it!</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro-Health HD for free through Bzz Agent.  I love this tooth paste.  It leaves my mouth feeling like I just walked out of the dentist&#x27;s office.  I have never found a toothpaste that works better.  The taste is a little different but it is not a bad tasting toothpaste.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what my dentist says at my next appointment.</li>
            <li> I received full size tubes of Crest pro-health HD 2 step whitening toothpaste from BzzAgent for free. I was actually excited about this because I&#x27;ve had some trouble with other whitening systems in the past. My teeth are a bit crooked and not perfectly aligned, so the strips or mouth plate systems don&#x27;t fit all the way correctly.  This though, is just 2 tubes of toothpaste that you apply to all of your teeth the same way you would normally brush your teeth.  The Step 1 tastes and feels just like a normal fluoride toothpaste.  You brush for 1 minute then spit. The Step 2 is a clear gel that definitely lets you know you are using something different.  The taste is not great, but it is not unbearable either.  I felt a tingle in my mouth and on my gums as I was brushing for 1 minute with it. As I read the box, I&#x27;m assuming this must be the hydrogen peroxide in the product. The box does state that you may feel some sensitivity to it in the beginning.  Except for the slight tingle While brushing with Step 2, I did not notice a discomfort while using it or after.  After the very first brushing, my teeth felt like I had just left the dentists&#x27; office ( the good feel). After the 4th day of using it twice a day, I do notice my teeth whitening and I am getting more used to the taste and tingle of Step 2.  I am excited that I have found something that will whiten as well as this does without having to use expensive strips or mouth plates!</li>
            <li> After using this product twice daily for about two weeks, I have noticed a slight improvement in the whiteness of my teeth. I&#x27;ve never tried any sort of professional or at-home whitening kits or toothpastes before, so this was my first go around with any sort of product. I have a permanent cap on one of my front teeth that was done almost 15 years ago, while the color change of the surrounding teeth has not been dramatic over the years, I&#x27;ve become a fan of coffee and tea in that time, so there is a bit of discoloration from those dietary habits. There has been no negative impact on the cap, something I&#x27;ve always been a bit nervous about damaging, and the rest of the teeth have lightened up a bit, but not startlingly so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advantages:&lt;br /&gt;- Even with very hot / cold sensitive teeth, I have not noticed any increased sensitivity while using this product. This is something that many folks who use whitening products report, but this seems to be fairly gentle on the teeth overall while still providing some whitening.&lt;br /&gt;- Simple to use system - start with the 1st step, brush, spit then add step 2 to your brush and continue brushing. Spit, rinse, and you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;- Provided a noticeably whiter smile after just 2 weeks of using twice a day. Not super dramatic, but I can tell a difference, especially using my permanent cap as a guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;br /&gt;- I am really sensitive to the aspartame taste and this definitely has it, but it is subtle and not overwhelming. Just wish they&#x27;d use a sugar alcohol in place, but I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a reason.&lt;br /&gt;- If I store the tubes on their caps, so they stand up properly on the counter, the toothpaste will goop up around the nozzle / opening a bit. Nothing too bad, but I hate a messy toothpaste tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this to someone who is looking to start a whitening regime but isn&#x27;t sure where to start. It&#x27;s a gentle enough product for sensitive teeth, provides a good clean feeling, and is as simple as switching up your toothpaste - none of those extra strips or mouth pieces to fool with.s as simple as switching up your toothpaste - none of those extra strips or mouth pieces to fool with.</li>
            <li> I really like this set. I always want to whiten my teeth, and then spend a mint on kits that I end up using only a few days because I an never find the motivation to keep strips on my mouth for a half hour. This is perfect because it is just like brushing my teeth twice in a row. It is easy, clean and not at all time consuming. I found it to be really easy to use and I had no excuse to not whiten! After a couple weeks of using this I feel like my teeth are quite a bit whiter. They were sensitive at first, but now I don&#x27;t even notice any sensitivity at all. The paste didn&#x27;t dry my lips out like some whitening products have done in the past. I love the way this tastes, and feels. An excellent, easy way to whiten daily!</li>
            <li> Just great!! Amazing clean feeling in your mouth, like just leaving the dentist office.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth looked whiter in the first week.&lt;br /&gt;i was lucky today and grabbed the last 2 boxes at my local drug store.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I am an avid coffee and wine drinker with what I think are great teeth. I am always looking to improve the shade of my smile and have tried various whitening products. The Crest Pro-Health HD makes me feel as if I just walked out of the dental office. It has a great flavor and did not bother my sensitive teeth. I highly recommend it for anyone trying to better their smiles. Keep them health, we only get 1 pair. Thank you Smiley360 for sending this product to me for free. These are my own views and opinions.</li>
            <li> Aislinn the loved- I was given for free theCrest ProHealth HD the new 2 step teeth cleaning kit, by bzzagent so I could test and reveiw it.  I am just starrting the beginning of my regime but I love this.  The first time you apply a toothpaste and brush for one minute this is super fluoride treated and cleans your teeth very well.  Then not to be gross you spit but don&#x27;t rinse, then you apply the clear tooth polisher again you brush for another minute.  Once you are done you can finally rinse out your mouth.  Your teeth are shiny and clean and your mouth tastes like a yummy gum minty flavor.  I really recommend getting this I have sensitive teeth and this has not bothered me at all</li>
            <li> I am four nights into my trial of Crest Pro Health HD and I wanted to share my initial thoughts on this product.  In the sake of full disclosure, I did receive a free sample of this product through BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit about me:  I am a coffee drinker, but not a smoker.  I have tried a variety of whitening products in the past (toothpastes, strips, gels).  I&#x27;d have to say this ranks about the same, not a life shattering change by any stretch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros/Positive Aspects:&lt;br /&gt;- Yes, when I am done my teeth feel silky smooth, like I just left the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;- My mouth doesn&#x27;t have as much of that morningy &#x27;funk&#x27; each morning as it normally does.  Maybe it&#x27;s related to using this product, maybe not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons/Complaints:&lt;br /&gt;- Bleh.  The taste is not good.  I want my regular toothpaste taste, please.&lt;br /&gt;- Step two has a twist on cap.  If I am in the middle of brushing w/ step one, I am to then spit, but not rinse.  How do I open and close the step 2 container while brushing?  Sure, sure I can open it before I get started and close it after I am all done, but that&#x27;s not how I operate and this peeves me.  There should be a flip cap on the step 2 tube.&lt;br /&gt;- It is slightly disconcerting to put the liquidy gel (step 2) across your tooth brush and in your mouth.  It&#x27;s not like toothpaste, and mentally, I have a barrier to it being something I should be puttingin my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;- I read the label and now I&#x27;m perturbed.  Step 2 contains Sucralose... the artificial sweetener (in my opinion - likely a cancer causing agent).  This is probably why step 2 tastes terrible (as sucralose and aspertame in yogurts and other foods often tastes nasty to me), no clue why step 1 tastes nasty.  Yes, I know we&#x27;re not actually &#x27;consuming it&#x27;, but you do end up ingesting a little.  Further, I should already be concerned with fluoride in general, but, it is a concession I have made to prevent cavities, I&#x27;m not comfortable with the sucralose and that is reason enough to state that after this trial I will NOT remain a crest pro health hd customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say my rinse after step 2 is WAY more thorough than my old brushing routine was.state that after this trial I will NOT remain a crest pro health hd customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say my rinse after step 2 is WAY more thorough than my old brushing routine was.</li>
            <li> I received the Pro-Health HD daily system free from Crest so I gave it a try. I&#x27;ve tried whitening strips in the past with little to no results and so I was skeptical about this. At least my teeth should be clean even if they don&#x27;t get any whiter. To my surprise the Crest HD system has so far exceeded my expectations. I love the way my teeth feel after brushing. I feel like my teeth and breath are so much cleaner than using regular toothpaste. I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 5 days now and I can see a slight difference in the whiteness of my teeth. I plan to keep using daily to see how much whiter my teeth might get. I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because: 1. The &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; in the 2nd step causes my mouth to have a burning sensation in the last 30 seconds of brushing with causes me to rinse early and therefore probably cutting down on the overall effectiveness of the product; 2. Adding a 2nd step to the brushing routine adds too much extra time that I&#x27;ve had to adjust for. As a parent of a small child who needs my constant attention, time is everything! Overall, I feel really good about using the system and am happy about the results thus far. I will be continuing to use the system until I have no more left. Based on the final results, I will definitely consider purchasing it in the future.</li>
            <li> I received the Crest Pro Health HD set for free to review from BzzAgent, but the fact that I got the product for free has had no effect on my review.  I was skeptical about how well this would work because whitening toothpastes I&#x27;ve used in the past didn&#x27;t work very well at all.  I&#x27;ve been brushing with this system (made up of a paste and a gel that you brush with for one minute each) for about two weeks and have been surprisingly happy with the results!  I drink coffee daily so I did have some yellowing to my teeth, but this system has already started to lighten my teeth.  My teeth also feel very clean and my breath fresh after using the Crest Pro Health HD set.  I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I received this kit from Crest as a free trial. Sure the toothpaste is two steps and at first looks like it will take longer. BUT you only have to brush with each for one minute. The process is really quite simple. You brush with step one first, then you brush with the step two paste. Brushing for two minutes total the two step Crest Pro Health HD only takes an additional ten seconds to apply the second paste. You don&#x27;t even have to rinse in between. When I say your teeth stay clean all day long; I literally mean all day long. I&#x27;ve been using this paste for a week and I don&#x27;t see myself returning to \\&quot;normal\\&quot; toothpaste. This stuff is a vast improvement over your standard whitening paste. TRY IT!!!</li>
            <li> The cleanliness factor is huge with this and I like that I feel that way every morning.  But the two-step process isn&#x27;t fun when you are in a hurry.  Plus, it&#x27;s not easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try the new Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step toothpaste as apart of the BzzAgent.com campaign. After only one use of the toothpaste and whitener I was delighted to find out how clean my teeth felt! Not only did they feel great moments after brushing but the WHOLE day my teeth felt clean, even after eating &amp; drinking! I do not mind have to do 2 steps because I am so pleased with the results even after just a few times using this product. I find that 1 minute for the first step is not enough time so I usually go close to a minute &amp; a half. Adding the second step to my brushing routine isn&#x27;t cumbersome since I know how amazing my teeth feel after I&#x27;m done. My teeth look noticeably  whiter &amp; I haven&#x27;t even been using the product a full week yet. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after continued use. I would highly recommended this product to friends &amp; family! I will be buying more Crest Pro-Health HD when my free bottles run out! #GotItFree #Bzzagent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really more like 4 1/2 stars to me.  The most important thing is that it works!  My son, husband and I have been using it for about two weeks and we can all see a very significant difference in the whiteness of our teeth.  The tubes are clearly marked &amp;#34;step 1, step 2&amp;#34; so even early in the morning you won&#x27;t get confused.  I like the taste it and it really makes my mouth feel cleaner and fresher.&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to use.  Brush with step 1 for about a minute, don&#x27;t rinse, brush with step 2 for a minute, rinse.  Tada!  Whiter teeth fresher breath.  I deducted a star because I cannot use it twice a day as is instructed.  It starts to irritate my gums if I use it more than once a day.  Of course it will last longer that way and still does a good job. I&#x27;m not sure how it will be in the long run, but so far it&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: After using it for a while, my gums are less sensitive.  I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this product and figured I would give it an honest shot for a week and then go back to my trusty Arm &amp; Hammer routine. After just 5 days/twice a day, I&#x27;m hooked and my tube of A&amp;H has been moved to the guest bathroom. My teeth haven&#x27;t felt this clean since my last dentist cleaning and I love that I get this feeling after brushing every morning &amp; evening. I don&#x27;t mind the 2 step process since it doesn&#x27;t take up any additional time, just an extra step of adding the Step 2 gel. My teeth also seem whiter now which is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> Seems simple enough - use the fluoride toothpaste for anti-cavity and anti-gingivitis, and then use the whitening gel to whiten your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except that the last thing I need in the morning is one more step to get ready.  Especially since I use an electric toothbrush and I&#x27;m already watching the timer to make sure I&#x27;m brushing thoroughly.  Now I have to change the timing, stop halfway through, and apply the whitening gel.  Not time effective for me, sorry.&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention, Step 2 doesn&#x27;t really taste very good.  Didn&#x27;t like it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you spend just a moment reading the label on the toothpaste, this interesting gem comes up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Products containing stannous fluoride (and that is the active ingredient in this toothpaste) may produce surface staining of the teeth.  Adequate toothbrushing may prevent these stains which are not harmful or permanent and may be removed by your dentist.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really?  So this 2 stop process to &amp;#34;whiten&amp;#34; my teeth, could produce stains that may be removed by my dentist?  Think I&#x27;ll sign up for a teeth cleaning, and ditch this Crest Pro Health HD set.</li>
            <li> I received a free full product sample from Crest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for about a week, I certainly notice a whitening effect. My teeth feel more smooth and clean. I use a Sonicare toothbrush, so before trying this new product I was already used to an effective brushing. This product adds a step, since you brush first with step 1, then with step 2, one minute each. However, the separate steps produce a better result. The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because the Hydrogen Peroxide ingredient in step 2 does produce a somewhat less than desirable sensation and taste and foaming action. However, I have also noticed that this step 2 is effective at removing bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, an effective, clean, smooth effect. I can see why they call this &amp;#34;HD&amp;#34;, because this offers a high resolution experience.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty interesting product in that it is the first time Ive ever seen a two step brushing process.  At first I was thinking that this is going to be one thing to add to my daily routine, but after trying I&#x27;m hooked.  Not only am I being forced to brush a little longer than I would have (by forcing me to cover my tracks twice), but I can almost taste and feel the cleaning difference.  It&#x27;s clear from the product packaging that this is intended to be a results driven product...cleaner and whiter teeth than anything else on the market.  I am an early user so I can&#x27;t speak to the whitening yet, but Im impressed with the cleaner feel.  The new approach to brushing makes the morning and evening routine a bit more interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Tastes good despite being a function focused product, easy to use, immediate results, will last a while&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Two step brushing process&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the wonderful opportunity to try this new product for free thanks to Crest and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I really loved the clean feeling it left in my mouth. My teeth felt clean, like I had just walked out of the dentist&#x27;s office. Unfortunately, I did not see much difference in whitening.</li>
            <li> This is a simple two-step brushing process: use tube 1 for one minute, then tube 2 for another minute, without rinsing in between. Over a two-week period of twice-daily usage, it does produce noticeably whiter teeth, even if you&#x27;re a coffee addict. The flavor is pleasant, the process is simple and it&#x27;s really a matter of just switching out from regular toothpaste with no need for teeth guards or anything complicated. It doesn&#x27;t whiten as much as targeted (and expensive) whitening products over the same time frame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this stage, I don&#x27;t know the price of this product but I can say it performs similarly to Arm &amp; Hammer&#x27;s bicarbonate of soda toothpaste, which is around $3-4 a tube in supermarkets. There is a difference in taste and I know some people cannot stand the A&amp;H substitute but it definitely whitens very effectively. If budget is an issue (or this product is as expensive as the boxed packaging suggests), it might be a good alternative.</li>
            <li> I was excited to be invited to use Crest Pro Health HD as a Bzzzagent.  This means that I got to try Crest Pro Health HD for free.  All I have to do is write a review after trying it.  I usually need to floss and use mouth wash in order for my gums not to bleed.  I started using Crest Pro Health HD as soon as it came in the mail.  All I had to do was brush with the first step for one minute.  Then, brush with the second step for an additional minute.  It was very easy to use.  The hardest part was remembering not to rinse in between the steps.  The first time I used it was at night.  It had felt like I just got home from the dentist.  The next morning my mouth still felt clean.  I did not have morning breath or a gross morning teeth feeling.  I have been using Crest Pro Health HD for a week now.  I still floss before brushing, but I have been skipping using the mouth wash.  My gums and teeth feel great and clean.  I usually cannot even go a day without skipping the mouthwash or my gums bleed the next time I brush.  My teeth did seem to get a little whiter, but I do not have a before and after picture to really tell if they did.  I would recommend Crest Pro Health HD.  I love going to the dentist, and my mouth feels like I have been to the dentist every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Crest was kind enough to furnish me a free sample to try and it is a rarity. It is as good as advertised. In only 2 minutes 2 times a day your mouth is cleaner, teeth whiter, and has fresh breath.  My teeth stain easily due to lacking enamel from overdoing fluoride treatments at the dentist as a kid. This 2 tube combination has greatly improved the whiteness of my teeth unlike any other product I have tried unsuccessfully. This product eliminates the need for mouthwash entirely. This product revolutionizes oral care for the consumer.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Crest Pro Health HD from Crest and have been using it for about a week now and I have to say that I am SUPER impressed!! You literally get that fresh from the dentist feel after the very first use, and with each day that passes my teeth have gotten noticeably whiter and just feel healthier.  I was skeptical to try at first, because of the 2 step process and because so many products claim to offer amazing results that don&#x27;t really deliver...but this is DEFINATELY not one of them...and adding that extra step to my morning and bedtime routine is no big deal at all when u can see and feel the results.  I am so happy I tried this product and would definitely recommend it to anyone that is looking for a brighter, fresher smile!</li>
            <li> I will say I was super excited to try this product. The kit arrived as a promotion from Crest and was a little late, but no big deal. I immediately opened the box, grabbed a toothbrush, read the instructions, and brushed away. After using Crest Pro Health® HD(tm) for the first time my mouth felt clean. The 2nd stage (whitening stage) is a little harsh on the gums. I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth or gums, but the whitening stage definitely irritated my gums. I continued to used the product twice a day and still use it. I will say the irritation to my gums has ceased and my teeth are whiter than they&#x27;ve ever been.  I have used multiple whitening products on the market from strips to trays. My mouth does feel healthier and has less visible build up. The only thing I dislike about Crest Pro Health® HD(tm) is that the toothpaste stage doesn&#x27;t foam up as good as others on the market. As far as whitening and leaving your breath fresh this is a great product. My wife can tell a total difference in the shade of my smile.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try Crest Pro-Health HD for free as part of a BzzAgent campaign. I was interested to see exactly how a two step toothpaste works and how it fit into my normal brushing routine. It was surprisingly easy to incorporate the two steps! I just had to switch toothpaste halfway through my typical two minute brushing session. My mouth definitely felt fresh and clean after brushing which was much better than some other toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in the whiteness of my teeth. The packaging of the toothpaste stated that I would have 6x whiter teeth after a week. I brushed twice a day according to the instructions (1 minute for each paste, don&#x27;t rinse between) and after a week my teeth looked pretty much the same. This was disappointing because I could have really benefited from the whitening. If you are looking for whitening, I&#x27;m not sure this is worth the extra step.</li>
            <li> Using Crest Pro Health® HD(tm) leaves your teeth feeling extremely clean. You know the squeaky clean feeling you always want, well this toothpaste gives you this. You notice how clean it leaves you teeth after just one use. The whiting formula works quickly also. After just a few uses you will notice a color change to your teeth that will not only allow you to smile, but makes you want to. This is a two step process where you brush twice each time you brush, with step 1 and then step 2. The extra step takes a little more time than normal, but after you see the results it is well worth it. I received this as a free sample from Bzzagent to try.</li>
            <li> I am definitely one of those people who is skeptical of new products.  I have the products that I use and love, so I don&#x27;t usually branch out, but I received this Crest ProHealth HD product as a BzzzAgent, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I&#x27;m not sure I would have purchased it on my own, since adding more steps to my daily routine wasn&#x27;t something I was originally interested in doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, this is a Two-Step process.  You put Step 1 on your toothbrush, brush for 1 minute, spit out the toothpaste, but don&#x27;t rinse.  Put Step 2 on your toothbrush and brush for an additional minute.  I&#x27;m extremely picky about my teeth, and would not recommend a product that didn&#x27;t leave my teeth feeling super clean.  I will say that Step 1 was a bit bubbly, and was not at all like the toothpaste I&#x27;m used to using, but once I got past that, I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using this product.  My teeth and mouth feel great from daily use, and my teeth appear whiter.  I will for sure continue to purchase and use this product after I run out of what I have!</li>
            <li> I received a free trial of Crest Pro Health HD from Crest.  I was skeptical at best prior to trying this product. (I have used the same toothpaste for years.) Overall, I am very satisfied with my results.  My mouth felt noticeably cleaner after the first use and felt cleaner overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cons I determined were:&lt;br /&gt;1. There was no color strip provided to prove my teeth were actually whiter.&lt;br /&gt;2. I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure how to do the routine.  I have an electric toothbrush and alway brush for 2 minutes.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should stick with the 2 minutes between the 2 toothpastes or add 2 minutes.  I decided I was over thinking &#x3D;) and just did each toothpaste for 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I was very happy with the results.  My teeth feel cleaner all day and night and they immediately appeared whiter!</li>
            <li> As part of a promotion from Crest I was able to receive CREST PRO HEALTH® HD™ for free and all I can say is wow. Not only does this product clean my teeth like that of a dentist cleaning but it also does so with minimal effort. However one small annoyance of the product is the two step process. Sometimes when rushing out of the door I tend to ditch the second step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall its a great product I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste and polishing routine.  I saw immediate results after the first brushing when using this.  I drink a lot of tea so my teeth can look stained easily, but this toothpaste cleaned it right up.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing keeping me from giving this 5/5 stars is the price.  Otherwise it is a no brainer of a toothpaste for regular and amazing oral care and teeth whitening.</li>
            <li> As a smoker who drinks coffee and dark soda on a daily basis, I could use all the help whitening my teeth as possible.  I was super excited when Bzzagent sent me Crest Pro Health&#x27;s newest two step whitening system.  It takes two minutes with the two step system: one minute for the first paste which cleans plaque away, and one minute for the second step which whitens teeth.&lt;br /&gt;My concern going into this was about the whitening gel. I have used whitening strips in the past, but my teeth were too sensitive to continue their use.  This toothpaste provides the effective whitening agents without the harsh side effects on my mouth. I was pleasantly surprised! My teeth felt squeaky clean, like I just left the dentist&#x27;s office, and they stayed that way throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to let at least one week elapse before I wrote this review, but this product really does work in days. Even the first time you use it, your teeth get noticeably whiter, but by the end of one week, my teeth are really white and I had no issues with sensitivity!&lt;br /&gt;Considering how expensive and annoying the strips are, this toothpaste is a great alternative. And I don&#x27;t see a reason to use any other toothpaste moving forward.&lt;br /&gt;Is this expensive compared to most regular toothpastes? Yes ($14.99), definitely. But for how white it makes my teeth, its worth switching over.</li>
            <li> After using Crest Pro Health HD both my husband and I noticed an improvement within just a few days. Both of us noticed we had whiter teeth, which is impressive for two avid coffee drinkers. The two-step process is easy to follow, and works well with our Philips Sonicare toothbrush. The first step cleans your teeth, and you can really feel that every little piece of plaque is gone. The second step polishes your teeth, and leaves them feeling super clean and smooth, almost like you just had a professional teeth cleaning! We are both impressed with the difference we&#x27;ve noticed in our smiles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint would be the flavor - it is a strong wintergreen sort of flavor, which might be perfect for some but as someone who prefers a natural peppermint oil taste, seems very fake to me. We got to try it free thanks to Crest. The product is great and I would buy it again, but I do hope they offer it in different flavors in the future.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health HD is a quick and easy way to a whiter smile! By adding one minute longer to my brushing routine, I have seen great results in 6 days. I feel that my teeth are whiter and my smile is healthier. Two simple steps that take around two minutes make the brushing routine easy! It is difficult to remember not to rinse after step one, but otherwise a very easy way to brighten a smile! And how great is it that I got it free through BzzAgent! Thanks Crest!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step to try by the company. Having white, beautiful teeth is important to me because I have a big smile that&#x27;s one of the first things people notice about me. While I don&#x27;t drink coffee or smoke, I have some moderate yellowing particularly on my canine teeth. I was excited to try this toothpaste to see if I could help eliminate some of the yellowing and maybe brighten my teeth overall. Each kit comes with two tubes of toothpaste - Step 1 is the typical toothpaste and Step 2 is a finishing polish. You brush with Step 1 for one minute, spit out the toothpaste and do not rinse, then brush with Step 2 for 1 minute, spit and rinse. I did this twice a day - morning and night - in place of my regular toothpaste. I have an electric toothbrush that lets me know when I&#x27;ve brushed for a minute so that helped me with the timing of the two steps. I followed the exact process for seven days. The Step 1 toothpaste has a sweet, minty flavor. I prefer strong mint flavors so this was something that took a little getting used to for me. The Step 2 finishing polish did not have too much of a taste, it was just a slight mint. My teeth felt clean afterwards, no filmy residue was left behind. I also noticed fresh breath which is very important to me when I use a new toothpaste. So after a week, I noticed a slightly brighter smile. The results were not overwhelming, my teeth still have a slight yellow tinge on a few teeth but I do believe it lightened them a bit. I think for someone looking for a little bit of brightening would enjoy this product. If you&#x27;re expecting miracles and celebrity-white teeth, consult a dentist for professional whitening products. It&#x27;s important to note, I did not have any tooth sensitivity with this product. I&#x27;ve used whitening products in the past and have noticed some sensitivity to hot and cold but this toothpaste did not cause any issues for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using Crest Pro Health HD for a little over a week and my teeth already look noticeably whiter! My teeth and gums are usually very sensitive to whitening products, but Crest Pro Health HD did not make my teeth hurt or overly sensitive. My gums got a little sensitive during the first few days of use, but it quickly went away, and it is was not nearly as bad as my gums typically hurt with whitening products. Like whiter teeth isn&#x27;t enough, my mouth also feels cleaner and my teeth feel very smooth. My mouth even feels cleaner when I wake up in the morning because I&#x27;ve noticed I don&#x27;t really have near as bad of a taste or morning breath. Thank you Crest for letting me try Crest Pro Health HD for free! I will continue to use this product!!</li>
            <li> I was able to try Crest Pro-Health HD free thanks to Crest! I am always skeptical of whitening agents because I have some exposed enamel due to a receding gum line - any whitening agent is usually extremely painful. I am happy to report that this kit is painless on my teeth and they definitely feel smoother and look whiter.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Crest for many years- and applaud them for launching new products that just keep getting better and better.  I was very excited to see how this 2 step toothpaste would stack up.  First- each step takes only a minute each to use-and combines together they work really well.  After just a few uses I could see a visible difference in the color of my teeth, they were a few shades whiter.  My breath was fresh and my gums looked great.  I have been using this for about a month and the results have kept coming.  Love this product. &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a lot of luck in the past using whitening products so I was sceptical that Crest HD would be any different, however after receiving a free sample of Crest for being a bzzagent I gave it a try and was pleasantly surprised.  The two step system is so easy.  You use step one for one minute followed by step two for one minute.  Step two does have a slight bleach taste but it does not bother me.  I have been using it for two weeks and my teeth are noticeably whiter.  I will continue using the system to keep my teeth white.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get my Crest Prom Health HD in the mail!! This is totally my new #HealthyObsession for the day. I use the paste and gel two times a day and have seen some great improvement in the color of my teeth! I am more confident with my smile and my fresh breath! If you are at all skeptical about this product just take my word for it!! You will never go back to regular toothpaste again!! So give it a try!! Thanks to Crest for sending me my free sample!! #gotitfree</li>
            <li> One week ago I set aside my long-term toothpaste of choice (Tom’s) for the newly received free Crest Pro-Health [HD} Bzz Kit. Reading the instructions (which are very clearly stated), I first felt that the two step routine would be cumbersome, but it immediately gave me the feeling that the product truly addresses both of the aspects most important to me for daily dental care – a healthy mouth and white teeth.  The first step is brushing for one minute with the purifying cleanser which I found to have a refreshing flavor, then, without rinsing, the second step is brushing for an additional minute with the perfecting gel which, although not as “tasty” as the first step, I did not find objectionable at all.&lt;br /&gt;In general, I would recommend the product because immediately after the first use, I was amazed to notice that my teeth felt and looked smooth and polished like they do after a visit to my dentist! I have experienced no problem with sensitivity or any of the “temporary signals” listed on the back of the packaging. After a week of use, I have noticed some improvement in whiteness, but not a dramatic difference. I will continue to use this product in hopes that the whitening process continues and because I love the healthy mouth feeling that it leaves (although I am not exactly sure how to assess if its use results in a “6x healthier mouth” as the packaging claims).</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh! Amazing! I absolutely am in love with this product!! I received this for free as a promotion through Crest via BzzAgent. I am so glad I was asked to try this product for free! At first I was like, okay, 2 steps, not sure if I&#x27;m a fan of doing that but I&#x27;ll go ahead and try it. Boy am I glad I did!! My mouth felt so clean, cleaner than it ever has! I used it for about 3 days and then on the 4th day I wanted to actually compare it to my regular toothpaste. When I used my regular toothpaste my mouth didn&#x27;t feel clean at all and I still had a feeling of stuff left on my teeth. Needless to say, I went straight back to my Crest Pro-Health HD 2 step toothpaste and I&#x27;m never going back to regular toothpaste! The 2 step process is not bad at all. Dentists recommend 2 minutes for brushing your teeth and that&#x27;s all this takes. 1 minute with step 1, 1 minute with step 2 and bam! you&#x27;re done! Easy and great feeling!</li>
            <li> After just 1 use I could already see a difference. Great taste and leaves your teeth feeling amazing. I had my doubts because I have tried a lot of different at home whitening products and nothing compares to the new crest pro health kit. After getting this free kit and having such good results I&#x27;m excited to try more new free products!!</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this on Amazon, I received it as a promotion from the brand. However, I definitely recommend it.  The two step process takes a little getting used to, but I believe it is worth the little bit of extra effort. Step 1, the cleanser seems to do a good job. It is a little thick, but the flavor is good. The whitening gel has a peroxide flavor, but is not bad.  I can tell a difference after just a week of use.  I will probably buy this when I run out of the promotional pack.</li>
            <li> 4 minutes to whiten and brighten your smile is a small amount to ask. My husband and I love how quick and easy this product is. Not to mention, it leaves our mouths feeling clean and sparkly. We love how it freshens our breath and makes our teeth shine bright.We are definitely satisfied Crest ProHealth HD customers after receiving the product from our bzzzz agent!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my smile within one week!  Now I can wear my favorite bold shades of lipstick without feeling like my teeth will look dull or not white enough.  Great way to change up your routine and start feeling the difference in the health of your teeth!  Thank you Crest for allowing me to try the product for free!</li>
            <li> I received this as a BzzAgent Campaign. I like the product. I saw pretty impressive results within a couple of weeks of using this (twice per day at least). The two step process isn&#x27;t hard to get used to at all. It doesn&#x27;t really take much longer than usual to brush my teeth. I gave it 4/5 stars beca &amp;#34;burned&amp;#34; my sensitive gums twice. I suppose I should have been a little more careful considering I know I have sensitive gums.&lt;br /&gt;So if teeth whitening strips aren&#x27;t your thing,but you want the benefits of using them, this product is for you!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of the product. From the first use I felt a difference it gave that just left the dentist feel to my teeth. They felt so smooth for hours after brushing. I also see a difference my teeth looked whiter from the first use. Why 4 stars then instead of 5 not sure my teeth are 6x whiter like it states. Plus loses a star for the taste not my favorite but Definetly doable.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive teeth and normally use toothpaste specialized for this, since I hadn&#x27;t used a different type of toothpaste for a long time I was willing to give it a try. The taste for the first step was okay, the second step tasted like peroxide. The toothpaste was easy to use.  I wasn&#x27;t able to use it for all that long and had to discontinue use after a few days becAuse of increased sensitivity.  I did notice a slight difference in the whiteness of my teeth but not enough to make me suck up&lt;br /&gt;The pain when eating/drinking anything sweet, hot or cold.  I&#x27;ll stick with my old toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this toothpaste free for testing purposes from bzzagent.  The above opinion is my own.</li>
            <li> I received this for free to try on Bzzagent. To start I really like the abrasiveness of the step 1 toothpaste. I think it feels like it really cleans my teeth and has a normal mint flavor. The second step really doesn&#x27;t take any extra time, but feels inconvenient because you have to&lt;br /&gt;apply it as a second step. This is why it lost one star. Also, using peroxide on your teeth is likely to whiten your teeth. I find my teeth to be a little whiter after about a month, but not anything extravagant.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try  this tooth paste for free from Crest and I&#x27;m so glad I tried it!  The results after just a couple days of use were fantastic! My  teeth feel like I just left the dentist office for a cleaning overtime I brush! The 2 step system is easy to follow and doesn&#x27;t require any wait time! Just brush away and watch your teeth feel healthier and cleaner in just a couple of days! Thanks Crest! Planing to make this my new staple toothpaste</li>
            <li> Let me first start off by saying that I was a very lucky girl that I got to try this for free from P&amp;G.  I would recommend this two step tooth paste for anybody that is looking to get rid of some stains and actually have a healthy feeling smiles through most of the day.  My only upfront issue that I will warn is that this is not for the medium to heavy coffee drinkers.  The taste is not horrible as compared to some of the gels that you keep inside of a toothbrush, whitening strips that feel like bad gum stuck to your teeth, nasty bleach trays that cost WAY to much or the dangerous UV light on your teeth.  By far I would recommend this two step process that is looking for a long lasting healthy smile.  I would brush my teeth straight after breakfast and most days depending on what I was eating or drink, i.e. not too much dairy, I had the smooth clean feeling until I got to dinner at 6-7 pm at night.  Well worth the money spent, especially if you are looking for a less exspensive way to whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li> Crest HD is an amazing product! I am always very skeptical of whitening products. I am afraid that I will invest a bunch of money into something that will not work, or even worse...my teeth will become sensitive. I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now as a part of a promotional product review and I have not experienced any sensitivity. Every time I use this product, I feel like someone took a squeegee to my mouth. The flavor tastes great and you can see and feel the difference immediately. I will be referring Crest HD to all of my friends and family members.</li>
            <li> I got to try this product free through bzzagent. All opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;I was really nervous about this whole 2 step process, but I actually love it, and you can&#x27;t just do one step or the other. It&#x27;s the 2 steps combined that give you that clean, fresh feeling. I love that Step 1 really feels like I&#x27;m getting a good scrub like the dentist provides with their buzzing tool slathered in fluoride toothpaste. Then, Step 2 leaves your teeth feeling silky smooth and clean. Each day feels like a great trip to the dentist, and I know my teeth are clean. No more licking all the grit from the toothpaste off for hours, just clean, smooth, whiter teeth. I&#x27;ve always had to use white strips in the past, and I&#x27;ve been drinking more coffee now with baby #2, so I&#x27;m happy to say this has kept all the staining to a minimum. I certainly never would&#x27;ve thought to try this product if I saw it on a shelf, but now I&#x27;m sad it wasn&#x27;t around when I was trying desperately for whiter teeth before my wedding and dealing with nasty whitening strips and treatments that really just left me with sensitive teeth and no results.</li>
            <li> My latest and what I thought would be greatest product I received (for free!) from BzzAgent was the new Crest Pro Health HD system.  This product has two steps: Tube 1, you brush for one minute.  It is supposed to remove plaque and help prevent gingivitis, etc.  After brushing for one minute, you spit but don&#x27;t rinse.  Tube 2, you also brush for one minute.  This is the polishing agent.  This step is supposed to activate the whitening and brightening aspects of the system.  You are supposed to use twice a day for at least a week and teeth should be up to six shades whiter. So now you&#x27;ve heard all of the &amp;#34;supposed to&amp;#34;.  In reality, I wasn&#x27;t as impressed with this product as I thought I would be.  I found that the two step system left my gums feeling very sensitive after the first few uses, so I couldn&#x27;t use twice a day.  I used once a day and then used a toothpaste for sensitive teeth at night to counteract the sensitivity caused by the Crest Pro Heath HD system.  For this reason, I used it longer than just six days.  While it probably maintained my original color, I didn&#x27;t see any significant difference in the whiteness or brightness of my teeth.  Six shades, to me, is a significant difference.  I guess I just expected to have these brilliant white teeth after using the product.  Now I consider my teeth to be a pretty average white/off-white (however you consider it), so I didn&#x27;t need a major whitening, but I feel like I didn&#x27;t really see any whitening at all.  I will say a few positive things about the product though:  The two step system makes your teeth feel SUPER clean, which I love!  My dentist made me start using a soft bristle tooth brush a while back because I had some gum erosion.  I liked my hard bristle tooth brush, because my teeth were always very clean &amp; my teeth cleanings were minimal.  I feel like the soft bristle tooth brush just doesn&#x27;t get my teeth as smooth and clean as I would like.  The Crest Pro Health HD gives me back that polished feeling.  And step two is foamy and tastes pretty decent too.  I like that foamy bubbly feeling from my toothpaste that makes you feel like it&#x27;s getting your teeth really clean, and some of the other whitening toothpastes don&#x27;t do that.  For these reasons, I will score it at three stars.&lt;br /&gt;So overall, not a product I&#x27;m going to go out and purchase myself but not a bad score from BzzAgent.eling.

            <li> I absolutely LOVE THIS TOOTHPASTE SYSTEM! The first night I tried after I received it for free from Crest (Thank you!) through BzzAgent, I could already tell it would become my favorite toothpaste ever... I&#x27;m a little bit obsessed with my teeth. They need to be CLEAN, white, and strong. I brush twice a day, and floss daily (Dentists love me), but my teeth have never felt better, or looked better since I started the Crest Pro Health HD routine a few weeks ago. The first step makes them feel so nice and polished, and the second step has brought them to their brightest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I used this for a couple of weeks before writing a review. I didn&#x27;t like it at first. I found it cumbersome to basically have to brush my teeth twice. BUT after using it for awhile, my teeth feel noticeably cleaner. Both tubes feel completely different from regular toothpaste. It kind of reminds me of going to the dentist--they scrape all the gunk off your teeth and then polish them for you. This toothpaste seems like it does the same thing. The first tube feels gritty in my mouth, like it is scraping my teeth clean. Then the second one tastes and feels like a whitener. I&#x27;m lucky to have naturally healthy teeth, so I don&#x27;t know if I will continue to use this. I would definitely recommend that people try it for themselves, especially if they have problems with keeping their teeth healthy. (I got a free sample from Crest.)</li>
            <li> While I did not see my teeth lighten by 6 shades as promised, they are noticeably smoother and more polished, and have that &amp;#34;I just came from the dentist&amp;#34; feeling.Disclaimer: I was provided this product free by Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I received a tube of Crest Pro Health® HD™ free to try.  My first reaction was that this looks complicated.  It wasn&#x27;t.  It literally takes two minutes to use - which is how long you are supposed to brush normally.  You use the cleaning part for one minute and then without rinsing your brush or mouth, you switch to the whitening part for another minute.  That&#x27;s it.  Your teeth are super clean and super white.  Morning breath totally eliminated for hours.  I can&#x27;t wait until I go to the dentist.  I want to see if they see the difference that I see.</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro Health HD for a couple of weeks now.Here is a quick list of the pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and takes no longer than your normal teeth brushing routine&lt;br /&gt;Tolerable taste&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use tubes&lt;br /&gt;Shows an improvement in a couple of days&lt;br /&gt;Easier, quicker, and cheaper than whitening kits&lt;br /&gt;Since it is used every day, whitening is maintained&lt;br /&gt;No sensitivity problems&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Whitening power is minimal and I reached full whitening in a few days&lt;br /&gt;Requires the use of two different pastes (not a big deal unless you are like me and keep misplacing one of the tubes)&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t rinse mouth until teeth are completely brushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was quite happy. If you are looking for a product to dramatically whiten your teeth then this is probably not it. However, if you are looking for a daily way to keep your teeth looking good then this is is a good product to try. I received this kit free of charge in order to share my opinions.</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest HD for a couple weeks now, and I am beyond impressed with the difference it has made with my teeth. I was a little hesitant to use the product, as often times, teeth-whitening products really hurt my teeth and make them very sensitive. But I was offered the toothpaste to try for free from Crest, so I decided to give it a chance. I did not experience any sensitivity with the Crest HD set. But, even more important that that, this toothpaste really did whiten my teeth in just a few days. I could tell a difference early on, and I have had several people compliment me on my white smile. I have been extremely pleased by this product and would recommend it highly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for free to review from Crest through Bzz Agent, but my opinion is my own.</li>
            <li> I got this product free as a buzzagent and was concerned that it really wouldn&#x27;t perform as advertised but it definitely does.  It took about two weeks and my teeth definitely seem whiter now.  I can&#x27;t prove that my mouth is genuinely healthier but I definitely believe that it is.  Best price you can find for this product is here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used a teeth whitener that actually worked. I have tried Crest strips and teeth gel whitener, and everything before just seems to mellow out quickly or never worked. I am a major coffee drinker, and even that didn&#x27;t hinder performance. This stuff is real, and better than advertised. I got this for free, and now I am going to continue to buy this every month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first try, my mouth felt as clean as a dentist&#x27;s visit. After the first week, my teeth were several shades whiter. After two weeks use, my mouth felt better than before. And it was more than the whiteness; it felt healthier and clearer. It&#x27;s my recommendation that if people want teeth that are actually cleaner AND whiter, they try Crest Pro Health HD. It just plain works.</li>
            <li> I have never loved a toothpaste.  I usually buy what is on sale. After trying this toothpaste I LOVE it! It really feels like you just went to the dentist. There is no film or paste left on your teeth.  This two step process really works and you can see and feel the difference between the two.  I would have never thought about buying this toothpaste or that you would need two different steps in brushing. I am so glad I tried it and I will definitely continue to buy it! Thanks to Crest for the free sample and for getting me hooked on a new toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I got a chance to try this free of cost from Crest and i was a little skeptical in begining seeing two tubes, a process to follow but it was totally worth it. I felt different from the first brush and within 2 weeks i could notice the longer lasting freshness, cleanliness was noticeable. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of the product as part of a promotion from the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Crest Pro Health HD for over a month.  Within the first few days of using it, I noticed a huge improvement in how clean my teeth felt.  It was like I had just walked out of the dentist office after having my teeth polished.  I can&#x27;t say that it dramatically whitened my teeth, because I&#x27;ve been using regular Crest Whitening paste for a long time.  Add in the fact that the whole process only takes 2 minutes and you&#x27;ve got a product that people will actually use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really want to give this product 5 stars, but I can&#x27;t.  About 2 weeks into using Crest Pro Health HD, I started having a numb feeling along the front edge of my tongue.  It didn&#x27;t go away after a couple days, so I stopped using the paste.  After a couple more days, the numbness went away.  I went back to using the paste regularly and sure enough, the numbness came back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For that reason, I&#x27;ve drastically cut back on how much I&#x27;m using it.  I now use it 1 or 2 times a week instead of the suggested 2 times a day.  I still think it is a good product, if used sparingly.</li>
            <li> I really like the way that the toothpaste makes my teeth feel, but am not sure that I notice a difference in the whiteness of my teeth. Since that is the primary use of the toothpaste I will probably not purchase it and just stick with the regular Crest that I use since I also like the way that it makes my teeth feel. I do believe that since it is two steps I do brush my teeth longer than I do with the regular Crest, but for me the cost is not worth the benefit.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest and BzzAgent, I have been using the new Crest Pro Health® HD whitening system for about 4 weeks now. I have to say that I was surprised with how well it works. My teeth are whiter and brighter than ever before. With the Crest Pro Health® HD easy to use 2 step system, my teeth are whiter than the more expensive systems out there. There is no need to sit with trays of gel in your mouth for hours. The Crest Pro Health® HD system only takes 2 minutes and you use it instead of brushing with regular toothpaste. I recommend that everyone who wants a brighter smile for less money, try this new system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have is that the first step makes my mouth feel dry and gritty. Once I use step 2, my mouth is clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> A great new product! I received a free trial from crest for this new toothpaste and whitener to try! I was glad I did. The product works as good as advertised! After two weeks of use, I am seeing positive results! It is easy to use and has no horrible aftertaste.</li>
            <li> I received the Crest Pro-Health Daily Two-Step Toothpaste for free as part of being a Bzz Agent.  I started using it right away and was excited about the results, my teeth felt cleaner longer and were visibly whiter!  My friends and my husband even commented about how white they looked and asked what I was using!  My only issue that I had is that after about a week I started getting sores on my tongue and gums, I am prone to canker sores so I wasn&#x27;t sure if this new toothpaste was the culprit or not.  I stopped using it until the sores were gone and then I started again, only I decided to use it every other day to start with.  So far it&#x27;s been a week and I haven&#x27;t gotten anymore sores.  I really like the way the Crest Pro-Health makes my teeth feel cleaner for much longer than my regular toothpaste, and a huge benefit is that my teeth are much whiter!  I will continue to use this product, but will try to stick to every other day to avoid any more sores.</li>
            <li> I was floored by how well this whitened my teeth.  I am a 2-3 cup a day coffee drinker, and so my teeth always have that dark-ish off-white tinge to them that I hate.  I got the opportunity through BzzAgent and Crest to try this for free, and wow. I&#x27;m a customer for life.  For the price, and what I was able to attain using this for just a few weeks, I won&#x27;t try another whitening toothpaste.  I highly recommend this to all the coffee drinkers, red wine drinkers, or anyone just needing that extra white gleam!</li>
            <li> The Crest Pro Health HD really does whiten and get your teeth cleaner within one week. I was absolutely amazed at how clean my teeth felt after using this system. My teeth felt like I had just received a cleaning at the dentist office. And in addition to feeling clean, the added bonus was that my teeth were significantly whiter after just two days of using the product. And they were even more noticeably whiter after one week. I like that it doesn&#x27;t overly whiten your teeth to the point that they no longer look real, but it gives it a naturally white look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all of that being perfect why did I give it only four stars? Well, because I noticed myself getting a mild headache after using it two times a day for two weeks straight. After I stopped using it the headaches went away.  It is obviously something that my body doesn&#x27;t tolerate too well, because my husband has had no problems with it at all. Possibly if I use it just once a day or every other day I wouldn&#x27;t have that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants super clean, just out of the dentist, feeling teeth with the bonus natural whitening. I am very impressed with this product. I did receive this product free thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li> Wow, I can feel &amp; see such a difference when I use this product.  I even notice that I am less &amp;#34;yucky&amp;#34;  and fresher in the morning versus when I use other toothpastes.  I also notice an immediate brightness to my teeth when I use this.  I wasn&#x27;t sure about having two steps, but really it&#x27;s no more effort than what I was doing before.  It&#x27;s still only 2 min of my time.  I totally think it&#x27;s worth the money and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> mouth feels so squeaky clean.  It does take a bit to get used to using both tubes with every brush but you have never felt so fresh.  Received trial through bzzagent</li>
            <li> When I recieced my free sample of Crest Pro Health HD, I was skeptical. I have used many whitening toothpastes in the paste and find that they don&#x27;t whiten so much as prevent further yellowing. The only read success I had with whitening was with the whitening strips. But those are pricey and don&#x27;t fit in my usually routine. After using Crest Pro Heath HD twice a day for over a week now I have notice a good amount of whitening! Not too the level of the white strips, but more than any other toothpaste I have used. The kit comes with 2 separate tubes of toothpaste. The first is a tradional toothpaste meant to clean the teeth. It has a pleasant taste that is reminiscent of wintergreen altoids. The second tube, that you use immediately after brushing with the first, contains a clear gel meant to do the actual whitening. This gel is mostly flavorless as far as I can tell. Overall I am pretty satisfied with the product, and would recommend it to anyone who wanted a toothpaste that actually does a decent job whitening. The only drawback is that because it has separate tubes it takes twice as long to brush my teeth now.</li>
            <li> I am really self conscious about my smile. I&#x27;m a coffe and soda drinker and my teeth are stained. To get them whitened is a pretty big chore. I do get them cleaned at the dentist, but in between those 6 month periods I have never found a product that  has quite done the trick (and I have tried them ALL!). I was really geeked that I got to try this product for free (thank you Crest!!) because now I&#x27;m a customer for life. Not only does it do an awesome job by whitening my teeth, it feels good and leaves my mouth feeling fresh and healthy. You should definitely give this a try, it&#x27;s so worth it! I no longer smile with my mouth closed, I flash those babies! My teeth, that is :)</li>
            <li> I received this for free from Bzzagent.  I am not a fan of brushing my teeth twice and do not like the taste of either toothpaste included.  I&#x27;ll continue using just to see if my teeth do get whiter.  At this point though, I would probably not purchase this item.</li>
            <li> A must buy! I first received this from Crest to try and I was hooked! I have since bought this toothpaste system on my own as well and  My teeth felt so clean after the first time using this system. It is a system, and has two steps, but all together takes 2 mins and the pay off is AMAZING! A dazzling smile, fresh breath that lasts for hours and teeth that feel polished and so CLEAN! I highly recommend this toothpaste(s) as it will make it impossible to go back to any other brand...An added bonus is that your teeth do not feel sensitive as with other whitening products!</li>
            <li> Let me preface this review by saying that I routinely use crest products as part of my daily dental hygiene regimen so I was pretty excited to try out the new Crest Pro-Health HD. I have been using this product for the past 7 days. Well let&#x27;s get started with the positives of the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest HD does a great job of making my breath seem fresher and my mouth overall feel cleaner. When I awake in the morning, the dreaded &amp;#34;morning breath smell&amp;#34; is less noticeable since I have been using this product. I am especially impressed with the smoothness of my teeth. I catch myself running my tongue over my teeth throughout the day because they feel so smooth. Lastly, I really like the fact that Crest offers a 60- day satisfaction guarantee with this product. If you not satisfied with your results, Crest will send you a pre-paid card in the amount of your purchase. Now let&#x27;s get on to the not so positive part of this product and for me there is only two:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest Pro-Health HD boasts that you will notice a 6X healthier mouth and 6X whiter teeth in 1 week. Prior to my trying out this product, I really didn&#x27;t have any stains on my teeth but they are not glistening white either so I was hoping for some improvement in my smile. After a week of using this product however I have not noticed any change with the color of my teeth. Secondly, this is a 2 step process. So if you are constantly strapped for time, although a minimal addition to the toothbrushing process, you will need to stay close by your bathroom in order to apply the perfecting gel (step 2) after using the purifying cleanser (step 1).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in summary. Is Crest HD worth a try or a better question yet, would I try this product again. Probably yes if I was using a coupon when purchasing it. If for no other reason than the clean feeling you are left with after using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*(I got the opportunity to try out Crest HD, compliments of Crest through Bzzagent. This has been a totally nonbiased review.)totally nonbiased review.)</li>
            <li> I got this product free from Bzz agent. At first I thought of it as a free product I would use with not much intention of buying b/c it was two tubes and I didn&#x27;t think it would really work.  At first I didn&#x27;t care for the taste of step 2, wasn&#x27;t minty like I normally like.  I&#x27;ve been using it a couple weeks and I really like it.  My husband started using it, too.  I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in the whitening of my teethe yet, but I have noticed it in my husbands teeth.  I do like the freshness I feel in my mouth! I&amp;#34;m a coffee drinker.  I brush my teeth before I leave the house for work, but after I have my morning coffee, I would always have that taste in my mouth and that weird film on my teeth. With this toothpaste my teeth always feel clean! There was even a couple occasions where I fell asleep before I brushed my teeth before bed and I woke up and my teeth still felt clean! Honestly,not sure if I would purchase this product yet, b/c it it kind of pricey, but if I can get some coupons I would for sure purchase it!  I&#x27;ll decide when I run out !</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of the Crest HD 2 part kit for bzzagent.com. I have been using this product for about a week now and over all I really like it. My teeth feel much cleaner using this system then regular paste. The cons are dry mouth when it&#x27;s first used, cost, and so far my teeth haven&#x27;t gotten much whiter.</li>
            <li> this was one of the most amazing products I had used for my teeth. it helped me with my plaque, the whiteness of my teeth and the smell of my breath. my dentist had told me that my teeth were good and healthy. this product was not a waste and I would love to continue using this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m someone who is diligent about oral hygiene. I have been using an electric toothbrush for years, floss nightly, and visit my dentist every six months religiously. Needless to say I was excited to try out the two-step Crest Pro Health® HD(tm) system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The routine did take a bit of getting used to. First, you apply Step 1, a purifying cleanser, and brush for one minute. (FYI, you are allowed to spit but not rinse after this step.) Then you add Step 2, a perfecting gel that is for polishing and whitening, and brush for an additional minute. My electric toothbrush helped me keep track since every 30 seconds it makes a noise. Other than adding a second toothpaste to my routine, it didn&#x27;t feel much different from my regular brushing regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the \\&quot;feel,\\&quot; the first step does feel a bit drying to the mouth, but the taste is a subtle mint not unlike many other toothpastes. The second step leaves more of a \\&quot;just back from the dentist\\&quot; feel rather than a \\&quot;just brushed with traditional toothpaste\\&quot; feel. The first night I felt a little thrown by the lack of true mint flavor and swirled a bit of mouthwash after I was done brushing. That helped a bit, but by the second day I was used to the flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What impressed me most about this toothpaste was its staying power overnight. I woke up in the morning with NO horrible morning breath taste in my mouth! This was an awesome. I&#x27;m a nursing mom and have to get up several times in the night to feed the baby, so not to have that gross taste in my mouth during those night feedings was a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the whitening, I can&#x27;t say that my teeth are any whiter after over a week of use, but they weren&#x27;t that stained to begin with. I will say that I have used Crest whitening strips in the past and had great results. If you are looking to whiten your teeth, I would stick to those. For me, I was much more interested in the health aspects of the Crest Pro Health® HD(tm)toothpaste, so I still feel like the system is a good upgrade from my normal brushing routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Thanks to the generosity of Crest, I was able to try this product for free*l feel like the system is a good upgrade from my normal brushing routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Thanks to the generosity of Crest, I was able to try this product for free*</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent, I was able to try this 2-step whitening toothpaste by Crest (Crest Pro Health HD). I am absolutely sold on this product! My teeth feel incredibly clean (pearly smooth) and the taste is refreshing. I noticed a slight improvement in whitening instantly, but after using the toothpaste twice a day for a week I noticed a great improvement. This toothpaste gives your teeth the same feeling that you have when you leave the dentist office but you get to enjoy that feeling every day.  I personally don’t mind the 2-step process because this ensures I’m giving my teeth adequate brushing time. I will say that after a week I have gone to using the 2nd step just daily because I did notice that my gums became a little sore if I used the whitening gel twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;I am truly impressed and I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> First of all, I have to say I don&#x27;t love the taste.  It&#x27;s not awful, but it&#x27;s not great either (is that the hydrogen peroxide?).  But I&#x27;m seeing some noticeable improvement in whiteness, so on I slog with the two-step process.  I think it&#x27;s making me brush my teeth longer, so that&#x27;s probably not a bad thing either!  I was provided the product for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I love the just clean feeling from the dentist, but I hate that it only lasts about a week.  I just had my six-month check up, and two weeks later my teeth still look amazing.  The two-step process to brushing is really nice, and it helps focus on spending the required amount of time brushing to get my teeth really clean.  You use the step 1 for one minute, then spit (but don&#x27;t rinse), then use step 2 for one minute. The step 2 tube is smaller than step 1, which makes me believe that I need to use less of it.  It is the whitener.  Really, two weeks after my dental cleaning and my teeth still look like I just left the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;The negative is the price.  Yes, I am sure that the price may be less than the white strips and all, but it is still a bit too much for someone used to spending about $5 on a tube of toothpaste, and this is four times the amount for two tubes.  I got this kit from BzzAgent  promotion from the brand, and that is why I wasn&#x27;t worried about the price at first.</li>
            <li> This is a two step process the first step you brush your teeth and spit but don&#x27;t rinse and the second part is the polish. My husband and I have both used it and from what we have figured is that the polish tastes bad and thats why you should spit after step one and not rinse. When we first tried the product we assumed it would be around 50 and that price would be fine with us also but it&#x27;s actually less than that so we are happy to continue to use. My husband is a coffee drinker and was getting concerned about the stains on his teeth but even after one use we could tell a difference. We will continue to buy the product as long as it keeps working and after 2 weeks it&#x27;s still making a difference. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own</li>
            <li> I found there to be some very strong pros and very strong detractors to this toothpaste.  Positive first: I loved how clean my teeth felt after using this toothpaste and it whitened very well (though perhaps not as dramatically as the producer is suggesting).  Now for the negative.  The two-step system is kind of a pain to use if you don&#x27;t have a way to manage the amount of time you are supposed to be brushing with each paste;  I use a Sonicare so it beeps every thirty seconds and is handy for knowing when to switch from step one to step two.  The taste of this toothpaste is, like most whitening pastes, not great; the second step in particular tastes very strongly of peroxide.  My biggest issues comes from using the Sonicare toothbrush with this.  The pastes did not stay on the brush well and therefore didn&#x27;t disperse well around my mouth/teeth.  The second step was the most troublesome with this issue and would just sit in one spot, requiring some fancy maneuvering to get it around.  That issue alone will keep me from purchasing this product in the future as it was just too cumbersome to use.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean using this product. Within a week improved tooth sensitivity and a change in whiteness for sure!  Thank you #bzzagent for letting me try this!</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health HD toothpaste is a great way to whiten your teeth, I have to say that I have tried other product but never had great success and could never bring myself to spend money to have my teeth professionally whitened.  So, when I was given the opportunity to try this product I was very excited but apprehensive at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise, I love this product, I have cant tell you how easy it is, you simply throw away your old toothpaste and replace it with Crest Pro Health HD, you brush your teeth twice a day for two minutes, using step one and step two!  Yes, its that easy, and within the first cleaning you feel your mouth is much fresher and cleaner, then within days you can see that your teeth are getting whiter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only two negatives, one being that the toothpaste for step 1 is a little thick and feels like there is sand in it, but that you can get over since you only use it for one minute at a time.  Second, you teeth can be sensitive after brushing, so no drinking water for about 15 minutes after your brush!  In all honesty these two things are minimal and so worth dealing with because you get healthier and whiter teeth in such a simple way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to BzzAgent for giving me the opportunity to try/sample this product, its has truly helped improve my teeth and confidence.  #HealthyObsession #Sponsored #GotItFree</li>
            <li> When I recieced my free sample of Crest Pro Health HD, I was skeptical. I have used many whitening toothpastes in the paste and find that they don&#x27;t whiten so much as prevent further yellowing. After using Crest Pro Heath HD twice a day for over a week now I have notice a good amount of whitening!  The kit comes with 2 separate tubes of toothpaste. The first is a tradional toothpaste meant to clean the teeth. I The second tube, that you use immediately after brushing with the first, contains a clear whitening gel.  Overall I am pretty satisfied with the product, and would recommend it to anyone who wanted a toothpaste that actually does a decent job whitening. The only drawback is that because it has separate tubes it takes twice as long to brush my teeth now.</li>
            <li> II have been using this product for a little over two weeks now and I see the difference. I did not think with just brushing my teeth with these two products that my teeth would get whiter and cleaner but they did. The whitening gel does have a different taste but it is not different than if you were at the dentist. I would recommend this to anyone who needs to whiten their teeth. I will continue to use this product on my teeth. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure:  I got this product to try from BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always taken good care of my teeth, brushing twice a day no matter what.  With this product, I brush a bit longer than I used to but no big deal.  Does it work?  Yeah, my teeth seem more white/brighter than a week ago.  This is certainly a good way to go about making your smile whiter and look cleaner compared to other expensive methods.&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;ve never liked the taste of Crest products and while I&#x27;ve gotten used to it some, it is still weird and too sweet.  The Step1 product isn&#x27;t too bad, but the Step2 protective gel is strongly sweet from the flouride or something.  I don&#x27;t know why Crest insists on keeping the same taste all these years.&lt;br /&gt;Now, on the flip side, once you are done and rinse our your mouth, it really does feel clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;The part I worry about is long-term use though in that typically products that whiten teeth are wearing on the enamel/surface of the teeth, so users that have high wear on their teeth (from night grinding or what have you) may be weary.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the product does seem to do what it says:  Whitens teeth, leaves them clean and bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minus 1 star for the typical Crest taste.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of this product at first. However, after 3 days of using it morning &amp; night, I noticed a major difference in my teeth. They are noticeably whiter. My teeth felt cleaner all day long. This is such an easy product to use, brush for 1 minute with step 1, then brush for 1 minute with step 2. Repeat at night. 4 minutes a day for whiter teeth! I am very impressed by this product and now I don&#x27;t have to whiten with messy trays or strips. **I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> At the very get go would like to mention that after using the new Crest Pro Heath toothpaste duo, my  teeth do feel whiter and fresher. I am not a person who is big on coffee or any thing that may stain my teeth. My teeth however are yellow that i dont think any one can avoid any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the regular Crest tooth past, so an offer from bzzagent to try the new Crest Pro Health toothpaste was a no brainier. I dont think any one would say no to a freebie.  The new toothpaste surely made my teeth feel clean and my mouth feel fresh for a longer time than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two-step system is pretty simple, except for the fact that since we have to use two different toothpastes the time spent in brushing seems like forever. The first step involves using what seems like a regular crest toothpast which i do feel is an improved version of other regular variety.  The taste is good and as i have already mentioned, it makes my mouth feel fresh and cleaner for a longer time than the regular paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, from what i have come to understand  Step 2 is basically hydrogen peroxide in a gel form with artificial sweetener added. This is the one with little funky taste but it is also the one which is responsible for cleaning out the stains and yellowness from your teeth. Knowing my teeth will shine brighter, the taste does not seem so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I say it&#x27;s worth a try. The only draw back i can think of is maybe that the price is a little on the higher side just for toothpaste so i am taking away one star just for that. But I would surely recommend using it once for sure.</li>
            <li> I am someone always looking for a safe, healthy and fast way to keep my teeth white.  When I was invited to do a test trial for this product from Crest I was thinking - this looks like more work and will probably make my teeth hurt like of the other products out there on the market.  I got my Crest Pro-Health HD last Saturday and have been using it twice daily.  I moved the other toothpaste I had in the bathroom so I wouldn&#x27;t be tempted to use it.  This even made my fianc&amp;eacute; have to use it :)  I have to say I am impressed.  I thought this would be more time consuming but yet it is not.  Same time frame to brush my teeth.  My teeth actually feel cleaner than when I leave the dentist after a  cleaning.  I do have nice looking teeth already but this product has made them brighter and they feel amazing.  I also don&#x27;t feel any sensitivity either. I asked my fianc&amp;eacute; this morning how he was liking the new toothpaste and he too said his teeth feel like he left the dentist and doesn&#x27;t notice the two step process taking any longer.  So I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro Health HD 2-step system from Crest and BzzAgent and I was stoked to try out a new toothpaste. When I used it the first time, I found I enjoyed the taste and it took a little bit of getting used to brushing my teeth with what seemed to be a regular toothpaste and then a whitening, less foamy toothpaste thereafter. After about a week of use, my teeth began to look noticeably white and I&#x27;m much more used to the routine. Looking forward to seeing how white they are after I finish the tube!</li>
            <li> Received this product for free in the mail by the Smiley program! Was skeptical at first since its a tooth paste. But after using it I was really impressed how clean and white my teeth have become!</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste system for a couple weeks now. I was given this package complimentary to try and review online through Crest and BzzAgent.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros- I have to say I am very impressed with the results. This paste has dramatically whitened my stained teeth- they arent stained anymore! This stuff works well and lives up to the hype. Plus it works FAST. I noticed results within 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons- I have had issues with sensitivity and I do not enjoy having to brush twice in a row. The first paste also has a strange gritty texture, but I got used to that. I have defeated the sensitivity by only using this toothpaste once a day in the morning and my old regular toothpaste once at night. This has maintained the level of whiteness I achieved through this product AND cut down my sensitivity. Much better now.</li>
            <li> Before I tried Crest Pro Health HD I was a little skeptical that it would be any different than regular toothpaste.  I was was surprised in the difference.  My teeth feel clean all day long.  The 2 step process is not as inconvenient as you might think once you have done it a few times.  I also think my breath stays fresher longer than with regular toothpaste.  I don&#x27;t think the whitening works as well as it say but I have never really thought any home whitening product has really worked on my teeth.  Overall I am very impressed with how clean my teeth are.  I received a free sample from crest and bzzagent.</li>
            <li> Got this free from Buzz Agent.  I have to say, while it takes a little moe time to brush my teeth, it really makes them feel cleaner and my teeth are noticeably whiter after using for only a couple of weeks. Really not that much else to say about it.  Use the first step then use the second step, couldn&#x27;t really be much easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of going to the dentist.  Nor do I like the whitening strips that are so popular.  I do however like my teeth to feel clean :)  I have been using Crest Prohealth for several years that has a whitening agent to it, so I didn&#x27;t know how beneficial using this new two step toothpaste could be compared to what I had been using.  I was really pleasantly surprised in less than a week by the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel cleaner after brushing.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because you actually brush them twice, or if it&#x27;s the ingredients doing the trick.  I love the results!  I love that I get a cleaner feel that lasts longer, and my teeth are whiter, but not a fake bright white.  I know this toothpaste cost more (about 4x what I was paying for the other Crest toothpaste), but it might just be worth it if it saves me time in the dentist chair and not having to use whitening strips anymore.  Cudos to Crest for another amazing product that delivers exactly what it promises</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest, I got to try this product for free because I am a Bzzagent. I really wanted to love this new toothpaste. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t love stannous fluoride. Years ago I was obsessed with the idea of Crest Pro-Health, so I went out and purchased the whole whole of products. After using it twice a day for two weeks, my pearly whites turned dingy green. I also had issues with the toothpaste peeling the top layer of skin from the inside of my cheeks and lips after each use- gross! I was hoping that this toothpaste wouldn&#x27;t have the same problems, but it does. My first experience with this product was pretty negative. Step 1 hurt my gums. The 30 minutes after brushing my teeth, I had that nasty layer of skin peeling off from inside my mouth. This is a side-effect from the active ingredient on the toothpaste. I can&#x27;t deal with it, so I unfortunately won&#x27;t be using the toothpaste (step 1) again. Now step 2, the whiting/polishing gel is a cool product. I would purchase this product on its own. It is a peroxide based gel which is meant to whiten your teeth. I can also see this product counteracting the effects of the toothpaste, helping to avoid the green stains caused by the toothpaste. Today I used the whitening gel in place of my usual gel in my teeth whitening tray. The gel was cooling and minty. I left the tray in for about 5 minutes. I had the usual foaming action that I see with my usual whitening gel, but to a slightly lesser degree. The mint flavor made the whitening process kind of enjoyable. I noticed that my teeth were about 1/2 shade lighter which isn&#x27;t bad at all. The step 2 in this system was nice and gentle, so I would use it a few times a week for about 5 minutes and probably see significantly whiter teeth in about 2 weeks. So all in all, I hated the toothpaste and loved the gel. I hope that crest starts to sell these products separately.</li>
            <li> Really works.  2 minutes and my mouth feels cleaner than with any other product.  As clean as when I leave the dentist.  Very impressed.</li>
            <li> I got to try this Crest Pro Health HD for free thanks to Crest. I immediately saw a difference in my teeth after the first use. My teeth are not really bad stained so it was  great that I could tell a difference. The instructions are simple just a few steps so anyone can use. Open tube one and brush for one minute, spit but do not rinse. I , out of habit rinsed the first few times by accident. Next apply tube 2 and brush for one minute, then spit and rinse. It is literally that easy. I used for 5 days and my teeth felt great but then on the 6th day I noticed my gums were getting irritated and got white spots so I took a 3 day break and resumed. I leaned to brush looking in the mirror to avoid getting the whitening gel on my gums and it made all the difference. My family is now using it and loving it. I will be buying more after these tubes are empty.</li>
            <li> This is seriously my holy grail. I recently received this product from bzzagent and crest and i am already hooked to it. At first i thought it would be like usual toothpaste with high claims but i was so wrong. This product works. I used to be less confident with my smile and was not really happy with my overall oral health. This product has been a Savior. My teeth have never been so white my entire life and my confidence is 100%. My mouth feels fresh. I highly recommend this brushing system to everyone.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free from P&amp;G and I have been using it for 3 weeks.  I thought with two items this would take longer but I use an electric toothbrush and this fits into the 2 minute timer on it.  1 minute I use their toothpaste and the second minute I use the polish.  It is very simple and I thought it would take more time than regular brushing but it does not.  My teeth are whiter already and I can feel the smoothness of my teeth from the extra plaque removal.  I really enjoy that this is no longer than regular brushing since I have 2 young children who don&#x27;t give me much personal time.</li>
            <li> I got this free as product tester with Bzzagent. At first I was worried the kit comes with 2 separate tubes of toothpaste. I thought this 2 step process would be time consuming. After first use I realized that it did not add much time to my routine. First you purifying cleanser for one minute then without rinsing you add the polishing gel  and brush your teeth for an additional minute before rinsing. This product is very easy to use and makes your teeth feel amazing when you are done. When you run your tongue across your teeth you can see how clean and polished they are. It also makes your breathe very fresh and the clean feeling last all day. The only down side is that I thought my teeth would be whiter then what they are after 2 weeks of use. It is not a deal breaker because the product is better than other tooth paste I have used it the past but I thought it would get the teeth whiting strips look.</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro Health HD for over a week now and am very impressed with the results! The two step process takes a few brushes to get used to, but now that I am in the habit I don&#x27;t have to think twice about how to get whiter, cleaner teeth in 2 minutes. Step one provides a great clean feeling, while step two has the whitening power in a one-two punch system. My only complaint is the flavor of step two and the awkward aftertaste left behind. Its not terribly distracting, but definitely a place for improvement. While I did receive the the product free as a promotion from Crest, I would definitely recommend this product and purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I chose this product even though I was unsure about the 2 step process. I am also extremely skeptical about a toothpaste (or &#x27;system&#x27;) that makes teeth whiter. However, it hasn&#x27;t been that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 20 days of use, the feel of my teeth and mouth is certainly cleaner. Like crazy just-back-from-the-dentist clean. The toothpaste leaves my mouth/ breath smelling so great and feeling even better. But the second step takes me back to the days of Whitestrips. That sticky, weird gel tape that made it hard to talk or swallow or breathe. They made me gag and felt gross. The second step wasn&#x27;t that bad, but the taste leaves a bit to be desired. It is a metallic taste that doesn&#x27;t dissipate quickly. And as far as I am concerned, I see no change in the color of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all this said, if you are looking for extra clean feeling mouth, this is your product. But if you are spending the money to get a brand new bright white smile, I&#x27;d consider calling your dentist instead.</li>
            <li> I truly saw a whiter smile after a week of using this product.  And my teeth feel dentist clean afterwards. I like how you do not need to add an extra time to your weekly/monthly routine with an additional whitening product.  I am a mother with 4 small kids and I can whiten and clean in the same step as brushing me teeth daily.  I was at first unhappy with the price, BUT after some research it is the same price as whitening products and includes the toothpaste. I was able to try this product for free, I may not have tried it otherwise, now I am not sure that I can live with out it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the fresh feeling of the pastes, but I am more of a one step kind of person.  The first step is a thick paste, and you can tell there is more involved with it than your typical gel paste.  Step 2 is more liquidy, but does make your mouth feel fresh once you are done brushing.  I just prefer one step, but this is a refreshing paste.  I&#x27;m not totally sure about the whitening as I have some veneers, but overall it seems like I have a little brighter smile.  Thanks, Crest!</li>
            <li> I do not have the whitest teeth, so I was excited to try this product from Crest and BzzAgent, Crest Pro Health HD. I brushed with a Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush 2x a day for 2 weeks and used it as directed (1 minute tube 1, 1 minute tube 2). The taste was fresh and left my mouth feeling clean; however, I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in tooth whiteness. This may be, perhaps, because I also drink coffee in the morning every day. I also suffer from tooth/gum sensitivity, so I stopped using this toothpaste after 2 weeks. Overall, I think it&#x27;s worth a shot, especially if you don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth &amp; can finish the tubes!</li>
            <li> I was surprised with the results.  I have sensitive teeth, so used this in conjunction with my sensodyn.  I could see results after 3 days without bothering my sensitivity.  I didn&#x27;t love the flavor, but willing to overlook that for results!&lt;br /&gt;I did try this product free through a promotion.  But, it&#x27;s worth the price tag too because I could actually use it.</li>
            <li> I received this toothpaste from BzzAgent and Crest for review and my first thoughts before trying it was &amp;#34;oh another toothpaste&amp;#34;. However after the first use I found that it is more than just &amp;#34;another toothpaste&amp;#34;. This toothpaste after the first use gave me a just left the dentist clean feeling that I hadn&#x27;t experienced in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit itself consists of 2 steps which is definitely more work than using a regular toothpaste but it is worth it. The instructions specify to brush with each step for 1 minute each without rinsing in between, however I&#x27;ve been using it with my sonicare toothbrush and running one cycle per step (2 minutes per step of brushing time). I&#x27;ve yet to try the kit using a standard toothbrush so I&#x27;m unsure if it would give the same clean feeling that I receive with my sonicare. This product also states that it will whiten teeth, and it does to a certain extent and would probably work better if I did not drink so much coffee which just restains my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product and is worth the extra $$ compared to regular toothpaste and I will be purchasing again in the future.</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference, and feel. I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of toothpastes, I don&#x27;t really have a go to brand but this has definitely stood out.</li>
            <li> A two step toothpaste that leaves your moth feeling slightly cleaner then a one step toothpaste.  Still waiting for brilliantly white teeth before I decide to keep up the two tube routine.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this to try. My teeth are pretty white to begin with. After using the product for a couple weeks, I don&#x27;t really see any difference in the whiteness. The paste does have a nice, fresh, clean feeling though.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest, I am to try the Crest Pro-Health HD for free! I have been trying the whitening strips and trays which I just do not like and was elated to try this product. Dentists recommend that you brush your teeth for 2 minutes. The Crest Two-Step system breaks it down into two one-minute sessions so only &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; time you invest is the time it takes to apply the extra gel form the second tube onto the toothpaste, which is just a few seconds. As the other reviewers state - the wintergreen taste of tube one is nice and the gel taste in tube 2 is okay. I have noticed a difference in the whitening of my teeth - by a shade or two. I am not a smoker. I do not drink coffee, red wine or soda I do however drink tea several times a week. Overall, I do enjoy the Crest Pro-Health HD. I will be purchasing it once I run out of product. I have recommended it many friends, family &amp; co-workers!</li>
            <li> I was sent this sample through BuzzAgent, asked to use the product and report back what I think of it. I have been using this for the last 3 weeks.  I am really interested in finding whitening toothpaste that works. Sorry, but I do not see any difference in how white my teeth look now after the 3 week trial period. I have a little bit of sensitivity and this product did not make that any worse which is something I was concerned about. Considering the price of this product and the extra step involved when brushing your teeth, I do not feel this product is worth it. It takes more time without the added benefit of making my teeth any whiter.</li>
            <li> I got to try this for free thanks to Crest. What an amazing product! It got my teeth at least one shade lighter within 2 weeks. I keep using it and definitely see my teeth getting whiter while leaving them sparkling clean. Totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro-Health HD as part of the BzzAgent campaign.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks and found a slight whitening of my teeth and less gum bleeding.  The system is comprised of two separate tubes. Brush with the 1st tube for 1 minute.  This tube is the cleanser that strips away the plaque.  It is comprised of a  slightly gritty mint flavored blue gel that contains fluoride toothpaste to fight  cavity and gingivitis. You are instructed not to rinse after brushing with the 1st tube but proceed to brush with the 2nd tube for another minute.  The 2nd tube contains a clear smooth gel that  polishes and whitens the teeth. While brushing with the 2nd tube,  I noticed a very strong tingling mint flavor in my mouth.  Follow up with rinsing of your mouth.. I did see the dentist while using Crest Pro-Health HD.  The dentist did notice that my gums were in better shape.  However, in summary I found that the Crest Pro-Health HD system only slightly whitened my teeth and it may have improved my gum bleeding situation.  Due to the cost of the product I would like see if there is another product which would give me get better teeth whitening results.</li>
            <li> While my mouth did feel healthier, I only saw a slight change in the whitening of my teeth. The two step process does become tedious and I often rinsed after step one when instructions said to rinse after step two. Overall, I was expecting more but I did see some results.</li>
            <li> So I love having clean teeth, and I hate going to the dentist, I hse the Sonicare diamond clean system to help improve my chances of being in and out as quickly as possible. I have to say that having gotten the opportunity to try the Crest ProHealth HD for free was a great chance to find something new. my mouth felt clean and smooth with  nice minty fresh breath. I will say being a creature of habit remembering that its 2 steps was annoying at first but as I got into the groove it doesn&#x27;t bother me. This has been the simplest way to get whiter cleaner teeth so far. you should check it out.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest, I was able to try Crest Pro-Health HD two-step toothpaste.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and  I really like it.  My mouth feels super clean after I use it.  One night when I was out of town, I used regular toothpaste because I didn&#x27;t bring my Crest Pro-Health HD with me, and it was crazy how different the regular toothpaste felt.  My mouth/teeth did not feel as clean after using that toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only do my teeth feel cleaner, but I also notice a difference in the color and brightness of my teeth!  After seeing some photos of myself a few weeks after using Crest Pro-Health HD, I noticed that my teeth looked whiter than they have in the past.  I would definitely recommend Crest Pro-Health HD to anyone looking to have cleaner, brighter teeth.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for that fresh minty taste in your mouth after brushing your teeth, you won&#x27;t find it with this toothpaste. The texture or the first paste is a bit funny, but gets fully dissolved by the second paste. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days so I can&#x27;t speak to the teeth whitening aspect - but will update when I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I received this from a Crest rep to try out. Let me preface this with the fact that I am a dental hygienist. This is like the other Crest Pro Health toothpastes in that it is one that will cause mucosal sloughing in some individuals (meaning that the insides of your mouth may shed like a snake). Not sure what ingredient in the Pro Health line does this, but I&#x27;ve noticed it both personally and in my patients with these products, including this one with the first step paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing of note: don&#x27;t use this if you are sensitive to whitening agents. The second step is essentially a low dose whitening gel and can cause some to feel anything from a range to slight discomfort or severe pain. After one use, I could already feel some of my teeth feel more sensitive to cold air and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As some other reviewers have noted, the active ingredient, Stannous Fluoride, can stain the teeth. Stannous fluoride is notorious for this and could potentially stain some individuals teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the flavor is not all that great! If this toothpaste works for you, then that&#x27;s great, but just making some notes for those who may have gum or tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks now after receiving a sample from BzzAgent.  After just a couple days I immediately noticed a difference in the clean feeling compared to my old toothpaste.  I truly felt like I had a fresh-from-the-dentist clean.  All my teeth were super smooth and free of plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in whiteness.  I was already using a whitening toothpaste (Arm&amp;Hammer Advanced White), so this could be why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the two-step process goes, it wasn&#x27;t as cumbersome as I initially thought it was.  I used the timer on my phone to ensure I was getting the prescribed one-minute brushing from each step.  Naturally, this isn&#x27;t as \\&quot;easy\\&quot; as a single step 2-minute brush, but it&#x27;s not over-burdensome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another positive note is that I didn&#x27;t experience any of the possible side-effects mentioned on the packaging.  No spotting on the gums or teeth; no discomfort.</li>
            <li> When I recieced my free sample of Crest Pro Health HD, I was skeptical. I have used many whitening toothpastes in the paste and find that they don&#x27;t whiten so much as prevent further yellowing. The only read success I had with whitening was with the whitening strips. But those are pricey and don&#x27;t fit in my usually routine. After using Crest Pro Heath HD twice a day for over a week now I have notice a good amount of whitening! Not too the level of the white strips, but more than any other toothpaste I have used. The kit comes with 2 separate tubes of toothpaste. The first is a tradional toothpaste meant to clean the teeth. It has a pleasant taste that is reminiscent of wintergreen altoids. The second tube, that you use immediately after brushing with the first, contains a clear gel meant to do the actual whitening. This gel is mostly flavorless as far as I can tell. Overall I am pretty satisfied with the product, and would recommend it to anyone who wanted a toothpaste that actually does a decent job whitening. I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product from Crest and have been using it consistently for four weeks (missing an occasional morning in the rush to get out of the house). First off I&#x27;ve never had much luck with tooth whitening products such as gels or strips, compliance has always been an issue for me. This paste has been very easy as I&#x27;ve just substituted it for my normal past when brushing.  In terms of impact, it&#x27;s been great.  In fact, my wife commented a week ago that I must be using the product regularly and commented &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve never seen your teeth look so white and healthy&amp;#34;.  Just again yesterday she said &amp;#34;your teeth look great, I think I might have to start using your toothpaste (refer to the Crest HD). Note also that I&#x27;m a 3-4 cups a day coffee drinker, so I&#x27;ve got that working against my white teeth! Suffice it to say I&#x27;ve been very happy with the product. My teeth also feel cleaner, which may have to do with actually brushing my teeth for the full recommended two minutes.  One tip that&#x27;s worked for me is using my electric toothbrush which beeps after each 30 second interval to ensure I go a full minute with each step. All in all this product has been a great way for me to get whiter, cleaner teeth</li>
            <li> So easy to use, and best of all - visible results (i.e. whiter teeth) after just 5 days of use! My mouth feels extremely clean; I&#x27;ll continue using this toothpaste. (Disclosure: I received the product as part of a free promotion from the brand)</li>
            <li> I have been a long time fan of Crest Toothpaste every since I was little.  My parents brought me up on Crest and they still use it today. I was at first a little bit skeptical to switch and try something new because I thought how much better can this new Crest HD really be compared to the regular toothpaste?  But after using this product, I started noticing a change after the first couple of times using it.  My husband and I both smoke and drink coffee, so are teeth; needless to say, are very stained and have a terrible yellow tinge.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe how wonderfully white mine and my husbands teeth were getting just after only a few uses. Besides that, the way it left our teeth feeling so fresh and clean was awesome! Normally I have the worst taste in my mouth not long after using regular toothpaste, but after using the Crest Pro two step system; my mouth stays fresh and clean tasting all day!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a whiter and cleaner smile that last for a long time!!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste I have EVER used! It ACTUALLY does what it says it will do.  I noticed whitening the first time I used it. So mush so that I made my 2 boys, 8 &amp; 11 come use it immediatly (they were less than thrilled...).  My husband said we are &amp;#34;never going back&amp;#34; to regular one step toothpaste.  I recived this profuct as a promotional item, so I was glad to find out it sells for about $12 at a local retailer.</li>
            <li> I had the chance to sample this product for free through BzzAgent and I am pleased with the results. I was using a standard non-whitening toothpaste before, and after a couple weeks of using the Crest Pro-Health product my teeth are starting to seem noticeably whiter. When I am not in a rush while getting ready, I don&#x27;t mind using the two step system and I feel like I am getting my mouth extra clean from the double-brushing. Sometimes at night when I am super tired I do use a standard toothpaste so I don&#x27;t have to use this two-step system, but for the most part it&#x27;s not a major inconvenience. I would recommend this product to anyone like me who never tried a whitening system before!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product. I received a free sample and I am going to admit, I was a little apprehensive. A tothpaste that can whiten my teeth? But alas, I was wrong. I took a before picture and a picture 2 weeks&lt;br /&gt;ater and you could tell there was a definite difference in the shades of my teeth. The first part of brushing is the toothpaste and the second is the whitening. I wish the whitening had more bubbles so that I could feel the product working in my mouth, but I was impressed wih the after picture. I would recommend this product and the opinions in this review are 100% my own</li>
            <li> amazing product......... the first step really leaves your teeth feeling clean...... and i don&#x27;t completely understand as it makes my mouth feel much cleaner than other products with the exact same active ingredient at the same concentration... i think the first step paste is much more viscous (flows better) than most competing products.. that could be the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;second step is good too...... very strong bleaching agent as you certainly feel a burn in your mouth. i would think you might want to put the 2nd paste in a mouthpiece to minimize contact with flesh (i don&#x27;t care. it doesn&#x27;t seem to do any damage at all)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i think you can buy the steps separately but i found the price of one was 85% of the total package anyway... step 1 works really really well.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  I was skeptical of a 2 step cleansing system when I received my complimentary box from BzzAgent, but after having a couple of weeks to test it out, I can say that the 2 step system is no more work than a 1 step toothpaste, but with much better benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You first brush for 1 minute with tube 1 - the cleanser.  Its pretty mild - not really much flavor.  Without rinsing, you then brush for 1 minute with tube 2 - the polisher/whitener.  Simple enough.  I tested it for 1 week then compared a before and after to see if their claim of &amp;#34;6x healther teeth &amp; 6x whiter teeth in 1 week&amp;#34; was an accurate claim, and I can honestly say I feel like I got an even better result than that.  After 3 weeks of using this system, my teeth are no longer sensitive, are SO shiny, and much whiter.  Not only does my mouth feel healthier, but my teeth look healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a pricey product, but when considering what you get out of it, the price is totally worth it to me.  Based on use of it so far, I&#x27;m expecting it to last at least twice as long as my regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I received a sample from Crest of the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste. I&#x27;ve tried several whiteners, but have never tried one in the form of toothpaste. I thought the 2 step, 2 toothpastes would be a pain when reading over the directions, but that is not the case at all! It didn&#x27;t add any time to my normal brushing routine. My teeth felt amazingly clean after Step 1. Step 2 didn&#x27;t have a taste but took some getting used to. My husband and I both agreed that our teeth looked whiter. I took away 1 star due to the price.</li>
            <li> Who doesn’t want have whiter teeth, right? I was so excited when I was selected for this campaign but it was too good to be true. At least for me... The first week I tried, I had to stop because mu gum started being extremely painful. I was not sure if this was due to the toothpaste or not, so I decided to wait for my gum to heal and start again the product.&lt;br /&gt;The second try was not as bad as the first one but I have to admit that I cannot use this product on a daily basis or even several times per day. While step 1 is not really a problem, I actually like the fresh feeling left with this paste, I am rather having a hard time with step 2. As soon as I put the step 2 gel on my teeth I start feeling my teeth tingling and my gum burning. Do I have sensitive teeth? YES. So I guess I should expect this kind of reaction. So I tried to reduce the amount of gel but still the tingling and burning feeling is still there.&lt;br /&gt;The whole point of using this kind of product is to start seeing results, but unfortunately if not used on a daily basis I do not think whiter teeth are to be expected. So I would say that this product is not recommended if you have sensitive teeth, so it is not a product for me!!&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AS PART OF A PROMOTION FROM THE BRAND.</li>
            <li> I really love the way this feels after i use both steps. I recieved this as a free sample to test and absolutley love it. I just had a ton of work done to my teeth and it doesnt effect sensitivity at all. My mouth feels so fresh after using this product. I would highly reccommend!!</li>
            <li> I received this toothpaste for free from Bzzagent in an exchange for a review. At first I didn&#x27;t care for adding an extra step during my brushing routine but, because this program requires it for the desired results, I quickly became accustomed to it. My teeth feel clean every time I brush but no more clean than my regular toothpaste. I personally didn&#x27;t notice a difference in the color of my teeth but my husband (who did not know I was using a whitener) commented on how white my teeth looked after using it for about 2 weeks. The taste of the toothpaste is fresh and minty, not medicinal at all. Overall, I liked using it. It forced me to brush longer than I normally would, left my mouth fresh and tarter free and my teeth were whiter in about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I had already found the toothbrush of my dreams and was looking for a better toothpaste when as a Buzz Agent I had an opportunity to try the new Crest Pro-Health HD via a promotion from Crest.  Hands down it is a remarkable option to the other pastes out there that have left icky grit in my mouth or even gave me sores on my tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The HD is a two step process that starts with a no rinse cleanser followed by a polishing gel.  I mentally struggled thinking of the 2 minutes I needed to dedicate to the brushing process but soldiered on.  The taste of both products is successfully underwhelming and leaves a clean feeling and super smooth surface to run your tongue over-well worth the investment in a smile to be proud of and I will definitely keep this product in my cupboard!</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for over a month and love it! From the very first use, it makes your teeth feel just like you left the dentist office after a cleaning. I also think my teeth look whiter. It is more expensive than regular toothpaste, but definitely worth the money! I got to try this for free through BzzAgent and Crest, but definitely plan to continue to purchase it for myself.</li>
            <li> With today&#x27;s busy world, the thought of brushing my teeth and taking 2 steps to do this was not something I was looking forward to doing. However, the whole process really takes less than a few minutes. The first step is actually cleansing your teeth. It removes plague and other stuff. The second step actually whitens and polishes your teeth. There is a different taste to get used too, but I feel having a fresher feeling in my mouth when all is said and done is worth it. I did notice whiter teeth but I am not sure if they are 6x whiting than what they were before, as I have no way to measure this. the first time I used Crest HD, I felt like I just came from my dentist&#x27;s office. After using this product for a couple of weeks, I have brighter teeth. My whole mouth feels healthier.</li>
            <li> I got this item for free from Bzzagent. I really liked it. It leaves my breathe fresh for a really long time and my teeth have definitely gotten whiter. A+! I particularly love the second step of the system. It has a bit of a baking soda flavor, but that&#x27;s what makes it work. I like the two steps also because it helps me to brush for the full two minutes, since it&#x27;s only one minute per tube. This is a great system and I&#x27;m totally going to keep using it. My husband loves it too! Both my husband and I have also noticed that our gums are healthier and less inflamed. It&#x27;s super convenient, and really the best whitening system we&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t completely sold on the idea of using two products to brush my teeth when I received samples of this line from BzzAgent. However, I was impressed from the first day! I think that using two products helps me brush more thoroughly than I usually do. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in how clean my teeth feel, a reduction in gross morning breath, and whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to use. Brush 1 minutes with tube 1, spit, brush another minute with tube 2. It&#x27;s so much better than having to sit for 30 minutes with whitening strips in your mouth! I received a free sample to evaluate and I&#x27;ve been using it about 1-2 weeks and I&#x27;ve already noticed my teeth are a bit brighter and whiter than before. The taste of the peroxide step isn&#x27;t too bad either. Overall quite a nice product. I would buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from Crest via BzzAgent. I like the taste of the toothpaste (1st step) quite a bit. In fact, I have been looking for a toothpaste that I like the taste of because most of them are awful in my opinion. I found it somewhat hard to be consistent with the second step. I tend to only use whitening products when my teeth get noticeably yellow, and I don&#x27;t think that I would use the second step all the time but would use it for several weeks when I felt the need. I found both steps easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  I noticed from the first time I used it how smooth and clean my teeth felt.  After one week I could notice that my teeth wore getting even whiter.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> I enjoy the taste and texture of both pastes, I&#x27;m big on texture! My teeth feel&lt;br /&gt;So incredibly clean with step 1, so I knew step 2 was working! I got my kit as a free sample which made it all the better! I had fairly white teeth to begin with, no coffee, wine or cigarettes in my diet. It was a great touch up for my teeth for spring!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this new product from Crest through BzzAgent, because, honestly, I haven&#x27;t enjoyed the last few Crest toothpastes that I&#x27;ve used. I was considering switching brands. This is the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve used in a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I want white teeth but have zero interest in the time and money it takes to use a whitening kit. Second, I want a toothpaste that leaves a fresh feel and taste in my mouth. This accomplishes both with little extra effort. Some of the whitening toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried in the past are too harsh. They leave a strange aftertaste in my mouth and are rough on my gums. This is extremely refreshing! I have relatively white teeth to begin with, but with age, I was getting yellowing near my gum line. I have noticed a lot of improvement over the last few weeks, and so have my family members. My mom asked me about the product and wants to try it. I also have not had any issues with my gums while using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pricier than normal toothpaste, so I will likely use it again, but not completely replace my regular toothpaste with it. I will be in a few weddings this spring, though, and plan to use it leading up to the events. It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this for the last two weeks and am very impressed with the results. My teeth are substantially whiter. It feels like a professional job. Someone even commented on my nice smile two days ago. I definitely recommend Crest Pro Health HD. It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try this product through Bzzagent. Thanks, Crest! I really like this system. The first step gets my teeth clean, and the second step (the whitening) is far easier and quicker than either strips or trays. My teeth do look whiter than they did when I started the kit. My morning breath is also noticeably better.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative things I can say are that they first step waters down very quickly. It doesn&#x27;t stay foamed very long, so you have to be quick.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product.</li>
            <li> I am a member of bzzagent.com and I have received this item free as an item to rate and review.  I have been using it for 3 weeks daily with my new Phillips a Electric diamond toothbrush.  It has a clean setting and a whitener setting and I feel my teeth are cleaner than ever before and I feel that I am noticing a whiter smile.  I will buy this product in future!</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health HD Two-Step Toothpaste System is a two-step tooth-cleaning process that requires minimal time to complete. The steps are simple: brush with the fluoride toothpaste for one minute, spit (but do not rinse), then brush with the hydrogen peroxide gel for an additional minute. The expectation is that you will use the system morning and night, totaling four minutes a day of oral care (not including flossing and all the other stuff you might or might not do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say that my teeth have never felt cleaner than when I used this system with my Spinbrush classic. My teeth literally felt like perfectly buffed pearls in my mouth. I can only imagine how well the system works with one of the more high-tech brushes (sonic) applying the pastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaint is in regard to the whitening claim. I literally saw no change in how white my teeth were even after weeks of use. This may be because I have used Crest Whitestrips within the past two years, or it may just be that whatever has caused the discoloration of my teeth isn&#x27;t affected by hydrogen peroxide. Whatever the case, I can&#x27;t recommend this whitening toothpaste for its whitening properties - though it still does an impressive job of cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li> I got this toothpaste for free from Crest to try. I was excited about trying this product, after all who&#x27;s teeth couldn&#x27;t use some whitening. I told my 10 year old daughter about it. She had cute little pearly whites when she was little but since her adult teeth have come in they&#x27;ve been less than white and it really bothers her. My mom was also visiting for the month so I thought we could to the 6 days together. There was plenty of toothpaste for all three of us.  I&#x27;ve waited until the full 6 days were complete before posting anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial pros: the full size package we received is huge it would take one person a long time to go through it. So that&#x27;s nice.&lt;br /&gt;Initial cons: there isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; strip to measure any progress. They claim your teeth will be 6x whiter in 6 days..but how can we tell?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We took before pics and got started. I got out a timer so we could make sure that we were following the directions exactly. One minute with tube # 1 and then 1 minute with tube # 2. First impressions, I didn&#x27;t care for the flavor of either tube. Tube 1 is your normal toothpaste, but it has a very mild mint flavor. Tube 2 is the whitening/polishing gel, it almost has a fruity flavor, it reminded me of the gel fluoride treatments I got as a kid. On and on we went morning and night for 6 days. It was actually quite fun all 3 of us brushing together to the timer. :)  After the first day I could tell my teeth were cleaner than normal. It does work good at polishing!  After day 3 we could see noticeable change in in the color or my daughters teeth, no change for me or my mom.  After 6 days, I still don&#x27;t think my teeth have gotten whiter, but they are cleaner. My mom says the same. My daughter teeth on the other hand are whiter. She loves the toothpaste &amp;#34;Feels like the dentist every day&amp;#34;. I have to agree with her, it does feel like you&#x27;ve had your teeth cleaned at the dentist. I got used to flavor of the toothpaste over time. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product for cleaner, healthier teeth.&#x27;d recommend this product for cleaner, healthier teeth.</li>
            <li> gave my teeth spots. Full disclosure, I got this product free from Crest, via the Bzz marketing company</li>
            <li> I received a sample kit of the Crest HD system through BzzAgent.  I did use the product for two weeks following the directions.  The bottom line is that the product is somewhat more difficult to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you notice there are two parts to this system.  Step 1 is the cleaning step.  It is a very thin paste with a very strong mint flavor.  After 1 minute you stop brushing and put step 2 onto your toothbrush.  It is important not to rinse between steps.  Step 2 is a bleaching gel and doesn&#x27;t taste very good, the strong flavor of step 1 helps mask the poor taste.  After another minute you are done and you rinse as normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a Sonicare toothbrush, and unfortunately mine does not have the feature that beeps every 30 seconds.  That would have made the switch at 1 minute easier to time.  I relied on counting to 60 because I would repeatedly forget to bring a watch in with me.  This two part system is a little more inconvenient than normal toothpaste, but probably better than whitening trays.  It wouldn&#x27;t have been a problem, except I didn&#x27;t see a difference in my tooth color after 2 weeks.  For me, it was not worth the hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mouth did feel clean, but I did not like the aftertaste or the sensation left by the bleaching agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found the packaging to be strange.  Crest spent more time with the technical requirements of the bleaching paste than they did the use of the entire system.  Step 1 is a flip cap that is easy to open.  Step 2 is a screw cap that if you forget to open before you brush, is hard to open one handed.  And this shouldn&#x27;t matter at all, but the label on step 2 is upside down if you place the tube on the flat part of the cap, the opposite of step 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, after 2 weeks of using this product, I had increased sensitivity.  I was glad to go back to a one tube sensitivity Crest product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applaud Crest for indulging somebody&#x27;s new idea.  It just doesn&#x27;t deliver enough of a difference in results to make up for the extra hassle.in results to make up for the extra hassle.</li>
            <li> From the first time I used this my teeth felt smooth and I loved the minty fresh breath. The  two step system is easy and  you can spit  after step one, but no rinsing! It really doesn&#x27;t take any longer and you can really feel the difference from a one step. After using these for a few weeks I do see some big difference in how much whiter my teeth look.  And as an added bonus makes my breath so much better. I have tried other whitening systems before but they have not work like this one does.  Plus my new whiter teeth have gotten noticed by friends and family.  I got to try this free thanks to Crest and Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li> I held off on writing this review because I wanted to give the product time to actually work, not just hype a review based on so little time. I have fluorosis, so my teeth have been on the yellow side with dark patches since I was a kid. Dentists always said that I&#x27;d have to get my teeth professionally bleached (of course they did) if I wanted them white again. Turns out that&#x27;s not true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a couple weeks I could see signs of lightening, and my fiancee mentioned that my teeth seemed whiter. Longer into it now, even the dark patches are fading which I did not expect. My teeth, while still bright and shiny, are definitely whiter than they have been in years. I did have to cut down to using the regiment once a day because I have sensitive teeth, but my teeth have still gotten progressively whiter. I&#x27;ve been very happy with the results of this toothpaste so far, and plan on continuing to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I got the product for free thanks to Crest, but that doesn&#x27;t take away from the fact that my teeth are whiter.</li>
            <li> This product works great.  My teeth feel so clean afterwards and I know that they are healthier.  Easiest two minutes of my morning routine.  I tried this product for free thanks to Crest, but the opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about a two-step toothpaste, really.  I made sure to do everything as normally as possible - same toothbrush, same place, same time. The first step, which reminds me of the gritty toothpaste the dentist uses to polish at a cleaning, is pretty normal and feels fine. The second step is a little less enjoyable, since you apply it to the toothbrush after spitting (but not rinsing).  This whitening gel is sort of warm in the mouth and not the most pleasant feeling, but certainly not as awfully tedious and uncomfortable as whitening strips for 20+ minutes!  My teeth were so clean, I was sure I&#x27;d just left the dentist office! I do think the whitening gel makes a difference, but it&#x27;s hard to tell. The mouth-feel of my teeth, however, is truly remarkable.  4 stars, because I don&#x27;t think the two tubes is super convenient for travel and I don&#x27;t use it when I&#x27;m in a rush, but it&#x27;s really a powerful tool for ultra-clean teeth. Product was provided free thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li> Before I review this product I think there should be full disclosure, I was able to try this product free thanks to a promotion by Crest.However, that does not sway my opinion! This product is absolutely amazing! I saw improvements in about 4 or 5 days and my mouth felt cleaner right away. I love the hybrid nature of it, how it is like a cross between conventional toothpaste and whitening trays. I used to hate whitening because of the pain it would cause my gums. Not any more. This is definitely the way to go. My teeth are much whiter than they have ever been. My breath has never been better. Not sure if it&#x27;s because of the tooth paste or not but my wife has been kissing me a lot more!</li>
            <li> I got to try this product for free, which is nice because I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought it other wise.  Here&#x27;s what I decided:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It has fluoride!! which anyone who worries about cavities like I do knows it a game changer!&lt;br /&gt;It does whiten! I don&#x27;t know if I would say 6x, but its better than normal whitening toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make your teeth super sensitive like whitening strips or trays do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s kinda an annoying extra process... brush your teeth and then brush your teeth again...&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely 100% hate the flavor of the whitening stuff!! bleh, but with that being said, youre going to get the same flavor if you use whitening strips or trays&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t whiten as fast as the strips or trays do.</li>
            <li> Remarkable and noticeable results....cleaner....brighter.....whiter!</li>
            <li> I recieved a free sample of the Crest Pro-Health HD system from Crest and I have to say that I really do like it.  I noticed a difference in the color of my teeth after the first use, and it has only gotten better from there.  I have been using the system for about 3 weeks and my teeth are noticeably whiter.  I also dont get any sensitivity issues with this system as I have when using other whitening products.  The only downside is that it is sometimes hard to remember to do the second step.  I have used one tube of toothpaste for so long, that it is hard to make myself reach for a second tube before I rinse.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this product to try from Crest and knew as soon as I got it that I&#x27;d be sharing it with my wife. Reading the package and Crest&#x27;s claims who wouldn&#x27;t want to see if you did in fact have the tools in hand to get a smile that was 6X whiter and mouth that was 6X healthier than before. We started using it and I noticed that the first tube wasn&#x27;t sealed tightly at the bottom and leaked when I squeezed toothpaste onto my brush, but using a little Yankee ingenuity took care of that issue.&lt;br /&gt;We both have used this new toothpaste for several weeks and agree that our mouths feel fresh and tingly after we brush. I&#x27;ve noticed some improvement in the color of my coffee-stained teeth. I&#x27;d hesitate to say that they&#x27;re 6 times brighter, but there has been noticeable improvement.&lt;br /&gt;We are regular Crest users and are pleased with what we&#x27;ve seen from this new product.  We&#x27;ll keep using it!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Crest Pro Health HD from Crest through BzzAgent and I am loving the results.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of a traditional toothpaste, this is 2-part product which will replace brushing &amp; using white strips. First, you brush for 1 minute with the step 1 purifying cleanser, then spit that out, and brush for an additional minute with the step 2 purifying gel. The combination of the steps include fluoride, polishing agents, a hydrogen peroxide whitener and anti-tartar ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mouth feels fresh and clean which lasts for hours compared to my normal toothpaste. Some might say that the 2-step process is time consuming but I have always brushed my teeth for the 2 minutes so the only extra step is switching from step 1 to step 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest uses stannous fluoride has been around and approved by the FDA for quite a long time.  This will help with tooth sensitivity issues which usually occur with whiting products. I have not had any sensitivity since using this product compared to whiting strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product as it helps the teeth with fluoride, gums with anti gingivitis, and your smile with the quick white teeth/</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product from BzzAgent, and I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like this toothpaste, knowing that I had multiple steps to brush my teeth. I have to admit that I think Crest should have put step 1 in the blue tube, since the toothpaste is blue, and then the finishing gel in the silver tube since it is clear, and I associate polishing with silver. I have accidentally started with step 2 at least 5 times, because the colored tubes make more sense to me to use the blue one first, then the silver! I really wonder if I am the only one who has done this!&lt;br /&gt;I do think the toothpaste works well. It has a clean, but not overpowering flavor, and after one week of use I went to a dentist appointment and was complimented by the dentist on my clean teeth! I think that it could do a better job of whitening, but overall is a decent toothpaste that I would purchase if it was not too expensive.</li>
            <li> Although I initially received this product for free (thanks, BuzzAgent), I have since purchased this using my own money because I am so pleased with the results from using this product. At first, I was a little annoyed by the use of 2 toothpastes. I felt it was just one more step added to an already busy routine. But, it quickly became routine and does not bother me any more. My teeth are noticeably healthier and seem to sparkle. The plaque in the back of my teeth has noticeably decreased. Also, I notice that I wake up with less morning breath. This is definitely more than just regular toothpaste and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Definitely whitens teeth!! For me though, it only lasted for as long as I was using it, so I had to use it every day. And call me lazy but it was a little bit annoying to have to use two tubes at each brushing. After a while, I tended to only use it in the morning and I could definitely tell that my teeth weren&#x27;t as white as when I used it every time I brushed. I really does make teeth whiter so if that&#x27;s important to you, and you&#x27;re dedicated, and use it all the time, you WILL see a big difference!! I found that the second tube of paste had a really harsh taste and burned my lips a bit so I was less inclined to want to use it. (But I do have a sensitive mouth to lots of different toothpastes!&lt;br /&gt;Just FYI - I got this product free as part of BzzAgent, in order to use and review it. BzzAgent is so cool, if you&#x27;re not part of it, you should check it out!</li>
            <li> My teeth were whiter in minutes! Crest Pro Health HD worked so fast I couldn&#x27;t believe it. The toothpaste tastes great, your breath smell kissably fresh, and makes your teeth feel dentist office clean. The gel makes your teeth whiter the first use. They get whiter and whiter everyday. By the third week they were three shades whiter. I&#x27;m super impressed. I will purchase this. It&#x27;s my new go to toothpaste. The only con is my gums became sensitive after a week or so. The pros by far outweigh the cons. Best part of it all I got to try it for free from Crest and Bzz</li>
            <li> I was sent a free trial of the Crest 3D white daily cleansing and whitening toothpaste. This one doesn&#x27;t say anything on the package about the whitening aspect, the package I received looked a little different, and I felt I saw results after the very first brushing.. I will say that I prefer to feel a little mintier after and I also find it a little annoying to have two bottles especially since I travel so much. However, if it actually gives good results than I the slight inconvenience is worth it. I do keep using my old crest with whitening single tube of toothpaste and have to make a conscious effort to remember to use my new product. Once I get in the routine and use it on a regular basis I will do a before and after pic</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro Health HD free from Crest via BzzAgent.  I love that my mouth feels clean for hours after I brush.  I had no trouble with the two step system after brushing for a few days.  However, I do not believe my teeth are 6x whiter.  They are whiter, but overall I think that crest whitestrips do a better job whitening.</li>
            <li> Good results.  I tried this product for free courtesy of crest.  I did feel like my teeth were cleaner and felt polished-they look better too!  I just kept forgetting to not rinse my mouth after the first step out of habit!  I kept messing it up.  I don&#x27;t like that there are 2 steps.  If it were only one step then I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I loved Crest Pro Heath HD toothpaste so much that I&#x27;m considering replacing my current toothpaste with it permanently!  I was able to use it to quickly and easily clean AND brighten my smile.  I wanted to give it time to whiten, so I used the two step combo twice a day for over a month.  It was so simple and easy to use, it wasn&#x27;t any more work at all to use a 2 step process.  In fact, it saved me time because I didn&#x27;t have to whiten AND brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really excited to try this because I drink a lot of coffee and the coffee was beginning to noticeably stain my teeth.  After just 4 weeks, the Crest Pro Heath HD toothpaste had lightened my smile very effectively, it was back to normal!  I was very impressed with the results.  My spouse even noticed immediately and was impressed with the whitening power in such a short time!  They are hooked now too.  &#x3D;)  I will definitely use this again to whiten and brush.  Crest even let me try it out for free through BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health HD comes with two tubes that are marked Step 1 and Step 2.  The tubes are also different colors (silver and blue) so you don&#x27;t mix them up, which is a nice touch.  Step 1, the &amp;#34;Purifying Cleanser,&amp;#34; is the larger, silver tube, and it&#x27;s like a regular toothpaste.  It&#x27;s nice and minty and a slightly aqua or blue color like some mint gel toothpastes are.  You brush your teeth with this first for 1 minute, and spit but do not rinse with water.  Step 2, the &amp;#34;Perfecting Gel,&amp;#34; is in a smaller, blue tube.  It&#x27;s a clear, somewhat runny or watery gel.  You brush with this second step for 1 minute, spit (but don&#x27;t rinse), and brush for 1 minute more.  This gel tastes more like a product from the dentist&#x27;s office.  It&#x27;s not bad per se, but not nice and minty like regular toothpaste.  More of a medicinal taste, which is kind of unfortunate since it&#x27;s the last taste you have in your mouth as Step 2.  One thing I liked about these products is that you feel more inclined to brush for longer; they recommend 3 minutes total of brushing (1 for the cleansing, and 2 for the purifying gel).  My mouth felt really clean afterwards.  The tubes are small, though.  My husband and I usually share 1 tube of toothpaste in the master bathroom, and I feel like this would be gone very quickly if two people used it.  I have used the Crest Whitestrips product in the past.  In my experience, those strips whitened my teeth faster and more noticeably.  This Pro Health HD product seems to me better at reducing stains or maintaining whiteness than whitening itself.  I didn&#x27;t see any dramatic improvement, but my mouth feels clean. I got a free sample of the product from Crest.</li>
            <li> As I have found most whitening systems do not work. But I fell in love with the crest 2 step system.  It works great. First of all I love that it has the everyday toothpaste that cleans and keeps mouth healthy.  I definitely recommend this to those who are looking for an easy option to maintain a bright healthy white smile.</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest ProHealth HD for 4 weeks thanks to a free system from Crest and BzzAgent. I can reiterate what many other reviewers appear to be saying - although my teeth do feel very clean with use of this product, I haven&#x27;t experienced any noticeable difference in the health of my mouth or the whiteness of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary innovation of this toothpaste seems to be that, as it has two steps, it causes me to brush for twice as long as I otherwise would. It also contains hydrogen peroxide in the perfecting gel, which of course is a proven effective whitening and oral debriding agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary mark against this toothpaste is the price. Yes, it works, but it doesn&#x27;t work any more effectively than my regular toothpaste, which costs about a third of what this system does. I also take exception to the amount of packaging that this toothpaste entails (I feel very wasteful) and I&#x27;m leery of stannous fluoride, which may actually stain the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall score for this toothpaste is 3/5 stars. It works, and my mouth feels clean and tastes pleasant - but I could achieve the same effects with much less expense.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health HD is awesome.  I received it free as part of a sampling/review program from BzzAgent and I’m glad I did.  I went to the dentist last Thursday for my 6 month check up, I had been using Crest pro Health HD for about 4 weeks prior.  I never said anything to the dental hygienist, but she commented on how little plaque I had on my teeth and that I had been doing an excellent job brushing.  I’m not known to be the greatest brusher and I’ve never received a complement from the dentist or hygienist before.  Crest Pro Health HD is a keeper.</li>
            <li> When I got a free box of the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two Step Toothpaste from Crest through bzzagent, I was skeptical.  I had used whitening toothpastes before without much difference and I had tried the strips and I never seemed to be able to follow through on those to get them to work well.  I had a box of strips that had been sitting, unused, next to my sink for a few months, so I decided to give the Crest Pro-Health HD Toothpaste a try. I read the directions, which I am glad I did, because you use the step 1 for a minute (the fluoride toothpaste to protect against cavities &amp; gingivitis) and then you spit it out, but you do not rinse (It took a few rounds of this before it because second nature not to rinse with water). Then you use the Step 2 for a minute (a whitening gel that contains hydrogen peroxide).  You rinse after this step is complete.  Within a few days, I thought my teeth looked whiter.  I drink a lot of tea and some soda and my teeth tend to lose their shine and get a bit of a dingy look to them.  After I had been using the Crest Pro Health HD for a couple weeks, my mom came into town and one of the first things she said to me was to ask if I had had my teeth whitened.  The product is very simple to use and it produced results for me.  You brush your teeth as long as you normally would (two minutes total each brushing), so there&#x27;s no added time or inconvenienced like you can have with strips or other whitening methods. I am also not a fan of my toothpaste flavors, but this has a light minty taste that did not bother me at all. My first box may have been free, but I have continued using it on my own.</li>
            <li> At first I was hesitant to try a 2-step system for a toothpaste. However, considering it takes only 2 minutes total, I quickly got over my hesitancy. The step 1 fluoride is exactly what I need - removes plaque and reduces gingivitis. The step 2 hydrogen peroxide gel is great for removing surface stains. If you are a coffee and wine-drinker like I, you will benefit from and appreciate this toothpaste combo. I tend to be sensitive to whitening toothpastes, and my teeth didn&#x27;t tingle when using this step. I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars because I think the mint flavor could be a bit stronger. However, my mouth still feels clean after using the HD system. I personally just like a stronger, more pungent flavor. I did receive this toothpaste free courtesy of Crest but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I tried this product as part of a BzzAgent promotion. Unfortunately the results were average at best. Although it did leave my breath fresh, the whitening affect was minimal, only slightly noticeable after two weeks of use. Having to use two tubes is a bit of a hassle, the second tube doesn&#x27;t have a flip top which might have eased the annoyance slightly. It doesn&#x27;t taste all that good either. Overall though, I did feel like my teeth were clean after using the product, but I&#x27;m not sure the extra cost is justified by the limited additional benefits.</li>
            <li> I received a free package of Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste as a BzzAgent to try out and give my opinion.  My teeth were noticeably whiter after a week of using this toothpaste twice a day.  After five weeks, my teeth are still whiter than before and I&#x27;m happy with the product.  Plus, it is super easy!  No messy, annoying whitening strips.  Simply brush for one minute using Step 1 and then brush for another minute using Step 2.  Then your done.  I was a bit concerned that my sensitive teeth would have a problem switching to a new toothpaste (I have used Sensodyne for over 10 years) but I have had no issues with my teeth for the last five weeks.  Love this produce and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> So full disclosure, I received Crest Pro Health® HD™ toothpaste for free to try as part of a promotion with Crest and BzzAgent. With that out of the way, I will explain to those unfamiliar with this product that the two-step process involves one minute of brushing with the cleaning toothpaste and then one minute of brushing with the polishing/whitening gel. The cleaning toothpaste seems to be comparable to other Crest products. The whitening gel also seems similar to home whiteners. The fact that it is a two-step process is an extremely minor inconvenience, though when you have an electric toothbrush (as I do) it simplifies things. I know that after it buzzes twice it&#x27;s time to move onto step 2.&lt;br /&gt;I find the taste to be inoffensive. It&#x27;s not great, but I don&#x27;t really expect toothpaste or teeth whiteners to have a pleasant taste. The step 1 toothpaste is a little on the gritty side, if that&#x27;s something that bothers you.&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I will say that I was really glad I got this opportunity because my teeth definitely look whiter. It&#x27;s not as stunning of a difference as I saw with some other people&#x27;s reviews, but I definitely noticed whiter teeth after using the Crest Pro Health® HD™ for 30 days. I think my teeth weren&#x27;t that yellow to begin with, so maybe a less dramatic change is to be expected. I guess that&#x27;s the only reason I&#x27;m giving 4 stars rather than 5.</li>
            <li> The product was easy to use. The flavor was pretty good. However, I&#x27;ve only used it one week and I&#x27;m not quite sure what the advantages are yet.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try CREST HD for free and at first I was nervous because it was a two step process, but I got over that quickly because of how great my mouth felt the next day. I could instantly feel how clean my teeth felt all day and barely any plaque was present by the time I got home from work. I also liked that it had a whitening component that was not as time consuming as other products. I did notice that it made my teeth sensitive the first couple of days, but it eventually passed. All in all I was more than satisfied with my experience and would recommend it to anyone willing to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I found that my teeth were not as sensitive as they were using a normal tartar control, whiteneing toothpaste. The consistency of the paste is good, it is not too thick or too thin. The Smooth Mint flavor is pleasant and your mouth remains feeling fresh for hours.</li>
            <li> While the toothpaste seemed to work really well, the taste was way too strong and I really did not want to keep brushing for two minutes like my dentist says I should.</li>
            <li> I was really wanting to like this product, truly I was.  I&#x27;ve tried other whitening strips in the past and found them too annoying.  This product seemed interesting.  Here is the problem:  There is a big warning on the product that says not for anyone under 12.  WHY??  I get why regular toothpaste isn&#x27;t for small kids because they could eat the fluoride.  This however, begs the question - what is in this toothpaste that is dangerous?&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, I couldn&#x27;t use it without knowing why it isn&#x27;t to be used in kids under 12.  Answer that, and I&#x27;ll be a willing customer to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I got this product in a free review from Bzz agent.  I wanted to like it so I would keep getting new products for free, but, well, I&#x27;m just not that type of gal.  The truth hurts sometimes.</li>
            <li> I received this kit through BzzAgent.  I am not a fan of the two step process and while my mouth does feel &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; it does not feel &amp;#34;minty fresh&amp;#34; after brushing like it does when using my regular toothpaste (Crest Whitening with Scope).  I will also have to say that I have not seen a noticeable improvement in the whiteness of my teeth.  I will continue to use it to see if there is an improved whiteness with more time.</li>
            <li> It is always an exciting day when the BzzAgent box arrives in the mail.  In this box was the new Crest Pro Health HD.  And that is about where the excitement came to an end.  This product claims that it will make your mouth 6x healthier and your teeth 6x whiter in one week (disclaimer applies).  To give this product a fair review, I did use this product for a whole month.  Now I will agree that my mouth felt fresh, and that my teeth looked a felt clean.  However, it also felt like the enamel was being stripped from my teeth.  Now I can&#x27;t say for sure if the enamel is being stripped, but I have successfully lived by going with my gut feeling.  My gut feeling tells me to stop using this product since once your enamel is gone, you can never get it back.  Finally, the whitening process.  I have used other whitening products successfully.  After using this product, I did not see any difference in the white of my teeth.  Personally, I feel that this is a false statement on the product advertisement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Crest is on the right track for a great product, but they still have some work to do.  Until then, use your favorite toothpaste, and try the next Crest product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Could not believe how quickly it whitened my teeth.  Had pleasant taste and made my teeth feel super clean.  I have been using about a month now and there is a noticeable difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  Highly recommend.  I did receive the product as a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive a free trial of this new toothpaste through BzzAgent and I love it!  The routine is bit different because you brush your teeth 2 different times for 1 minute with 2 different toothpastes, but in the end it really doesn&#x27;t take any more time.  (that is if you are brushing your teeth for a full 2 minutes like you&#x27;re supposed to)  This toothpaste is amazing because it not only leaves your mouth feeling very fresh and clean, but it also whitens your teeth really well.  I&#x27;ve used other whitening toothpastes in the past and I&#x27;ve always felt like they might have been preventing my teeth from yellowing more than they were actually whitening my teeth.  This toothpaste really works.  My teeth were noticeably whiter after only using the toothpaste for about 2 weeks.  Also, I have sensitive teeth and had been using a special toothpaste for sensitive teeth, so I was a bit worried about using this because I was concerned that my teeth would become more sensitive, but I&#x27;m happy to say that they didn&#x27;t. The flavor of this toothpaste is good too - I&#x27;m a bit picky about that and I was pleasantly surprised by this one considering the claims.  I guess I expected it to taste bad if was really going to work.  Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my new morning routine and will keep using Crest Pro-Health HD.  I highly recommend this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I got to try this toothpaste through BuzzAgent and I&#x27;m glad I did because I would have never thought that I needed a 2 step cleaning process for healthier teeth. This makes sense because when you go to a dentist, you get cleaned with that scraper tool and then the dentist polishes your teeth with some product. Anyways, the 2 step process feels clinical and it does take a bit more time and effort, but when I do it, I feel a bit like a dentist. Step 1 is the toothpaste part, getting rid of plaque and polishing the teeth. Step 2 is the clinical part, where it&#x27;s whitening the teeth from all the food that you eat. I felt a little less guilty about drinking tea or coffee when I do this step. Step 2 does have a weird smell and I feel like it stings my mouth a bit, but I don&#x27;t think any harm is done. Try this product if your regular toothpaste isn&#x27;t whitening your teeth as you wish or if you don&#x27;t want to buy a separate whitening and harsh product. This feels more seamless and more subtle. I use my regular 1 step toothpaste when I&#x27;m in a hurry and use this one at night when I have a bit more time.</li>
            <li> I received this 2 step whitening toothpaste for free from Crest in return for a review.  I use Crest toothpaste daily, been using Crest since I can remember.  I&#x27;ve never really noticed anything in regards to whitening toothpaste and thought maybe this 2 step process would be different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried for a couple weeks and simply gave up.  The step one feels like your using a buffer on your teeth and the step two feels like bleach is in your mouth.  My concern is that this may not be great for my teeth.  I am 40 yrs old with no cavities (knock on wood) yet this whitening process concerned me that I would damage my teeth enough to get cavities.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong,  I don&#x27;t have any issues with the Crest brand and will still continue to use their toothpaste, but these whitening products simply concern me enough, based on how they feel, that I&#x27;m not comfortable using them.  Plus, after two weeks, I did not notice that my teeth were any whiter than when I started.</li>
            <li> 2 steps to whiter teeth - SIGN ME UP....no need to worry about using strips every again.  This 2 step process is easy and once you get use to it it becomes 2nd nature.  I find the flavor to be minty and refreshing and the most important factor is that it WORKS.  I had my doubts but looking at pics of me and getting compliments I really suggest you go out and try it.  Crest is a solid brand and stands behind their products which should tell you that it does really work.</li>
            <li> When first opening the package of the new Crest Pro Health HD, it may seem like the process will be an overwhelming and daunting task. TWO separate tubes to use each time you brush. How could that actually be better than the conventional toothpastes that I have been using in the past. Upon first using the 2 step pastes, I was thrilled. I loved the flavor and especially knowing that I was doing something proactive to improve the health of my teeth/mouth. All it takes is two minutes of your time to improve upon your mouth health. After a few uses I felt that my mouth was cleaner overall. And after several I did notice that my teeth looked brighter and cleaner, if only a tad. I would recommend this paste for someone that is looking for improving their teeth and also for those that need to improve their mouth health.  The only thing that would make me rate this higher is if it could be combined into one product to use. I was lucky enough to try this paste out for free.. Thanks CREST! But all of the opnions are totally mine!</li>
            <li> : This toothpaste is just awesome. Because it&#x27;s pro health advanced this toothpaste does everything that my teeth need to be healthy and clean. I don&#x27;t need to use any other products because this toothpaste covers everything.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this product as a part of BzzAgent&#x27;s sponsored trials! I can honestly say that really like this toothpaste! After the first time, I immediately noticed a difference in the color and appearance of my teeth. I have been using is faithfully once a day for three weeks not. (I can&#x27;t do it twice a day, it caused me tooth sensitivity!) The toothpaste comes in two tubes (making it a two step process).  The directions say to use tube one for a minute and then tube two for a minute. And even though, stopping in the middle to reapply toothpaste is a bother, I really like the results.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting product.  As a heavy coffee and tea drinker, I often worry about how the drinks stain my teeth.  However, I would never fuss with all the strips, trays, and such.  That is to mush of an interruption of my routine.  The two steps take some getting use to but it’s easy to adapt to the routine.  The most difficult thing to remember after using the product for the past month is to not rinse between steps one and two.  What I have noticed (and more importantly my friends and family) is that that the Crest Pro Health HD whitening system that BzzAgent sent me did make a difference in the brightness and whiteness of my teeth.  In addition, my teeth feel &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34;.  They are slippery like after going to the dentist.  Aside from remembering not to rinse between the two steps, my biggest complaint is the cap of Step 1.  It is a bit flimsy.  Not a big deal, but it bothers me.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Crest Pro-Heath HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste for about a month now.  I like the way this toothpaste makes me mouth feel.  My teeth feel very clean.  My mouth feels alive after using this paste.  I do have to say that I am not crazy about the flavor of the first step of the process.  I would prefer to have a mint taste.  However, I do like the taste of the second step.  If you have ever used white strips it reminds me of that same flavor.  I did not have a chart to check the color of my teeth prior to using the paste.  But I can tell that they are whiter since I started using the new tooth paste.  This is cheaper than white strips too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for free from BzzAgent.  However, al of the opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Tried this new toothpaste through a free sample from BzzAgent. I was skeptical because the 2-step brushing process seemed like a hassle. It turned out to be easy. You brush for 1 minute with step 1, 1 minute with step 2, and then rinse. You are supposed to brush for 2 minutes anyway so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.  I did see whiter teeth- not significantly whiter, but whiter than a typical whitening toothpaste. What I really enjoyed about this toothpaste was how clean my teeth felt. My teeth felt smooth (similar to the feeling you get from a dental cleaning). The taste was not as minty fresh as my normal toothpaste, but wasn&#x27;t bad. None of the ingredients bothered my mouth and I didn&#x27;t have any tooth sensitivity. I would use this toothpaste again.</li>
            <li> I loved the clean that I received when using the Step 1 Purifying Cleanser. Definitely noticed that my teeth were cleaner and felt fresher after the first use.  I did not love Step 2 unfortunately, the flavor of the Perfecting Gel was not pleasing and it was very difficult to finish brushing for the time expected due to that. After several uses I did feel that my mouth was healthier and my breath was fresher but I did not see any significant changes in the whiteness of my teeth after several weeks. I liked the packaging of the product, especially that each tube was colored differently so I knew which to grab first! All in all I will continue to use the product and would probably continue purchasing on my own in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: This product was given to me to sample and review from Crest through being a member of BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most unique products on the market.  Actually its the most unique of all its competitors.  Step one is a simple 1 minute brush to clean your teeth.  You can feel it working the second it hits your teeth.  I actually let it sit for an additional 30 seconds after brushing because I love the self cleaning feeling that is actually intense.  Step 2 is the bonus step that only requires 60 seconds to complete.  In just 2 days of brushing with Crest Pro-Health HD my teeth were noticeably whiter.  I actually received this item as a sample and I am beyond grateful because I will never use anything else. LOVE LOVE LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I found that the toothpaste system is great tasting  but my teeth were not noticeably whiter after use.  However  my breath and mouth indeed felt fresher which made me smile more.  What was really cool is that I  recieved compliments on how  fresh my breath smelled. As my hubby said more kissable now.  I must tell you I did receive this product for free but the opinion I expressed is all my on.  I gave it the 4 stars only because  I really did not notice any whiten of my teeth after a month of use.</li>
            <li> I got to try out the new Crest Pro Health HD free from BzzAgent. Let&#x27;s just say, it feels like you have just gone to the dentist every time you brush. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that it is a two step product, so you have to use 2 tubes. The first step tastes fine, but makes your teeth feel dirty. The second step tastes bad but makes your teeth feel fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am loving the product!</li>
            <li> I love trying new things. I was so exited to get to try this out for free. I got a kit from BzzAgent.  I&#x27;m always looking for an easy way to whiten my teeth. Sure- strips work but they&#x27;re a commitment. You have to remember to put them on... for 30 minutes a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this is fantastic.  I already brush my teeth so there&#x27;s nothing new I need to remember. I just use  this when I would normally brush. I spend a minute with step 1, spit, and another minute with step 2. I really noticed a difference in my teeth in just 2 days even though they guarantee results in 6!</li>
            <li> After trying this product for free from Crest through BzzAgent, I would definitely buy this product again! It was easy to use, delivered the results it promised and lasted for about a month. My teeth were left feeing clean and my mouth fresh. The product did leave a slight tingle sensation after using so if you have sensitive gums or mouth this product may not be for you. The only thing I would change is the instructions don&#x27;t specify how much whitening agent to use for step 2 and it takes up more space in the bathroom to store since there are 2 tubes.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for whitening without the strips!</li>
            <li> I have yet to see outstanding results but okay I guess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people that researches the hell out of things before I buy them.  So of course I came on here and read 400000 reviews of this toothpaste before taking the plunge.  Anyway, I used this 2-step system for almost 2 weeks and I can honestly say I like it.  The system isn&#x27;t that hard and yea you may have to devote a couple of more minutes to your tooth-brushing routine but I find it&#x27;s worth the &amp;#34;trouble.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it whiten teeth?  Yes it does.  I&#x27;m a daily coffee drinker so my teeth aren&#x27;t piano key white but they aren&#x27;t corn yellow either.  I don&#x27;t know how well it would work with someone with deep, dark stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t give this product 5 stars because while step 1 makes your teeth and mouth feel clean as hell it also dries your mouth out.  Simple solution: swish with some Biotene afterwards or deal with the cotton mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a shot.  If you don&#x27;t like it then shitcan it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I got a sample of this free and was a tad skeptical about it. I thought: 1) it&#x27;s going to have ridiculous &amp;#34;rules&amp;#34; like not eating for hours afterward, 2) it&#x27;s going to taste horrible, or 3) it&#x27;s just not going to work. Not the case at all! It&#x27;s so much easier than the annoying strips that take forever and, quite frankly, end up irritating my teeth anyway. Its ridiculously easy: brush with #1, spit, brush with #2, then spit and rinse - DONE! After about 10 days I am actually seeing a difference.</li>
            <li> I  got to try Crest Pro- Health HD Daily for free, this was part of a promotion from the brand.&lt;br /&gt;I must say that this toothpaste is absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;My mouth felt squeaky clean immediately, there was no horrible after taste and most importantly. .it was not harsh on my gums as most products, which contains whitening agents.&lt;br /&gt;The two step system is sooooo easy to follow, and due to no wait time in between, it makes brushing your teeth a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for protection for your teeth, a product that whitens, easy and convenient to use... then without any further hesitation. .. try Crest Pro Health HD today...</li>
            <li> I received this toothpaste for free and I cannot say enough good things about Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste. It is amazing! From the first time I used the new toothpaste, me teeth had never felt cleaner. I also noticed a difference in teeth sensitivity within about a week. I used to have very sensitive teeth and typically used sensitive toothpaste, but this works much better than Sensodyne or any other sensitive toothpaste I have used. When I started using Crest Pro Health HD, my husband was out of town for a week. He came back and asked if I had gotten my teeth whitened. For the record, he doesn&#x27;t even notice when I get a new haircut so I was shocked that he noticed a change in my teeth. He started using the toothpaste and loved it so much that he bought some for when he travels. This will definitely be our family&#x27;s new go-to toothpaste.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought the routine would be hard to stick but I really was impressed by how white my teeth were! After the first use, I noticed just how clean my mouth felt. I didn&#x27;t feel the need to jump to grab a piece of gum straight after my coffee and no more of that &amp;#34;fuzzy&amp;#34; feeling. I also enjoyed the sharp mint taste. My honey is so kissable in the morning and now I&#x27;m not ashamed to go for it because morning breath is a thing of the past. My friends have definitely noticed me smiling more, and even though my teeth were already pretty white, I feel better knowing that the most recent coffee and tea stains have been cleared. Using two pastes at once took getting used to but I definitely think it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to trying this product because I never really liked the whitening strips. I thought a paste that I would normally brush and whitening my teeth was the way to go. I got in this through Bzzagent and once I received the package was hooked on my Crest HD. I noticed a difference in the whiteness after only three days of using the product as directed. Now, that I am at the end of both tubes, I def. notice a dramatic difference. I only wish I had taken a before and after pic of my smile. I highly recommend Crest HD for those of you who do not like using the whitening strips.</li>
            <li> I used Crest Pro Health twice daily for over two weeks as I received a complementary kit to try out. While it did not make my teeth significantly whiter, I was impressed by the overall feel and quality of the product. The whole experience left my mouth feeling like it does after leaving the dentist office. While I did experience some gum discomfort, it was negligible. The two bottle system wasn&#x27;t too cumbersome but I feel the price stands in the way of making this become part of my brushing ritual in the long run.</li>
            <li> I liked the feeling of clean while brushing. I liked the taste, thought the foam got around all of the teeth and think it&#x27;s a really nice improvement. I usually use Colgate, but this is a great toothpaste and makes my mouth feel completely clean and refreshed. I would definitely purchase again and highly recommend this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This product is Uh-Mazing!! And that that might just be an understatement! I received this for free from smiley360 to test out and the results were awesome!! I loved the results so much after a few days I went in search of it and had no luck...until today I spotted a brand new display of this product and snagged one! I am hooked! I have been using crest whitening products for over a year now and crest hd really gets the job done!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now.  I received it free from Crest. I&#x27;m so impressed with the results I have had. From day one you could see a difference.  The two step process is so easy. Two minutes total. My friends have all asked if I got them done professionally.  When I tell them that I have not and I&#x27;m simply using toothpaste they don&#x27;t believe me.  Happy to prove them wrong.  No more strips or trays that take up to an hour.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I use it every morning and night and it leaves my teeth and mouth feeling like its fresh and clean and its really going to improve my mouth hygiene I feel.</li>
            <li> Let me begin with saying that I have been a smoker for over 25 years. This has caused my gums to be very sensitive and my teeth to be very yellow. Since starting to use the Crest Pro Health HD I have noticed a HUGE change in the sensitivity of my gums! Not only that, but I have also eliminated a lot of the yellowing stains caused from smoking and also coffee. Thanks to Crest Pro HD, I am not embarrassed to smile in pictures! I love my new teeth!!!!! Thanks to Crest for letting me try this AMAZING product free, I have regained my confidence! The freshness that I feel after brushing my teeth is like something I have never experienced before. The freshness last for hours, even after my morning espresso. Which by the way, that bitter taste that espresso leaves behind..... GONE!!!! This is by far an amazing product and I would highly recommend it to all my family and friends! Thanks again Crest for letting me try this product for free!!!</li>
            <li> I was kind of put of at first  by the 2 step brushing process of Crest Pro Health HD,  however I got over it quite quickly after using a few times.  It really did not take much extra time and after a week I definitely noticed a difference.  I could see my teeth get a little whiter and I also felt a difference.  my teeth felt cleaner is some ways.  Thanks to Crest for a free trial- or I may have missed out on this great new product!  I like the fact that it is part of my normal brushing routine and I do not have to take the additional time to use the inconvenient, messy strips or other time consuming or costly products.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  It leaves a clean-ness, like I just came from the dentist!  I love the taste, and a good mouth feel.  The only minor complaint is, the second step polishing paste runs out before the first step. I have used Crest Pro-Health [HD] Daily Two-Step Toothpaste for about 30 days now, and I will be buying more Crest [HD].  I think my teeth have whitened a little over the last 30 days, so I&#x27;m keeping it going for the next 6 months, and see how much improvement I see in my smile, and over all mouth healthy.</li>
            <li> I received a full sized sample of the Crest Pro-Health HD two-step system.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks now, and I&#x27;m definitely seeing a difference.  I&#x27;ve never had really stained teeth, and I wouldn&#x27;t call the results dramatic, but I definitely think my teeth look cleaner and whiter than they did when I was just using a regular whitening toothpaste.  The two-step process takes a little getting used to, but all in all, it&#x27;s a lot easier and less messy than whitening systems with trays or strips.</li>
            <li> This product lightened my teeth by a shade or so, after 10 weeks of use. It didn&#x27;t turn them super white which is a good thing. I don&#x27;t want them  glowing in the dark or anything!! I think this combined with a tooth whitening strip would be the best combination for getting a whiter smile, but if you just need a refresher then this toothpaste works well. I didn&#x27;t enjoy the 2 step process, wish it was an all in one, but over all good. * I received this from Bzz Agent for review.</li>
            <li> I received the opportunity to test this product from Bzzagent, and was completely skeptical at first. As a daily coffee and tea drinker, I did not think it was possible for a product to whiten my teeth outside of my dentist&#x27;s office. In less than 2 weeks I became convinced, a believer. This product does just what it says it will do -- whiter teeth and a fresh breath unlike what you experience from regular toothpaste. Will most definitely be purchasing this product again!</li>
            <li> Disclaimer, I received this as part of a free promotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a regular toothpaste, the Crest Prohealth HD works well. It leaves my teeth and mouth feeling very clean. As for whitening, I found it does work (a little), but the whitening effect on my teeth was that great over the 2 weeks I used it regularly. I am a very heavy coffee drinker, so my teeth do yellow and require standard whitening, but although this is MUCH more convenient than things like the Crest White Strips I&#x27;ve used before, I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend it because it didn&#x27;t seem effective. Lastly, who designed the text on the tubes to go in opposite directions. If you put them down on their caps, you can read one tube and not the other. I guess its good for the packaging, but strange after you take it out of the package.</li>
            <li> The Crest Pro Health® HD™ is a good product but not a long term toothpaste for me. I received a free sample from BzzAgent and I&#x27;ve been using it for just over a month. While I like the results I&#x27;ve seen with whitening it&#x27;s just not the toothpaste I could use forever. I&#x27;m a big arm and hammer baking soda fan and love the clean feeling I get with their toothpaste. I will go back to arm and hammer after my sample is gone. I&#x27;d consider using again for the whitening results but it doesn&#x27;t have the strong clean feeling I love. The only other negative is I have a sonicare toothbrush that goes for two and a half minutes so my cleaning time has doubled with two steps. The Crest Pro Health® HD™ only requires a minute per step but that means I have to stop the toothbrush cycle mid way. Overall not a bad product as far as a whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try out and review the Crest Pro-Health HD Two Step product and am extremely glad I was given this opportunity by Crest. First I was slightly worried about using a two step process as I&#x27;ve been brushing my teeth the same way for 30 years, after the first couple of times it has become my only toothpaste, to the point where my wife is now using it also and I&#x27;ve had to another pack! I noticed a brighter smile in about a week, and after two weeks I must say it is at least 2 shades whiter than prior to use. Friends has asked me if I was whitening and I said technically yes, and explained the process, some had seen the commercial on TV and knew what I was talking about. The process is extremely simple, brush using step 1 which is just regular toothpaste I believe, do not rinse and brush using step two which is the whitening product which is a gel. I did notice that after the rinsing with the step two Gel there was a bit of an aftertaste that went away shortly thereafter, not nearly as bad a generic toothpaste. From a price point, this is an fairly expensive product for those of us who have used off the shelf Crest before, it retails for between $12-15, and the tubes are smaller than normal toothpaste and last about half the time, roughly about two weeks as opposed to about a month for a normal size tube. However this is a whitening product and as such being cosmetic I would expect it to be a bit on the higher side, but not as high as Crest&#x27;s competitors pricing. All in all I feel confident that I will continue to use Crest Pro-Health HD, since it does the job and does it really well.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt seriously cleaner than they ever have using the Crest Pro Health HD system! It was a little gritty when rinsing but for a real whitening system I was expecting a lot worse. I didn&#x27;t have any sensitivity which I have had from other whitening systems and I definitely see a noticeable difference! I am going to be purchasing this again before my vacation in a few months to make sure my teeth are as white as they can be! There are only 2 steps so it only takes a minute longer than the usual way of brushing. No waiting around with something in your mouth for hours and no mess! Used it down to the last drop... as you can see from the picture attached!  I got this item free from Bzzagent and am impressed!!</li>
            <li> This Crest Pro-health HD really provide supreior cleansing experience which deserve my purchasing it a long way from China</li>
            <li> Crest sent me a free kit via BzzAgent.com, so I gave this a try. Normally, I don&#x27;t pay this much for toothpaste, so if it wasn&#x27;t going to work for me, I wouldn&#x27;t want to plunk down that kind of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my 3 cups of coffee a day habit, it&#x27;s easy to understand why I would want to use a whitening product. I&#x27;m happy to say, Crest Pro Health HD kept stains away and my dental assistant complimented me on their natural looking brightness. (I have never had movie star white teeth.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Different from other whitening toothpastes, using this product over a month caused NO sensitivity issues with teeth or gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also different from sensitive teeth brand whitening toothpastes, it didn&#x27;t feel chalky or leave my teeth feeling coated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a matter of fact, my FAVORITE aspect of using Crest Pro Health HD is the amazing &amp;#34;fresh from the dentist CLEAN&amp;#34; feeling I get each time I use it. It&#x27;s that slick run-your-tongue-over-your-teeth-and-smile feeling of &amp;#34;Wow! Clean!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That clean feeling even lasts through the night so that never once did I wake up with &amp;#34;morning breath mouth&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as convenience, yes, it is a two step process. But I found myself being very diligent to make sure I was brushing with each product for a full minute. If that&#x27;s what it takes to get me to make sure I get 2 full minutes of brushing in--well--it worked for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be MY oral hygiene product of choice from now on. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it all stars was that I didn&#x27;t experience a major whitening improvement. But, keeping stains away and giving me that clean mouth feeling that befor now, only came from paying for a dental visit twice a year, more than offsets the price.</li>
            <li> I have been concerned about my teeth whiteness for sometime and jumped at the chance to evaluate a product that was supposed to whiten my teeth in 1 week without having to deal with the inconvenience of whitening strips. Even better, I got to evaluate the product for free thanks to Crest.  Another benefit was it was a product from Crest which is a brand I have enjoyed using in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging of the Crest Pro Health HD seemed to be environmentally friendly with green recycled cardboard packaging. However, the packaging did not have a cheap appearance and looked premium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest Pro Health HD consists of two parts. Part one is a cleaner and part two is a whitening gel. You are supposed to brush with part one for 1 minute, spit, and brush with part two for 1 minute. The directions were clearly written and easy to understand the two separate steps. After using the Crest Pro Health, my mouth and teeth feel cleaner and healthier than before. Part of the reason might be because I have been brushing for 2 minutes, which I was not always diligent about doing. However, I feel Crest Pro Health HD had a bigger impact on the clean feeling than additional brushing time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The part that I was dissapointed about was the whitening. I have not noticed a visible difference in my whiteness, even after 4 weeks of usage. I also did not get any comments from others about my teeth whiteness. The other negative was my teeth were sensitive about 2 weeks after using the product. I had the same reaction to teeth whitening strips in the past. The sensitivity went away after about 1 week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also convinced my wife to be a trial subject because she is interested in teeth whitening and dental health. Like me, she did not notice her teeth getting whiter. However, she thought it makes her teeth feel cleaner and less &amp;#34;slimy&amp;#34;. She is very diligent about brushing for 2 minutes, so the Crest Pro Health HD is the reason for a non-slimy mouth. She enjoyed the product and would recommend it for this reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Crest Pro Health HD makes your mouth feel healthier and cleaner, but in our case did not seem to make our teeth whiter. I was hoping for better whitening capabilities, but would recommend using it if you want cleaner, healthier teeth.joyed the product and would recommend it for this reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Crest Pro Health HD makes your mouth feel healthier and cleaner, but in our case did not seem to make our teeth whiter. I was hoping for better whitening capabilities, but would recommend using it if you want cleaner, healthier teeth.</li>
            <li> AMAZING! Upon first use my teeth felt much cleaner, and are now noticeably whiter. Prior to using this toothpaste I hated Crest oral care products because they left a thick white film in my mouth, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this toothpaste whatsoever. I was initially given this kit for free to try this toothpaste out, but loved it so much I ended up buying 4 more kits to have available when I run out. I will never use another toothpaste willingly again! There is no other toothpaste on the market that leaves your teeth feeling sparkly clean every time you brush your teeth like this.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive the CrestProHealth HD two-step system from BuzzAgentto try for free. As soon as I received the product I started using it. I loved how easy the system all you needed to do was just simply brush with each step for two minutes. The one thing I immediately noticed was that my teeth didn&#x27;t have the same clean feeling. With my regular toothpaste my teeth felt smoothly clean but with this system they felt more roughly clean if that makes sense. I continued use and after just one week I could see that my teeth were whiter. After about a week and half I noticed my teeth were getting sensitive to cold drinks and food but my results continued to get better. Overall, I really like that my daily brushing can help provide great results for a healthier and whiter smile. This is definitely be my go to whiting product.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Daily Two-Step Toothpaste has shown great results for me over the past few months. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I feel like my teeth can be very sensitive when I first started using it. I actually had to alternate the toothpaste  with my normal crest toothpaste for the first few weeks. Other than that I have loved it!</li>
            <li> Not the best.. It does a little.. but the white strips work a 1000x&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> This is not your Mother&#x27;s toothpaste(s).  Consumer should know that step one tube involves one minute of brushing and no rinsing.  Step two tube is the same only rinsing is required at the end.  Well worth the effort.  Your teeth feel as if they have been coated with a pleasing smooth coating.  My teeth are also whiter.  Had a check up today and my dentist was very pleased, as I have had gum and plaque issues in the past.</li>
            <li> I work in the dental field and I got this product at the CDA recently as a sample.&lt;br /&gt;First time I tried it and yes my teeth appeared whiter (even my son noticed). I drink coffee daily and I do not like whitening my teeth with harsh chemicals often. I do want to advise using an electric toothbrush since it does breakdown plaque and superficial stains faster and better than a regular toothbrush. I use sonic care if that helps. Taste is not that great, but hey it&#x27;s not food. I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Don&#x27;t forget to floss 😁</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see much whitening , but that&#x27;s okay , I won&#x27;t complain .&lt;br /&gt;But I dislike how you spit step 1 out and CAN NOT rinse but follow with step 2 right away .&lt;br /&gt;when spitting out step 1 it just gives a weird taste that I personally can&#x27;t stand if not rinsing before continuing with step 2 .&lt;br /&gt;but oh wells , guess different people different thoughts . if you don&#x27;t have a problem with that . guess this is okay .&lt;br /&gt;but other than that , I feel extra clean after 2 min , doesn&#x27;t feel like its that clean with other toothpaste .&lt;br /&gt;at $6 for this , -I can&#x27;t complain . :)</li>
            <li> Works great. Been using it for about three days and have noticed a difference already.&lt;br /&gt;It does not taste funny like other people ^ claim - if you have had your teeth professionally whitened or have used other at home kits... It taste just like that. No big deal- it&#x27;s one minute people!!!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Received the Crest Pro-Healthy HD daily two-step as a promo from Crest for free.  It is a set two minutes you need to spend to do it, but after using it for only a couple days my teeth already feel cleaner.  I normally use the Kirkland (Costco) version of Crest Pro-health and brush and floss twice daily so I do have good oral hygiene.  If you have sensitive teeth, I would not likely recommend based off the warnings on the box.</li>
            <li> I love feeling cleen teeth. I got the opportunity to sample the Crest ProHealth HD for free (#GotItFree) and really love it! It gives you that just visited the dentist clean feeling after the first use.  It leaves your teeth whiter, your mouth healthier, and breath minty fresh. It doesn&#x27;t take me any extra time. They say it&#x27;s 2 step but it&#x27;s really just 1.  It&#x27;s simple, easy, and it works.</li>
            <li> Works great and gives you the incentive to brush completely. The taste isn&#x27;t very good but that is ok</li>
            <li> This product HURT my gums and I couldn&#x27;t use it. There is a warning about gum problems -- heed it.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for free thanks to Crest, and I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks. I do notice a difference in my teeth, but the problem is that the second step tastes not great. First, you brush with the white normal toothpaste, then you spit without rinsing and brush again with the gel step. It doesn&#x27;t take that long, but the gel doesn&#x27;t taste good and has an uncomfortable texture. It leaves a bad taste in your mouth afterward, too. Still, I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who isn&#x27;t bothered by the taste of whitening agents (like in strips).</li>
            <li> I got this product to try for free from Crest and I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week now. At first i was skeptical about the two steps because i&#x27;m usually rushing in the morning....it really doesn&#x27;t take up any additional time at all! Now let me get to the results...in such a short time my overall mouth has never been this fresh, nor my teeth as slick....my mouth, even after meals, remain clean until my bedtime brushing. I will definitely be purchasing this product in the future!</li>
            <li> This 2 step toothpaste works! I received the product for free (BzzAgent/Crest HD Sponsored) and was intrigued by the bold &amp;#34;6x whiter in a week&amp;#34; label.  It&#x27;s for real! I noticed after the first time I used it.  Definitely read the fine print.  The box notes that you could have a gum sensitivity or get white spots on your gums.  I got both.  But by day five both had subsided.  The first step leaves my mouth a little dry which I am still getting used to, by the time I finish with step two I feel like I just left the dentist. My family has converted! We have always been Crest users.  Now we are Crest HD users!!!</li>
            <li> Taste was fine.  Application was 2-steps but easy.  It may have been just me, however, I didn&#x27;t notice any change in tooth coloring (e.g. lower stain level, whiteness).</li>
            <li> Overall I think this toothpaste is ok. It did whiten slightly, but it is definitely comparable to other whitening toothpastes that have less hassle. That being said I believe the biggest downfall of this toothpaste is that after a minute I have to turn my brush off, put the next step on and start again. It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s difficult to do of course, more just inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is good, leaves you with fresh breathe that lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price, again I believe there are other toothpastes out there that work better for me, but for ~13.00 maybe this one will work for you and it&#x27;s worth a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note on the image I did use natural light for both shots. Can&#x27;t control how sunny it was though, so brightness may differ :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great has already helped whitening my teeth that were stained.</li>
            <li> Hey I&#x27;m old and I drink coffee ALL DAY and I&#x27;m with the other positive reviewers on this stuff. Crest has knocked it out of the park this time. I tried Vivid and was so-so about it, but this product? I am smiling so much more because my teeth look better than in years. Yes I use whitening toothpaste every day, yes I use a Sonicare.  This is better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and thanks to Crest for letting me try it for free!</li>
            <li> I was able to try Crest pro health HD toothpaste for free thanks to Crest.  I have to say I was very surprised how polished my teeth felt after the second step.  (There are two steps cleaning, then polishing). I am sold, especially since it still only takes two minutes of brushing.  It actually keeps me brushing for the full two minutes (what my dentist recommends no matter which toothpaste I use) clean for 1 min polish for another.</li>
            <li> I think Crest Pro Health HD has made my entire mouth a lot healthier. When I get finished brushing, my teeth and gums feel squeaky clean. The two-part system allows each part to work to its highest potential. The cleansing paste cleans out all the plaque and the second whitening/polishing gel adds the little boost to make all your mouth super-clean and healthy. Because I have sensitive teeth, I was concerned that the peroxide formula could increase sensitivity, but I have not experienced any extra sensitivity from it, which makes it all the better!&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure: I was sent this toothpaste system for free from Crest and BzzAgent and was asked to write a review, which is my own opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> I received a free trial from BzzAgent and am happy they introduced me to this product. I will continue to use it after my trial has expired. The two-step system leaves your mouth feeling remarkably clean and fresh while whitening your teeth. I have sensitive teeth, and I notice no increased sensitivity. The only negatives to this product is the extra time and effort it will add to your morning/evening routine and the fact that the second toothpaste does not have the best flavor. Overall, I am impressed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a BzzAgent and got a full size CrestPro Health HD to try and report on. It states you will have brighter teeth in a week and I found that to be true! It is a two step process, 1 minute of brushing with the purifying cleanser and 1 minute brusing with the perfecting gel. I will say that those with sensitive teeth/gums may nto like using this as the first step is very drying and gave me cotton mouth while the second step is peroxide based and can tingle or sting your gums if you are sensative. Bottom line - it works! But you must pay the premium cost, use both steps twice a day and bear some possible irritation.&lt;br /&gt;A few other comments:&lt;br /&gt;- I wish both tubes were flip top.  Only step 1 is flip top while step 2 is a twist off.&lt;br /&gt;- Can they create a senstive teeth/gums version or would that not be effective in the whitening process?&lt;br /&gt;- Some feel the two step process takes you twice a long to brush and see it as a pain...but I felt it made me accountable for brushing 2 minutes and didn&#x27;t feel bothered by the time commitment, especially when I saw results after the 7 day test - also this was with me still have my 1-2 cups of coffee each morning!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Crest Pro Health HD for several weeks now.  First thing I noticed after using the product is that my teeth felt extremely clean.  I was excited to continue using the product to see the results.  After a few days using the product day and night, I began to notice white spots on my gums.  I discontinued use for several days to see if the product was the cause.  The spots went away after stopping using the product.  I tried again for another week.  This time I didn&#x27;t notice any white spots on my gums, but my teeth were extremely sensitive when eating anything crunchy or chewy.  I totally stopped using the product after this.  Overall, the product seems to do its job by cleaning and whitening the teeth.  Although my teeth only showed minimal whitening before I had to discontinue use.  I imagine every person will be different, maybe this product just wasn&#x27;t right for me.  For anyone looking for a simple system to clean and whiten your teeth, I would recommend this.  Just be aware that you may have unwanted side effects, such as white spots on your gums and sensitive teeth.  Thanks to Crest and BzzAgent for allowing me to try this product for free!</li>
            <li> I received this toothpaste as a free sample thanks to Crest as a participant on Bzzagent.  It is by far the best product I have tested through that program.  The thing I love most about this toothpaste is that it feels like I visited the dentist office for a cleaning.  I have never had a toothpaste clean as well as this.  Plus, after just a week, my four year old daughter is commenting on my teeth being &amp;#34;shiny!&amp;#34;  I thought I could tell they were whiter, but now I know others can too.  The only thing that took a little getting used to is that it dries out your mouth; I have never experienced that before.  But it is definitely worth it in the end.  I don&#x27;t think my mouth has ever been this healthy.  I have a dentist check up at the end of July, and I fully anticipate my hygienist to comment on how much better my mouth and teeth are.</li>
            <li> Received a package of the Crest Pro-Health HD toothpaste for free to try and I was a little skeptical at first.  Would it taste weird?  Too much time?  Forget a step?  But, after using it for a few weeks now, I can honestly say that my skepticism has been set aside.  It&#x27;s not an overly mint-y toothpaste, so don&#x27;t expect that &amp;#34;refreshed&amp;#34; feeling in your mouth, but it does leave them feeling clean.  It&#x27;s that sort of clean that is smooth and polished (like you were just from the dentist).  As for the second step, my teeth have been visibly whiter over the past few weeks.  In the past I&#x27;ve used whitening strips, but could only use them for a week before my teeth became overly sensitive.  With Crest Pro-Health HD, I haven&#x27;t had any sensitivity issues.  This product is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve had success with a whitening toothpaste. I tried this free thanks to Crest, and after 1.5 weeks of use in the morning and night my teeth are noticeably whiter. Today, I wore a bold color of lipstick and for the first time in years I wasn&#x27;t self-conscious about it because it didn&#x27;t make my teeth look yellow. On the contrary, I noticed that the lipstick color looked great with my pearly whites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Did a great job whitening my teeth&lt;br /&gt;- Toothpaste has a nice minty flavor&lt;br /&gt;- Packaging looks nice (not that it really matters, but still)&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t take much more time to whiten when you&#x27;re already brushing vs doing whitening strips or whitening trays&lt;br /&gt;- Did not make my teeth sensitive to cold or hot foods&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- I try to avoid artificial colors, and the toothpaste has Blue 1 in it&lt;br /&gt;- Smaller size than normal toothpaste tube&lt;br /&gt;- Can put tiny white spots on gums temporarily</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro-Health HD from Crest to try for free. It&#x27;s a great product for those of you that are concerned about whitening and does what it claims. Immediately after my first use I noticed that my teeth felt smoother than usual after brushing. Initially I was skeptical about having to use two products just to brush my teeth, but it&#x27;s not complicated to use and doesn&#x27;t take any longer than usual to brush (about 2 minutes).</li>
            <li> I got to try this for free from bzzagent thanks to Crest and I am still liking this toothpaste! The 2 step process really isn&#x27;t a big deal but make sure you brush for 1 minute with step 1 to clean, spit without rinsing, then brush for another minute with step 2 to polish, then rinse. After my first use, I felt like I could actually feel the clean. But I did miss the minty refreshing taste I get from my old toothpaste. If they could add that to the polishing paste it would be perfect! And after a week my teeth did look a little whiter. For a whitening toothpaste I would say this is a good one to get. The only reason I knocked off a star is because I miss the after minty taste.</li>
            <li> I tried this toothpaste free, thanks to Crest, and I loved it! It left my mouth clean and my teeth feeling fresh-from-the-dentist smooth. The whitening power is also much stronger than other &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; toothpastes; I actually saw results! I wouldn&#x27;t say there was a huge change, but anything is miles ahead of the competition. The ONLY downside is that this toothpaste made my sensitive teeth ache after two weeks. Now, I use my sensitive toothpaste in the morning and Crest Pro Health HD at night, and I&#x27;m no longer having sensitivity issues! Love this stuff! I&#x27;ll definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I am giving Crest Pro Health HD 4 stars because I don’t think it whitened my teeth as it should have. However, I still enjoyed using the toothpaste and will probably be buying more. I have tried whitening toothpastes in the past, and they always seem to hurt my teeth. My teeth are really sensitive to cold water, and apparently are sensitive to the whitening component that is in most whitening toothpastes.  I have tried whitening strips in the past, but had to discontinue due to how much it hurt. So, I was a bit worried to try this product. After the first use, I did not experience any irritation at all! I was completely surprised! Now, two weeks later, I feel that I have found my new toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took before and after photos to see if there would be a huge difference in my teeth. Crest Pro Health HD claims that after using their product for a week, your teeth with be substantially whiter; even 6 times whiter. It has been two weeks, and I am not sure that my teeth are whiter, but I do love the clean, fresh feeling I have after every use. It truly does feel like I have left the dentist office. I can lick the top of my teeth, and they have a polished feel to them that I also have when leaving the dentist office. Now, who doesn’t want to have that great, fresh, and clean feeling every time they brush their teeth?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crest Pro Health HD comes with two tubes for a complete 2 step process. In step 1, you are using a purifying cleanser to help strip away any plaque that might exist. In step 2, you are using a perfecting gel, which polishes and whitens your teeth. You are not supposed to rinse in between using the 2 tubes. I loved the taste of the cleanser and tasted somewhat like spearmint, which was so refreshing. The polishing tube has somewhat of a metallic taste, but like I mentioned, my teeth felt super clean afterwards. This clean, fresh taste lasted all day, so I know that it is continually working in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also went in for a dental cleaning about a week after receiving Crest Pro Health HD (perfect timing in receiving Crest Pro Health HD). I must admit that I am really bad at flossing, but my hygienist commented that I had the best gums he’d seen that week. He said I was doing a really great job flossing, and honestly, I don’t floss as much as I should. I truly believe that using Crest Pro Health HD really improved my dental hygiene too (and yes, just after a week!). I think I will be making the switch to Crest Pro Health HD. It can be pricey, running up to $20 a box, however, I have seen it on sale for as low as $12.99. Those will be the times I make sure to stock up on this toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received Crest Pro Health for free from Crest as part of a BzzAgent campaign. Opinions are 100% my own.a dental cleaning about a week after receiving Crest Pro Health HD (perfect timing in receiving Crest Pro Health HD).

            <li> This toothpaste set definitely gets the job done.  I used it for about 3 weeks between getting 2 parts of my mouth deep cleaned.  The first visit was a little brutal and I had to use numbing gel.  By the time I went back to get the other half of my mouth cleaned, the hygienist was really impressed with &amp;#34;how well I&#x27;d been taking care of my teeth.&amp;#34;  Except honestly- the only change I&#x27;d make was switching toothpaste.  Step one does the job it claims to do, and does it so well that professionals take notice.  The reason for only 4 stars is that Step 2 (whitening) is nothing to write home about.  Granted, my teeth are white, but no whiter than they were before using a standard whitening paste.  This is worth the cost due to the effects of step 1 even if the whitening part is average.  I got this for free from Crest, but these opinions are all mine.</li>
            <li> I got to try this product for free as a Bzz Agent. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now. At first I was skeptical.  I&#x27;ve used strips, whitening products, whitening pastes, professional whitening and nothing has really worked for me. I have very sensitive teeth and the preservatives always hurt my teeth. I was concerned about trying this but gave it a try. I&#x27;m so glad I did. No stinging, no burning, nothing hurt me. I saw results in the first three days. I saw a dramatic difference in the first week. I took pictures to compare. I thought that would be the best results. I was wrong. My teeth continued to get whiter and now they look fabulous.  Everyone notices my smile and people ask me if I had my teeth professionally whitened. I told them I use the Crest Pro-Health, much cheaper than professional whitening and for me worked much better with absolute no pain. For me there is no going back. This is a keeper! Thank you Crest for letting me try this product!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even notice any difference in my teeth since I been using it.</li>
            <li> So this may seem weird but I was super excited to receive this toothpaste for free via BzzAgent and Crest. I have been a Crest user my entire life and was looking forward to trying this new product with the added bonus of better mouth health and whiter teeth! The first thing anyone will notice is that the Crest Pro Health HD is actually two tubes, one which has the cleaning paste (which is basically like normal toothpaste) and the other which is a polishing paste. The instructions clearly state that you must brush with the toothpaste for 1 minute, spit but not rinse, then continue brushing for an additional minute with the polish. This is a somewhat strange procedure, I think not necessarily because it is a hardship or bad, but because it&#x27;s not the usual routine. For me, I found it awkward because I use an electric toothbrush which automatically turns on for 2 minutes of brushing so to pause the toothbrush halfway through it&#x27;s interval is a bit weird. It&#x27;s also a bit annoying because I really can&#x27;t be bothered to count out the 1 minute or set a standalone timer/cell phone to time it. However, this is a relatively minor issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product claims to provide whiter teeth in 1 week and to reduce gingivitis (in 3 weeks) and plaque and this is what sets it apart from existing toothpastes and whiteners already on the market. I&#x27;m not sure about the gingivitis as it&#x27;s hard to tell, but I do think my teeth are slightly whiter after using it for 10 days. I think that the biggest advantage of this system is that it&#x27;s fairly affordable compared to whitening strips or professional whitening. It is also painless and doesn&#x27;t require sitting around with strips for 20 minutes awkwardly waiting for the whitening reaction to take place. I personally did not have a problem with the taste or texture of either step 1 or step 2. In fact, I found step 1 to be reminiscent of the kids Crest gel toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one tip I would give is that because you are only brushing with each step for a minute, you really have to make a conscious effort to reach all surfaces of your teeth in both steps. I found after a few days that my top teeth were noticeably whiter than my bottom row but was able to correct this with more focuses brushing. Overall, I would say that this product is an innovative whitening alternative but that it may be too much of a hassle for some people. I would recommend it to people who wanted a multi-purpose, affordable way to whiten their teeth while at the same time having more effective cleaning.th each step for a minute, you really have to make a conscious effort to reach all surfaces of your teeth in both steps.

            <li> Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste System has step 1 for cleaning and step 2 for whitening. Using this toothpaste daily leaves a very fresh taste in the mouth. Some days it does feel like its stinging. But the freshening aftertaste is worth the momentary inconvenience. The teeth do get whiter. Especially if you have certain teeth that dont behave and will get worse when you cant visit the dentist for any reason, Crest Pro-Health will keep it under control. Impressed with Crest pro-Health I shifted my toddlers toothpaste to Crest bubblegum flavour.&lt;br /&gt;I hold the maker P&amp;G in good esteem, so I had to try this product. I am satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;complimentary product from Bzzagent</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro-Health HD toothpaste to try and review from Buzzfeed. I LOVE this toothpaste! I would normally be turned off by the two step process, but the results are totally worth it! As a coffee drinker my teeth looked kind of dingy. After using this toothpaste for about two weeks my teeth are so white and feel like I&#x27;ve just come from the dentist!</li>
            <li> I have never been one to believe in product hype. I got this to try free thanks to Crest. With Crest Pro Health HD I was happily surprised and shocked by my result. I have tried just about every &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; toothpaste and this puts them all to shame. After one week my teeth were noticeably whiter and brighter. After going two weeks... Wow! My teeth are whiter then they have been in years. This two part product is well worth the two part process. Just had to get used ti figuring out the exact middle on the Sonicare two minute toothbrush cycle. I am so happy I tried this. Now I just need to convince my wife to allow me to spend the extra to continue using it!</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity thanks to Crest to try this product for free.  I went in quite skeptical that a product could really improve the whiteness of my teeth by 6x.  However, after my first week I began to tell a noticeable difference.  In addition to me telling a difference my co-wokers, wife, &amp; friends began to comment on how white my teeth appeared.  To the point that a few of my friends &amp; my wife have purchased this product and are using it.  I would recommend this to anyone looking to whiten their teeth.</li>
            <li> I got the opportunity to try this product out for free and let me tell you I don&#x27;t regret trying this one out!  It has been a month to date and I do notice a whiter smile, even my mom noticed and asked if I had been whitening my teeth.  I am an avid coffee drinker so I am glad to get rid of that yellow tint.  My only gripe is that it is a two step regimen.  I wish I was just one.  I have to literally take my phone to time myself, two minutes total, to make sure I do one minute for each step.  I like that step one feels grainy so it really feels like I&#x27;m cleaning my teeth.  I would definitely buy this again! :)</li>
            <li> Got to try the Crest Pro Health HD for free thanks to Crest. I will say I&#x27;m a bit skeptical about tooth whitening systems inside of toothpaste, because it doesn&#x27;t seem like the bleach will be on your teeth long enough. This system is fun though, even my wife is trying it.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in two steps. The cleaning step, which is a minty fresh tooth paste that cleans your teeth, and then you brush again with the whitening gel. After using for a couple of weeks, I think my teeth are a bit whiter, and the paste itself has a good flavor.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to get your teeth really white you will probably need to do gel strips or see a dentist, but this is a good system if you want to just do it while brushing.</li>
            <li> I was chosen to try Crest ProHealthHD  for free as a campaign for Bzz Agent.  I received a full size kit in the mail a few weeks ago and immediately began using the products.  It, of course, is very straight forward.  Use tube 1 for one minute.  Then you can spit, but not rinse, and move on to tube 2, which you use for one minute as well.  The consistency of the first tube is more like regular toothpaste.  That almost gritty feeling that makes you feel like you are really giving your teeth a good scrubbing.  The second tube is more of the polishing finisher; kind of adds that last minute touch of white and clean!!&lt;br /&gt;When I first began using the products I did experience some sensitivity to my gums.  They were a bit sore and red, but nothing of concern.  After about two days and tenderness disappeared completely.  I am very impressed with this product.  I have definitely seen visible results in terms of my teeth looking whiter.  When I am done brushing my teeth and my whole mouth overall feel incredibly clean.&lt;br /&gt;I am a pretty faithful Crest consumer.  I am very fond of their toothpastes and this one is no different.  It does what it says it will do and at a very reasonable cost.  I saw this kit in the store the other day for less than $13.  For the size of the tubes you are getting and for the job that this set does, you are definitely getting more than your money&#x27;s worth with this product.  This is definitely a product I would recommend to anyone and definitely a product I will be using again in the future!</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try a free sample of Crest Pro Health® HD™, courtesy of Crest.  It did what it said: my teeth were whitened by following the directions.  They looked pretty good and the whole experience was much easier than wearing whitening strips or going to the dentist.  That said, it made my morning routine more complicated.  I&#x27;m a sleepy person in the morning and for years, I&#x27;ve been letting my electric toothbrush&#x27;s automatic two-minute timer tell me when I should be done brushing.  This product puts a kink in that.  I had to remember after a minute to switch gels halfway and sometimes forgot to do so.  Overall, it will be just fine, but I learned it wasn&#x27;t for me since I&#x27;d prefer to keep my brushing routine the same.</li>
            <li> This is a review for Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste. I was given a free sample to do this. After several weeks use, I can say it does leave you with a clean mouth feeling, but as for the whitening effect, it falls short.  My teeth did not show any significant change in color, and for a product that is not exactly inexpensive as compared to other toothpastes that claim also to whiten teeth, HD did not deliver to me. Others have said, and there is a warning on the product, that they have gotten stains on teeth because of this toothpaste, but thankfully that was not my case. So, purely reviewing this product on it&#x27;s principal claim of whitening teeth,I have to give it a 1 star  rating.</li>
            <li> I got this product free through BzzAgent.  I tried it for a month and I noticed that my teeth felt clean and wonderful after each use.  It is a bit weird to have two separate products to use while brushing my teething, but that is the nature of this product.  Another issue that I had when using this was the instructions that tell you not to rinse after the first product is used.  I am so used to rinsing my mouth out each time that it took a bit to get used to.  Overall, this product left my mouth feeling clean and my teeth feeling ultra polished and clean!</li>
            <li> &#x27;#&#x27;BzzAgent&#x27; &#x27;#&#x27;free&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Got a free Crest Pro Health kit to test out about a month ago. Started to try this out just as instructed twice a day and it seems to whiten teeth within 2 weeks of use. Unfortunately it makes your mouth feel dry. I would not recommend this product after using as it irritated my poor tongue and took a layer off on one side &amp; caused canker sores until i stopped using it. It may whiten but at the cost of the rest of your mouth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want white teeth you can give this a try at Target, Walgreens or Walmart but at your own risk!</li>
            <li> MY TEETH HAVE NEVER FELT THIS CLEAN AND SPARKLING! EASY TO USE!  STEP 1 HAS A ( GOING TO THE DENTIST FOR A CLEANING FEEL). IT ALSO HAS A GREAT INGREDIENT, FLUORIDE. STEP 2  HAS PEROXIDE WHICH IS GREAT TO WHITEN AND CLEAN. THIS IS MUCH BETTER THAN DEALING WITH WHITENING STRIPS.</li>
            <li> Received a free trial of Crest ProHealth HD and I was initially skeptical of the 2 step system. I did read the directions and since each step is only 1 minute it&#x27;s really not longer than my typical toothbrushing routine. First step reminded me of my regular toothpaste,  with a nice foam and clean fresh taste and feel. (I am definitely a fan of Crest.) Then came the second step, it&#x27;s a smooth gel that polishes the teeth, it also has a nice taste. After my first use I noticed a difference in the clean feel of my teeth, they felt so smooth! After about 5 days I could tell my teeth were whiter, my husband could too!&lt;br /&gt;I am a huge fan of this product, great toothpaste with whitening that is comparable to using strips, but so much easier.  Got my husband hooked too!</li>
            <li> This is a good alternative to those whitening strips!  The strips cause some serious sensitivity pain and this new 2 step program does not.  It is kind of a pain to brush two times, but I have truly noticed a difference in the way that my teeth look.  They look whiter and feel healthier thanks to Crest&#x27;s new 2 step system. I am trying it free thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li> I trust Crest Products, I received a package of Crest Pro Health® HD™ Daily Two-Step Toothpaste to try for FREE from Crest and BzzAgent.com.  I love trying new products and white teeth are important to me and my family.  I use Crest White Strips every six months.  It was time to brighten my smile so the Crest Pro Health® HD™ Toothpaste came just in time.  I use an &amp;#34;electric&amp;#34; toothbrush (Cybersonic), it has a built in timer.  I used Crest Pro Health® HD™ toothpaste for 2 minutes 2x a day as instructed and I have to say I did not really notice much difference.  My wife (who has naturally white teeth), tried it and she thought her teeth were looking dingey colored, she looked up the ingredients and recognized it was the stannous fluoride.  She stopped using it right away, and scheduled her dental cleaning for next week.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.drugs.com/cdi/stannous-fluoride-rinse.html</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to be selected by Crest to try the new Cresh Pro-Health Daily Two Step Toothpaste Process.  In my opion, Crest Pro-Health HD is a revolutionary product.  I have tried whitening toothpastes, whitening strips, whitening gels, and just about every over-the-counter whitener on the market and none have ever worked as well as Crest Pro-Health HD.  After using Crest HD for just a couple of days, I noticed my mouth felt very fresh and clean, cleaner than just brushing with regular toothpaste.  I wasn’t sure if my teeth actually looked whiter until I went to the dentist about a week in to using Crest HD and my hygienist asked what I was doing differently because my teeth looked whiter.  At this point I knew I finally found a whitening product that actually works.  Crest Pro-Health HD is a 2 step process first you brush with a mint flavored paste and then brush again with a gel that polishes the teeth. It is a very easy process and the product tastes great and leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean, almost as clean as after a visit to the dentist.  I plan on replacing my regular daily tooth paste with Crest Pro-Health HD, it’s a quick and easy process and whitens and brightens my smile and makes my mouth feel fresh and clean.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I tried this product as part of a bzzagent campaign to see how it works. I have to say that it&#x27;s difficult for me to see a difference in the whiteness of my teeth because they&#x27;re pretty white to begin with. My feeling was that the combo treatment wasn&#x27;t as good as using Crest&#x27;s 3D Polishing Treatment with Brilliance Boost. The Polishing treatment is more satisfyingly gritty compared to the HD Perfecting Gel that is paired with this Purifying Cleanser.</li>
            <li> I got a sample from Crest of Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two Step Toothpaste.  This product is great! At first I thought the two step-process was going to be hard get used to, but after a few days, it was very easy.  It just took a little getting used to.  I feel like like I&#x27;m actually brushing more carefully since I have to use the two different products.  I really like how clean my teeth feel after I brush - almost like the feeling you get when you leave the dentist&#x27;s office and your teeth are super-smooth.  The taste of the Crest Pro Health HD is not quite a minty as some I&#x27;ve tried, but It seems like the fresh taste lasts longer and my mouth feels really good.  It totally knocks out that morning coffee-breath and leaves my teeth and mouth ready for the day.  I really love this toothpaste!!</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product free thanks to Crest and BzzAgent. While I didn&#x27;t think my teeth got much whiter, I really liked the toothpaste portion of the product. It had a nice minty flavor that wasn&#x27;t too strong, and it left my mouth feeling super clean! Also, I felt like this product worked as well as strips, but was WAY easier to use, and took much less time (and less mess!)</li>
            <li> I really like this system far better than the yucky whitening strips.  This system only takes 2 minutes and the results are the same!  I see a much whiter and brighter smile in my mirror in just days.</li>
            <li> I got to try this free as a promotional sample review from Crest but opinions are all my own. I was skeptical because it&#x27;s hard to find a teeth whitening product that actually works without uncomfortable side effects like sensitivity or bad taste. This program is easy and simple and actually works. I love that it doesnt take up any more time during my toothbrushing routine. Definitely give it a try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Crest Pro Health HD for a month now &amp; I can&#x27;t believe how much it has helped whiten my teeth! It&#x27;s easy to use &amp;  altho I was a bit skeptical about this product being able to produce the results promised, I did notice a difference in the brightness of my smile. Instead of having to deal with bleaching trays or strips that have to stay on a long time, you just take just a couple of minutes to brush with Step 1 and then just a couple of minutes to brush with Step 2. I highly recommend the product. And, it is designed to help reduce gingivitis &amp; cavities. Easy peasy! So grateful to Crest for letting me try this product for free. I definitely am a customer now for life!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying Crest Pro Health HD Toothpaste for about a month now. At first I thought the two step process was going to take a lot longer than my ordinary toothpaste routine. It takes just two minutes just like my routine which is great because I&#x27;m usually on the go most mornings and tired at night. After the first couple of uses my teeth really started to feel cleaner and look whiter. I had that just from the dentist feeling. My teeth felt clean and polished. The first step uses Stannous Fluoride to clean away plaque you use for 1 minute. Then without rinsing you use step 2 for next minute the perfecting gel that whitens teeth then rinse.  My breath is pretty fresh after every use too. Some surface stains were less noticeable which is nice surprise. The Crest packaging say a 6x healthier mouth and 6x whiter teeth in one week vs ordinary toothpaste. My mouth does feel cleaner and my teeth look whiter so no complaints here. The only problem I encountered is the step one tube does not shut properly sometimes so the paste leaks out and it can be a mess. Otherwise I really like using Crest Pro Health HD Toothpaste. I receive this product free from Crest for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> If you have tooth sensitivity this toothpaste is not for you. I was given this product to try for free from Crest and I really liked it at first. It made my teeth feel very clean and the clean feeling lasted a very long time. The whitening step was also very effective and I liked the results that I saw. However after 2 weeks of using this paste just once a day and using my sensitivity toothpaste once a day I found my sensitivity to cold had increased substantially. The sensitivity had become completely unbearable and I had to discontinue its use. It took another 2 weeks of use of my sensitivity toothpaste to get it down to a tolerable level again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this toothpaste for all those fortunate enough not to have sensitivity issues as it made my teeth very clean, healthy and white. If you are among the unfortunate to have sensitive teeth then I would recommend skipping this product and instead sticking with a sensitivity toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I received this kit free from BzzAgent, so thank you Crest and BzzAgent for the opportunity to try this new product.  At first I was skeptical - will this be better than all of the other whitening toothpastes out there, and will my mouth really feel much cleaner?  After just a few days of using this product, I found that yes, this kit whitens as good as about 2-3 whitestrips, and yes, my mouth felt much cleaner.  Some people might be annoyed by how the first paste makes your mouth feel really dry, and then you have to use the 2nd product (a gel), but I did not find it bothersome.  I had no sensitivity during or after use, and the product should last for more than one month, so it is a good deal if you want better than average whitening, and you want to keep your gums healthy.  I&#x27;ve attached a photo of my teeth after using this product for about one month.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product free from crest on bzzagent!  I was a little hesitant of the 2-step process but after the first use I wasn&#x27;t bothered.  My teeth felt so smooth and polished.  I was curious how long that would last and was pleasantly surprised that coffee (even a iced beverage or frappuchino) didn&#x27;t affect how my teeth felt!!  SCORE!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth love this and I haven&#x27;t had any sensitivity issues either.  It&#x27;s amazing how clean my teeth feel after a night of falling asleep and not brushing.... It&#x27;s good to wake up to a pleasant mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I really loved the toothpaste and I&#x27;m still using it!!!</li>
            <li> This two step whitening system that I got for testing purposes through BzzAgent and Crest has worked great! My smile is whiter and my teeth feel so clean after brushing, which I noticed after the first time. The taste is a little weird, and it doesn&#x27;t foam up as much as normal tooth pastes do, which is something to get used to. However, my teeth have never looked whiter!</li>
            <li> I really liked using this.  I was able to snag this as a free sample thank to Crest, and I am glad I did.  I used it religiously for weeks, and I definitely noticed a difference in the color of my teeth and the freshness of my breath.  The only reason (and it&#x27;s a small reason) I would not give this 5 stars is that I can see some people having an issue with having to use 2 different tubes to get the job done.  It only bothered me if I happen to be in a rush, but otherwise, the product is GREAT!</li>
            <li> I got this as a test kit from Crest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My views are real though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this around a month ago replacing my Colgate enamel health toothpaste. You can feel the difference. the two step thingy is a little bothersome because I would sometimes rinse after step 1 (no you cant do that). However once you get the hang of it, the mouth does feel a lot cleaner and you can see the whiteness in the teeth week over week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I will just switch to these, the price tag&#x27;s a little bit of a deterrent though.</li>
            <li> 2 minutes to a healthy, white smile. I admit at first I thought 2 minutes was a lot, but after the first brushing, I could feel a difference, and after 3 weeks, I can see a difference in the whiteness of my teeth! I am so glad Bzzagent chose me to  try it free thanks to Crest. The initial taste may seem strong, it did to me, but after a couple brushings, it was no longer noticeable. This is an investment in your oral health, reduced morning breath, plaque and gingivitis reduction. This 2 step process is the best new toothpaste I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I tried out the Crest Pro-Health HD toothpaste free by being a Bzz Agent.  The first paste in the set didnt really provide the minty clean feeling that I expect from a toothpaste, and the second paste that you use is more like the peroxide toothpastes on the market, and left a bad aftertaste.  I didnt really like this toothpaste and will be going back to my regular Crest Pro Health toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get my free sample from Crest of the Crest Pro Health® HD™.  I am definitely one to care for my teeth.  I use an Oral-B electric toothbrush everyday and go to the dentist every 6 months.  I drink coffee and tea, eat red meat and enjoy saucy foods, so stained teeth has always been an issue for me.  I’ve used Crest before, but never tried a whitening solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, let’s discuss the toothpaste itself.  It tastes nice, feels nice, and I absolutely feel like my teeth are cleaned.  I get that happy tingling that occurs after you come out the dentist’s office.  Based on my experience with just the toothpaste, I am definitely more likely to purchase a Crest toothpaste product in the future.  It almost makes the teeth brushing experience pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the whitening part of this kit I found to be totally ineffective. After 45 days of using the whitening product my teeth actually look less white.  I used the product as directed.  I did not change my diet or my brushing frequency in any way whatsoever.  The whitening product was just a complete waste of time. I am glad that I got this product for free because I would have otherwise been annoyed at the waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing that is just plain stupid are the containers.  The toothpaste is in a great flip top container that is very simple to use, even when already holding your toothbrush.  Flip top, use, close top.  Now the whitening toothpaste has a screw-off cover that is not connected like the toothpaste.  So you need to unscrew, remove, place someplace, use the product, pick it up, and screw it back on.  How the heck did these two very different containers get past the testers and into the market?  This annoyed me from the very first moment I used the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I do not recommend Crest Pro Health® HD™. The whitening did not work and it’s packaging is very annoying.  Save your money with just the toothpaste, and ask your dentist for the best way to whiten your teeth if you really desire that.  I do, however, absolutely recommend the Crest Pro Health® toothpaste only as a stand alone product.  I really like the feeling the toothpaste leaves.best way to whiten your teeth if you really desire that.

            <li> After receiving a set of Crest ProHealth HD for free trial (from Crest and BzzAgent), all three members of my family tried it out.  I will admit to being a bit of a skeptic about whitening toothpastes, but this product has made me a believer.  Regular Crest ProHealth has been a staple in my household for years, upon the suggestion of our dentist, and now Crest ProHealth HD has earned a regular spot in our cabinet.  The product is reasonably priced, but more important it works beautifully.  My husband had a good bit of tartar build up on his teeth, and improvement was obvious after only the third or fourth day of using the product.  Now that build up is all but erased, and his smile looks great and white!  My teenaged daughter and myself love it, too.  Great product.  I&#x27;d highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Although this toothpaste is two steps, it will save time with brushing and whitening in one.  I was skeptical about having to use two tubes for one brushing session. I then realized after a few uses that you get used to using both tubes. I also realized this 2 step toothpaste takes away the need for separate whitening products therefore saving time in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth felt very clean after this 2 step process. I really enjoyed how sparkly they looked after a few uses too. I noticed some whitening after a week of use. Overall it was easy to use, it saves whitening time and it is reasonably priced. It&#x27;s worth a try! I&#x27;m trying it free thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this product.  The flavor is not overpowering, yet my mouth feels clean all day. I have a dental checkup soon, and am anxious to see if plaque has been reduced.</li>
            <li> After using Crest PH HD, my teeth felt very clean, almost like having a professional cleaning. The product is easy to use - it&#x27;s just like brushing your teeth twice. Step 1 was very much like regular tooth paste. Step 2 is added to the brush after Step 1. It takes a little extra time, but it&#x27;s totally worth it. The super clean feeling lasts all day too.</li>
            <li> I got to try this fantastic new product through bzzagent and I&#x27;m so happy I did. The entire process only takes 2 minutes. 1 minute for the first step and 1 minute for the second step. You are suppose to do conventional brushing for 2 minutes anyway. My teeth have never felt or looked better. My teeth look a little whighter also. I highly recommend trying.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product that gives you a clean like never before.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get my BzzAgent Crest Pro Health® HD™ kit in the mail, but a bit leery as well. I am a great person to test products as I am truthful and hard to impress. If a product is only so-so, I will say so honestly and pass that info onto friends &amp; family. Could all the hype I’d read about this Crest product really be true ??  So call me doubtful as I began my test with this product. The packaging at 1st glance looked like it was going to be difficult to open, but then I spied an arrow in the upper left corner. It easily peeled back ! Score a big plus for that feature right away and the package did not deform or rip apart so you can store the tubes back in the original case if you choose. The front of the package said I’d experience a healthier mouth; reducing gingivitis 6 times more than regular toothpaste and much whiter teeth; 6 times more than ordinary toothpaste. Really ?? You get 2 tubes of product. You brush with the 1st tube for 1 minute which is a purifying cleanser using stannous fluoride that strips away plaque. Then you brush with the 2nd tube for 1 minute which is a perfecting gel that polishes &amp; whitens. This routine seemed easy enough since I already use 2 minutes of brushing as my standard. The directions on the reverse of the package were very easy to follow and so simple. I was glad I carefully read them before using the product as you don&#x27;t rinse between using the tubes. I studied my teeth in the mirror before my first use to get a good image in my mind of their appearance and honestly, they were dingy. I wanted to see if I&#x27;d notice ANY difference after just 1 use. So I brushed with the products and followed the directions and ---- WOW !! I looked in the mirror after I finished and I could definitely see a big difference already! This was super exciting since I assume with continued use I can expect even greater results. But truthfully, I&#x27;d be happy if my teeth just always look and feel this wonderful! I say &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; wonderful because I remember the 1st time I used my electric toothbrush and my teeth felt like silk - so polished and clean -- I felt like I&#x27;d just had a professional dental cleaning. Well, the Crest Pro-Health HD toothpaste &amp; whitening gel combo gave me that exact feeling too. My teeth felt and looked really smooth, clean and tartar free. I am switching to this product !!  I can&#x27;t wait to see if at my next dental cleaning, they also notice a big difference. Thank you -- BzzAgent &amp; CREST for bringing this wonderful product to me. I can&#x27;t wait to tell all my family &amp; friends &amp; co-workers about this.ause I remember the 1st time I used my electric toothbrush and my teeth felt like silk - so polished and clean -- I felt like I&#x27;d just had a professional dental cleaning.

            <li> I got this Crest Pro-Health HD 2-step toothpaste to try from BzzAgent and it&#x27;s actually pretty fantastic!  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of days, but my teeth feel like I&#x27;ve just been to the dentist after I use it and they are already looking whiter! :)</li>
            <li> The product comes in two bottles (a purifying cleanser and a perfecting gel). You use the cleanser and brush your teeth for one minute  and spit when the time is done (dont rinse) and then use the perfecting gel and brush your teeth for one more minute. The next step is simply to spit and rinse! thats it- very simple. Brush, spit, brush rinse! two minutes and done!&lt;br /&gt;I could see a difference after only a few days. Normally, whenever using a type of &amp;#34;whitening product&amp;#34; my teeth and gums get very sensitive and bother me, not this time!!! I can see a difference, i do not see any plaque building up- and it feels like i just visited the dentist!. But i have noticed, in just a few days, that any plaque i might have seen before is no where to be found! my mouth looks healthier. I feel that the product is not as &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; or strong compared to other brands, but i still get that &amp;#34;just cleaned&amp;#34; feeling everytime i use it. i could visably notice that my mouth was healthier! i like this product and would highly recommend it. i got this product as a free sample, thanks to Crest , and now i am going to make this part of my normal routine!</li>
            <li> Crest sent me this two step kit about a week ago. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past few days and it&#x27;s great!  The two step process is a bit cumbersome and odd but it seems to be working.  The first step is a fresh tasting white paste that foams up a bit.  You spit and then start step two. A clear gel like stuff the reduces the foam and feels smoother. Within two days my teeth are already looking whiter and I love the way they feel after I use this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been brushing every day with this product, and after only a week I can tell the difference.  I only ever see my teeth this white after the dentist cleans them, and really, not even then.  The process is time consuming, and if you at best devote 30 seconds to dental hygiene in the morning, you will have to go thru the process before you go to sleep. You spend a minute brushing with step one (the toothpaste, which tastes like bubblegum), and then a minute brushing with the polish. You can feel the hydrogen peroxide working.  I floss between the two steps, so the whole hygiene routine will take about 5 minutes. I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  I don&#x27;t smoke or drink coffee, so I only have some tea stains to contend with, but this product removes them.</li>
            <li> I always taken the best care possible for my mouth. So I thought. Now I am. I got the new Crest Pro Health HD daily two-step system free from Bzzagent as a part of a promotion from the brand. I know two-step with two tubes of toothpaste might sound little complicated, but it is as easy as regular one toothpaste brushing.  A Purifying Cleanser and Perfecting Gel system gave me unbelievable results. Step 1 strips plaque away, and Step 2 polishes and whitens for an amazing experience. I am heavy tea and coffee drinker, so I really needed good whitening product. I could not forget the fact, my teeth are very sensitive. Not anymore. I even stopped using sensodyne, which was my go to toothpaste, whenever I ate ice-cream or  drink something hot. My teeth got second chance to be strong and shine again. Try it today!</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health HD is a an easy 2-step program that promised results. I was not disappointed and in fact, was pleasantly surprised at how quickly I noticed a brighter and whiter smile. It is a simple, convenient process and I literally exclaimed &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; after the first use of this system. Why? My mouth felt so fresh and my teeth had that just-visited the dentist clean feeling. After using this for a week, the coffee stains that I noticed prior were much less noticeable and I continued to notice whitening. My favorite part of this product....there was zero tooth sensitivity noticed which had been a huge concern of mine with any whitening product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste System promises a cleaner and healthier mouth.  And other reviewers have said that it left their mouths feeling dentist visit fresh and clean.  But I have to honest, I&#x27;m not feeling the love.  And my husband is also mystified as to where these accolades are from.  Brushing with the first tube is pleasant enough.  But tube two combines an unpalatable taste with burning sensations.  And after two weeks of this, we discovered that our teeth were no better than if we just brushed with regular Crest Whitening.  So the product wasn&#x27;t for us.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to be selected to try this kit from BzzAgent as it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d otherwise have probably given a second look at.  However, I&#x27;m quite pleased with the toothpaste part so far.  It&#x27;s slightly abrasive, not overly strong flavored and cleans well.  Still on the fence as to the whitening gel part.  I, personally, can&#x27;t use the amount of whitening gel they show in the directions.  That much burned by tongue and gums.  I use a small dot and that is better.  I&#x27;m not sure how effective it is since it&#x27;s only on your teeth for a minute, then you rinse it off.  I&#x27;ll write a follow up review when I&#x27;m longer into using it.  But so far, at least the toothpaste is awesome!!</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try this product for free thanks to Crest and through my role as a BzzAgent, and boy, am I glad I did! I am a busy mom of three, and sometimes it feels like I have to fight for five minutes to myself, even to do something as simple as brushing my teeth. So I was skeptical at first about the practicality of me sticking to a new brushing routine that included 2 steps. However, after using Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste for about one week now, I can say that it does not add any time to my routine and has been an easy switch to make. With that potential con eliminated from the picture, I can only say positive things about this toothpaste! It gives my mouth an unbelievably fresh and clean feeling that really lasts. It does indeed whiten and brighten my smile, yet it does not feel abrasive and leaves me with a fresh-from-the-dentist feeling every time I brush. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth! Thank you, Crest, for the chance to try this product - I am a believer!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the claims of this product but tried it out as I received it through a brand promotion. And after a few days have not found any value. I use an electric toothbrush the extra step does not fit in with the calculated time per quadrant and you need to do on and a half brushing cycles. Brushing my teeth as I am running out the door is always an annoyance but I use the electric toothbrush to ensure I do a thorough job each time. Adding an additional step to my already hurried morning is simply a pain. I also am not a fan of the sticky texture of the first step (like the flouride treatment you get at the dentist, or the taste of the second step).</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about a week now after I received a free sample from the BzzAgent Crest Campaign.  I&#x27;m used to brushing my teeth for the complete 2 minutes (I have an electric toothbrush) so the process is a little longer than I am used to.  I am not getting the same amount of toothpaste bushing that I was getting when I was just brushing with Crest ProHealth.  Besides, my teeth are not much whiter than they were when I started the process.</li>
            <li> I am soooo happy I was able to try this system! I have tried other whiteners before and this is by far the best! THe first day my teeth felt squeeky clean, the same clean you feel after leaving the dentist office. Even the sound of my toothbrush on my teeth made that squeeky sound that you hear when your teeth are getting polished. I am more than impressed and just after  a few days my teeth have started to whiten! I am a coffee drinker and a past smoker and my teeth definitely needed this! Thank you! I would definitely recommend to friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I got the crust HD from bzzagent.com to try and this is is what I feel about the product. I tried it and from the first brushing itself I knew that product works well. Step one is supposed to strip away plaque and that&#x27;s exactly what I felt it did. Step 2 is for whitening and while I feel that I&#x27;m still not seeing bright teeth, it is definitely whiter than what I had. overall I&#x27;m satisfied with the product however one drawback was the feeling in your mouth after. It&#x27;s usually a fresh minty taste after you brush your teeth but with this toothpaste it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s more of a dry mouth feeling. I would recommended because it does remove plaque and leaves your teeth whiter than before but if you are looking for something that will leave your mouth fresh then this is not the toothpaste for you. Also, having a second step to my daily routine really wasn&#x27;t as bad I thought it would be, it took about the same amount of time as if I was brushing with one step alone.</li>
            <li> I went into this positive for most whiteners in my opinion do not work well. To my surprise this product was excellent. Crest Pro-Health was fresh tasting and even being two steps was not time consuming. My teeth are so much brighter and whiter since using Crest Pro-Heath and getting compliments. My husband as well as several of my friends are now using Crest Pro-Health after seeing my positive results. &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Visible difference!  Called my brother and said get this and he ordered some as well.  Been using Crest for most of my life...this is another step-up in their products.  A must have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple days and I&#x27;m impressed at how clean my teeth feel compared to using my regular toothpast. But this two step system has not only made my teeth sensitive but my gums are also sore. I&#x27;m going to give it one more day before I quit using it.</li>
            <li> I received this free to try out and I am on the fence as to whether i like it or not. The idea behind it is great and I think I have even seen some results. BUT the texture of these two gels really dries out my mouth and I don&#x27;t like the after taste it leaves behind. I will continue to use up the product I have but probably will not re-purchase.</li>
            <li> I was pretty impressed by the whitening capability of this toothpaste. It was.  Simple process and made my teeth feel really clean. The flavor wasn&#x27;t the best and left my mouth feeling kinda dry, but it was effective at whitening without causing tooth discomfort. Received free for review from bzzagent.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste tastes really nasty. It has like a medicine like flavor quality. Maybe like a disgusting cough syrup, but worse and it has a strange side effect of making you feel like you have cotton mouth while brushing. After that you use the whitening gel, which also tastes gross. The results are amazing though. I only used this once and my teeth are so much whiter! I used a whitening tray for an hour once and had the same results as with this product, that only took minutes to use! I did have to brush my teeth with my regular toothpaste afterwords, because the taste in my mouth was so horrible and I still have a bit of an aftertaste in my mouth. I would use this product again, because it is so quick and effective. I am very impressed with how white my teeth are and how good they look after one use. I will probably only use this once a week though, because it is so unpleasant and because it works so well, I wouldn&#x27;t need to use it daily. I got this product free to review.</li>
            <li> Loved this product! Crest is a a household name and this is a great another great product! Leaves your teeth feeling so smooth and clean! The 2-step process will clean then whiten your teeth after just a few usese!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried teeth whiteners before but nothing like this. I have several very sensitive areas and during my trial only had one issue of discomfort. What I liked best with this product is how long my teeth stay feeling fresh, no yuck build-up on them. My teeth actually still feel fresh at the end of the day! I have even noticed a good change in my breath, which to me I a plus!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This two-step toothpaste is very easy to use. Simply place step-1 on tooth brush and brush all surfaces of your teeth for 1 full minute. Spit but do not rinse. Add step-2 to your brush and continue to brush all surfaces of your teeth a additional full minute. Rinse and your mouth will feel awesome!!! How much easier can it be to have a great white smile!!! It is worth the try!!! :D</li>
            <li> I brushed longer and could really feel the effects of the two formulas working together to get rid of plaque. I had fresh breath longer than with just brushing with normal tooth paste.</li>
            <li> This product is the best on the market. The foaming tooth paste in Step 1 removes all plaque stains in a single use as if you had a professional cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office. This cleaning provides a great surface for the Step 2 whitening paste to whiten your teeth with results definitely visible after the first application. This is a win-win product !!!</li>
            <li> Stars: 4 out of 5&lt;br /&gt;Review:&lt;br /&gt;My mouth feels cleaner along with my breath and teeth. I think it is a good product and would purchase it again&lt;br /&gt;Headline:&lt;br /&gt;cleaner mouth</li>
            <li> I was so impressed with Crest PH HD because my teeth felt dentist clean even when I woke up in the morning!!! The two step process took a little more time, but the rewards were well worth it. I use an electric toothbrush, so I ended up brushing with step one for two minutes and then switching to the second product for two minutes.  I love the way my teeth feel immediately after brushing and four the next 10ish hours.  It is truly amazing!  I didn&#x27;t see much in the whitening aspect, but hope to over time.  I gave this product 4 stars because I do get some peeling of my cheeks and gums and after research realized this is a common occurrence with the floride that is used in the Crest HD.  I would also like to see this made in a sensitive teeth formula and then all of my concerns would be covered.  Nice job, Crest</li>
            <li> I thought that this was going to be all smoke and mirrors but I was so wrong. This product is actually worth the money and the time. Your teeth are like coming out of the dental office without the trauma. It is like getting them back to brand new when all the plaque is stripped away. I do think my teeth look whiter and for sure they feel way healthy and better. I wish all products on the shelf provided this option. I think it is about time some one came up with a product that you can actually feel and see the outcome before going to the dentist. I would and will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Brush, spit, brush, swish BLING.  I thought that this dual system would take up too much time but it is the quickest whitening system that I have ever tried.  The first step makes your teeth feel squeaky clean and prepped.  The taste is pleasant and the foaming texture makes the bubbles do their job.  The second step has a sweet taste to it and you can feel it working instantly.  As you are brushing the color changes right before your eyes, quite a few shades.  I was shipped this product for free from bzzagent.com and I am hooked.  I can&#x27;t wait to give them as gifts!</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get the chance to try out the Crest Pro Health® HD™ 2 step system for free! Special thanks to Crest for hooking me up! I just got it yesterday and jumped at the chance to try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is compact, sleek and stylish. It comes with a 4.0 oz tube of purifying cleanser and a 2.3 oz tube of perfecting gel. My only critique is that the actual tubes were a lot smaller than what I expected. After opening the package, I smelt a wonderful mint scent. I let my wife take a whiff and she told me that she liked it already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, how does it work?  Simply brush 1 minute with the purifying cleanser then spit and do not rinse. Finish off by brushing another minute with the perfecting gel, spit and rinse. This simple two step process take two minutes to complete which leaves your mouth feeling very refreshed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1, the purifying cleanser is meant to strip away plaque. It&#x27;s a fluoride toothpaste for anti-cavity and anti-gingivitis. After step 1, it left my mouth feeling kind of dry and slightly sandy or grimy. It felt very similar to that feeling after your dentist waxes your teeth during a cleaning. Unfortunately, you&#x27;re not allowed to rinse just yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2, the perfecting gel is meant to polish and whiten your teeth. Once the gel combined with the cleanser, my mouth was already feeling extremely clean. Finishing off with a much needed rinse, this product left my teeth feeling literally squeaky clean. My teeth had that same feeling walking out of the dentist after a cleaning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen this wonderful product at major retailers just yet, but if you are interested, it is available at CVS for $15.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how this great system will affect my smile within the next week.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use, gives good results quickly and is less expensive than some other whitening alternatives.  It certainly saves time as well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! My teeth never felt this clean after a brush. Even though it adds an extra step to brushing in the morning and at night, I felt like I just left the dentist! My husband had to try it right when we got it, and he also said he hasn&#x27;t felt his teeth feel so clean except right after visiting the dentist. I look forward to seeing if there is a difference in whitening!</li>
            <li> I got this Crest Pro-Health HD 2-step toothpaste to try from BzzAgent and it&#x27;s actually pretty fantastic! I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of days, but my teeth feel like I&#x27;ve just been to the dentist after I use it and they are already looking whiter! :) It&#x27;s a little annoying to add a second step to my brushing routine, however, I&#x27;ve been finding that it&#x27;s totally worth it. My teeth look and feel good! :)</li>
            <li> I really love crest pro health HD daily ! My teeth look and feel so much cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;Every time I use it I see my teeth lighten , whiten and brighten.  My 16 yr old daughter has braces for 2 years  now causing stains on her teeth . I had her use the system too and we were amazed with the results&lt;br /&gt;received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own</li>
            <li> I love a product that whitens teeth so when I got the chance to try Crest Pro Health® HD(tm) For free courtesy of Crest, I was super excited. I received my package yesterday and couldn&#x27;t wait to try my first cleaning.  I read the directions which were not only easy to understand but easy to locate as the package and both tubes are labeled effectively.  I love the ease of this process!  It takes two minutes from start to finish. I have tried several products specific to teeth whitening and NONE of them take two minutes!  Step one is a cleanser which tastes great, a lot like toothpaste.  I felt my teeth were truly cleaner after one application.  After one minute of scrubbing with the cleanser and no rinsing it was time for step two, a gel.  This is the part with whitening power.  The gel also tasted fine, was cool and cleansing.  After a minute I was able to spit and rinse.  Running my teeth on my gums insured they were clean and smooth.  I took a before picture of my teeth and will take a picture in one week which is the advertised time of noticing whiter teeth, I can&#x27;t wait to compare!  The last thing I noticed immediately is that the cleanliness and freshness lasted for a long time.  My first application was at night and I woke with a clean feeling mouth the next morning.  So easy to remember 2x2, 2 steps and 2 minutes, LOVE it!  Thank you Crest for a super product!</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I have a serious aversion to wintergreen flavored anything. I gag every time I use step 1, very strong wintergreen flavor. Step 2 is more mild flavored, way more tolerable. I&#x27;m hoping they add different flavors to the line or I won&#x27;t be purchasing it in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed in the past week that my teeth are getting noticeably whiter. My husband also wants to try it out. But, he hates the wintergreen flavor as well.</li>
            <li> Confidence...  That feeling right when you leave your dentist after having your teeth cleaned.  You move your tongue along your pearly whites - oh how smooth.  And you look in the mirror, and there&#x27;s a shiny reflection staring back at you.  Knowing you can get in someone&#x27;s face, and there&#x27;s nothing but fresh, clean breath coming out of your mouth.  That&#x27;s what I am getting with the Crest Pro-Health HD system.  I call it a system because there are two steps:  First, (the silver Step 1 tube) you brush for one minute with a fluoride-based gel.  Second, you spit but don&#x27;t rinse from Step 1, and then brush for another minute using the second, blue tube.  The second tube has a clear gel that has peroxide as one of its ingredients, and you see the bubblies on your teeth and between the teeth as you brush.  I experienced no sensitivity, but my mouth feels so clean.  Usually when I drink coffee and brush afterwards, I still taste coffee no matter how much I brush my tongue and gums.  Using this product, all I taste is dentist-clean freshness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m supposed to mention that I snagged this product free as a BzzAgent, which is good, really, because I might not have discovered it otherwise.  This just doesn&#x27;t compare to the single tube toothpaste I&#x27;ve always used.  I feel more confident, and my teeth really do look whiter.</li>
            <li> say goodbye to plaque!!! So i was a little skeptical when trying this product. I mean, i would have to committ to a &amp;#34;two minute&amp;#34; teeth brushing routine, when i never really have timed myself before. It was all worth it.&lt;br /&gt;The product comes in two bottles (1 is the purifying cleanser and 1 is the perfecting gel). You use the cleanser and brush your teeth for one minute (and yes, i timed myself with my phone). after one minute, spit (DO NOT RINSE) and then use the perfecting gel and brush your teeth for one more minute). At that point, you can spit and rinse! two minutes actually goes by very fast- who would have known!&lt;br /&gt;After my first few days of brushing, i could see and feel a difference. Every once in a while, we have all must have experienced what plaque build up looks like and feels like on our teeth- yeah its gross- it happens even when we brush our teeth consistently. But i have noticed, in just a few days, that any plaque i might have seen before is no where to be found! i could visably notice that my mouth was healthier! i really enjoy this product and feel that it gives me a deep, down, complete clean- more than my other toothpaste products.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own and I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! Its important to note that Step 1 you brush for 1 minute and then DON&#x27;T RINSE! Then complete Step 2 for 1 minute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within 5 days I noticed a difference in my smile. It was much whiter and I could also feel a difference with my teeth. They weren&#x27;t as gritty and were very smooth. I use an automatic toothbrush so the 1 minute timing was very simple for me as my toothbrush has notification sensors for time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing this product over and over as I just love the simplicity of it. Its two steps but well worth it! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I received this as a Free Sample and I am so lucky I did! I wasn&#x27;t sure it was going to work because I have tried other brands strips and tooth paste that gave me no results but after 6 days I noticed a big difference! It is easy to use and only take a total of 2 mins, just twice a day and you see your teeth become whiter. I am a big coffee drinker and this has helped me, so much so others have told me how nice my teeth are! I&#x27;m excited to keep using it and see how white they get! I would DEF recommend anyone to at least give it try!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and I highly recommend it. I received a sample from Crest and BzzAgent and am so excited with the preliminary results . Gives u that fresh from the dentist clean feel. I will be purchasing more for my family and myself once our sample runs out .</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  The whole day after you brush makes you feel like you just got your teeth cleaned. Doesn&#x27;t taste bad for a whitening product nor does it make your teeth sensitive.  I have an allergy to sodium laurel sulfate and have had no reaction to this product. So happy to have found it! I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> I was recently given the opportunity to try Crest Pro-Health HD and I have found its one of the easiest ways to whiten my teeth.  I have tried the strips before but I could never find the time to do it and when I did I never felt like I was doing it right, therefore not seeing great results.  So when BzzAgent contacted me to participate in this campaign. I was excited to see if this would work and be as easy as it sounds! #HealthyObsession #Sponsored #GotItFree&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily, I just changed up my toothpaste routine, its so very easy!  You simply brush for one minute using step one paste and then brush for another minute using the step 2 paste.  Its that simple, I have been using it for about a week now and I have to say that my mouth feels fresh and clean, and my teeth seem a little whiter.  I will be using it from now on and cant wait to see how white my teeth get.  The only negative, is that the first step paste is a little thick and feels like sand is in the paste, but its only a minute and so worth it!</li>
            <li> I would like to start off that the ONLY reason this is not 5 stars is because I am lazy and this product is two steps.  I have been using Crest products most of my life and started using the Pro Health line last year because of how healthy it made my mouth feel and the results I experienced at the dentist.  When I was asked to try out this product thru BzzAgent, I jumped on it.  This is like combining the best of both worlds, Pro-Health toothpaste and Crest White-Strips.  You will feel a difference the first time you use it.  By the end of the first week, my teeth were noticeably whiter, even as a tea and coffee drinker. The first step looks and tastes just like the regular Pro-Health toothpaste and the 2nd step is a clear gel similar to a whitening gel, with a light hydrogen peroxide/baking soda taste.  It&#x27;s not too bad and well worth the results.</li>
            <li> I received this to try as a promotion and was very pleased to be included.  I like Crest products, but this didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.  I wish that it had more of a minty flavor.  And after using the second tube, my gums are sore.  I also didn;t like the aftertaste.  But I will say that my teeth are brighter after 5 days.  Also I am not sure when I should be flossing, before or after brushing.  If I floss before, my gums are more tender.  And if I floss after my gums are more sensitive.  I will probably stop using this product soon because of the discomfort in my gums.</li>
            <li> Crest® Pro-Heath® HD™ 2 step whitening product is amazing.  I have sensitive teeth, so most whitening products hurt too much to use.  This product is fast, easy, and does not hurt my teeth.  And the results are amazing!  I am very impressed with this product!  I received a full size product to try for free from Smiley 360.  I highly recommend this product!  I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately was offered this product shortly after going through a Rembrandt whitestrips regimen.  I drink coffee and red wine and have a taste for red and blueberries but I&#x27;m not a smoker - nevertheless my teeth had yellowed more than I would&#x27;ve liked and I balked at the dentist&#x27;s whitening treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the Rembrandt strips DID have some slight effect, but far from Hollywood tooth-whiteness, and those whitening strips, at only about 2 1/2&amp;#34; long, left more than just the back teeth unaffected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crest Pro-Health combo seems about equally effective, but is SOoOoOo much easier to use.  It&#x27;s a little weird brushing then NOT RINSING and applying the gel, but it&#x27;s ridiculously easier than applying the strips, and the gel goes a lot further in every respect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel does indeed contain sucralose, but that doesn&#x27;t bother ME.  It&#x27;s true you could brush your teeth with straight hydrogen peroxide, but this is a MUCH more pleasant alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of this writing, however, my teeth are still far from tv-commercial brilliance.  Nevertheless I&#x27;m going to continue to use it - it&#x27;s supposed to have many other benefits.  We&#x27;ll see what the dentist says at the next appointment.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste for the past week as part of the bzz campaign, where Crest provided a free product for me to use.  First the good.  I do think that my teeth felt noticeably cleaner than with regular toothpaste.  And my teeth felt cleaner for longer than they do when I use regular toothpaste.  Now for the bad.  I did not notice any change in the whiteness of my teeth.  My teeth are what I would call average.  Not bright white but not stained.  I just didn&#x27;t notice any change at all in the whiteness.  But I still think the toothpaste works better for cleaning teeth than regular toothpaste and would recommend it for that.  The one other bad is that I use an electric toothbrush and it is a pain to have to monitor the time for one minute with the first toothpaste and then stop it and use the second tube of whitening gel on my teeth.  I wish this were all one step.  I am all about ease of use, especially on the early mornings when I am in a rush to get to work.</li>
            <li> I love Crest pro-health Hd daily two step toothpaste. It leaves my teeth feeling so clean and shiny. I can already see if a difference. I will def be purchasing more. I received this as a product for free to test out and my opinion is 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received sample of Crest Pro Health HD for free to try through BzzAgent. I decided to use Crest Pro Health HD for a few days before I wrote this review. The product boasts 6x healthier and whiter teeth in a week.&lt;br /&gt;First, let me comment on the packaging. &amp;#34;Regular&amp;#34; toothpaste comes in a rectangular box with a smaller footprint than this toothpaste comes in. Due in part to the two packages of toothpaste instead of the normal one. Also, the packaging makes the product stand out, with a masculine-looking blue packaging scheme. However, I did find the box a bit hard to open, even with the pull tab on one of the corners. I feel that perhaps the packaging could be easier to open and maybe a bit smaller.&lt;br /&gt;Second, taste and effect. Since this is a two step process, brushing will take twice as long as before, but I didn&#x27;t really notice this too much. Step 1, the cleanser, has a nice wintergreen-type flavor. I like this because I don&#x27;t really like the peppermint-type flavor of a lot of other toothpastes. It also felt a bit grainier than other toothpastes, but maybe this is because I couldn&#x27;t rinse after I brushed. Step 2 is a polisher, a gel paste. This gel had a very medicinal flavor which I didn&#x27;t find pleasant, but it wasn&#x27;t off-putting too much. It also had that mouthburn type of reaction that you might get with a strong mouthwash. After finishing with Step 2, you can rinse. I just rinse with some water and my mouth does indeed feel fresher and cleaner after I brush with this product. I haven&#x27;t noticed, however, if my teeth are whiter, so I might give the product more time to see if I can notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;One last note, which may be nitpicky. The tubes are meant to be stand-up tubes. The packaging doesn&#x27;t match the stand-up aspect for Step 2, since when you stand the toothpaste tube on the sink the writing is upside down. I would like for Crest to make both tubes the same, so that the writing for both tubes is the same (see image).</li>
            <li> I was sent this toothpaste to try as part of a BzzAgent campaign, and I just don&#x27;t like it. The step 1 tastes okay, not great. Step 2 tastes horrid - like bleach, or something. The Step 1 paste feels incredibly rough, and I was wondering if it could even wear away tooth enamel. Having whiter teeth is not worth wearing down tooth enamel or brushing with a paste that tastes like bleach, in my opinion. I&#x27;m not even sure it was whitening my teeth - they almost look like they were turning green-ish. We threw our sample away.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product as a promotion from BzzAgent for Crest and I can definitely tell a difference in how smooth and polished my teeth are after a week of using this product.  I haven&#x27;t been able to tell if they are whiter yet but the feel clean all day long and even in the morning.  It says that you only have to do each of the 2 steps for a minute each but it takes longer than that for me to make sure that all of my teeth have been adequately brushed so it is like I&#x27;m brushing my teeth twice each time.  Since every minute counts when you are trying to get out of the house for work in the morning and have 3 small children, this is a drawback but the results make up for it.  The only other issue is that I can&#x27;t find anywhere that says how long it should take before seeing results.  I don&#x27;t know if I could stick to this routine indefinitely so I&#x27;d like to know what milestones I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> Do you like that &#x27;just from the dentist&#x27; feeling?  Do you like a bright, white smile!  Then Crest ProHealth HD is for you!  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks.  Initially, I thought that the two step process would be a pain but it is simple and so, so effective.  I haven&#x27;t had the need to use either my whitening strips or trays since Crest ProHealth HD came into my life.</li>
            <li> I recently tried Crest Pro-Health HD as a part of a promotion from the brand.  I was hoping to get an ultra white smile, as promised on the box.  Unfortunately, that didn&#x27;t happen for me.  I tried the product exactly as directed on the box, one minute for the first product and one minute for the second and after a week I had mouth full of sore gums. If you want this effect for less of a hassle, I recommend brushing with your regular toothpaste for two minutes.  You will probably achieve the same results as you do from purchasing this product.  One thing I did notice after using this regimen is the blast of artic freshness you get. It isn&#x27;t a horrible product but don&#x27;t be disappointed if the results aren&#x27;t as extreme as advertised.</li>
            <li> THIS NEW PRODUCT IS THE BEST I HAVE EVER TRIED. IT LEAVES YOUR TEETH FEELING AS IT THEY HAVE BEEN RESURFACED. RUBBING YOUR TONGUE ACROSS THEM MAKES THEM FEEL AS SMOOTH AS PEARLS. THE WHITENING WAS JUST RIGHT. MY TEETH WERE NOT OVERLY WHITENED MAKING THEM SEEM NATURALLY WHITE - IT TAKES YEARS OFF MY SMILE</li>
            <li> Crest HD is a product that actually delivers, cleaner, whiter and smoother teeth in less than 1 week.  It has a fresh taste but step one has a sticky-spongy texture.  Even with regular dental cleaning I notice a little plaque buildup but this product removed it.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste part of step one tastes really good, that was the first thing i noticed (and it smells good too haha). I really felt like it got my teeth clean. I think the second step doesn&#x27;t really taste like anything but its a gel which has improved the whiteness of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first i thought the two steps would be annoying but it really does not take any extra time and actually encourages me to brush my teeth for the time dentists tell you too! I deff thing it is worth the price and i feel like you get a good amount of toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;( I received this as part of a campaign for free)</li>
            <li> I figured a 2-step process would be time consuming or more work than it actually was. I received the kit free from BzzAgent and Crest to try it out. I couldn&#x27;t believe all it took was 1 minute with Step 1 for anticavity and antigingivitis cleaning. And then only another 1 minute for the whitening gel. This is so much easier than those strips I used to use that you had to wear for 5 minutes that left your teeth sensitive and slimy! The paste and gel of the Crest Pro-Health HD kit are not abrasive or foul tasting. It&#x27;s very easy on the teeth and leave a fresh minty taste. In just 4 days of use, 2x per day, I can already see the difference in my teeth. My smile is much brighter! I&#x27;ve always used Crest toothpaste; it&#x27;s a brand you can trust. I&#x27;m loving the addition of the pro-health HG two step process and would definitely recommend you try for yourself.</li>
            <li> Just started using the Crest Pro Health® HD toothpaste system. What makes the Crest Pro Health® HD system unique is the two step process. My first concern was (A) would I miss a step or (B) would the extra step be a nuisance or too time consuming. As a working mom with my three youngest being 8, 3 and 18 months, my mornings are very hectic and so is bedtime. More complication is not what I am looking for in morning or bedtime routine.&lt;br /&gt;Before I even put the toothpaste in my mouth I read the ingredients. For step 1 which is the purifying cleanser, the active ingredient is Stannous Fluoride. Sodium fluoride is the ingredient found in most other toothpastes. Wasn&#x27;t sure what advantages there were over stannous fluoride, but according to Crests website it differs from sodium fluoride in that it not only helps with cavity protection but also protects against plaque, gingivitis and tooth sensitivity. From my research also found it had more anti-microbial properties.Tooth sensitivity is a problem for me so can&#x27;t wait to see if this toothpaste will reduce sensitivity. I generally don&#x27;t like the taste of traditional anti-sensitivity toothpastes, but more on taste of this toothpaste in a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste system came in an awesome little package that looked appealing. Most importantly it was easy to open. You could even save the container to store the system. This was what I did to reduce clutter. According to the instructions, you use step 1 for 1 minute and spit but DO NOT rinse. Step 2 is the polishing and whitening gel that you use for another minute. I have an electric toothbrush with timer and didn&#x27;t find the second step too taxing. You just stop brushing your teeth for a second and add the paste from step 2. If I had to rinse in between steps, that would have definitely been a deal breaker. I would feel like I were brushing my teeth twice. My only criticism is that step 2, the tube should have been a flip top like step 1. Would have made life easier.&lt;br /&gt; The taste of the step one paste was minty, but not overpowering. in fact, I thought it could have been a little stronger. Step 2 had a more harsh taste in my mouth. None of them left any strange aftertaste. I cant say my teeth are noticeable whiter just yet after using for two days, but we will see. Not sure if Crest Pro Health® HD will offer other flavors because that will give consumers a variety to choose from. I did notice that my mouth felt more fresh in comparison to other toothpastes I have used. Most importantly the feeling of freshness even lasted after I ate and several hours later.&lt;br /&gt;Crest Pro Health® HD promises to make your mouth up to six times healthier and whiter in a week. In conclusion, if Crest Pro Health® HD can really decrease sensitivity, and increase the whiteness of my teeth with such a simple system, I am sold. Who wants to fiddle with whitening strips and trays, when life could be so much simpler.  I received the Crest Pro Health HD free, courtesy of Crest and for being a BzzAgent. However my review is true and unbiased.

            <li> I was so overjoyed to get my kit from BzzAgent. I am two days into my new routine with Crest Pro Health HD and I&#x27;m loving it so far. Two things that automatically stuck out to me after the first night were that I had no sensitivity like I do with most whitening products and my teeth still felt fresh when I woke up the next morning. I was pleasantly surprised about the lack of sensitivity, but I was blown away by how clean my teeth actually felt hours after brushing. It felt like I had just had my teeth cleaned at the dentist. I have noticed that my teeth were shinier and a little whiter. I will post again after a week so I can see how much whiter my teeth can get. The only downside is the second step has an unpleasant flavor, but most whitening products do. So far I&#x27;m loving it and would recommend it. I will post again after I&#x27;ve had a week to see how much whiter my teeth actually get.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product. I had previously tried the Whitestrips, which were not for me.  I think it&#x27;s a texture thing. But this particular product is sooooo easy to use and my teeth felt like I just left the dentist.  Even the next morning when I woke up, I still had that super clean feeling that makes you run your tongue over your teeth?  You know what I&#x27;m talking about.  I highly recommend it.  I&#x27;m totally hooked.  I did receive a free product for the purpose of my review and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I have tried many whitening systems, and. Frankly I think many of them are disgusting. This one though, I really like. It&#x27;s a two-step process (obviously) but not a difficult one. You use the first tube -- toothpaste -- for one minute. Then, without rinsing (yes, you can spit), add a small bit of the polishing/whitening gel and brush for another minute. That&#x27;s it. It really is simple, and no more time-consuming than regular tooth brushing. My teeth felt clean, looked clean, and we&#x27;re super-smooth. I use this every day and have had no issues -- no excessive bleeding, dry mouth, or weird gagging sensation that I can get with strips or trays (if have that issue, you know what I mean). Best of all, my teeth really are cleaner and brighter-looking.</li>
            <li> I received this system through a sampling site for free, but my opinions are all my own. I have always had issues with whitening toothpastes leaving behind a sticky glue like residue on my teeth and in my mouth. After using the system, I was very happy that no such residue occurred. I was even more thrilled with the results; my teeth and gums actually felt like I had been to the dentist for a cleaning!&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the results from this product, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I received my Crest Pro Health HD in a BZZ campaign free, so this review is based on that, not a purchase. I was pleasantly surprised, and after using it I will definitely buy it. Great product. This is a two step process to strip away plaque and whiten and brighten your teeth. You brush with the first tube for 1 minute, then, without rinsing, you use the second product for 1 minute. I loved how it made my teeth feel so clean. I highly recommend this product. I would have liked the product to have a little bit of a more \\&quot;minty\\&quot; flavor, but it was not an unpleasant taste, and this would not deter me from using it.</li>
            <li> The product came in a nice and easy to open package. The directions were easy to follow and it was a quick process. After finishing the process my teeth felt very clean and my breath fresh! I have not noticed a differance in the whitening yet, but time will tell. Overall nice product. I recieved this product for free through Bzzagent.com</li>
            <li> I think this is a FANTASTIC product- When I read that it would take a week to see results I honestly didn&#x27;t think that would happen, but my own family made a comment that my teeth looked &amp;#34;really white.&amp;#34; I used other Crest toothpaste so I trusted the brand, but I really didn&#x27;t expect to see results so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I know there are other whitening products out there, but I thought this was especially easy because it&#x27;s easily incorporated into my usual brushing routine. You don&#x27;t even need to rinse in-between each tube.&lt;br /&gt;Neither tube has a bad taste either. I even have sensitive gums and this did not irritate me in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to BzzAgent and Crest I was able to try this product for free, but I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again when mine runs out.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!! Easy to use. Quick results. Crest pro health hd made my teeth feel cleaner and my breath fresher after just one use. Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> I have always loved having white teeth. I was sure to give this a try. I do love the product. I was not sure about the two step program and if I would be willing to do it every time but it worked well. I did like it and the taste.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own</li>
            <li> I am a bzzagent, which means I get to try products for free and share my honest opinions.  In other words, spread the buzz.  When offered this Crest Pro-Health HD campaign I was eager to start it and excited to try it the first time,, 3 days ago.  (Yes, I don&#x27;t get out much) Actually, I am OCD about my teeth.  The first time I used this 2-step process, my teeth felt just as clean as the week before when I walked out of the dentist office for my 6-month cleaning.  And I swear they were shinier and maybe a tad whiter after the first use. Yes, it is 2 steps.  I have an electric toothbrush with a 1-minute timer so it&#x27;s a no-brainer for me.  I just run the cycle twice.  If you are a serious tooth-brusher, you won&#x27;t mind the extra minute.  The taste could be better, it isn&#x27;t minty fresh which is what I prefer.  Other than that, I am very pleased with how clean my teeth feel and hopefully more white as I keep using it!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest, I was able to try Crest Pro-Health HD for free!  I&#x27;m glad I got a chance to try it, because this product works really great.  It leaves your mouth feeling healthier, plus it also helps whiten teeth.  Besides those benefits, this product is designed to reduce cavities, gingivitis, and plaque.  And who doesn&#x27;t want to prevent those things?!  You will want to know that this product contains two tubes, to be used each time you brush your teeth.  The instructions are to brush teeth for one minute with tube 1 paste, spit but do not rinse, brush for one more minute with tube 2 paste, and then spit and rinse.  The tube 2 is for polishing and whitening.  For some reason one of the tubes is a flip-top and one is a twist-off.  While it may sound slightly complicated, it really takes no more time than a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; tooth care routing.  There is less foaming of the pastes than regular toothpastes, which I think I prefer.  The flavors are minty and fresh.  I have been using this product for only a couple of weeks, but so far it leaves my mouth feeling super fresh and healthy with no adverse affects.</li>
            <li> I have a mixed feeling about this product.I got it from BZZagent for free trial. Lets start with positives.&lt;br /&gt;1) Cleaning - when it comes to cleaning it does clean your teeth very well.&lt;br /&gt;2) Fights bad breath - It really helped me to keep the bad breath 12-14 hours which is really a plus.&lt;br /&gt;3) Whitens - yes it does whitens your teeth but seems to be a slow process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now comes the negatives:-&lt;br /&gt;1) Fights Plaque - I have been using it for a week now and I am yet to see the results in this front.&lt;br /&gt;2) Sensitivity - I have sensitivity and this toothpaste replaced my synsodyne but after I stopped sysnsodyne, I got the problem of sensitivity back which hurts.&lt;br /&gt;3) time consuming - you have to use 2 products 1 after the other which takes lot of time in the morning rush hours. Even though this is not a real negative but had these been in 1 product it would have worked better.</li>
            <li> I got this product free from Bzz Agent. I have found a whitening toothpaste were I see immediate results.  Just got this Crest Pro Health HD. Mouth feels clean and fresh. Noticed results fast. Simple 2 step process.  Only takes minutes. I&#x27;m on average a 5 cups of coffee drinker along with a glass of red wine a day. Will finish the tube and post more pics.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to sample this product for free via BzzAgent.  I love it so far for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It is easy to use.  Just brush as you normally would.  Use step 1, don&#x27;t rinse and use step 2.  Done!&lt;br /&gt;2. It is convenient.  No strips or whitening trays to leave on for long periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;3. It is strong, but not harsh.  No sensitivity or burning like other systems.&lt;br /&gt;4. It tastes good.  Some others I have tried in the past tasted like chemicals...yuck!&lt;br /&gt;5. It works!  It is not a bright white, but it slowly cleans and brightens your teeth as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several other methods in the past, including whitening strips, trays, etc. and this is by far the easiest system to use.  With that said, if you are expecting a bright glowing white smile, this probably is not the best product for that.  This is a daily use system that slowly whitens.  The benefits to whitening slowly is that you will experience less sensitivity and issues with enamel breakdown.  Give it a try and see for yourself how wonderful this daily system truly is!</li>
            <li> I received crest pro-health Hd tooth paste through bzzagent thanks to Crest ! I always hated when it was that time again to whiten my teeth. Other whiten tooth paste took forever to show a small improvement, whitening strips left my teeth sensitive after 1-2 treatments and always messed up the timing. Did I leave them on long enough or too long? With crest pro-Heath HD I noticed a significant difference after the first 2 minute treatment ! It&#x27;s easy to use tubes are clearly labeled step 1 and step 2 . Do each step for a minute and don&#x27;t rinse until after step 2! Wait a week for full results then show off your beautiful smile !</li>
            <li> As someone who drinks copious amounts of coffee (and a red wine-lover to boot), my teeth are always needing a little help in the white department. I&#x27;ve tried those strips but was always annoyed by the 30 minutes I had to leave them on and the gooey taste, plus they made my gums sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample from Bzz Agent, and now Crest Pro-Health HD is my new go to toothpaste. After the first time I used it, my teeth had that smooth feeling you have after going to the dentist, and after a few uses I noticed a definite improvement in color. It only takes 2 minutes to use the two different pastes (one to remove plaque and one to whiten), so it couldn&#x27;t be any easier. The taste is fresh--like baking soda, nothing too cloying or sweet.</li>
            <li> First off, I love this product! I evaluated this product for BzzAgent who provided me with a free sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks. I enjoy the taste and the two step process isn&#x27;t bothersome. I do notice that my teeth feel smooth and clean. They are also noticeably whiter. Today, I received a compliment that started with &amp;#34;Are your teeth natural?&amp;#34; Well, they certainly are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Definitely love this toothpaste!!  I received a free sample as part of a promotion from Crest as a BzzAgent, but I&#x27;ll gladly pay for this when it comes out.  Despite having two steps, it&#x27;s fast, and the feeling it leaves you with is fantastic.  I did have one of the \\&quot;signals\\&quot; show up in the first few days, which was white spots on my gums.  They didn&#x27;t hurt, bleed, and weren&#x27;t extremely noticeable to anyone other than me.  So no harm, no foul.  As a coffee drinker, I noticed the difference in my teeth after about 3 days of usage (a good notice, as they&#x27;re whiter).  Only reason why I gave it 4 vs 5 stars is that the mint is almost too strong, but not a showstopper.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do as great a job in whitening as I had expected.  I thought the whitening product was too thin.  It slid off my toothbrush before it had a chance to get to my teeth.  It whitened a little but in all fairness my teeth are pretty white to begin with.  I used Crest 3D white strips professional every six months and they work well for me.  My mouth felt healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> As a BzzAgent, I received my free Crest Pro Health HD sample a week ago to test and review.  The timing was perfect because I have been wanting to try a new toothpaste.  I am not a fan of the typical fluoride toothpastes out there so  I was excited to try this new product. Instructions are simple and easy to follow - two quick steps but the hardest thing for me to remember was to NOT rinse between step 1 and step 2. Step 1 - Purifying Cleanser (light blue paste) cleans and removes plaque.  Step 2 - Perfecting Gel (clear gel) removes the stains and whitens the teeth.  After completing both steps, my teeth definitely felt cleaner but I have not seen any whitening.  Perhaps after continuous use, I will see better results.  I will continue to use the product as instructed since the process is simple and quick and my teeth do feel cleaner after use.  However, I can&#x27;t say at this time if I would purchase the product since I have not seen any noticeable changes with the whitening aspect.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it would be a pain to use a two step system but it&#x27;s not at all. After a week it seems completely natural. I have an Oral B brush with the 2 minute timer broken into 4 30 second sections so this works perfect with that. The step one paste does an excellent job of cleaning and removing plaque. Then the whiting/polish step can work it&#x27;s magic. It&#x27;s a great idea to have then whitener separate. It can be more concentrated and get everywhere it needs to instead of being diluted in the regular paste. I recommend this system. My teeth have gotten whiter during the two weeks I&#x27;ve been using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes:&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use 2 step system. Not as difficult at it seems&lt;br /&gt;- Works very well with electric brushes with timers&lt;br /&gt;- Having the whitener separate lets it work better</li>
            <li> This product is so good. What I like most about it is your teeth feel like you have just left the dentist after each brush. The second thing I really enjoy is that you brush with Step 1 for 1 minute and then Step 2 for 1 minute also. It breaks up the monotony of brushing for 2 straight minutes with one toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;I was really surprised as to just how clean my teeth felt and how white they had gotten after even one brushing! The wintergreen flavor of the toothpaste is another perk, it just happens to be my favorite! I did recieve this product as part of a promotion from this brand.</li>
            <li> I received a kit for free as part of a promotional campaign.  I was a little skeptical at first about using a 2-step process to brush my teeth.  But I have to admit, I could feel the clean difference right away.  My teeth felt smooth and polished immediately, and after a week I have noticed that they are whiter too!  It is pretty simple:  use the step 1 toothpaste for 1 minute to strip away plaque, spit (do not rinse), then use the step 2 gel for 1 minute to polish and whiten.  It only takes 2 minutes for a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product when I recieved it through a promotional trial.  I am always up for trying new products and ones that will whiten my teeth.  One thing I am not a fan about is having to use two products each time.  Brushing teeth being apart of my routine is somewhat scheduled.  I hate having to do something for a long period of time.  What I found out by using this product is that it really didn&#x27;t take much time.  I have been using the product for 6 days and have seen a significant change in the whiteness of my teeth.  I am a coffee drinker and I know that my teeth don&#x27;t always look bright and white.  These last six days have been a real change for me.  My teeth feel so clean afterwards and they are looking great.  This is a product I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get this product as part of a promotion from Bzz Agent and couldn&#x27;t help but be curious and also skeptical, because it contained two products to brush my teeth.  Contrary to my regular routine of only using one paste to brush my teeth, I had to try it and see what it was all about.  It didn&#x27;t taste like regular toothpaste, but it wasn&#x27;t a bad taste.  After using both pastes I felt that my mouth was very clean and my teeth also looked brighter.  After I week I started to notice my teeth even look whiter than before, I wish I would&#x27;ve taken pictures to compare. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to have a cleaner mouth/teeth and brighter smile.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Crest pro-health from smileys and I was a little concerned at first cause of the extra time it took to use both tubs. But after a few days I just became habit..I really like the taste and I can see a differents in my smile and it makes my mouth feel very clean after using it..It does take a few times to get used to the taste of it..</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and implement into my routine. Step 2 made my mouth dry, but that only lasted while brushing.  I did notice a difference, but nothing drastic.  best part, no sensitivity like whiteness in the past!</li>
            <li> A great new product from Crest.  I love the fact that we are able to whiten as we brush, eliminating the need to wear strips or use any other products.&lt;br /&gt;I only wish they had simplified it into one tube and reduced the waste of containers.</li>
            <li> I had an opportunity to try this product for free through Smiley360.  I was just getting ready to try a whitening kit I purchased online from a dentist.  I thought I would give this a try first.  I definitely see a difference but I don&#x27;t think it is 6X whiter like they claim.  Not even close.  I plan to continue using it until it is gone and then determine if the difference is really significant.  It is definitely something you can use everyday just to take away the stains from normal drinking and eating like coffee and tea.  I like that it is easy to use.  I wish the taste was bit more refreshing if this is to take the place of normal everyday brushing.  I do have some sensitivity to it as I typically use a sensitive toothpaste due to sensitivity issues.  I am giving it 3 stars because I do think it can be useful in removing day to day stains if you are a regular coffee or tea drinker.  However,  don&#x27;t think it will whiten or remove built on stains.  It hasn&#x27;t for me so far.  My smile is a bit brighter but not as significant as the packaging claims.</li>
            <li> Noticed a huge improvement in just 1 use! I have been using other whitening toothpastes for years without nearly the difference. This left my mouth feeling incredibly clean. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is step 2 tasted very &amp;#34;medication like&amp;#34; to me...so step 2 was a very long minute for me personally,</li>
            <li> I tried this free through BzzAgent.  Only used it once, the taste of step 2 was so horrible I won&#x27;t use it again. Almost threw up and ended up re-brushing with other toothpaste to get rid of the taste. My teeth did look good for what that&#x27;s worth but I won&#x27;t suffer through the taste again.</li>
            <li> I am a white teeth fanatic and usually purchase gel from the dentist and use it in a custom made tray.  I got this product through bzzagent.com to try and review.  It&#x27;s much simpler and faster than the gel bleach.  Brush with #1 for a minute, don&#x27;t rinse, brush with #2 for a minute.  I saw a bit more whitening after three uses,  The taste is typical of dental products with peroxide but without the messy foaming of strips.  For the money you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Seems like everyone is getting free samples to try. I received one as well from Crest, but in no way was I asked to write a positive review. I honestly feel like the product worked for me. I drink a lot of coffee and after using the product my teeth looked noticeably whiter to me, but I asked my wife just to make sure. I&#x27;m not sure I will continue to regularly purchase the product because it is a bit pricey, but I will most likely purchase it every couple of months to maintain my white teeth.</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste as a free sample to try. There were things I liked about the toothpaste and things I did not like about the toothpaste. I gave it 2 stars instead of 3 because I would probably not buy it myself. The step 1 toothpaste is used to clean your teeth and remove plaque. What I did not like about it was that it tasted like you were brushing your teeth with chalk. It left a kind of dry chalky feeling in your mouth. The step 2 is supposed to whiten your teeth. What I did not like about step 2 is that it had a very &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; hotness taste like a VERY STRONG peppermint taste. When I would breath in through my mouth, it would feel so cold that it would almost hurt. This was a much stronger feeling than with any other peppermint toothpaste. The more I used it, the stronger the sensation. I feel that it made my teeth somewhat sensitive (as do many whitening products). As I could only use it for 4 days before the sensation got too strong, I did not see a noticeable difference in teeth whitening. What I loved about the product is how CLEAN it made my teeth feel!!!! WOW! It was like getting them cleaned at the dentist every day! They even felt super clean ALL DAY  LONG. Have never experienced that from a toothpaste before. I would absolutely use it just for the great clean feeling if it only did not make my teeth sensitive and have such a strong &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; burn.</li>
            <li> I was given the option to try this product free thanks to Crest. At best, I was skeptical that the system would do all it promised. Now, I LOVE this product. My teeth feel clean for the entire day. I&#x27;m even consistently brushing twice a day (in the spirit of full disclosure, I didn&#x27;t always do)! I can notice a visible difference in the whiteness of my teeth. Between the clean feeling and whitening I feel more confident and SMILE MORE! The process is a little strange--I really want to rinse in between steps! The first step makes your mouth feel a bit dry and after the second step my teeth are sensitive when I rinse (similar to whitening strips). In addition to silky smooth, white teeth, I feel  like my whole mouth feels clean. I am super conscious about morning breath and after using this system, I feel like that&#x27;s no longer an issue--brushing alone helped some, but I still didn&#x27;t always feel like my mouth felt super clean. Now, it&#x27;s a different story. My husband is already saying we are buying more when we run out!</li>
            <li> As a BzzAgent I get to try new products occasionally as part of a promotion for the brand, and this was one of the products that was sent to me. I&#x27;ve always been a Crest fan so I was excited to try the new Crest HD product. My teeth were already pretty white because of regular professional whitening treatments so I can&#x27;t really speak to the efficacy of the whitening aspect, however, overall, I enjoyed the product. The first step consists of a kind of a gritty (but gentle!) paste that scrubs away the plaque and tartar, prepping for the whitening gel which is step 2. Again, I didn&#x27;t notice a signicant whitening because of my previous shade, but I did notice that this products seems to keep my mouth feeling fresher longer than other pastes that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!  I received it as part of a promotion and I am so glad I did!  The first toothpaste leaves your teeth feelithg so clean.  I have been a bit concerned about my teeth being whiter, and the second step toothpaste works great to leave you with a shiny white smile.  It only takes two minutes and it is worth every second for the clean bright feeling my smile has after using this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving my new Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste! Not only does it give my mouth that fresh feeling for hours after brushing, it also whitens better than any other toothpaste product I&#x27;ve tried, in my opinion! The two step process is fun, and makes me feel super efficient in getting that deep clean feeling. My smile is dazzling white, after just two weeks of using the toothpaste. Thanks to Crest, I got to try the product for FREE!!</li>
            <li> At first I was very skeptical.. why do I need to brush my teeth twice? This tastes kind of funny compared to the toothpaste I am used to...&lt;br /&gt;I quickly overcame my skepticism after brushing. My mouth has never felt so clean...like dentist clean (minus the painful scraping!). I honestly didn&#x27;t think it was possible for my mouth to feel this clean just from brushing my teeth. The clean feeling (similar to the sensation of getting your braces off for the first time) lasted practically all day! And bonus points for whitening better than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried in the past! Brushing my teeth with a two-step process doesn&#x27;t take much more time than doing one step, and the results are incredible. I would definitely recommend this product! I&#x27;m trying this product for free thanks to Crest, but when I run out I&#x27;ll be sure to go to my local Target and buy more!!</li>
            <li> The results after using this product are amazing. My teeth were truly noticeably whiter after just one treatment. However, it is &amp;#34;HOTTER&amp;#34; than the hottest mouth wash ever made. I can hardly keep it in my mouth long enough to complete the treatment which is &amp;#34;ONE MINUTE&amp;#34; for each of the two tubes. I would still recommend it. The cost comparison to a professional whitening is huge.</li>
            <li> i was lucky to sample this product for free from CREST thru BuzzAgent - i love it - i like the 2 steps - my mouth feels really clean and fresh and so easy - my smile is brighter and the minty taste is refreshing. I definitely would recommend trying Crest Pro-health 2 step for a healthy alternative  to regular toothpaste</li>
            <li> I was given a box of this to try out. After only a couple of weeks my teeth are already looking whiter. I have tried strips and gels in the past, but to no avail. This stuff works and works great. It also has the great taste of Crest leaving your mouth feeling refreshed. If you&#x27;re like me and have had trouble getting white teeth, give this a try. It does work.</li>
            <li> I have been trying the Crest Pro Health® HD system for almost a week and there are no visible results yet but I won&#x27;t give up. Ill keep brushing my teeth with the two step system as it is a simple process and doesn&#x27;t take any longer than brushing your teeth with ordinary toothpaste. First you use the purifying cleanser, which basically tastes like normal toothpaste, after one minute of brushing you spit but DONT rinse, and then you start brushing with the perfecting Gel. I don&#x27;t have an issue with the two step system but the perfecting gel doesn&#x27;t taste nice at all. It has a required taste and since this is the last step that taste stays with you for a while. I git used to it now but its still not very pleasant. I will keep using Crest Pro Health® HD and hopefully the bad taste will give me results very soon. I am trying this product for free as part of a promotion thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this toothpaste. I was able to try it free thanks to Crest. In the past, I have not liked whitening treatments because of the taste and time involved. But this is different. The first step is a tarter control paste that tastes great and leaves your teeth feeling clean. The second step is a whitening and polishing paste. It has a small flavor of the typical whitening gels, but the flavor is also good. My teeth have whitened noticably and I will definitely be buying more when my free sample runs out.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I have seen results with the cleanliness and the whiteness in my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a free sample and started using this about 2 weeks ago and instantly noticed that my teeth felt cleaner. Within a few days I also noticed they were whiter! At first I felt like the 2 pastes were going to be a pain, but I feel like I can tell which part I am on based on which paste I am using - brushing with each one is such a part of my routine now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried lots of whitening products and had pretty much given up, but this one really works and is not expensive at all. I will definitely keep using it - I like it!</li>
            <li> I had tried Crest Whitestrips years ago to improve the whiteness of my teeth.  I had the opportunity to try this for free from Crest via BzzAgent, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a go.  I found this to be significantly better than the old whitestrips.  It is nowhere near as messy and doesn&#x27;t taste terrible. I used this for about a week and found my teeth a shade or so whiter / brighter.  I was also happy that I was able to use this for the full week without the tooth pain that I had previously experienced with other whitening solutions.  If you also had trouble with the whitestrips, this may be a solution for you.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Crest Pro Health HD thanks to Crest, and I absolutely love it! My teeth feel about as clean as they do after a dental cleaning. I&#x27;m extremely impressed with how much plague the toothpaste removes.With other toothpastes I&#x27;ve used, it always seemed like I still had stuff on my teeth after brushing. I don&#x27;t have that issue at all with this product. I also noticed that my teeth were whiter by the third use. I&#x27;ve never used whitening toothpaste before so I don&#x27;t really have much to compare, but I&#x27;m happier with how my teeth look. I will gladly continue to take two minutes twice a day to have such clean teeth!</li>
            <li> I got to try this toothpaste for free thanks to Crest. At first I was skeptical. Two tubes? I thought I&#x27;d have to take twice the amount of time to brush my teeth. Would it even be worth it? Well, I was wrong! I absolutely love this toothpaste! It doesn&#x27;t take any longer to brush, but it leaves my teeth feeling so much cleaner than regular toothpaste! After the first use, I could tell a difference. My teeth felt smooth and healthier. After using this for two weeks, I can see a difference in how white my teeth are, as well! This toothpaste is great!</li>
            <li> For the first time in nearly 30 years, I actually look forward to brushing my teeth with this stuff! I received it free to try from Crest, and I&#x27;m so glad- because I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d have chosen this to try on my own. It seems like the &amp;#34;whiter teeth&amp;#34; claims on toothpastes and strips are just a little out of hand, and there&#x27;s no way to tell which one is good enough for you. This stuff is awesome... My teeth look noticeably whiter (even after one day), and my mouth FEELS clean for way longer than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve used. Seriously, it rivals a dentist cleaning!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest  -- I was a little skeptical when I signed up to try the 2 part Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste for free courtesy of Crest. I&#x27;ve used a lot of toothpastes, Crest included, that claim to whiten teeth, and I&#x27;ve honestly never noticed a difference with regular usage. I drink coffee every morning and also like to drink tea, so my teeth are always in need of whitening help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was how good the toothpaste tasted. I&#x27;ve stopped using toothpastes mid-tube if I don&#x27;t like the taste, but this one actually tastes really good! I&#x27;ve also used whitening strips and applications before and the taste is always atrocious, but the purifying cleanser isn&#x27;t bad at all.  I love that it&#x27;s so easy to use with no strips or trays to put on. You just put it on your toothbrush right after using the toothpaste. Super easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I both agree that after a week of using Crest twice a day, my teeth are looking whiter. For me to notice an actual difference I know the change must be significant. I will definitely be purchasing this again when I run out!</li>
            <li> I got this package from bzzagent for free. I did not think it would work since I drink coffee and my teeth were really stained. I am happy to report that my teeth look a lot brighter thanks to this kit. I also like how the toothpaste makes my mouth feel clean. With some toothpastes my teeth still felt slimy and like there was some left over plaque.However I can feel no plaque with this new toothpaste. I am going to buy this in the future and recommend this to my friends!</li>
            <li> I have to admit, when this popped up as my first BzzAgent free sample, I was not the most enthused I&#x27;ve ever been--I typically swear by my natural toothpastes and homemade brushing powders. I do my best to put as few nasty, toxic chemicals in &amp; on my body as is reasonably possible. However, I gave this 2-step Crest ProHealth HD a try and I can honestly say this is the most effective &amp; pleasant toothpaste I think I have ever tried. My teeth feel more clean &amp; smooth than ever. And that sensation lasts for a solid 18-24 hours, through eating, drinking, candy-ing, sleeping... My mouth is so fresh and clean! And let me tell you, Crest&#x27;s claims that this product whitens your teeth noticeably &amp; quickly is NO LIE. After just ONE USE, I could see a big difference in the whiteness &amp; brightness of my teeth. I also have not had any issues with sensitivity even after normal use, unlike other whitening products I&#x27;ve tried, which have definitely caused some discomfort. I am so sold. I would recommend this to anyone! #GotItFree #BzzAgent</li>
            <li> I revived this product for free through Bzzagent. I tried this product with no high expectations. Probably the fact that the product has two parts with two different toothpaste tubes makes me think it is going to take too long to brush my teeth. I am too lazy to brush my teeth twice every time. The truth is you don&#x27;t have to brush them twice each time, you just stop half way through and use paste 2 to finish your brushing. That&#x27;s all.&lt;br /&gt;The result is amazing! In my opinion it is the closest feeling of having a professional cleaning service at your dentist office. The first part, paste #1, is like having an scrub on your teeth. It removes plaque even between your teeth. Paste #2 feels like whitening and polishing.&lt;br /&gt;Very good product. You can feel the difference since the first time and after a few days my teeth are whiter!</li>
            <li> I have recently started using this product and see the difference already. My mouth feels much cleaner, fresher and less sensitive. And my teeth are starting to look more whiter than before, The 2 step process is not time consuming and easy to follow, 2 minutes 2 times a day. The change is noticeable and my colleagues and friends have asked me what I am using for my oral hygiene. I think this year my dentist is going to see me lesser and I am planning to continue this regimen for a longer period of time to get more benefits from it. I received this free product to try and give review, Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Crest Pro-Health HD system last week from BzzAgent to review.  I found I really like this system.  Step 1 has a pleasant taste and makes my teeth feel insanely clean.  Step 2 tastes a little weird, not bad, and makes my teeth feel slick and polished, as if I had just been to the dentist.  What really blew me away is that my teeth were noticeably whiter in the first week.  I&#x27;ve never had the patience to consistently use any other whitening system.  This takes no more time than my normal routine.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for five days now and so far, so good! No tooth sensitivity at all (unlike with teeth whitening strips), and I can already tell my teeth are whiter. My mouth feels cleaner after use and I really enjoy the minty-ness of the Step 1 toothpaste. The Step 2 product isn&#x27;t bad... just like a tasteless gel. I use this with my Sonicare tooth brush and it works pretty well - both are two-minute systems!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product but the 2 step process can be annoying if you are in a rush in the mornings.  I&#x27;ve been using this product once a day for about a week and my teeth feel noticeably cleaner. They don&#x27;t look necessarily whiter, but they feel good.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free through Bzz Agent and I finally found a toothpaste that actually whitens.  I thought that doing 2 steps would bother me but it really was no big deal, though your mouth feels kind of funny and dries out with the first step.  The 2nd step gel then refreshes your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started seeing results in whiter teeth after just a few days use, and a week in my teeth feel very clean all day long.  It also looks like I am seeing a reduction in plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, the rest of my mouth doesn&#x27;t.  In fact I feel like I need to brush with regular toothpaste afterwards to get that clean feeling for my tongue and back of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I think in the long run I would use this product to get whiter teeth periodically, but switch back to a regular toothpaste for every day use</li>
            <li> I received this as a promotion for the brand and I could not be happier! Ilove this two-step process that is quick and thorough! The toothpaste for step 1 is more abrasive than normal toothpaste and creates a cleaner feeling. The polishing gel for step two is smooth and freshens your mouth even though the taste takes some getting used to. I love the results of this process!</li>
            <li> After using my free Crest Pro Health HD as part of a promotion for a week, I have mixed feelings.  I have always used Crest and I will never use another toothpaste.  In the first step, you brush with the toothpaste for a minute.  The toothpaste tastes and feels just like regular Crest Pro Health and I enjoy it very much.  It makes your breath feel very fresh and clean.  I followed the instructions and just spit and didn&#x27;t rinse.  I then used the second step, the whitening/polishing gel. I then brushed my teeth for another minute with this.  I then rinsed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package claimed that after a week of using the toothpaste twice a day, my teeth would be 6 times whiter. I took a before and after picture to see and my teeth are no whiter.  I could see how they might have been polished a little though; they do seem shinier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very excited about trying this product, but am somewhat disappointed.  I was looking forward to whiter teeth, since the whitening/polishing gel seems to be the same that is used in the whitening strips.  The whitening strips were always a pain to use, so I thought this would be more convenient.  To sum things up, I love the toothpaste, but I&#x27;m disappointed by the whitening/polishing gel.  I am going to continue using the product and see if my teeth do get eventually whiter.</li>
            <li> All I can say was I didn&#x27;t believe the hype until after the first brush. Brush my teeth with two things not one? Don&#x27;t spit and brush again? Yeah! It hasn&#x27;t quite been a week and my teeth are brighter and after every brush it is cleaner than my mouth feels leaving the dentist, without the huge bill! I got a sampling of this product free through bzzagent but I will be purchasing for myself once it runs out!</li>
            <li> I have had the Crest Whitestrips before, and the blue tube definitely tastes like those strips.  So if that makes you gag, I would not purchase this.  I had a chance to try a free sample, and I have to say, it made my teeth whiter.  A coworker of mine actually came up to me today and told me that my teeth look whiter (and I drink a lot of coffee so that is huge to me.  It definitely forces you to change your routine, as you have to brush for 1 min with the paste in the grey bottle and 1 min with the gel in the blue bottle.  I think I brush now, though, longer than I did with my regular toothpaste.  It also helps that the first tube protects your enamel, because I was worried a little bit about my enamel with the Crest Whitestrips.</li>
            <li> This Crest Pro Health HD 2-step toothpaste is awesome. I am trying this free thanks to Crest. I have been using this for a week now and can see the results. My results are awesome and my smile is great. I was skeptical at first about using two products but after the first use I was sold.</li>
            <li> I received this toothpaste to try from BzzAgent. This toothpaste is awesome! I have only been using it for a week, and I have already seen a difference in the whiteness of my teeth. It&#x27;s so much easier than whitening strips! You don&#x27;t have to change your routine, and it takes 2 minutes! Worth buying!</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for about a week and love the deep clean feel that it gives my mouth.  My teeth feel like they have been scrubbed down every time I brush. I haven&#x27;t noticed much whitening but my teeth were pretty white and stain free before I started.  The routine is simple and doesn&#x27;t take any longer then it did when it was just 1 step.  It was also surprisingly nice that Crest Pro Heath HD did not bother my usually sensitive teeth the way most regular toothpastes do.  I typically use a sensitive toothpaste formula.  I know I will continue to use this product because my teeth never felt this clean before and I can&#x27;t imagine going back to that ordinary clean after having my mouth feel this good.  I did receive this product free from BzzAgent to use and review but my opinions are very much my own.</li>
            <li> Love this its super easy to use kept my teeth feeling clean all day its also made my teeth whiter.</li>
            <li> I have tried other teeth whitening toothpastes in the past so I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much from Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Process when I received it from Crest to try for free. I had actually just made an appointment with my dentist to have my teeth professionally whitened when I received it. I had enough time to try this toothpaste out for a couple weeks first. I didn&#x27;t notice any immediate difference in the whiteness of my teeth after the first use. However, four hours later after I had eaten lunch I did a quick glance in the mirror to make sure I didn&#x27;t have any food stuck in my teeth. I literally did a double-take. I definitely noticed that my teeth were whiter. I was so surprised and completely distracted throughout the remainder of the afternoon, I had to keep sneaking in a quick glance in the mirror to believe it. I&#x27;ve continued to use this product daily and the results have exceeded my expectations. My teeth feel really smooth and my mouth feels much healthier after using it. I kept my dentist appointment and the hygienist even noticed my whiter teeth and asked if I had bleached them. I hadn&#x27;t. I had only used this product. I received everything I needed from the dentist to professionally whiten my teeth at home but I must say I have not even started doing that yet because I&#x27;m curious to see how far this two step product will take me. I expect that this toothpaste will extend the results of professional whitening. I personally think this product is well every penny. I would pay up to $20 for it, Crest often has coupons in the Sunday paper that can be combined with my local pharmacy sales. This says a lot because before this product I had been a stickler for paying less than $2.00 a tube since I felt they were all the same. I&#x27;m also not at all inconvenienced by the amount of time it takes to use this product as it does not need any more time than we should already be giving when brushing our teeth. For me, the results are superior to the rest and I am hooked!am hooked!</li>
            <li> Wow, Crest Pro Health HD is the best at-home whitening I have ever used. No more messy strips or trays. You have to brush your teeth anyway, so why not whiten at the same time! After using both of these, my teeth feel like they have had a professional cleaning. I will continue to buy this kit and never be without it, it&#x27;s made a huge difference in my smile!</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health HD has made my breath fresher and my teeth whiter and brighter!  I&#x27;m trying it free thanks to Crest and I&#x27;ve been really impressed with it.  It takes about 2 minutes for the entire process and it does what it says it does.  I&#x27;m liking my fresher mouth and that is whiter and brighter!</li>
            <li> I received this as a promotional item from Crest.  I&#x27;ve never been a fan of whitening strips because I have sensitive teeth and gums and, well, that bleach hurts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trial started out great.  I could see the difference the first few days, and was really excited.  Then, reality set in.  I have weak teeth to begin with, and this process was not a good choice.  While the base of my teeth got whiter and whiter, the ends turned almost translucent, which was not a good look.  So, I can&#x27;t say my experience was the best.</li>
            <li> I consider myself somewhat of a toothpaste snob, and this stuff has me converted. I was lucky enough to get to try this for free through bzzagent. From the first time I used it I noticed a big difference. My teeth immediately felt so smooth and looked whiter. I have used other whitening products before and they all require you to put aside a good amount of time to use them, and they leave your teeth feeling so sensitive. You just have to add this to your normal brushing routine, and I have experienced NO sensitivitely, and I feel like the results are more immediate</li>
            <li> I received a promotional sample of Crest Pro Health HD as part of a Bzzagent campaign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happened to receive my Crest Pro Health HD around the time I had a dentist appointment scheduled, so I used the product for about a week before and a week after my visit.  In the week before my dentist visit, I definitely noticed the product gave my teeth more polish, similar to how they looked after a dentist visit - not 100% of the polish of a dentist cleaning, but maybe 50%.  I also noticed after my dentist visit that the whiteness and polish on my teeth has lasted much longer than it typically has in the past.  So that&#x27;s been encouraging - I drink a lot of tea and I hope the product will keep my \\&quot;just from the dentist\\&quot; polish until my next visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would note two other things:&lt;br /&gt;1) As opposed to my regular toothpaste, I felt the Crest Pro Health® HD didn&#x27;t give me as much of \\&quot;fresh in the mouth feel.\\&quot; My breath was fine (as confirmed by my wife) and seemed fine throughout the day, but I got less of a feel after I brushed my teeth of like breathing in a minty cloud.&lt;br /&gt;2) There is a noticeable astringent effect from the toothpaste - I have noticed this with other Crest products as well.  Not a bad thing necessarily, but worth noting.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get this product for free, but rather I bought it after the raving reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1: I did go to the dentist today so I figured I have a clean slate to start this journey on. I don&#x27;t have the whitest teeth due to high fluoride exposure as a child. After the first brushing, my teeth felt great even though I just went to the dentist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More updates to come!</li>
            <li> I received the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste for free from BzzAgent to try and review. Before trying this product I already had a high opinion of Crest as that is my toothpaste of choice.  I could tell a difference in my teeth after using this for approximately 3 days. My teeth looked whiter and I loved the fresh clean feeling.  The two step process is easy! At first I was even unsure that 1 minute for each step was enough as I usually brush my teeth longer than that. After following the direction accordingly my teeth feel clean and my breath feels fresh. I do see a difference in the whiteness of my teeth as well. And even though no one has complimented my white teeth I feel more confident in my smile and my teeth. I drink coffee everyday so this is a great way for me to feel like my teeth can still be white despite the coffee.  Others have commented on the price of the toothpaste. It is high compared to toothpaste alone but compared to other whitening systems the price is quite comparable.  It&#x27;s also much less expensive than professional whitening at the dentist.  The one other thing I would like to note is the taste of the toothpaste.  After brushing it leaves a little bit of what I call an after taste that is different. It&#x27;s not bad, just different. And after using this toothpaste for a few days I found that I easily adjusted to the taste and didn&#x27;t notice it any more.  I also have a little but of sensitivity in my teeth but found this system didn&#x27;t hurt or cause me any discomfort at all while using.  Some of the whitening strips have caused a bit of discomfort for me in the past but this was not so with the Crest Pro Health HD. Overall this is a great system for whitening and cleaning in the comfort of your own home.</li>
            <li> I was definitely interested in trying Pro Health® HD(tm) being a regular coffee drinker, so I was happy to get a sample of the product as part of a promotion from Crest.  Other whitening toothpastes have not yielded any noticeable results and I am not willing to invest the time or cost of whitening strips.  So over a week into trying this \\&quot;breakthrough\\&quot; toothpaste I certainly can attest to a clean feeling after the 2-step brushing.  The Stannous Fluoride in Step 1 has a bit of a gritty texture but it seems to get the job done.  As for the whitening properties of Step 2, well I frankly haven&#x27;t seen the results yet at one week.  However, that is not deterring me from continuing to use 2x a day for another few weeks to see if there is a noticeable improvement longer-term.</li>
            <li> Whiter teeth after first use. The step 1 paste has a good minty flavor... step 2 is not as tasty but definitely gets the job done. My whole mouth feels clean after brushing with this. Thanks to bzzagent.com I got to try this item for free.</li>
            <li> I got this product as a sample from Crest through BzzAgent.  Let me just say I was pretty skeptical at first.  Having to use 2 different tubes in one teeth brushing seemed like it might be a hassle.  I&#x27;ll tell you what!  It is worth the hassle.  My teeth have never felt cleaner and they are whiter each day.  Love this!  It will be my only toothpaste from now on.</li>
            <li> Thank you Crest &amp; BzzAgent for allowing me to try this toothpaste. I am an avid coffee and tea drinker and I always get negative feedback from my dentist on how badly my teeth are getting stained. I am so happy this arrived on my doorstep to try! This 2 step daily toothpaste leaves a fresh clean straight from the dentist feeling after using it. Plus I was able to notice a difference in just a couple of days! I recommend this to everyone to try especially any other fellow coffee drinkers. Surprise your dentist at your next routine appointment!</li>
            <li> I got for free a sample of Crest Pro Health® HD™. I already switched to it. The presentation is great. It is very simple to use. Just 2 minutes and you will get a super fresh breath and whiter smile. No doubt will result in a healthy mouth.&lt;br /&gt;#buzzahent #goitfree</li>
            <li> I have to admit I didn&#x27;t think a whitening toothpaste would make my teeth whiter, healthier and NOT make them more sensitive.  I WAS WRONG!  I received this for free and Crest Pro-health HD is the best toothpaste I have ever tried.  This two-step process also makes you aware of how long you brush your teeth so 2 minutes in the morning and 2 minutes at night makes your teeth and mouth feel refreshingly brighter and healthier.</li>
            <li> I was very interested in trying this two-step toothpaste when I got a free sample. I was curious to see how brushing for two minutes with two different pastes could be more effective than brushing for two minutes with my regular paste, but I was amazed by the difference! After using in the first time, my teeth felt as clean as if I had just left the dentist! And, I was shocked when they still felt that clean 12 hours later when I was ready to brush again! My teeth feel like they have just been polished, and after 1 week, they look so much brighter!&lt;br /&gt;The only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that this paste made my teeth very sensitive. My teeth tend to be on the sensitive side, and the whitening agent seemed to make this worse. I started using the paste only in the morning and using my regular paste at night and this seemed to solve the problem. I will for sure keep using this paste!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample to try from Smiley360 and I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks.  At first I was skeptical about what benefits the two step system would offer, but after just the first use I realized the second step was worth it.  After just a week, I noticed a visibly whiter smile.  My teeth as clean as if I just got back from the dentist.  It really doesn&#x27;t even phase me that there are two steps because they&#x27;re so easy to do.  It&#x27;s just brushing and polishing and you&#x27;re done.  Your teeth are cleaner, whiter and you don&#x27;t have to shell out so much money for white strips!</li>
            <li> Before I used this product, I really didn&#x27;t believe it would do what it claims - and more. But it does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have quite severe periodontal disease, my dentist had been recommending both Crest Pro Health toothpaste and mouthwash, which I&#x27;ve been using religiously for nearly a year now. But even then, although my periodontal problems have not gotten worse, my gums continued bleed when I brushed my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What has been most annoying however is that the mouthwash causes teeth yellowing - and I haven&#x27;t had the patience for white strips which I tried briefly without much success. So when I discovered this 2 step Crest Pro Health HD process that includes whitening/polishing, I was very happy to try it - and even happier to discover immediate results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works!  First, the instructions to brush using each tube for one minute means I&#x27;m spending two minutes at a time on my teeth twice a day, rather than the one  minute that I too hastily have been doing. So that undoubtedly helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what most pleases me is that the whitening effect is immediate. I thought I was imagining it when I noticed it at the end of the first day I did this treatment, but it&#x27;s for real. Now that I&#x27;ve been doing both for two weeks, my teeth are whiter than they are after my four times a year cleanings at the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An added big plus, my gums have stopped bleeding when I brush them. Since the Crest Pro-Health toothpaste included here has the same ingredients and strength of regular Crest Pro-Health toothpaste, maybe the whitening gel also helps with the gums. Given the cost of this treatment, certainly more than half of what you&#x27;re paying for is the gel, which as far as I can tell, is not sold alone - and is better than any other whitening treatment I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can afford the cost (which is considerably less than a dental cleaning), I believe that this is the best home treatment available both for real cleaning and for whitening. It even tastes clean and pleasant - the gel has barely any taste at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for those of you who also have periodontal disease, using this treatment according to instructions (and flossing) is likely to  be very therapeutic for your gums as well. GREAT product! Five stars plus.whitening.

            <li> I was very excited to try this. I have use a whitening system before and it was not that good, but this new Crest Pro-Heath HD whitening toothpaste and gel was very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;It preformed as expected. Step 1 made my teeth feel cleaner, Step 2 did make my teeth whiter. After using this product for a week now I do notice a considerable difference. I can tell you it does feel like you just got your teeth cleaned by a dentist. Step one I had to get used to. You can spit but do not rinse, I had to stop myself with the rinse part and go straight to part two. The second part was more of a whiting gel but made my teeth feel cleaner and whiter after I was done. I agree It is a little more expensive than regular toothpaste with whitener, but the results are amazing. I will be using this product again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this as a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Crest Pro Health HD as part of a promotion from Crest little over a week ago and I am loving the results.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of a traditional toothpaste, this is 2-part product.  You brush for 1 minute with the step 1 purifying cleanser, spit, and brush for 1 more minute with the step 2 purifying gel.  Basically step 1 contains fluoride and some polishing agents and step 2 is a hydrogen peroxide whitener an anti-tartar ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mouth feels fresh and clean much longer than with any other toothpaste I have used before.  I will say that the 2-step process has taken some getting used to and feels like it takes longer than using a traditional toothpaste, but it really isn&#x27;t a big deal once you adapt to it.  I have also noticed a distinct &#x27;saccharine&#x27; taste to the Step 1 gel - not too bad, just definitely sweeter than any other product i have used (I checked the label when writing this review and I was correct, saccharine is an ingredient).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I am (perhaps more than slightly) neurotic about using new products on/in my body, I did a little bit of research before trying this out.  Crest Pro Health HD is formulated with stannous fluoride instead of the traditional sodium fluoride.  Stannous fluoride has been around and approved by the FDA for quite a long time.  It is actually more effective than sodium fluoride because not only does it strengthen teeth, it is also antimicrobial! On top of that, stannous fluoride can also help to address tooth sensitivity issues. So why hasn&#x27;t it been used before?  It turns out that 1) stannous fluoride is hard to formulate into a stable toothpaste, 2) it can cause removable tooth staining (and maybe other reasons that aren&#x27;t apparent to me).  It seems like crest has solved these problems to bring Crest Pro Health HD to market.</li>
            <li> I received the new crest health pro hd to review for free,  the opinions after 2 weeks are my own.&lt;br /&gt;The crest pro health hd package comes with 2 tubes.  The first toothpaste is  to clean teeth, gums, add fluoride, reduces plaque and reduces gingivitis.  This tooth paste you are to use 2 times a day for 1 minute.  then you do not rinse your teeth and move onto using the second paste in the kit.  this second paste with the polishing toothpaste. You then use the polishing tooth paste on your teeth for one minute.  Rinse week.  this routine you complete 2 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;the first week i used the toothpaste I did notice a slight difference in the color of my teeth.  I am a regular coffee and tea drinker so i was hoping to lesson the effects of those drinks.  After week 2 i noticed a bigger difference.  so the kit does seem to work as advertised.  My teeth are whiter, smoother and seem  to be overall healthier.&lt;br /&gt;However the one major drawback for me is the polish taste.  It is VERY VEERY hydrogen peroxide tasting.  At this point i am somewhat getting accustomed to it but It takes a lot of vigorous rinsing to remove the after taste.  perhaps some sort of Crest rinse might help this.  Secondly i do notice that the smooth clean feeling of my teeth begins to fade about 1/2 way through the day.&lt;br /&gt;Over all i rate this system a 3 instead of a 4 because to the flavor of the polishing and the not lasting all day long.  However it does live up to whitening and cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li> I am a BzzAgent and received this product for free as part of a BzzCampaign. I&#x27;ve used Crest Whitestrips in the past and it has been a couple of months since I last used them. That said, I wasn&#x27;t expecting to see any more of a change in the whiteness of my teeth...but I was wrong! Crest Pro Health HD successfully made them at least two shades whiter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the products (two steps; one minute per step) 13 days ago. Since I brush for at least two minutes, twice per day, the process didn&#x27;t phase me at all. However, the &#x27;not rinsing&#x27; between steps one and two was hard for me to remember in the beginning - especially when I was really tired. The first time I used the products, I noticed that my teeth felt gritty after step one, and then smooth again after step two. My mouth was definitely blown away by the power of the polish and it actually burned a bit (a minty burn)...but only for a few seconds. I&#x27;m used to the sensation now but I do feel I can back down to using the two-step process once per day since the &#x27;regular&#x27; toothpaste I use is Crest Whitening with Baking Soda &amp; Peroxide (Fresh Mint). Overall this is a great product and I highly recommend using it!</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. After using it for a little over 2 weeks, my teeth and mouth feel and look fabulous. It takes 2 steps and 2 minutes to get to whiter, brighter and a healthier mouth. My everyday routine is not affected and I&#x27;ve received a ton of compliments. Definitely recommend purchasing this product!</li>
            <li> I tried this product for one week and I noticed a sparkling smile and also a cleaner mouth.  My teeth was a nice shiny shade of white and not dull beige,  I noticed that all the mouth seemed cleaner and fresher when I swung my tongue around.</li>
            <li> I received Crest HD Toothpaste free from BzzAgent and I have been using it for 3 weeks. I only brush my teeth in the morning, so this 2-step system feels very lengthy! In the mornings, I am in a rush so spending 1 minute on each step feels like forever. The first step has a very grimy texture and makes my mouth feel like cotton. The second step is a watery gel and tastes awful! I have to count the seconds before I can spit it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I haven&#x27;t noticed a dramatic change in the color of my teeth. It does make my mouth feel clean and fresh afterward, though. I would recommend this product to anyone willing to sacrifice time and taste for a more powerful brushing session.</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the Crest. This is one of the best tooth paste&#x27;s I have tried. You brush for a minute with the paste, spit, brush another minute with the gel, rinse. That&#x27;s it. It leaves your mouth with a dentist-esque clean. I use an Oral B powered tooth brush together with this system. It has made brushing actually a nice activity and not a chore knowing the results will be a cleaner brighter smile.  I would recommend this system if you are looking for a change in your toothpaste. The flavor is a mild mint and the gel has minimal flavor but the end result is a very clean brush. Unfortunately, I have not seen the results of the claims of 6x whiter but I will continue to use to see if the claims are real. My teeth are clean though!</li>
            <li> BzzzAgent.  I received my Crest Pro Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste and absolutely love it.  The most remarkable thing I noticed was that my teeth felt much cleaner use this toothpaste compared to another toothpaste.  My teeth feel like I just left the dentist office.  My husband is also using the toothpaste and I see a vast difference in the whiteness of his teeth too.</li>
            <li> I love this system.  It makes your mouth feel amazingly fresh and the whitening agent is incredible.  It&#x27;s so easy to use, too.</li>
            <li> This product was reviewed for Bzzagent in which I received the product free to try/review. I was very nervous at first to try Crest Pro Health HD because previously I had used the Pro Health mouth rinse and it stained my teeth. I had to go to the dentist and have them clean my teeth to get the stains off. This product comes with two tubes, one is the toothpaste which contains stannous (tin) fluoride and  requires a warning label that it may stain teeth. So I was very nervous that it would stain my teeth. However, the toothpaste did not stain my teeth! I used the  toothpaste followed by the whitening gel, twice a day and my teeth were noticeable whiter after 3 days (although I continues using it for 2 weeks). It took at least 3 minutes to do the two step process in the morning and at night and I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how much whitening gel to use. Since the Crest white strips have to be on your teeth for ~30 minutes, I wasn&#x27;t sure this would work considering you rinse after about 2-3 minutes but it did work. I still feel that there is some yellow on my teeth near the gum line overall my teeth are whiter. I did notice some sensitivity on my teeth after 3 days, so I cut back to using it once a day and the sensitivity went away. I also used both an power toothbrush and a manual one and both worked well. Overall, this was easier to use than strips and saved time with good results.</li>
            <li> I received a Crest Pro-Health HD kit free from BzzAgent for review.  This is a two-step process that takes slightly longer than your old fashioned brushing routine...but it&#x27;s worth the extra effort.  The texture, especially Step 2, is different than normal toothpaste, but in a good way.  I noticed after the first use that my teeth felt cleaner...very smooth. Just like after a trip to the dentist for cleaning.  After about a week, I do think my teeth are whiter. I wish there was some kind of strip included to judge the difference.  Not only that, but this product did not affect the sensitivity of my teeth like other whitening toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  I will definitely purchase this.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and it&#x27;s legit</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health HD is my favorite, new #HealthyObsession!!!  I have been trying it free from Crest through their new BzzAgent Campaign  Not only am I so happy with my results after just a few weeks of uses... so is my dentist!  He noticed a big difference in my smile and so have my friends and family - I couldn&#x27;t wait to tell them about Crest Pro Health HD.  I let them know that not only is this amazing toothpaste easy to use, and helping to keep my teeth clean and healthy... my teeth are brighter and whiter than ever after just one week!  My teeth feel healthy and strong, unlike all of the other whitening products and pastes that I have tried over the years.  I have also bid a fond farewell to morning breath - Crest Pro Health HD does it all!!  Definitely a must try that I highly recommend and will continue to use for a long time - a true two in one product!!  Thank you to Crest for brightening up my smile on a daily basis!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Bzzagent and Crest, I was able to try this product!  I can&#x27;t believe how clean my teeth feel!!!!  It&#x27;s absolutely incredible how clean they feel, but I am a little worried about the whitening portion.  I have sensitive teeth, so I wish there was a way to whiten that didn&#x27;t hurt this!  Either way, it&#x27;s a great product that I would definitely recommend.  It works and it is MUCH easier than the whitening strips and mouth wash!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest Pro Health HD as part of a promotion sponsored by Crest.  I&#x27;ve been doing the 2-step routine twice a day for the past week, and my teeth look and feel as good as they did after my last dentist cleaning.  The 2 steps take no longer than my normal brushing routine, but definitely feels like I gave my mouth a minty power-wash.  As a tax CPA, I drink more than my fair share of coffee at work.  Using Crest Pro Health HD daily removes the surface stains and keeps my smile bright.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loooooove it!!  At first I really didn&#x27;t think it would make a difference considering I&#x27;m a coffee drinker and I smoke (I know horrid habit).  After the first two or three day I knew I loved the minty taste of it but wasn&#x27;t really feeling like my teeth were clean; but after about a week of using Crest Pro-Health HD twice a day I saw a huge difference.  My whole mouth just felt cleaner, fresher.  And oh my goodness, my teeth are seriously whiter.  Coffee stains GONE!  Morning breath GONE!  Even that white filmy gunk that forms on your tongue has diminished.  I actually got my Crest Pro Health HD free through a BzzAgent Campaign, but I&#x27;m seriously thinking this is my family&#x27;s new toothpaste regimen! :D</li>
            <li> Must buy toothpaste!!! You will notice the difference from day one. A brighter smile, cleaner teeth and fresher breath! It&#x27;s also way to easy to use. A 2 step process that takes less than 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> Whoa!  My sister highly recommended this to me.  I was skeptical and didn&#x27;t want to pay the $, so she brought me some on her visit.  I&#x27;ve been using it once/day (at night) for the past week and a half and now know why she was advocating for it so much!  My teeth are as white as the snow outside, which is great given that my skin is already so pale, it&#x27;s really impressive if my teeth are whiter than my skin (according to my dentist uncle.  Thanks?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like Whitestrips a lot and will probably alternate between the two - maybe this two times/year and whitestrips two times/year.  On a regular basis, I use a plain Crest toothpaste in the morning and 3D White toothpaste at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- HV</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest HD for about 2 weeks now. It definitely leaves a clean, just from the dentist office feel and my teeth are whiter and brighter! I am a BzzAgent and got the product for free -- thanks Crest and BzzAgent!  I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I hate brushing my teeth, it&#x27;s such a chore - my dental hygienist can attest to that. BUT... the new Crest HD 2-step definitely gave me a new healthy habit. And that&#x27;s because I have results I can actually see. I saw the first day I tried it. 9 days later, I&#x27;m loving it! My yellow teeth are not so yellow and now, I look forward to brushing! I tried the crest strips, thinking that wouldn&#x27;t be so much hassle than whitening trays. But I hated sitting around for 20 minutes. Now, it&#x27;s 2 minutes total and my mouth feels so fresh! I actually can&#x27;t wait to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> I got this product as part of a promotion from Crest and here are my thoughts on it:&lt;br /&gt;I brush my teeth twice or three times daily; sometimes because of my schedule I can&#x27;t brush during lunch where I&#x27;m at the office. According to my dentist my teeth are in good shape and they are marble white; however I wanted to try this product in order to make them whiter as advertise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product:&lt;br /&gt;Package is very nice and futuristic, the colors of the tubes are silver and blue respectively and advertise that I would feel a difference after a week usage and that my teeth would be whiter since the two processes brushing is intend to isolate ingredients for better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I want to know before I get this product? If in fact my teeth would be whiter and if it was worth the time for the two times brushing steps; therefore I will be paying more for a better product than the one I use daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage &amp; Details:&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to write a report after the first day; therefore I waited more than a week in order to write my comments to see if in fact there are any changes.&lt;br /&gt;During 8 days I ate different types of foods that included: Meat (read &amp; white), vegetables, fruits, grains, dairy &amp; coffee. For beverage it was water and red wine. No sweets since I don&#x27;t like sugar that much. I&#x27;m giving details of my diet so you can understand my report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;In fact it feels better after doing the two steps, mouth feels fresher and gives the protection to your teeth that regular toothpaste gives you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I really didn&#x27;t see any changes on the color of my teeth. On the first day using the product I mentioned to my brothers and sister since they don&#x27;t see me daily and after a week I wanted to know if they had noticed any changes which they didn&#x27;t confirming what I had noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Partial Conclusion (Personal Experience):&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using this product until it finish it where I will be writing my second report and giving my final conclusion. I want to see if is worth taking the extra time for the two steps brushing and the price, as of right now I will give the product a three....to be continuereport and giving my final conclusion. I want to see if is worth taking the extra time for the two steps brushing and the price, as of right now I will give the product a three....to be continue</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m undecided about Crest&#x27;s Pro-Health HD Two-Step toothpaste. It&#x27;s minty, it seems to at least cover the basics of giving you clean teeth, but so are regular toothpastes so why this one? It claims to do a better job at cleaning plaque, fighting cavities and gingivitis, and whitening teeth. There I can&#x27;t say it does or doesn&#x27;t, as even the product description says regular toothpaste does that too. Where it is supposed to differ is that it is supposed to reduce existing gingivitis and whiten more over three weeks. That remains to be seen, but I also just started using it so time will tell. It does add a certain degree of ritual to your routine if you typically brush and go in the rush to get to work as you&#x27;re supposed to brush for one minute with one paste then brush for another minute with the other before rinsing. This can&#x27;t be a bad thing as brushing longer is probably better for you, but not so great if you&#x27;re running late. Keep in mind I know I should floss, but I generally don&#x27;t because I find the process tedious and I&#x27;m short on time in the morning. Also consider that if you&#x27;re traveling you now have two bottles to carry with you and they&#x27;re not travel sized. Not a big deal, but something to think about if you&#x27;re tight on packing space or trying to reduce clutter. There is nothing truly negative I can say about this toothpaste duo. It&#x27;s making me be more deliberate about my brushing and if I notice (or more importantly my dentist notices) reduced gingivitis and brighter teeth, then the rating slips up to five stars.</li>
            <li> So far I am in love. It feels as if I have just left the dentist. I just started using it and will update with a before and after pic soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this as a free trial from Crest</li>
            <li> In complete transparency, I am trying this product for free thanks to Crest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives: Overall it definitely works and does what it says. I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth are cleaner and whiter. That fuzzy teeth feeling that can emerge as the day goes on takes longer to happen when I&#x27;m using HD. Using this two step product is fairly easy. It takes the same amount of time as just regular toothpaste (2 mins), but I have to admit I&#x27;m finding my desire to rinse in between steps hard to break. The taste is good and I like the foaminess of step one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downsides: My gums might be sensitive, but I feel like the product is a bit harsh. After using it my gums have been sensitive. The only other complaint that I have is that it&#x27;s unclear if this is a product that you use forever, or if you only use it when you need it. Seems pricey for something you&#x27;d use indefinitely.</li>
            <li> I was among some of the lucky to receive this complimentary during a promotion. I&#x27;m just here now to rate it and share my experiences.  I have done a few teeth whitening regimens and this one was by far the most easy and convenient.  There were no strips to use and not mess.  I am always prepared for a not so great taste with teeth whitening programs and toothpaste but this was quite pleasant.  I would definitely  recommend this is you are looking for something easy to use and effective.  I really started to notice results after the first week of use.  I will be purchasing this in a few days when my tube runs out.</li>
            <li> After the first use of Crest Pro Health HD, I could detect no difference on my &amp;#34;senior&amp;#34; teeth. I brush using a SoniCare electric toothbrush so my teeth always have a very smooth and clean feeling after brushing. I utilized a tooth color chart to track whitening improvement. There was no discernible difference on a day-to-day basis, but after approximately two weeks my teeth were one shade lighter when referencing the chart. No dramatic results for me, but minimal objective whitening was achieved. (My teeth are not extremely discolored and naturally towards the whiter end of the chart.)&lt;br /&gt;  I decided to try having my adult child try the Crest Pro Health HD.  His teeth have much more yellowing. I discovered a big difference between use of Crest Pro Health HD on my &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; teeth and my adult child&#x27;s &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34; teeth when it came to whitening. After just 3-4 uses, his teeth were noticeably whiter. He too uses a SonicCare toothbrush, and reported no difference in the feeling of cleanliness.&lt;br /&gt;  For both of us, there was no discernible difference in &amp;#34;morning breath&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;  The product is very easy to use, and the flavor is mild and pleasant. After the first use, it was easy to remember only to &amp;#34;spit&amp;#34; and not rinse between part 1 and part 2.&lt;br /&gt;  Based on the results of the 21 year old&#x27;s experience, I can highly recommend this new product. Based upon the results on my 60 year old teeth, I can find no fault with the product but saw only minimal whitening. I personally would elect to continue using Crest Pro Health HD to see if over the long term I could get more improvement regarding whitening.&lt;br /&gt;  Overall, Crest Pro Health HD is a product I can recommend to others. It is easy to use, has simple and clear directions, is well labeled and the products are very easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;Both tubes stand upright and steady on the bathroom vanity, with not only good sized and easy to read labeling but with an obvious difference between the two containers so likelihood of mixing up the steps is highly unlikely.&lt;br /&gt;  (I received Crest Pro Health HD as a promotion for Bzz agents.)en the two containers so likelihood of mixing up the steps is highly unlikely.&lt;br /&gt;  (I received Crest Pro Health HD as a promotion for Bzz agents.)</li>
            <li> Another reviewer wrote that this system gives you a &amp;#34;dentist clean feeling&amp;#34; and I completely agree. Crest provided me with this system to test it out, and although I&#x27;ve been a fan of their whitening strips, I wasn&#x27;t sure this system could get me to give up my beloved baking soda/peroxide toothpaste. I used Crest as a kid and quite frankly as soon as I was old enough to choose my own toothpaste I abandoned it for sexier dental care (sorry Mom!). This is not old Crest by any means. In addition to cavity-fighting fluoride, the toothpaste contains some sort of abrasive which does not damage teeth but gets them super clean, nice and smooth and very shiny. The whitening gel is typical of most gels of its type--but used in combination with the toothpaste it worked quickly to brighten and whiten my smile.</li>
            <li> Wow! As I sit down to write this review, I am smiling from ear to ear. Thanks to Crest for giving me the opportunity to try this product for free! Creat Pro Health HD is truly amazing. From the first time using the easy two-step process, my mouth felt so clean and fresh. Some toothpastes aren&#x27;t the best tasting, but I love the mint flavor. No morning, afternoon, or evening breath here. My favorite thing is how clean and healthy my teeth feel after cleaning them with Crest Pro Health HD. I met a friend for lunch today who commented how white my teeth looked as well. Who doesn&#x27;t love a great compliment? And this is only after using this product for seven days. She asked what I was using and said she will be adding it to her shopping list. I will not only continue to use Crest Pro Health HD myself, but I have already spread the good word to my husband and he&#x27;s excited to have the fresh, clean, healthy experience too. Crest Pro Health HD gives me even more reasons to smile - and often!</li>
            <li> I got a sample of Crest Pro-Health HD for free as a bzzagent and I gave it a try.  Crest is my regular brand but I love the cinnamon flavor the best so I wasn&#x27;t too sure I would like the Crest Pro-Health since it&#x27;s a mint flavored experience.  It&#x27;s also a two step process and I rush as it is in the am.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the 2 step process, while adding a little bit of time, made a huge difference in how my teeth felt.  Super Clean, no plague, even after overnight, and the taste is really, really refreshing.  I never would have guessed it, but after years with the same toothpaste I&#x27;m switching over to Crest Pro-Heath HD.  It&#x27;s that much better.  You gotta see for yourself!</li>
            <li> I think this toothpaste works, although my teeth are not heavily stained and I’m not a coffee or tea drinker nor do I smoke, I did notice improvement in the light discoloration I do have after just a short period of time. My smile is whiter after only a week but it was not without a cost. I experienced sensitivity, my gums were very tender and I noticed small abrasions on them with a little bit of bleeding. Even though Crest Pro-health HD seemed to give me a brighter smile a result which I am happy about. I didn’t enjoy a clean refreshing feeling in my mouth after brushing. Instead I noticed an unpleasant peroxide flavored aftertaste. The 2 step process isn’t a hassle but I do wish it were just one step. I did get this product as a free trial from Crest but I’m not sure that I would purchase this toothpaste going forward, when I consider all the concerns I described above along with the high price I just may pass.&lt;br /&gt;Your experience may be different so give it a try!</li>
            <li> I was given an opportunity to try this free through BzzzAgent, and I have to say, it was great! I&#x27;m not sure I would have spent the money on the kit, but after trying it, it&#x27;s a no brainer...&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the good and meh:&lt;br /&gt;Good:&lt;br /&gt;Great clean mouthfeel after using&lt;br /&gt;Good taste&lt;br /&gt;Great smell&lt;br /&gt;Easy application in comparison to whitening strips or gel trays (I&#x27;ve used both)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparable results to gel trays and whitening strips after 2 weeks of use&lt;br /&gt;Okay,  now the meh:&lt;br /&gt;I experienced some tooth sensitivity to hot and cold the first week of use&lt;br /&gt;It takes 1 minute longer than &amp;#34;normal brushing&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Results are not immediate as with gel trays, it took me a week to see results...&lt;br /&gt;All in, their product simplifies the tooth whitening process. When you have very little time for yourself due to work, kids and other obligations, this is a great way to pamper yourself! I will be using it!</li>
            <li> Got this product from Crest to try.  Got to say, I did feel like my teeth got cleaner and fresher as a result.  But dang were my teeth sensitive as a result.  I don&#x27;t normally have an issue with sensitivity but this tooth paste definitely gave me issues.  I will keep using it for sure but be aware if you already have issues with sensitive teeth this may not be the toothpaste for you.  But dang it works.</li>
            <li> Crest allowed me to try this product for free.  The Crest Pro Health HD products initially seem to work very well.  Upon using as directed, my mouth felt like it just came from a polishing at the dentist&#x27;s office.  This is almost scary to think about using twice a day every day because of how well the abrasive qualities seem to work.  This being said, following the directions (brush, don&#x27;t rinse, add other product and brush, rinse) would seem to be key.  It will be interesting to monitor if there are any whiteness benefits to my permanently stained teeth, but if so, I will also have mixed feelings of happiness and worry about the product being too good to be true, without some sort of negative effect.</li>
            <li> I received the crest pro-health HD two-step toothpaste kit for free through BzzAgent.  Having been a longtime user of Crest products and whitening strips I was very excited to try this product.  I expected it would be good but I was BLOWN AWAY!  This is more than toothpaste.  It made my teeth as smooth as the day my braces were removed.  I felt like I had just been to the dentist.  Seriously.  And my teeth felt clean all day long.  I have never found a toothpaste that even compares.  And, after using this for a week my teeth are definitely whiter.  I hate using the white strips because I find them messy and inconvenient.  I don&#x27;t mind using the two steps at all (and I&#x27;m a busy working mom of two young kids!)  I have been raving about this product to everyone.  I even bought it and brought it to my dad for him to try because I knew how impressed he would be with this.  I don&#x27;t care that it&#x27;s more expensive than regular toothpaste.  It&#x27;s 100% worth it!  I have never felt as passionately about a new product ever!</li>
            <li> AWESOME product.  I recently was able to try this product through BZZ AGent.  I was hesistant at first because in the past, whitening toothpastes have made my teeth very sensitive and my gums hurt.  This product though is WOW!!!  I was able to tell a difference in the first week.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how my teeth look when I finish the tubes.  Well worth the money.  You should buy this today</li>
            <li> I used Crest Pro Health HD for a week. I usually brush once a day for about 30 seconds, using an Oral B electric toothbrush. I thought brushing for 2 minutes in the morning and evening would take too much time, but I found I could do little things while brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a few days I noticed my teeth felt very smooth and looked cleaner. The clean feel lasted a long time. After a week I took the after photo (on the left). My teeth are slightly whiter. It&#x27;s not a huge difference, but a lot easier than using strips. Both steps also taste good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free full-size sample from Crest via BzzAgent. I would buy this product.</li>
            <li> This is the first 2 step dental care that I have ever used, so was not exactly sure what to expect. I have to say that I greatly enjoy this Crest Pro - Health product and love the results! After the first use, I noticed a much cleaner and smoother feel to my teeth and fresher feel to my mouth. I was incredibly pleased. After a couple weeks of continuous use, I also noticed a brighter and shinier appearance to my teeth. Being a coffee drinker, this was a great feeling! I highly recommend this 2 step system and am incredibly pleased to have discovered it and incorporated it into my daily health care.</li>
            <li> i received this system for free from Smiley 360.  i am hooked on this system.  it is soo easy to use.  brush your teeth with the cleaning toothpaste for 1 minute, do not rinse, then polish your teeth with step # 2, and rinse.  it leaves my teeth feeling soo smooth and clean.  my teeth are shinier and whiter and i do not see or feel the tartar and plaque i used to feel on my teeth.  my breath is fresher and my mouth feels healthier.</li>
            <li> The taste was pretty good.  The two step process did not take as long as I though but some times when you are in a hurry the two minutes can be tedious.  I will use this product about once or twice a week.  My teeth did feel clean after brushing and had the feeling of going to the dentist.</li>
            <li> I love this two step system.my mouth feels so clean after using it.i love that it&#x27;s done from step one to finish in severel minutes there&#x27;s no waiting with gross gunk in my mouth that makes me gag.i have noticed my teeth look much better after only a few weeks and are definatly whiter.i recieved this free to try(with smiley360) and will definatly purchase again I love it and I love my smile.</li>
            <li> I got the Crest Pro-Health HD kit as a Bzz Agent campaign. The product is easy to use but it&#x27;s a bit time consuming and I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in whiteness. I did notice my teeth were becoming more sensitive so I reduced my usage to once a day while alternating with an enamel strengthening toothpaste. The increased sensitivity continued so I stopped using it. I thought the taste was fine compared to some other whiteners I&#x27;ve tried and my teeth definitely felt much cleaner for longer. However I don&#x27;t think the benefit of a clean feeling outweighs the increased sensitivity and lack of whitening.</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised by this two step process, as it was very easy to use.  I received this free to try in my Buzz Kit.&lt;br /&gt;The first step is to brush your teeth with the step one product then just spit it out ...no rinsing next you use the second polishing product and scrub with this. My mouth felt very clean. I realized from the first day on that my teeth appeared much cleaner.  I think this is the peroxide which is excellent for preventing gum disease.</li>
            <li> I received the new Crest Pro Health toothpaste from BzzAgent. The new system is a great, easy way to clean and whiten teeth. This is so much easier than using the Crest whitening strips that I have used in the past. It takes the same amount of time as regularly brushing your teeth, just using two pastes instead of one. My teeth feel clean and look whiter after only a week of using the product. The only negative compared to Crest&#x27;s regular toothpaste is the taste. I realize this is because of the whitening agents, but while brushing it doesn&#x27;t taste great and has an odd drying feeling in my mouth. This is a minor issue, however, and I will still continue to use it.Thanks Crest for making a better whitening product!</li>
            <li> Received from Crest to sample: I&#x27;ve been using Crest Pro Health HD for the last two weeks, and I have to say my feelings are mixed. Most important feature is efficacy, and I say in this category Crest Pro Health HD scores high. I have seen a noticeable difference in shades, especially in area&#x27;s that regular whiting products don&#x27;t seem to effect. There are two reasons, however, I ranked it only as a four, and not five. First, the first step leaves my mouth feelings like i just put a spoon full of cinnamon in my mouth. Its dry and irritating. Luckily Step 2 quells that drought pretty quickly, but because (and here&#x27;s my second reason)it has a different consistency and is clear, its impossible to use each tube at equal rates resulting in uneven amounts of product as to get closer to the end. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll run out of Step 2 before Step 1, at which point I&#x27;ll throw Step 1 away.</li>
            <li> I picture the Crest executives wondering how to make more money off of what that they already produce. I know... repackage a crest pro-health toothpaste (maybe the whitening one?) into a fancier tube and then for the whitening gel, just fill a tube of the whitening stuff that&#x27;s used on the Crest whitestrips. Ta da - New Product! Anyways, this is how I feel about Crest HD. In addition, I&#x27;m not too keen on having to increase the number of steps in my toothbrushing routine. Nor do I like the taste of the whitening gel at all! I can only tolerate a tiny bit of that on my brush. I also can&#x27;t tell a difference in the whiteness of my teeth, but maybe it&#x27;s too early to tell since I&#x27;ve only used it for a week and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I got to try this product free through BzzAgent. These opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I have been given the opportunity to try this product through Bzzagent and Crest.  I was nervous about trying this because I did not want to get the tooth sensitivity that usually comes with whitening products.  I have been VERY pleased and have suffered NO sensitivity!!  My teeth feel incredibly clean and are many shades whiter!  The only reason that I did not give 5 stars is because of the cost, (though I got mine as a free trial, the price would discourage me from purchasing.) and also because the step two perfecting gel tastes a little too sweet for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is an amazing product!  Give it a try for a beautiful, clean smile.</li>
            <li> I have never used a whitening product before. I must say this product is really good. Its a 2 step oral care routine. My teeth looked whiter and I feel a lot fresher. The only gripe is not rinsing your mouth between the steps.</li>
            <li> I receive this toothpaste as part of a promotion from bzzagent and crest. All opinions are mine and was in no way influenced by outside sources. I am a professional blogger over at [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the toothpaste I though this was a great opportunity. Many people forget about oral health but it is super important. If not cared for properly bad teeth and lead to heart issues and other illnesses some even deadly. I was very happy to try this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1:&lt;br /&gt;The step 1 crest toothpaste is green/blue. Like suggested, I brushed for a minute. It was nice and had a slight minty flavor. This was not overpowering and did not burn my mouth. I brushed for the full minute and spit. I did not wash my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2:&lt;br /&gt;This step looks like a clear gel. I will admit it was kind of weird. In a way it dried out my mouth and made it feel strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I take my product trying seriously I gave it a few more tries. Weirdness and all, I was super impressed. My teeth not only look better but they feel better. When my tongue rubs against my teeth, they actually feel smoother. I did not realize how helpful a good toothpaste is until I tired this one. I would recommend using it.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is a game changer.  I has visibly whiter teeth after the very first use.  No strips or trays to deal with for 30 minutes.  Just a simple 2-minute brushing.  The first toothpaste has a similar texture as any other and leaves a smooth, fresh feeling behind.  The second paste is more like a gel.  I usually get sensitive teeth after using whitening products, but not with this.  I got to try this product for free but I will purchase it when it becomes available.  I&#x27;m hooked!  There&#x27;s nothing else like it on the market and it works!</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health HD is a breakthrough, the daily innovated system offers a noticeable and different experience that improves both the oral health and appearance of my mouth. By isolating toothpaste ingredients,I felt the difference first time I used. The first step is a purifying cleanser and the second step is a perfecting gel that polishes and whitens, easy to use and add into my beauty routine. Professional whitening made it easy and affordable !!! I received Crest Pro-Health HD as part of promotional from the brand through BZZ AGENT community to test and review my truly opinion.</li>
            <li> At first I honestly was nervous to change toothpaste because I thought the one I was using was the best. But this toothpaste is absolutely awesome!!! My teeth are 3 Shades lighter! I use it instead of my regular toothpaste because it comes with a toothpaste as the first step. I drink coffee and my teeth have turned a dark yellow but I noticed in a few days my teeth were brighter and whiter. It&#x27;s been a month and my teeth are evenly lighter. The containers look small but the toothpaste is not as thick as you would expect. I would definitely recommend it. I also don&#x27;t use it for the full 2 minutes, I just brush my teeth until satisfied, and my teeth are brighter and it has helped me keep my pink gums.&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product by smiley.com and asked to review it, I can honestly say I will be purchasing it in the future.</li>
            <li> I got this for free to try out and give my opinion on.  Wow!  This is amazing.  It works quickly and is less expensive than having a dentist do it.  It is not messy and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was real excited to be chosen to try this product.  When the package arrived, the package was visually bold and striking.  However, they didn’t provide any mini sample or coupon.&lt;br /&gt;The purifying cleanser:&lt;br /&gt;• The texture to the purifying cleanser was smooth and nice.&lt;br /&gt;• The taste wasn’t minty which I prefer because I like to breath to smell minty fresh.&lt;br /&gt;• The smell wasn’t bad. It’s the smell you get from the dentist&lt;br /&gt;• The look I was an aqua color which also made me feel the taste minty.  I guess I’m just trained by other products.&lt;br /&gt;The perfecting gel:&lt;br /&gt;• The texture of the perfecting gel was easily spreadable&lt;br /&gt;• The taste was like the whiten strips but not as strong&lt;br /&gt;• The smell was like the whiten strips but not as strong&lt;br /&gt;• The look was clear.&lt;br /&gt;First, I used the Step 1, a purifying cleanser, and brush for one minute. For me, if I brushed between 1 to 2 minutes my gums became sensitive.  Didn’t like the sensitive feeling but my mouth felt clean.&lt;br /&gt;Next I used Step 2, a perfecting gel that is for polishing and whitening, and brush for an additional minute. The second step left my teeth smooth like I &amp;#34;just back from the dentist&amp;#34; feel rather than a &amp;#34;just brushed with toothpaste&amp;#34; feel.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this duo that I received from Crest to try for free to review!  Leaves your mouth feeling like you just got a cleaning from the dentist daily.  Best part is, not only does the feeling last all day, it also noticeably whitens your teeth as well!  I was a skeptic at first and if I hadn&#x27;t got the chance to try it for review, I probably would not have tried it on my own.  This is definitely going to be added to my daily routine and I will be purchasing this over and over again.</li>
            <li> I got this free to sample and I love it!  It whitens so much faster than other toothpastes and leaves your mouth feeling very clean.  I felt like I&#x27;d just left the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is using both pastes.  It isn&#x27;t hard to use, I just found it tedious to use both.</li>
            <li> I love the super clean feeling I get with Crest HD. However, I didn&#x27;t notice a huge diffference in the whiteness of my teeth. If you have sensitive teeth you should be a bit cautious.  There was a tingling/stinging feeling when using the second step of this product. It also made my teeth a bit mor sensitive after a couple of uses.  I am hesitant to use it daily because of this increased sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you aren&#x27;t sensitive and you&#x27;re looking for a toothpaste that gives you a super clean feeling, this is a good option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received Crest HD via a brand promotion with Crest.</li>
            <li> I ordered it and used it as directed for just under a month and it works. It really works.  My teeth are three shades whiter and I am sure that the extra brushing will pay off at my bi-annual trip to the dentist.  For the price it is a great deal and Crest is a name you can trust when it comes to oral hygiene, according to nine out of ten dentists.  I would recommend this product to any one.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when I received a I received a sample of rest Pro Health® HD™ as part of a promotion from the brand. I wondered if the claims of whiter teeth in a few days using this two step toothpaste system. I was very surprised that my teeth were noticeably whiter/lighter and felt as clean as when I just come from the dentist. The steps are easy - you brush with the toothpaste in tube #1 for one minute, spit but don&#x27;t rinse your toothbrush off, then apply some of the paste in tube #2 and brush for another minute. My teeth definitely felt super clean - like I&#x27;d just had them cleaned at the dentist - and after about 1 week I noticed my teeth looked visibly whiter. If I have one complaint it&#x27;s the flavor or taste of the paste in tube #1. It is a wintergreen flavor and I&#x27;ve never been a fan. I&#x27;ve put up with the taste though because I really like the results.</li>
            <li> I received a free trial of this product through BzzAgent, and was excited to try it because i&#x27;ve been considering whitening products for a while now.  Too much coffee and those pearly whites have been looking less pearly!  I&#x27;ve been using the product twice daily for two weeks now and I notice a definite change.  My teeth are whiter and they feel cleaner all day.  I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised and really like the way my mouth feels after using the two-step product.</li>
            <li> I got some of this toothpaste from Crest to try. After using Crest Pro Health HD for over a week I can&#x27;t say my teeth are any whiter. I didn&#x27;t go to the dentist before and after use so I can&#x27;t say my mouth is healthier. What I can say is that after I brush my teeth they feel smooth and clean like I just had a professional cleaning at the dentist. And that clean, smooth feel lasts all day even after I eat. There are two steps to the brushing process and it takes two minutes. The tubes are labeled with a large 1 and 2, and are different colors - one silver and one blue- but if you miss those subtle clues you will still know if you are holding the right paste because step one has a flip-top toothpaste cap and is minty green like toothpaste, and the second step has a twist cap with a pointy nozzle. So it&#x27;s pretty much impossible to mess up the order of the steps. You brush first for one minute with the toothpaste which tastes minty and has a very pleasant flavor. Spit, but don&#x27;t rinse when the minute is up. Then use the second tube which is clear and not very tasty at all. In fact, I would recommend keeping your tongue as far from this clear gel as possible because it does burn slightly. Brush for one minute then spit and rinse. You will then be left with a clean, fresh mouth for the rest of the day. The first few times you use it don&#x27;t be surprised if you find yourself feeling your teeth with your tongue several times a day just to marvel at how clean they feel.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste System&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1 is a sparkling and blue tinted gel that has a nice minty toothpaste taste. Step 2 is the polishing gel and it is an opaque white gel that has a strong mint flavor. Each step asks that you brush for 1 minute with each gel, step 1 for 1 minute, directly followed by step 2 for 1 minute. After you finish with step 2, you are allowed to rinse your mouth. My electronic toothbrush has a 2 minute timer on it so I actually brushed with each step for 2 minutes, as opposed to the instructed 1 minute each for a total of 2 minutes. Since I didn&#x27;t want to bother with a stopwatch, I just used my toothbrush timer twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1 feels like I am brushing with normal toothpaste, but step 2 starts to burn a little bit toward the end of brushing. My mouth feels really clean after brushing with a cool and slightly numb feeling. I will say that it does indeed look like it is getting my teeth whiter than normal toothpaste. I will have to see what my dentist says to determine if my teeth and gums are 6X healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I did receive this for free for review purposes and this is my honest opinion about this product.</li>
            <li> After receiving my free sample from Crest I immediately using it to see if it would improve my mouth health. I had some tooth pain when I started using this and after a week it&#x27;s completely gone! I did not however notice a significant difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I received a sample before the release from Smiley360, amazing product. Step 1 really grinds away the guck and plaque without damaging the enamel. Step 2 seals and polishes, while keeping breath fresh. Only small complaint is the slight burning on the gums after step 1, doesn&#x27;t last long and can be avoided with more gentle precise brushing.</li>
            <li> First and foremost I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.  The product itself is ok.  I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for over a month but I&#x27;m not seeing the same results as others.  I don&#x27;t drink coffee, smoke or use any other teeth staining products so I expected to see some results.  The taste is pretty good and the texture as well.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the 2 part brushing without rinsing until the end.  I feel you should use the paste, rinse and then complete the routine with the gel.  I thought of purchasing another kit to continue to use to see improvement but once I saw it in the store; I realized it is very pricey.  I appreciate Smiley360 for the free sample and would most definitely try it again for free.</li>
            <li> I received this FREE PRODUCT thanks to Crest and I am completely in love with it.  I feel like I just left the dentist&#x27;s office when I use it.  I use my product twice daily, it does not cause any sensitivity at all.</li>
            <li> I got this product free thanks to Crest.  I really liked this product.  I&#x27;ve always used Crest products, but never tried the Two-Step Toothpaste before.  I was amazed how whiter my teeth were and how clean my mouth felt.  I also feel like this product also helped alot with my mouth and breath feeling fresher.  I definitely plan on using this product.  I&#x27;m happy I was able to sample this product before actually going out and buying it.  Again, I would definitely recomment this product!!</li>
            <li> I love this two-step toothpaste! My teeth looked much whiter after the first use! And I was surprised at how much cleaner my teeth feel after using it. I have a Sonicare with a timer so it is easy enough to brush my teeth for the required 1 minute (toothbrush vibrates every 30 seconds). I turn off my toothbrush, apply the second step and start brushing again. I also have a bad gag reflex so I was worried I would be choking on the toothpaste without spitting it out before applying the second but has not been a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive my Crest Pro-Health DH Daily Two-Step toothpaste as part of a promotion from Bzzagent but I definitely will be purchasing this in the future.</li>
            <li> This stuff was amazing, got a free sample to try by smiley360 and LOVED IT!</li>
            <li> I was sent this product to test free of charge for reviewing purposes. I&#x27;ve used the product for about ten days now. I was skeptical, but I love the way it makes my teeth feel! They look and feel extremely clean, and I think a little whiter! I like the flavor of the paste, and the 2nd step gel doesn&#x27;t really have a flavor at all. A con of the system is the two steps of course.  My husband tried it with me and gave up already. I&#x27;ve kind of gotten used to it and like the results I&#x27;ve seen so far, so I&#x27;m going to stick with it for a while. The only con for me, aside from the two steps and possibly the price, is the fact that the 2nd step gel has a twist off cap! I don&#x27;t like that at all! The first step has a convenient flip top, but I have to open the gel before I start, otherwise I have to put my toothbrush down to open it. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone looking for the results it promises.  It seems effective so far</li>
            <li> I was a little adamant at first before receiving this product through BzzAgent. Who wants to brush their teeth twice in one cleaning while switching products? Although step 2 had a little bit of a funky taste initially, I was pleased with how clean my teeth felt after using these 2 products. I would not consider using this everyday as it is a little bit costly, but would use it once or twice a week in conjunction with my regular dental routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for an enhancement to their everyday brushing, and to keep their teeth clean in between dental visits.</li>
            <li> Liking the clean feeling so far and freshness after using it in the morning and evening. I haven&#x27;t notice super noticeable results for whitening but I do like the clean feeling. There is a slight difference to whitening but I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple of weeks so I&#x27;m looking to see how it is going in a few more weeks. Only drawback is that it is an extra step to my routine in the am and pm which is already lengthy enough, but I&#x27;m still going to keep trying it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks now and it has made my mouth feel clean and have eliminated my need for white strips 1-2 per week.  The two part system does take slightly longer, but even using it once a day and a regular toothpaste the other has given me whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> Works great, I noticed a difference after just one use.  I will buy again!</li>
            <li> Thanks Crest for letting me try your new product free. After the first use my mouth felt noticeably cleaner and the freshness lasted longer. The two step process is easy to use because there is no rinsing between steps. At first I did not see any whitening effect but I have also tried plenty of other products that haven&#x27;t worked. Once a hygienist said it was probably the whitest my teeth could get without bleaching them. Right when I thought this wasn&#x27;t working either I noticed a slight change. I am excited to see if continued use will lighten my teeth a little more. Even if it doesn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s the cleanest any toothpaste has ever made my mouth feel and that alone is worth it!</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro Health® HD™ FREE from Crest, thank you. I was very happy to be able to try this free, because I had my doubts. Okay, there are plenty of whitening toothpastes out there, so how do we know if this one is actually going to make a difference?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEWS!!!!  Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love to read reviews and usually do before buying anything. So, I will give you my review. After the first time using Crest Pro Health® HD™, I noticed a huge difference. My teeth were clean, white and smooth. My breath was amazing. As the days went on, it only got better and better. Seems like morning breath is a thing of the past!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now been using this for several weeks and I don&#x27;t think I will ever switch to a different toothpaste again. My friends also noticed something &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; about my teeth. I think they look &amp;#34;healthier&amp;#34; and that is very important to me.</li>
            <li> Recenetly got a free sample from Crest through the awesome peeps at BuzzAgent and have been enjoying the extra clean feeling the two step process leaves.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d pay this for toothpaste though.  Maybe if I was serious to whiten my teeth it would be a drop int he bucket compared to something else on the professional level.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good product, but a bit pricy. I usually use a whitening tray, but it is so messy and time consuming compared to this.  Pretty comparable in terms of results though. You get two tubes, the first one functions much like regular toothpaste the second is a clear gel that uses hydrogen peroxide and baking soda to whiten.  You brush for each for one minute and rinse when done.  First one tastes like mint toothpaste the second one is a little more unique taste......it&#x27;s not bad though...subtle mint.  The process is very simple to use.  Much more so than trays and strips.  I noticed a difference in teeth color in about two weeks.</li>
            <li> I did not see a change by using this product at all. I was very dissappointed. It also made my teeth sensitive, which isn&#x27;t something that usually happens. I have used white strips before and other whitening products that have done a better job.</li>
            <li> I recently tried out the Crest Pro Health HD system for free through Crest for the purpose of my review.  All opinions remain my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say I enjoy brushing my teeth and often dislike the taste and texture of toothpastes, so while willing to try a new kind, I was also a little reluctant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crest Pro Health HD system comes with two tubes of toothpaste.  The first is considered a purifying cleanser designed to strip away plaque.  You are to brush with this paste for one minute, spit and add the second tube, a Perfecting Gel, which is designed to whiten your teeth.  You brush with the Perfecting Gel for one additional minute and spit and rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nice thing is it only takes two minutes for the entire &amp;#34;system&amp;#34; of cleaning and whitening your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One complaint I find when using this system is the two bottles/tubes have different style lids.  One is a flip (the first) and is easy to use.  The secnd one requires you to twist and completely remove the lid which seems to be a pain, especially when you have a messy toothbrush in your hands.  This seems like a porr design and something that could easily be improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an electric toothbrush that counts to two  minutes so the timing is easy for me, however I can see some people struggle with timing of the different minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do like about this system is it seems to really work. Instantly, my teeth feel cleaner--dentist clean would be the best way to describe it.  I can notice my teeth look whiter and I have never noticed a difference in whiteness from another toothpaste.  The taste is light and clean...you do taste the hydrogen peroxide flavor at the end but its not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the Crest Pro Health HD system for cleaner teeth and a whiter look overall.  This seems to be a great system and one that will instantly improve the feeling and cleanliness of your mouth!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this product, but did have some reservations.&lt;br /&gt;The pros to this toothpaste system are that I noticed a whiter smile after the first use. It was enough of a difference to impress me! After a while of using this product I have definitely noticed a big difference in brightness. My teeth feel a lot healthier too because of Step One, which removes plaque.&lt;br /&gt;The cons of this product are the sensation of step one. It felt like I had extreme cotton mouth and I couldn&#x27;t rinse my mouth until after step 2.. It was very uncomfortable and took some time to get used to. I also noticed in the ingredients list that in contained hydrogen peroxide, which I tasted strongly in Step 2. This could be also why my teeth felt very sensitive after using.&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I really liked this system, and the pros outweigh the cons because of the whitening power.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product for free thanks to Crest and BzzAgent, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I have tried.  Thanks to Crest I received this and love the way it works.  It whitens your teeth, freshen your breaths and leaves you with a sparkling smile.  It is easy to use and does not take any more time than using your standard toothpaste,  I would highly recommend everyone to try this.  Even your friends will notice a difference in your smile:)</li>
            <li> Great product.  Got it a week before my wedding after ordering whitening strips that never came.  Not only did it whiten my teeth but it tastes great and gives you a healthier mouth.  The two part kit also forces you to brush for the two minutes that dentists recommend anyway.  My smile was bright in the millions of wedding photos in which I had to partake.  Crest really did a great job with this product.  Disclosure:I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the Crest Pro Health to try and I was honestly really surprised at how clean my teeth felt after I used the toothpaste. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a fresh clean feeling after brushing their teeth.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone. I noticed a difference after only a few days. It is a bit cumbersome to use compared the the whitestrips though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> I love love love this stuff!! At first I was like ugh two steps - I&#x27;m always in a rush and don&#x27;t always take the time I NEED bc I&#x27;m always taking the time for others but I have LOVED the results I have from using Crest HD. I HIGHLY recommend it. It leaves your mouth feeling great and the whitening is a major bonus. The taste isn&#x27;t that great at first but I got use to it after just a few uses. We love this stuff!! Would buy! I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own</li>
            <li> I received Crest HD free from Crest as a BzzAgent, and was very unsure about it at first.  After using the first step, your mouth is left very dry and watering.  It is so hard not to rinse your mouth out with water or your toothbrush, but instead you add the second step which immediately makes your mouth feel better.  If you can make it to the second step, you will notice your mouth feels a lot cleaner and stays fresher longer.  So far I haven&#x27;t noticed whiter teeth, but I haven&#x27;t been diligent to only use this toothpaste either.  I will provide an update after a week or so of just using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Who doesn’t want have whiter teeth, right? I was so excited when I was selected for this campaign but it was too good to be true. At least for me... The first week I tried, I had to stop because mu gum started being extremely painful. I was not sure if this was due to the toothpaste or not, so I decided to wait for my gum to heal and start again the product.&lt;br /&gt;The second try was not as bad as the first one but I have to admit that I cannot use this product on a daily basis or even several times per day. While step 1 is not really a problem, I actually like the fresh feeling left with this paste, I am rather having a hard time with step 2. As soon as I put the step 2 gel on my teeth I start feeling my teeth tingling and my gum burning. Do I have sensitive teeth? YES. So I guess I should expect this kind of reaction. So I tried to reduce the amount of gel but still the tingling and burning feeling is still there.&lt;br /&gt;The whole point of using this kind of product is to start seeing results, but unfortunately if not used on a daily basis I do not think whiter teeth are to be expected. So I would say that this product is not recommended if you have sensitive teeth, so it is not a product for me!!&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AS PART OF A PROMOTION FROM THE BRAND.</li>
            <li> Since I got this from buzz agent, I have been using Crest Pro Health HD for the last two weeks,... and I have to say my feelings are mixed... One one hand it works really well! Very noticeable change in color... Now the bad... If you have sensitive teeth this may not be the best for you...  It hurt!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest ProHealth HD for three weeks and see a noticeable difference! I am a new mom and feel like my teeth yellowed after baby. I had no time for labor intensive whitening systems...I needed something quick and effective. This product is just that! I am able to complete the process quickly and see results. The toothpaste tastes fresh and the whitening gel is tolerable. I do wish both tubes had a flip top cap, not just the toothpaste, but that is my only complaint. The product has lasted me all this time, and still many more brushes to go. I also like that my husband can use the system, because you use it with your own toothbrush. #Bzzagent Tried it for free thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li> Great Item! Great Seller! Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to sample this product via BzzAgent, and I must say I&#x27;m not impressed. I&#x27;ve been using it twice daily for a few weeks and have yet to notice whiter teeth. Perhaps I need to give it more time to work, as I&#x27;m halfway through each tube. The toothpaste (step 1) tastes exactly like their Pro Health toothpaste. (I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s the same stuff.) The gel (step 2) doesn&#x27;t taste the greatest, but nor do most whitening products on the market. The gel is also quite runny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically experience sensitivity when using whitening products (brush on gel, strips, etc.) but have not had any issues with this product causing sensitivity. For the price, I would say if you can handle the feeling strips leave you&#x27;ll get a bigger bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this stuff through Bzz Agent... I was a little surprised to see the price tag but take my money, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I read the claims first- super clean mouth, reduction of morning breath, whiter teeth... I was intrigued.&lt;br /&gt;And then I read the ingredients and saw that it contains peroxide. Cringe. I detest the taste of peroxide to the point that I lived with my yellowing teeth for the sake of never having to use those awful whitening trays. Blech. So I was hesitant about step 2, since it contains peroxide as a main ingredient. I was pleasantly surprised- it&#x27;s more than tolerable. I could barely taste the peroxide, so I had to wonder if it would actually whiten my teeth much. Pleasantly surprised again- my teeth are noticeably whiter after just a couple of weeks of use. Most whitening toothpastes just keep your teeth from getting less white, while this stuff actually makes my teeth sparkling white.&lt;br /&gt;Super clean mouth? Check. I was cursed with poor gums and am prone to awful gingivitis if I skip brushing my teeth for even one night. I constantly battled puffy gums. Not anymore... my teeth are not only super-slick, but my gums are noticeably better too.&lt;br /&gt;And finally: reduced morning breath. The jury is still out on that one, as I haven&#x27;t gotten brave enough to roll over and mouth-breathe on my husband&#x27;s face yet. My mouth does feel much more clean in the morning when I wake up, so I&#x27;d wager that my breath smells better but I&#x27;m not ready to test that out just yet.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now. I received it free as a promotion from the brand. I felt and saw the difference right away! I used regular toothpaste yesterday, and hated it! I didn&#x27;t feel as clean. The two step process is really easy. My teeth are so much whiter now. I also have very sensitive teeth, and this product does not bother me at all. I am not going back to regular toothpaste again!</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste. Really gets the mouth feeling so fresh and clean!! Truly feels like I stepped out of the dentist  h air every time I use it. Love the packaging, love the taste, don&#x27;t even mind the two step process one bit!&lt;br /&gt;*i received this product as part of a promotional program</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro Health HD as prt of a promotional kit and I&#x27;m glad I tried it. After a few weeks my teeth are certainly whiter. I have had dental work done on one of my top front teeth and that one didn&#x27;t whiten as much as the others, but overall I can see a difference. Glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> So I had a chance to pick this up for free, because it really sounded interesting and I had to try it.  I must say, I am a huge fan of the super clean and ultra fresh feeling that I get in my mouth once I am done brushing with this two step system.  I really look forward to brushing my teeth because of how clean and smooth this makes my mouth feel.  What&#x27;s even better is I #GotItFree.</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand..I will admit that I was skeptical about this when I first tried it because I generally do not see a lot of results from whitening toothpastes or the white strips but I wanted to give it a shot. Also I was excited to try this product since its claim was providing cleaner, whiter teeth within a week.  The first time you try Crest Pro Health® HD™ and that is that it leaves my mouth feeling very dry and that you want to grab a glass of water but you can’t since that is only part one and it is a two-step system but I continued to test the applications.  After just a few days I could feel the cleaner, fresher feeling in my mouth and after about a week and a half to two weeks I could see a difference in the whiteness of my teeth. But I do however; I dislike the covers for the two items one is an easy flip open tube that can be done with one hand and the other one, the whitening gel comes in a screw top cap. I don&#x27;t understand why this was done as it makes opening and closing with one hand very difficult. It requires you to put your toothbrush down, screw off the cap, pick up the toothbrush, add the gel, put the toothbrush down, screw the cap back on, pick the brush back up and finish brushing. That is a lot of time consuming based on a 2 minute brushing period.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks and my teeth feel clean and whiter too!  What I really like is that there is zero sensitivity to the whitening agent and it doesn&#x27;t taste bad.  My previous experiences with whitening always led to gum soreness and yucky taste in my mouth.  I will keep using this product!</li>
            <li> I love this! I have tried white strips and trays in the past. I always end up with senstive teeth at the gum line but NOT with this one! I brush with it twice a day and my teeth feel great, look great, and they are not sensitive from it either which is a huge bonus!!!! I love this toothpaste! I did recieve it for free as a promotion however, it will be my new go-to toothpaste to keep away stains, for everyday use, and help with overall health of my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried a number of whitening products, some that work, but many, many more that don&#x27;t. My teeth didn&#x27;t need whitening, so I was a little hesitant to try this product, but I didn&#x27;t really have anything to lose. I received it for free from BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit surprised at the look and feel of the packaging when it arrived (it felt a little cheap), but it&#x27;s not about the packaging - it&#x27;s about the product! This came just before I went away on vacation and because I hate carrying one - no less two - tubes of toothpaste when flying (not to mention that I didn&#x27;t know how my teeth would react to it), this stayed at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product just about two weeks ago. The first step looks and goes on like a super-thick regular toothpaste. The product tastes like it should, but feels a little odd in the mouth - kinda gritty and thick. It took a while to get used to not completely getting the product out of my mouth, but once I got used to it it was no big deal. I got total dejavu when using the second step, but I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out why. It&#x27;s a clear gel that you put on top of the residual first step to polish and whiten. But be warned - when they say use for 1 minute, do not go over that 1 minute! The whitening/polishing gel is potent and can irritate your gums and (temporarily) turn them white if left on for too long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, my teeth didn&#x27;t need a whole lot of whitening to begin with, but I have noticed that they look a bit brighter since starting this regimen. The minty-ness always leaves my mouth feeling great afterwards, too, which is really what I&#x27;m looking for out of any toothpaste. My teeth and gums tend to be particularly sensitive to whitening products, so I probably won&#x27;t use it again for at least another 6-12 months to keep sensitivity at bay, but I have been quite pleased with it so far. I am about half way through my sample and would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a whitening toothpaste that actually works.ing for a whitening toothpaste that actually works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure two tubes is better than one.  While I have decent teeth already, the extra step in the morning when I&#x27;m already a mess getting ready for work after a couple extra snoozes, I&#x27;m not seeing the effects.  Maybe its nominal and maybe I should have taken photos, but the people i surround myself with are vain and I feel like they would&#x27;ve noticed a difference.  I sit there fumbling with a second tube and I&#x27;d think it was a bigger breakthrough if this was combined into one product.  Call me when that happens.</li>
            <li> I got this product free through a promotion, and I was looking forward to it.  The two-step process sounded a little gimmicky, but truth be told I like gimmicky tooth care products as long as the price is right.  Fancy dispensers, extra stripes, mouthwash crystals, I enjoy it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And while I might not have been expecting a huge leap forward, this is probably the most powerful toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.  After brushing, my mouth feels very fresh and remains that way right up until my next meal, which is something I couldn&#x27;t say about previous products I&#x27;ve used.  It really does feel similar to a dental cleaning minus the discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the whitening claims, before I started using the product I had noticed some mild yellowing along the bottom row.  I felt that the product cleared that up fairly quickly, within a couple of days of use.  I haven&#x27;t stopped using this product yet, so I can&#x27;t say whether or not this is a temporary effect, i.e. contingent on continued use or if my teeth will remain white if I switch to a non-whitening toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two-step part was nice in that it keeps me focused on the duration of my brushing and a proper rinsing procedure.  The downside is, due to the product size, the product goes quickly.  Being about 2/3 through the product, I would guess that I will get about 100 brushings in total. This might help you judge value if you choose to purchase this Crest product yourself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a BzzzAgent and can&#x27;t stop myself from thanking them for choosing me to be a part of this campaign! My mouth has never felt fresher, my teeth are only this shiny and smooth after a dental cleaning...I can&#x27;t wait for my hygienist to see my smile next week! 3 weeks on HD and happy as can be! I knew by day 2 I was sold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the 2-step Crest Pro Health HD process for about a month now, after receiving it as part of a promotion through BzzAgent. It has taken some time to get into the routine of using two products, and even now I often forget about the 2nd step when I am brushing later in the day. I try to brush for at least one minute for each step, but I am seeing very few results as compared to other whitening products I have used in the past. I also don&#x27;t like the taste of step 2. I will continue to use the product until it is gone, but will likely not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I am reviewing a free product I received as a member of Bzzagent. That being said, I have never been happier with toothpaste (at least not since I was about 8 and discovered the glittery crest toothpaste). I agree with what many others are saying about the &amp;#34;fresh from the dentist feeling.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve noticed this feeling lasts all through the day and even after eating, which isn&#x27;t something I could say about any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve used to date. Others have complained about brushing taking twice as long.. but really, it&#x27;s two minutes (that isn&#x27;t that long) and it&#x27;s well worth the extended time. My teeth are noticeably whiter, but I am even more impressed with the way my gum health has improved. I highly recommend this product and will be adding it to my regular purchase list.</li>
            <li> I’ve had my buzzkit for Crest Pro Health HD for a few weeks now and I constantly wanted to try it, but I always found myself rushing to get out of the door in the morning.  This rushing led to me to stick with the tried and true 1 step brushing process.  Eventually, I found myself with a long weekend morning with nothing pressing right after I woke up so I finally tried the Crest Pro Health HD.  To my surprise it didn’t take any longer that normal brushing took, just it had an extra step in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the process goes to using Crest Pro Health, it is a simple 4 step process – 1 – dry brush with the step 1 tube, 2 – spit, 3 – wet brush with the step 3 tube, 4 - rinse mouth out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the using the product I found my mouth feeling refreshed and smelling good.  One thing I didn’t notice was an increased in dry mouth after each use.  Over the course of having used the product for the past week, my teeth seem slightly whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend the product for someone looking for a 1-2 week course for whitening your teeth and even for someone looking for a whitening tooth paste product.</li>
            <li> I got to try this product for free thanks to Crest and I would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste is a good system for getting a great clean while also helping to remove stains and provide a whiter smile. When I finish the routine my teeth feel cleaner than they do with most other toothpastes and I can see the whitening occurring over continual use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the downside you do have to use two separate products, but, overall you&#x27;re still brushing as long as you should be with a single toothpaste so it&#x27;s not much of an annoyance. I am not a big fan of how the whitening paste leaves an aftertaste but this is rectified if you just use a mouth rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would definitely recommend the product. Perhaps they could find a way to combine both pastes to not have to deal with the two separate ones.</li>
            <li> I got to try this product free thanks to Crest. I was very excited to try this whitening toothpaste combo, but I was disappointed. To use, you first brush with the &#x27;paste&#x27; for 1 minute, then add the whitening &#x27;gel&#x27; and brush for another minute. I liked that I could control where I applied the gel, focusing it on my front teeth and avoiding my gums. I was also glad that I didn&#x27;t notice any sensitivity caused by this product. But I also didn&#x27;t notice any whitening effects, which defeats the whole purpose. The toothpaste itself also left my mouth feeling rough, and I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the taste. I also thought the gel bottle was poorly designed--it was hard to screw on and off the cap while also holding a frothing toothbrush. They should have made that bottle with a flip top like they did the toothpaste bottle. All in all, this product is inconvenient to use, and wasn&#x27;t very effective. I&#x27;ll be switching back to regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Oral care is very important to me so I was excited to use this product! I received it for free to use it and give my opinion on it. Prior to using this I used Crest Pro-Health toothpaste and was very happy with it. If you were to go from using any other tooth paste (beside Pro-Health) I know you would be amazed with Crest Pro-Health HD! I thought you couldn&#x27;t get better than the Pro-Health, which is a great product itself, but this is! My teeth feel like I just finished with a cleaning at the dentist each time I brush. I do notice that my breath also stays fresh longer. The biggest difference I noticed was the health of my gums. I would have occasional bleeding with flossing and one tooth in particular that felt very sensitive when I flossed it. Since using Pro-Health HD I have not had ANY bleeding with flossing and my sensitive tooth is no longer sensitive! As far as the whitening goes, I have not noticed much difference. I do drink a cup of coffee every morning and have noticed some discoloration over the years. I&#x27;m not going to lie, I hoped that I would see some difference, after several weeks of use and a before and after picture I didn&#x27;t see any change in the color of my teeth. I still give it 5 stars because of the clean feeling and overall healthy feeling of my mouth since using this product! This one is definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li> Over the past 3 weeks, my wife and I have used the Crest Prod Health HD product (as part of a BzzAgent campaign we were supplied with the kit from Crest) and the results have been great!  After a few days of getting used to the process and getting my gums used to getting a healthy scrub, my teeth began to whiten and I felt like I was getting a dentist cleaning every time I brushed.  My mouth felt healthy and my smile was looking much better as stains began to fade.  The two of us used up the tubes after just over 3 weeks and are ordering more today because we are not happy returning to the old tube we used before because the cleanliness is just not the same.  My teeth feel like they have a layer of slime on them and my breath is not as fresh as it was before after returning to the toothpaste I used before the HD!&lt;br /&gt;I have attached a picture of my teeth after the first brushing and after the last brushing...great results!</li>
            <li> I got this product for free through bzzagent.I have been skeptical of teeth whitening products in the past. THey are expensive and generally alot of work. I got this product and so far have mostly good things to say. I have been using it for about a week and can notice that my teeth are starting to appear whiter. I in general feel cleaner with this product. It does leave an odd feeling in your mouth after which I am guessing is part of the whitener. Overall I am noticing improvement and plan to continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using new Crest Pro-Health HD Daily two step toothpaste for a few weeks now. The two step system was a little confusing at first, but now I am used to using two different pastes.  The first step left my mouth feeling very clean and fresh. Then the second step helps whiten my teeth. The first tube is most like a toothpaste, and the second tube is a clear gel.  The system makes my teeth whiter.  I can tell the difference. I feel that I need to keep using it to keep my teeth white. But I am satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;The two step process is easy and it works well enough that I can see whiter teeth when I look in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;I got to try this product free from Crest and from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a good try for 2 weeks after receiving it free as a BzzAgent from Crest.  I must admit I wasn&#x27;t super impressed.  First, having to use 2 separate tubes of &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; during a morning and evening routine is a bit cumbersome.  I&#x27;m a busy mom and I find it a little more trouble than it&#x27;s worth to have to use each tube for 1 minute twice a day.  At first I didn&#x27;t think it would be a big deal, but when I actually tried to watch the clock to be sure I used each tube for a minute I realized that it was a lot longer than I anticipated.  Secondly, I didn&#x27;t feel the paste and whitening gel whitened my teeth.  My teeth are pretty white to begin with, but I definitely could have used a little whitening help on the front bottom teeth and didn&#x27;t notice a difference after my 2-week trial period.  As far as the taste goes the step 1 paste was a nice minty flavor and I felt like it really got my teeth cleaned.  The step 2 whitening gel was fairly bitter.  It seems like it is the same gel used on Crest white strips.  I&#x27;m continuing to use the product for a little longer in hopes of whiter teeth!</li>
            <li> I got this as a free sample!! Crest Pro health HD is absolutely amazing. ..definitely whitened my teeth. I seen results in the first week. After I use it, my teeth feel cleaner for many hours longer than other brands of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> i got a kit of the crest pro health hd 2 step toothpaste for free through bzzagent and i am so glad i got a chance to try it! the price is a bit steep, i saw it on sale at a drugstore for $13 which is a little more then id pay for 2 tubes of toothpaste that you have to use right after each other, so basically lasting as long as 1 tube. anyway I&#x27;m rambling. its a very effective way to clean your mouth and make your teeth whiter! i have used it for about 10 days now, twice a day, and i def feel a cleaner mouth. i would recommend that everyone try this out if you get a chance as it feels as good as after a dentist cleaning!</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro-Health HD for over 4 weeks now.  I have gotten to try it for free as part of a Bzz agent campaign.  I was really hoping that it would help reduce plaque build-up as I have problems with that due to some overcrowding of two lower teeth.  Unfortunately, it has not helped in this matter.  I will say that my teeth feel clean after use and they are somewhat whiter, although I cannot say how much (it would have been nice to have a shade card to have something to compare them with.  I did take photos but somehow they got deleted from my phone).&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all this product is okay.  I do think that those with straighter teeth will likely have better results than I have had.</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro-Health HD for several weeks now thanks to BzzAgent, and I have had amazing results!  My teeth are definitely noticeably whiter.  I also didn&#x27;t have any problems with extra sensitivity, which has happened in the past with other whitening products.  The only downside to this product is the extra time and effort that is required for the two steps, but I do think it&#x27;s worth it.  And, when I am short on time, I just use regular toothpaste on that day.  I was surprised when I saw the price, (I received a complimentary package from BzzAgent), because it was much higher than I expected, but after doing some research, it seems like that&#x27;s pretty average for a whitening system.  Overall, I definitely would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about using the new 3-D crest Pro health HD because of the two-step process. I am a mother of three young children and I barely have time to brush my teeth twice a day and now I&#x27;m supposed to take twice the time! Although after receiving my free sample from the brand, I was pleased to discover that although it was a two-step process it does not take twice as long. The toothpaste for step one is grainy and the taste is not as good as many toothpastes. The step to whitening has a weird taste. But I was very pleased with how the one two-step process made my teeth feel clean and look much wider. I have tried whitening strips in the past and due to my sensitive teeth I have never been able to get the full effect of the whitening. This product did not make my teeth feel sensitive. Overall I am pleased with this product due to the whitening. I wish the taste was a little bit better</li>
            <li> I received this toothpaste as a promotion and have to say that I couldn&#x27;t even use it long enough to find out if it whitened my teeth. I suppose for people who regularly use whitening products, it is probably easier and faster than whitening strips or other treatments that are available. However, I thought it was a pain. The first step is a pop top tube that you brush with like normal, but you don&#x27;t rinse. Then the second tube, is a screw top which is a pain in the butt. My toothbrush was already wet and I didn&#x27;t want to have to set it down to open the second tube. Then you brush with it and rinse like normal. I felt like it didn&#x27;t leave my teeth feeling very clean - I wanted to use my regular toothpaste after using this one to get that clean minty feeling. It felt weird to not rinse after the first step which is what attributed to the gritty feeling on my teeth. But, like I said, it&#x27;s probably a better option for people who regularly whiten.</li>
            <li> Wow! What a difference this product makes! I was able to try it free thanks to Crest and Bzz Agent, and boy am I glad I did. It improved the overall cleanliness and whiteness of my teeth in just a little over a week. It works better than any other at home whitening paste I have tried and I will certainly be continuing to use it. It is a quick 2 step system, rather than an overnight or 30 minute whitening strip. It was super easy to incorporate into my daily routine. If you have ever used a whitening strip, the second whitening paste does have that peroxide like taste and an interesting feel, but it is not too bad. I would highly recommend giving this system a try!</li>
            <li> So I had the opportunity to try this product free from Crest and I have mixed feelings but definitely will give it a positive review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; - Whiter smile. I see the difference. It isn&#x27;t as white and bright as they claimed but there was a noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt; - Super clean feeling. Reminds me of a visit to the dentist. I have never felt my teeth this clean from my other toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt; - While I was able to sample for free from Crest, I have seen it in my local shops and it is VERY reasonably priced compared to similar kits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt; - Didn&#x27;t see results as white as promised but still better than average&lt;br /&gt; - Gave me teeth sensitivity. Had to go back my old Crest Pro-Health toothpaste occasionally to stop the sensitivity before going back to the HD kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN THE MIDDLE:&lt;br /&gt; - It usually takes me a few minutes to brush my teeth regularly so having to brush with each tube&#x27;s contents for a minute wasn&#x27;t an issue but I can see how it can be a hassle if you&#x27;re in a rush or you don&#x27;t usually spend that long brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;A good buy and I would recommend</li>
            <li> Crest is my favorite brand of toothpaste so when I received the free sample from Bzzagent I was excited to try this toothpaste.  I was very impressed with how it immediately left my breath feeling strongly minty.  It is very powerful and I could feel the difference in terms of the plaque being removed.  My teeth felt smoother.  The second step that helps to whiten your teeth has left my teeth looking glossier and shinier.  They could look more white, so I wouldn&#x27;t use this as just a whitener, but the shine is noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product ever since it arrived in the mail (I am a BzzAgent).  So I have been using it everyday for several weeks.  I brush for 1 minute with the first tube which is a thick blue gooey paste. I then immediately brush with the second tube for 1 minute which contains a translucent colorless smooth gel with the consistency of hair conditioner.  When brushing with the second tube I noticed that my mouth would tingle.  I am assuming it was working its magic.  I do enjoy this &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; mouth feeling.  My husband has commented that my teeth do appear whiter.  I honestly did not notice a huge difference.  But I think the toothpaste does work well.  The results were good but not striking.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about trying out the Crest Pro Health HD (I received it as part of a promotion from Crest).  After all, I like Crest products, I like non-amateur products, I enjoy being healthy, and I have an HD TV- what&#x27;s not to like?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions exactly- brushing in two steps with a minute each. It was a little odd to not rinse out my mouth after the first step, but I overcame the urge and powered through to the end.  After a couple days, I noticed some white spots on my gums.  The directions call this &amp;#34;signals&amp;#34; and that I could ignore them without issue.  Well, unfortunately I had to cut my trial short as those spots eventually became very painful, irritated sections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why didn&#x27;t I give the product a one-star review?  A few reasons- 1) the product seemed to be working.  I had noticeably whiter teeth, and my mouth certainly FELT healthier 2) I can only imagine this was user error- I don&#x27;t typically brush the front of my teeth for 2 minutes, so I think I brought this on with an improper technique.  Unfortunately I&#x27;m a little gun shy about trying again so I&#x27;ll probably never know.  I tend to have more sensitive gums than many others, so I didn&#x27;t want to firebomb this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, if you have good, healthy teeth and have used teeth whiteners without issue, I&#x27;d probably recommend this.  For me, unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t quite work out.</li>
            <li> I was asked to test Crest Pro-Health HD for the company. After the first use, I was shocked with how clean my teeth and mouth felt. Within a few days, I definitely noticed whiter teeth. Some of the reviews mentioned the additional brushing step, but I did not mind the extra minute spent keeping my teeth and mouth healthy and clean. The flavor of each tube is pleasing and my hard to please husband even loves using Crest Pro-Health HD for his tooth brushing routine.</li>
            <li> I was able to receive this product free for review and Im glad I tried it.  On a typical day I would notice my teeth were yellow and gross by the time lunchtime was over. With the Crest Pro Health HD I noticed my teeth stayed silky smooth like they were polished at the dentist all day long.  Its almost like the polish blocks the coffee stains from even appearing and by the time I get home my mouth still feels clean.</li>
            <li> First let me say I am one for WHITE teeth. I like to smile and yellow teeth are not my thing. So when Crest came out with this system and I had the opportunity to try it out,via bzzagent for free, I had to do so, and it works O.K. but there are things that I would change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth do feel very clean and look as white as they did previously if not a bit whiter. So does it achieve the goals set forth by Crest? It&#x27;s plausible. However, as stated above, there are some drawbacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it is very cumbersome to use if you use a electric toothbrush. Your toothbrush is timed for two minutes. In your head you are counting to  60, then while the brush is running, (because if you turn it off and back on it starts all over) you rinse and put on step 2. How do you do that with one hand while one is holding on to a vibrating toothbrush? Not easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing I would change is that the step 2 is a different cap. I actually PREFER the cap for step 2, than the cap for step 1. Anyone who&#x27;s used Crest recently probably has noticed that the toothpaste tends to leak out of the cap. It&#x27;s been a topic of  discussion with my friends and family for the last few months. Step one has this cap, so it gets to be a gooey mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third is , I found the toothpaste has a tendency to burn my mouth. My mouth is far from sensitive however I&#x27;ve found myself stopping the entire process and spitting out before the first minute is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to recap, I like the system idea and it seems to be working. My teeth feel clean and do look white. However, the delivery of the system and make up needs some work .</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of Crest Pro Health HD from the company and I was excited but also leery. I quit smoking about 6 months ago and my teeth were still yellow, how could they fix that so quickly? Well, I won&#x27;t say they did it in a week but it didn&#x27;t take much longer! Get it - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with the new Crest Pro Health HD!!! So simple to use- brush your teeth for one minute with each of the two tubes and you will see results very quickly. I noticed a marked difference in just one week My teeth feel so clean, my smile is whiter and I am getting complements that I look YOUNGER !!! That is the best complement I could get.</li>
            <li> I receive  Crest Pro Health HD for free from Crest to evaluate and have used it for two weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed any change in how white my teeth are. The step 2 perfecting gel has a bad taste to it. I&#x27;m not a dentists so i can&#x27;t really comment on if my mouth is 6x healthier, but I am hoping that it is. The two step process does make me brush my teeth longer than i usually do, which would probably make a healthier mouth.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product via the Bzz Agent program. I was skeptical of it at first since I have tried other whiteners in the past and always had bad experiences with gum and nerve pain from the chemicals. I was also hesitant of the 2-step process since I figured it would be too cumbersome to fit into my morning and evening routines. But, after a week of using it, I realized it was a rather easy process since the 2 minutes is split between the 2 tubes. I also experienced no nerve/gum pain whatsoever. My mouth felt fresh for several hours. It was similar to that &amp;#34;post-dentist&amp;#34; feeling. As far as the whitening process goes, It took me until the 2nd week to really notice a difference. Now, several weeks later, my teeth have never been whiter and STILL no gum pain! I will definitely be keeping this in my repertoire.</li>
            <li> The two step process may be a little off-putting at first, and I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that it&#x27;s easy to forget not to rinse my mouth after step 1 when I am tired and getting ready for bed on autopilot, but the product works. I got a free sample to try a week and a half before my wedding, and while my fiance did a whitening gel, I stuck with the Crest Pro Health HD. I used it for 90% of my brushing and saw visibly whiter teeth in just a week or so.  I was happy that it didn&#x27;t taste bad. I was REALLY happy that it didn&#x27;t make my teeth painfully sensitive like whitening strips have done in the past. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with the product. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give all 5 stars is because of how easy it is to forget that it&#x27;s a two step process. I understand that having 2 steps is how the magic works, but after a long day, the last thing I have mental energy for is toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective. But I wonder if it is damaging to my teeth. I have no sensitivity issues, it just feels like a coarse sandpaper to clean the teeth, then when the teeth are more exposed, brush a whitener on the teeth. I used it several days in a row and have backed off to a few times a week. On the off days, I use a non-fluoride natural toothpaste. The process of using two-steps is easy to adjust to. I received sample of Crest Pro Health HD for free to try through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I am a BzzAgent and received this product to sample as part of BzzAgent campaign.  I typically use my custom trays and 20% hydrogen peroxide gel for whitening; I haven&#x27;t found anything to whiten better than they do.  So I decided to try the Crest Pro-Health HD to see if I could nix the trays.  I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 2.5 weeks and I would say I see about a 10% difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  I&#x27;m not certain if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m a daily 2-cup coffee drinker or it&#x27;s just stubborn stains near my gums.  The pros:  1) Tastes fine.  The 2nd step does have more of a peroxide slightly salty taste, otherwise, this wasn&#x27;t an issue.  2) Time - I typically use a Sonicare which has a 2 minute automatic timer.  The product takes 1 minute for the first step, 1 minute for the 2nd step, so it was no more time than I typically brush.  The cons:  1) Whitening.  I did actually get some whitening, but it wasn&#x27;t the dramatic results hyped on the packaging or on the TV commercials.  2)  Price.  At 12$ dollars/kit, it&#x27;s not cost effective for me to continue to use the product.  Unfortunately I&#x27;m going to stick with my regular inexpensive toothpaste and every 1-2 weeks use my trays and peroxide.</li>
            <li> I have replaced my current toothpaste with the Crest Pro Health HD set for several weeks now, and I must say the step one toothpaste is quite nice. It leaves my teeth feeling clean and fresh. I do notice that it makes my mouth feel dry during the actual brushing, strangely enough, but it doesn&#x27;t stay dry after rinsing. I don&#x27;t notice the part 2 doing anything special for my teeth though. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in the whitening, which was what I was really looking for. So overall I think the set is worth a shot because it&#x27;s simple to use, but I didn&#x27;t personally notice anything special about it to make it worth spending more than you would for just a toothpaste. Also, since you are supposed to use both products for one minute each, you need to have a clock or a timer around you while you brush your teeth, or just guess on how long you&#x27;ve been brushing... either way, it is more of a hassle, and I&#x27;d personally rather just use the old whitening strips so that I was setting aside special time for teeth whitening. Although this might be a good product to try for those who don&#x27;t have time to set aside for that. I did receive this item for free from bzzagent. #GotItFree</li>
            <li> I recently received the Crest Pro Health HD kit to review from BzzAgent.  Even though I receieved this product free of charge I can honestly say I absolutely LOVE this new toothpaste!!  It seemed like it might be a pain at first because there are two different tubes you have to use but it wasn&#x27;t at all.  You use each tube for only 1 minute each so it really wasn&#x27;t any different than my normal routine.  Step 1 is intended to clean your teeth.  What shocked me is my teeth were literally squeaky clean.  I mean by the end of the first minute my toothbrush is truly squeaking on my teeth.  From the first time I used it my teeth just felt cleaner.  Then Step 2 is the whitening and protecting gel.  By the end of the week my tongue was slightly sensitive to the gel but other than that it didn&#x27;t bother me at all.  Especially since my teeth were much noticeably whiter!!  I have used white strips in the past which are a complete pain and take weeks to work.  My results with this kit were MUCH better than the strips and took only 1 week of just brushing my teeth like I normally do.  I have tried several different brands of whitening toothpaste but this is the first one to actually work.  The one drawback is my breath doesn&#x27;t feel quite as fresh in the morning but I brush again then anyway.  I highly recommend this product and will be sticking with this toothpaste from now on!!  Loving my new smile!</li>
            <li> The Crest ProHealth HD set of toothpaste is different. For one, you get two tubes of toothpaste. And they are different for another reason.... they work! They do what they say on the box, they whiten AND get rid of bad breath! How refreshing that a product works.&lt;br /&gt;I was sceptical at first, but as soon as I received Crest Pro-Health HD (I am a BzzAgent) I was intrigued. Two tubes? Step one gets rid of plaque, tartar and gives me that &#x27;clean enough to sweep my tongue over my teeth&#x27; kinda feeling! It gives me beautiful minty breath, too. Step two has a tough job to do... I drink GALLONS of coffee... but I followed the two step process, and already I can see how much whiter my teeth are, thanks to Step two! Ha, coffee, take that!!! I can enjoy my drinks AND have a white smile. My dentist will be pleased to see me next time!&lt;br /&gt;One minute using step one, don&#x27;t rinse, then one minute using step two, is all you need. Twice a day. You&#x27;ll see the difference. I did.&lt;br /&gt;I am a Crest Pro-Health HD convert, see my white smile! :-D</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this. Who doesn&#x27;t want white teeth right??? I received it free to try from crest as part of a buzz agent campaign. First couple days I thought it was great. Two steps weren&#x27;t hard. Step one had a pleasant taste. My teeth felt smooth and clean. Over a week later I haven&#x27;t noticed my teeth to be whiter. But even worse my teeth are sensitive, my gums are sore, insides of my cheeks raw and tongue feels numb. I&#x27;ve read stannous fluoride causes a lot of these problems. Crest also uses real plastic specs...polyethylene in many of their toothpastes that get embedded in gums. I&#x27;m discontinuing use and going back to Colgate. Healthy teeth and gums are more important.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying the new Crest Pro-Health HD toothpaste and am starting to notice a difference. When I first got the product for free as part of a promotion to try it out I was skeptical, but kept an open mind. Right off the bat, I noticed my teeth really sparkled after the two-step process of cleaning then polishing. I can&#x27;t say that my teeth are any healthier, but I do notice they seem a bit whiter and even later in the day, my teeth still have a clean, smooth feel. I definitely plan on continuing to use this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I got to try this for free, thanks to Crest. I used it 2x/day for a week and only noticed a slight difference in my teeth. The biggest difference was that my teeth felt 10x cleaner than when I use my ordinary toothpaste. I could literally feel the difference in my mouth. As far as that HD whitening smile, I didn&#x27;t notice much difference. Disclaimer: my teeth are not super white to begin with. My teeth are probably just average (not darkly stained and not super white). I feel that the teeth whitening strips do a better job for that. If you&#x27;re looking for a toothpaste that will make your teeth feel brand new then this is it! Is it worth the money and having to do the 2 step process? I don&#x27;t know... it&#x27;s certainly worth a try though. It wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal to stop brushing my teeth to apply another paste, but some mornings I felt rushed and would have rather skipped that extra step.</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro Health HD tooth paste through Bzz Agent for free to try out.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s how it works:&lt;br /&gt;2 toothpastes: Step 1 a traditional toothpaste to clean your teeth to be used for one minute. Step 2 is a clear polish to help whiten your teeth to be added to your toothbrush for the 2nd minute of brushing (without rinsing in between). To be used morning and night&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I think:&lt;br /&gt;Cost $12.99- Pricey for the size although it has lasted me about a month now&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning capability- EXCELLENT!!! Here&#x27;s where the toothpaste may be worth the money, my teeth are so smooth and stay that way all day. The Step 1 has a grainier grit than other toothpastes which I think contributed to this.&lt;br /&gt;Whitening- Definitely made my teeth at least a shade whiter in as soon as a week of regular use. I got many comments on my white teeth&lt;br /&gt;Sensitivity- Did NOT make my teeth more sensitive (Whitening strips do make my teeth terribly sensitive so I&#x27;d say this is better). Although I do get a twinge of sensitivity/pain when Step 2 hits my teeth for &amp;#60;1 second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;- Supposed to use 2 toothpastes in one brushing episode (sometimes I was too lazy to do the second step and other times I thought &amp;#34;This is a good way of getting me to brush for a full 2 minutes&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;-High Cost&lt;br /&gt;- Dry mouth- It made my mouth super dry although this doesn&#x27;t last long&lt;br /&gt;- Taste- Not my favorite but tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall- A good toothpaste that&#x27;s best qualities are whitening capability with less sensitivity and a smooth, clean feeling for your teeth that lasts.&lt;br /&gt;After my free full size sample runs out I will have to decide if these qualities outweigh the high cost, which in my opinion is the biggest downside to Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste. I liked just Step One alone and would buy that for half the price</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try Crest Pro Health HD from BzzAgent. I was skeptic that this product would produce any results and that I wouldn&#x27;t have time for it however I was wrong. There are so many things I like about this product! First it only takes 2 minutes, 1 minute to cleanse the teeth with the paste, then another minute to polish them with the gel. So fast, I was able to add this to my normal routine! Second, my teeth instantly felt cleaner, they got a good scrubbing and polishing. Third, after one week I did notice they were whiter. This will be my go to product to make surely smile is at its best. I also like using this product after a few weeks for just a couple days to make my teeth feel and look better.</li>
            <li> I loved how it made my whole mouth feel, including my gums and teeth. I have never used a toothpaste that did so much all at once, and it even made my teeth look shinier and whiter, without making my gums feel sensitive.</li>
            <li> Minty taste was superior to others. it did its duty keeping my entire mouth clean. even the dentist was surprised that no cavities nor gum disease was appearing.</li>
            <li> I tried this as a free sample.  I found this product to be comparable to other complete/total care tooth pastes. It has a minty flavor, the vaguely caustic feeling of whitening pastes, and a smooth texture. I would add it into the rotation of toothpastes I buy</li>
            <li> Crest PH Advanced helped me feel confident when dealing with others because my breath was fresh and my teeth were clean. Even after I ate a bowl of chili for lunch my teeth and breath felt clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I saw a commercial for Crest Pro Health HD Toothpaste recently and was super excited when I received the product as part of a promotion to try and then review it.  I am a major red wine connoisseur and drink coffee regularly.  I have tried different whitening strips and whitening toothpastes in the past and have not been completely thrilled with the results.  I like how the Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste comes in two separate bottles to see how each bottle effects your teeth.  This way you can see the entire process and how it works.  Usually it takes weeks to get a beautiful white smile from whitestrips and other whitening toothpastes, but with Crest Pro Health HD I noticed a difference immediately.  My teeth felt clean and refreshed and beautifully white after the first use.  I have also started carrying this in my bag because it is perfect for those sudden photo ops, such as a new identification badge at work, or after my morning coffee(s).  After a couple weeks of use my teeth are still white and I have gotten several compliments and requests for what I am using.  I did notice some slight sensitivity, but I have had this happen in the past with all forms of whitening, so  it was expected.  Absolutely happy with this product and would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I love the fact that it is simple to use, just two things to use as you would normal toothpaste and you are done. You really do not spend any more time doing this then you would normally to brush your teeth. The taste takes a little getting used to but it is not horrible. I liek the fact that there is a noticeable difference even after a few uses. I had my teeth whitened years ago in a dentists office and it was uncomfortable, painful and made my teeth very sensitive. I have not had any of those issues with this product and I like the fact it will be much cheaper than the dentist office whitening. I would recommend if you are needing something that works without going out of your way to use it. I received this free from Crest for a Bzz agent campaign and am so glad I was able to try it.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean when using this product, but I have not noticed any difference in how white they are after 2 weeks of using it religiously.  I got this as a free sample from BzzAgent and would not purchase this on my own once my sample runs out.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I am a BzzAgent and Crest sent me this product to try for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first received the Crest Pro-Health HD toothpaste, I was very excited, but also very skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used any whitening strips or gels, etc., the only thing I have tried to brighten my smile is a whitening toothpaste.  In fact that is the only kind I get from the store.  It has to say &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; on the box.  Although, I&#x27;m not sure why I even bothered, because from my experience, I have never used whitening toothpaste that actually made my teeth whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, that has all changed since I started using the Crest Pro Health HD about 6 weeks ago.  For the first time in my life, I have noticed that my teeth are actually whiter from a toothpaste, and that is a great feeling!  Additionally, my friends and family have noticed it too and want to try this toothpaste now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not just whiter teeth I&#x27;ve noticed either.  My teeth feel &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34;...they are smooth all day, even after I eat!  They feel the way they do when I leave the dentist office after having them scraped and polished...which is very painful (at least for me anyway).  That &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling after a dentist visit is the best, but it never lasts more than a few days after brushing with a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; toothpaste.  So, even though I haven&#x27;t been to the dentist since using this toothpaste, it feels like I have, which is so awesome!  I am even excited to go to the dentist (crazy huh???) to hear what they think of my teeth!  I&#x27;m curious to find out if my mouth is, in fact, healthier from what it usually is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this product is great and actually really does work, there are some negatives that I will address:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It is a 2 step process, which can be annoying, especially in the morning when you are tired and in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. My gums were sore and turned whitish in spots for the first few weeks of using this toothpaste.  I did stick it out, however I had to cut back to using this product only once a day until my mouth was able to adjust.  Personally, I thought of the pain as a good sign that the whitening part was actually working!  But, I could see how this would cause someone to stop using it altogether.  I guess it just depends on the person and their individual tolerance level.  I was willing to deal with a little discomfort because the toothpaste was working and I could see the results.thpaste.

            <li> I got this item free via BzzAgent. The paste in step 1 leaves your mouth feeling dry but not uncomfortable. After using the gel, it feels smoother and cleaner. I see a very silght difference in my teeth color. I plan on buying another pack to continue using it bc I noticed i have less plaque build up.</li>
            <li> I have paid lots of money for lots of different teeth whitening products.  I love this product because #1 it works, and #2 it&#x27;s actually affordable!  It not only does a great job whitening my teeth, but it makes my mouth feel clean and healthy as well!  This product is definitely one worth trying!</li>
            <li> My mom is a Dentist so suffice it to say that I&#x27;ve tried more than a few different toothpastes.  I&#x27;ve recently been using Sensodyne until I received this as part of a promotion from Crest.  Let me start off by saying I&#x27;m a convert.  I have had sensitivity issues that have not happened at all since I switched.  The most important change for me is every time I&#x27;ve brushed my teeth my teeth never feel smooth like they do right after a dental cleaning when my teeth are polished, until now.  I don&#x27;t think I can say I&#x27;ve ever really enjoyed brushing my teeth. I have been using the system now for about 2 weeks and my teeth look much brighter, I actually had a coworker ask me what I changed about my appearance.  This is definitely a product I will be using for a long time!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I used it for 1 week and noticed a huge difference in the color of my teeth.  I felt like my teeth stayed cleaner longer during the day and in the morning I woke with them feeling clean still.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a product testing review as part of a promotion from the Crest.  I really love the clean feeling after using the paste and its so nice and convenient that the whitener is included. I&#x27;m more likely to use it that way.  I agree with other users that I brush longer which is probably a good thing.</li>
            <li> My teeth really feel very clean and are getting slightly more white.  I also like the taste.  The only down side is having two different steps but I think the benefits outweigh this.  Glad I was able to try this with a free promotion.</li>
            <li> I have been putting off writing this review in hopes to have something exciting to report. I haven&#x27;t noticed a drastic enough improvement in the whiteness of my teeth to tell people they HAVE to try this product, or that it is worth the money (although I got it free from the company as a BzzAgent). My husband and I noticed that one of the main ingredients is hydrogen peroxide, so it seems feasible that you may get similar results by rinsing regularly with that. I have noticed an improvement in severity of morning breath, but not an elimination of it. I also feel like my teeth possibly feel smoother, but I would credit that more to brushing longer when using two steps than I normally did with one toothpaste. I used a toothpaste where the main ingredient was baking soda, prior to this. I feel like the baking soda may be as effective at whitening as this. Perhaps, though, I may have naturally yellow teeth? If you are up for trying something new that is less expensive than some other options, it can&#x27;t hurt to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> Only a few days after using Crest Pro-Health HD mouth felt the cleanest it has in years, like the way it feels after going to get a cleaning. After a week I have also noticed a my teeth are getting noticeably whiter. Love this new toothpaste!!! Also, I got to try this product free thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li> I was putting off a gum scraping caused by gingivitis along my lower gum line.  I used this product for a month and at my next visit, the hygienist said that she saw noticeable improvement from my previous visit.  I&#x27;m excited to think that this product may help keep me from a very painful procedure.  I love the tingling/tightness I feel in my gums after step 1, and my teeth appear whiter as well.  A little on the expensive side, but if it can improve the health of my smile, I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> After using the Crest Pro Health HD system for a few weeks, I can safely say that my teeth and mouth do feel cleaner than regular toothpaste and for longer.  I can also say that the whole thing is a bit of a process. Having to brush, spit, don&#x27;t rinse, brush again, and then rinse takes some getting used to after a lifetime of one step cleaning. The end result is worth it though. IF you do forget and rinse before step 2, your mouth doesn&#x27;t quiet feel the same. Also, step 2 really tastes just like your brushing with gel hydrogen peroxide. The toothpaste is also runnier than regular toothpaste so be prepared to change a few shirts if you&#x27;re not paying attention. I received the product as part of a promotion from Crest through Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I received this Crest Pro Health HD to try for free as part of BzzAgent. The product consists of a toothpaste and a whitening gel. The directions are to brush at least 2 times a day. Each time you brush, use the toothpaste for 1 minute (you can spit but not rinse) and then use the whitening gel for 1 minute. It&#x27;s not time consuming or hard to use. It fits in pretty easily to a regular brushing routine. I use a regular manual toothbrush. The toothpaste feels like regular Crest toothpaste and tastes fine. The whitening gel tasted pretty nasty. I definitely wanted to spit out immediately but didn&#x27;t so I could give the product a chance and judge its effectiveness. It&#x27;s been over a week and I do not notice a change in my teeth. Friends have not noticed a change in my teeth. My teeth were not terribly discolored to begin with, so maybe it works well for those people. I don&#x27;t regularly drink coffee or tea. I don&#x27;t think this product whitens teeth very well. In addition, I found this product on the shelf at a local store and it costs more than the price of 2 toothpaste tubes, so it is not low cost but is cheaper than a whitening procedure at the dentist.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this from #BzzAgent and tried it for 3 weeks brushing twice a day following packaged instructions.  I did not see any significant change in tooth color.  I was disappointed but figured I needed to just use the product longer.  Then I decided to try another toothpaste from a competitor and not only was able to see results but my teeth feel clean.  I strongly disliked the way my teeth felt after using Crest Pro Health HD.  They never felt clean and I also seem to have a film on my teeth (maybe from the step 2).  I use a Sonicare electric toothbrush and had been previously happy about how clean my teeth felt using said toothbrush but this toothpaste and whitening gel took that away.  I&#x27;m sorry to say that I am not happy with this product.  I will be using my other whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I have tried several teeth whiteners before, gels, strips, etc. etc. and the same problem always seemed to occur, they made my teeth VERY sensitive.  After a couple weeks use I would have to discontinue using the product because I could not stand the heightened sensitivity.  So when I was able to try the CrestHD for free through a promotion from Crest, I figured I&#x27;d give one more product a try.  So now after using Crest HD for approximately a month, I have had NO sensitivity issues.  My teeth actually feel cleaner and I must say that I, and my wife, can see a difference in the whiteness of my teeth, maybe not 6X brighter but a difference none-the-less.  My mouth definitely feels fresher while using this product.  The only thing so far that I can say would be a drawback is that after brushing, my tongue, roof of mouth and cheeks seem to feel a little dry, or gritty.  Not sure if it is something in the 1st step toothpaste or what, but it doesn&#x27;t last long enough or is enough of a deterrent to stop me from using the HD toothpaste.  I also don&#x27;t even mind the brush time being a little longer than usual.  I do believe that Crest has made me a believer in teeth whitening without the uncomfortable sensitivity...!</li>
            <li> Awesome!!! I was a bit annoyed at first because there are two steps but after two weeks I see it as the shampoo and conditioner for my teeth! I tried going back to my old toothpaste but my mouth doesn&#x27;t feel as clean anymore.... This is my new toothpaste!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste works great, works fast, feels good. The only complaint I have it I wish it tasted a little better. I was able to try it through the survey site im on bzzagent. You get free things for doing surveys and all you have to do is review the products. Its great!</li>
            <li> I received this free from crest. So my opinions are totally my own. I find the packaging a bit odd. I would like to see the two tubes both have flip tops. It&#x27;s hard to remember to stop mid brush, not spit and use a second tube that you have to put down your toothbrush to unscrew a cap. I think it works well though despite the design flaw. I didn&#x27;t feel any burn and I did like the taste. The first tube has an odd flat and gummy feel to it. The very foamy like I&#x27;m used with my own toothpaste but once you add the second paste it foams and bubbles up nicely. Overall, I would purchase with my own money but only on sale or with a coupon.</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro-Health HD from the manufacturer. I was skeptical at first. Every other toothpaste that claimed whiter teeth fell short on their promise. Not only are my teeth whiter but they feel clean and fresh all day. I have found my new toothpaste. If you are looking for a great toothpaste then you need to buy Crest HD.</li>
            <li> I like it, it is easy and it actually makes me brush for at least 2 minutes. At first i thought it would be a pain but it really isnt anything more than just one more step. I also feel my teeth are whiter and i have received compliments that my teeth look whiter from friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flavor is good and isnt too minty and the gel isnt like some gels where they have a weird after taste. All -in -all it is a good toothpaste that does have resutls</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest, I have been able to try this product for FREE through BzzAgent.  I LOVE it.  In just a couple of quick steps, my teeth feel squeaky clean and white.  It took me a couple of tries to get the directions correct &#x3D;) , but after that it was smooth sailing.  My dental hygienist even remarked on how white she thought my teeth looked!  Nothing&#x27;s perfect, though, and I do notice that my mouth seems dry for about 30 minutes after use.  This is a trade off I&#x27;m willing to make for the other benefits this product offers.</li>
            <li> Works as it States it does but needs a sensitivity treatment added and a better flavor. It tastes horrible! Thanks crest for letting me try it but I wouldn&#x27;t pay $13 for it.</li>
            <li> Thank you Crest for allowing me to test this product.  My mouth has never felt or looked better! I am able to achieve that &#x27;just left the dentist&#x27; feeling everyday! My teeth are whiter, smoother, and my breath is more fresh since starting this product.  With this product I am able to quit wasting money on at home whitening kits that don&#x27;t work! This product promises and follows through! A+++</li>
            <li> I got my Crest Pro Heath HD sample for free from Crest via BzzAgent  and was so excited to try this!! I&#x27;ve tried many products for teeth whitening but many do not work because they require that you put paste or a strip on your teeth. When I put these on, saliva takes over and it all washed off.. but with this!!.. WOW I was literally blown away after the first brushing. I could instantly feel that my teeth felt polished, my breath was fresher and my mouth felt clean! I used the toothpaste twice a day for about 5 days and then my gums began to be a little sore. I was one of the unfortunate souls that had their gums slightly burnt by the polishing paste (the whiteness on your gums the package talks about). But never fear.. I skipped one brushing went back to my normal toothpaste (also a crest product) and was back with the Pro Heath HD the next night. I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste regimen for about a month now and I LOVE IT!. The gum tenderness is no longer an issue and morning breath is a thing of the past! The first step of the paste tastes like a regular mint toothpaste and the second step is more of a peroxide taste- keep it off of your tongue and on your teeth and you will be fine. As for whitening.. I didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference with that but I&#x27;m loving the way my mouth feels healthier!</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro Health HD for free to try through BzzAgent. At first I was a little skeptical about the two step process but after trying it I didn&#x27;t have a problem with it. The toothpaste left my teeth feeling extra clean and while I didn&#x27;t notice a whitening difference right away I did by the end of the 2nd week. The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for is the strong after taste it left in my mouth, but I talked with other people who used Crest Pro Health HD and they didn&#x27;t have this problem so it could just be me. I suggest you give it a try and see for yourself. The only thing you have to lose is yellow teeth.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Better than strips that only touch the front surfaces. I do wish there was literature on whether it can strip enamel from your teeth and cause sensitivity. I noticed results after the first time I used it on my tea-stained teeth.</li>
            <li> For gradual whitening that doesn&#x27;t increase tooth sensitivity this is the toothpaste for you! I have tried many whitening gels/toothpastes/strips and all made my teeth ultra sensitive to pretty my much everything I ate. That is not the cause the Crest Pro Health HD! Not only does it whiten it leaves your teeth feeling clean and healthy. I was pleasantly surprised how clean my teeth were using this tooth paste. Within a week I saw a decrease in the amount if plaque on my teeth! The 2 step process is a breeze. I originally thought it would be a hassle but it isn&#x27;t and I enjoy the 2 different pastes. First you clean then you polish and whitten it is the perfect mix! And it only takes 2 minutes!! I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;I was given a free sample to try in return for my review.</li>
            <li> As someone who regularly uses White Strips for whitening my teeth, I was excited to try the new Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step toothpaste as apart of the BzzAgent.com campaign.&lt;br /&gt;I use my Sonicare toothbrush with the Crest Pro-Health HD system, and it works perfectly for me because I&#x27;ll know when my first minute is up and I then move onto the second step. I don&#x27;t mind the two separate steps because it ensures that I brush for the two minutes as recommended  by my dentist. The first step tastes like any other toothpaste while Step 2 is full-on hydrogen peroxide smell. My mouth feels minty-fresh after each use, and because it&#x27;s a gradual whitening effect, I actually did not notice what a difference it makes on the brightness of my teeth until a coworker complimented on my white teeth!&lt;br /&gt;The 2-step toothpaste system requires more effort than simply applying White Strips, but I feel like the extra time and effort is worth it because not only does your teeth get whiter with each use, your mouth is also left feeling clean and fresh, which I appreciate! #GotItFree #Bzzagent</li>
            <li> I received the Crest Pro Health HD 2-step process free thanks to Crest. Although I was skeptical at first, after only a few weeks, my pearly whites actually sparkle! I have not only received compliments, but actually can see the results staring at me in the mirror every morning.  It&#x27;s really my new healthy obsession!  #SeeingIsBelieving</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to sample Crest Pro-health HD Daily for free thanks to Crest. I used it twice a day for two weeks straight. I loved the clean feel it left but I didn&#x27;t notice a huge change. Although my husband already thinks I have super white teeth to begin with. I would buy this product just for the way it leaves my mouth feeling afterwards!</li>
            <li> I received the Crest Pro-Health Daily Two-Step Toothpaste as a Bzzzz Kit. I will have to say that I would have never seen this item in the store and purchased it because I would feel like it wasn&#x27;t worth the money. After trying the product for now 4 weeks, I am glad I received this sample and I will be purchasing more in the future! The two step process really cleans your teeth and I can tell a huge difference from using regular toothpaste. The BEST part of this product is that my &amp;#34;morning breath&amp;#34; is extremely reduced! That aspect of the product really does work. My teeth do not feel as furry or dirty all day (or in the morning) as with other toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 out of 5 stars is because the whitening aspect of this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t live up to the 6X as advertised. I have noticed a slight whiter appearance in my teeth but as a once a year Crest Whitening System user, this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t come close to the strips. It is still a GREAT toothpaste but I still need to use the strips once a year.</li>
            <li> Being in HR i know 1st impressions are everything! Whether its simple everyday activities, meeting new employees, or greeting vendors or Executives, your smile &amp; teeth are your most prized possession. So treat them right! In just 2 weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed how much whiter my teeth are (&amp; so have my coworkers!)! So join me in making your smile what they noticed about you &amp; remember! Pick some up at your local @Target</li>
            <li> I got this for free through BzzAgent so the price was right!  I had high hopes, but the results have been so-so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have tried a lot of whitening products and this one seems to be about the same as any other. on the plus side it&#x27;s not any worse either. It is definitely more convenient than the strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; this is a two-part product. first you brush with what seems like just a regular toothpaste. no problem with that. then you brush again with the whitening gel at first I was brushing all of my teeth with the whitening gel but after awhile I  just brushed my front teeth. I don&#x27;t smile big enough for anyone to see any further than that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I say give it a try. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with it. It&#x27;s just not anything special either in my opinion. it did make my teeth whiter, so it does work.</li>
            <li> Definitely saw whiter teeth, but it took a few weeks. I got accustom to using two tubes, for a minute each. Used my electric toothbrush w/ a built in timer so I was sure to always do a minute per step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a kit free from Crest</li>
            <li> I am LOVING this product! I received a free full size sample from Crest. The two-step process makes my teeth feel so clean, and they are noticeably whiter. I&#x27;m heading to the dentist next month and I am feeling a great report from my hygienist coming on. My teeth haven&#x27;t felt this clean in a long time. The taste took me a bit to get used to, but now it&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
            <li> I received the new Crest Pro- Health HD Daily Two Step Toothpaste through a BzzAgent campaign.  When I first received it, I was a little hesitant in the amount of time it would take every time I brushed my teeth but once I used it, I forgot all about the time as I love how clean it makes my teeth feel.  It is amazing and the clean feeling lasts all day.  I feel like I have had my teeth cleaned professionally every day and love it! I have been using another toothpaste with whitener and thought it was the best until this product came along.  Will definitely be a repeat customer now that I am hooked!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type of person who would rather go to the dentist than go grocery shopping.  (Am I the only one?). I love the just cleaned feeling of shiny, smooth teeth after every visit with a hygienist.  I have never been able to replicate that feeling.  It seems to vanish days later so for those those two blissful visits a year to the dentist, I cherish that silky smooth feeling and the weird tiny gap between the bottom of my front lower teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my dental world was flipped upside down when one afternoon a week or two into using Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste, I realized that I was continually running my tongue along my teeth. I was confused at first, then quickly realized that my teeth were super clean and had that tiny gap between the front bottom teeth. I ran to a mirror to examine my mouth.  I was shocked and delighted by how shiny my teeth looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had only been using Crest Pro Health HD once a day and my regular toothpaste at other times.  So if you use it as directed, twice a day, you will likely have faster results and your teeth will probably be whiter than mine.  The taste of the toothpaste is fantastic.  It tastes like a baking soda and peroxide toothpaste, if you have ever used one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste has made brushing my teeth a pampering ritual (and I don&#x27;t feel so guilty about not flossing).  I am so glad I received a sample from Crest and BzzAgent to review with my honest opinion.  I never would have picked this up off the shelf, but this will always be in stock in my bathroom from now on!</li>
            <li> I was provided this product to try by Crest via BzzAgent and I was very excited to try Crest Pro Health HD and was curious to know if this tag-team option would work for me. Skepticism aside, I have tried several whitening options over the years, but they never really work.  This product, however, is a winner. My teeth are generally whiter, which is good since I drink coffee and soda regularly.  I used this product the first time and really liked how simple it is to use.  I was a bit surprised at the specificity of the use instructions, but they are simple. My teeth appear whiter and it looks more natural. I would say that I have seen several shades improvement, which is a good thing.  For a short, 2 minute process this is simple and has positive effects. I noticed that there was a possibility for white spotting on my gums but did not have any negative effects. Overall this product worked very well and I would buy it again soon!</li>
            <li> After receiving a free sample, I&#x27;ve been trying Crest Pro Health HD for a few weeks and I love how white my teeth are looking. They have a noticible difference and seem to sparkle! I have started to recieve more compliments on my smile and the yellowness that happens over time is disappearing into a beautiful white sparkle...</li>
            <li> I love having clean teeth. Having just had a baby this past year, I wasn&#x27;t doing the best I could to take care of my teeth, then I got the opportunity to sample the Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing &amp; Whitening System for free and loooove it! From the very first brush, I felt like I had just been to the dentist. My teeth felt smooth and I loved the minty fresh breath! This two step system is easy and convenient for every day use and is truly the Power Couple for my mouth :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste comes in two tubes. I followed the directions very carefully. I used one for a minute and then tube two for a minute. I made sure not to rinse my mouth in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first tubes active ingredients are Stannous Fluoride 0.454%. After completing this first step, my mouth felt so clean - the toothpaste reached in between my teeth and left no plaque behind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second tube lists full ingredients of Water, Glycerin, Hydrogen Peroxide, Carbomer, Disodium Pryophosphate, Flavor, Sucralose, Sodium Hydroxide. The whitener is just standard Hydrogen Peroxide in a gel. After completing this second step, I will admit, I had tears in my eyes from how minty it was - BUT, my breath stayed so fresh for the whole day AND the whitening step didn&#x27;t sting my gums like others have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure, I got this product free from Crest, via the Bzz marketing company.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product out thanks to Crest free of charge. Overall the product has done some great things. It makes my mouth feel cleaner longer throughout the day which is a great plus. It does give an odd sensation while using the product that I was not used to, but overall the product is good.</li>
            <li> I received this free thanks to Crest to try out.  I think that Crest Pro Health HD is a good product-it made my teeth a bit whiter and my mouth does feel healthy.  I did not notice a difference after my first use in regards to whiter teeth, but after a week or so, my teeth did appear whiter.  I gave it four out of five stars because I don&#x27;t think it really helped with morning breath and the freshness didn&#x27;t last that long after use.</li>
            <li> Works, doesn&#x27;t hurt, and is easy and pleasurable to use daily. Worth it.</li>
            <li> I like the feeling of newly cleaned teeth, and I think this toothpaste delivers that.The extra step isn&#x27;t too bad, and is worth it. My teeth look a little whiter, but they feel clean and thats the most important part. I like this new toothpaste. I was able to try this product as part of thr promotion for the brand, but I love it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from it, but was pleasantly surprised. After almost two weeks there was a significant difference and by brushing essentially twice each time, I brush longer and my gums seem healthier too!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love. Just had my checkup after using this for a month now and she could tell the difference. I&#x27;m glad i took the time and followed the 2-step process - I made sure I kept it up and used it as it was designed. Now I don&#x27;t even have to watch the clock to make sure I am brushing as long as I need too - it&#x27;s habit!! you won&#x27;t be sorry! #HealthyObsession I got to try it FREE thanks to Crest and once it was gone I&#x27;ve bought more @Walmart!</li>
            <li> I really like how clean my mouth feels for HOURS after using this product, especially if I use it at night! I wake up with really smooth and clean teeth. I have only been using it for about 2 weeks, and haven&#x27;t noticed my teeth getting any whiter, but will continue to use it just to see if it will whiten my teeth more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this as a free sample from Crest to test and use. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I received the Crest Pro Health HD system free as a Bzz Agent.  In the beginning, I was skeptical, as I had used whitening strips before that had left me less than impressed.  But I opted to give this a shot, as I truly would love whiter teeth without the cost of having it done at the dentist.  Initially I wasn&#x27;t so sure the process was worth it.  While the two step process didn&#x27;t take much longer than regular brushing, I just wasn&#x27;t sure I was seeing the results in the mirror.  I used the product for about two weeks and then decided it wasn&#x27;t for me.  That is until I posted a rare selfie on Instagram from an anniversary outing with my husband.  In that picture, I could truly see the difference!  And I have used the product every day since!  It was truly the easiest whitening system out there with the best results!</li>
            <li> I had been unhappy with the color of my teeth for some time and had considered buying a product when I was invited to the Crest Pro Health® HD™ bzz campaign. I had a few reservations. I have used white strips in the past and my teeth were left quite sensitive. I also had a broken front tooth as a child and I&#x27;m always concerned that the filling portion will not whiten the same. I tried the Crest Pro Health® HD™  And to my surprise, I am very pleased with the results. I used the kit 2x a day for 10 days. While I found it challenging to brush my teeth for 2 full minutes, there was a noticeable difference after. My breath was extremely fresh and my mouth felt much cleaner than with any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve used. My teeth are significantly whiter, the filling matches my natural teeth, and they never became sensitive. The first two days were torture, as my gums were very sensitive. I think it was because I was not used to brushing my teeth that long. The paste left my mouth almost burning from the intense mint, but it was refreshing. I also noticed that the whitening portion left marks on my gums where there was damage, and as time passed by, these spots improved and many disappeared. It helped me to pay more attention to these spots so I can watch for changes. The swelling of my gums decreased as well over the course of 10 days. I would absolutely recommend Crest Pro Health® HD™ to anyone looking to whiten their smile and get a healthier mouth.</li>
            <li> Being a natural toothpaste convert for the past year- the only reason I decided to use the Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste set was because I wanted whiter teeth! I received a free set to test and review from Crest, and it seemed like the best opportunity as I had already thrown out my other, older whitening products without realising that natural toothpastes, baking soda and white vinegar aren&#x27;t the quickest methods in brightening your smile! The usage is pretty straight forward- you use the tube marked 1 like a regular toothpaste (though this one contains Stannous fluoride which is better against plaque) and brush for 2 minutes, spit it out and without rinsing your mouth or the brush, apply the tube marked 2 on the brush which is the whitening gel and brush for another minute. That&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw a difference within the first 2 days itself of using this set twice a day as usual and in a week&#x27;s time I had the whitest teeth I&#x27;ve ever had, including a fresh breath and overall clean feeling in my mouth! I did switch back to my natural toothpaste as I&#x27;m trying to get rid of my fluoride consumption as much as possible, but use the Crest Pro health HD atleast 2 times a week as maintenance and it seems to be working brilliantly this way! Being a natural toothpaste convert for the past year- the only reason I decided to use the Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste set was because I wanted whiter teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I took off a star in my rating is because I began to find the toothpaste (tube 1) too sweet, almost sickeningly so! The set does live up to what it promises on every account- a brighter smile, fresher breath etc, but the taste really gets to me. Another factor I found, which may or not not be connected to this toothpaste combo, would be that I develop a slight pain in my molars each time I use this product, which lasts for about half the day! I haven&#x27;t been able to thoroughly verify this, but I do know that I don&#x27;t have any cavities or issues at present. I plan to continue using this product on a twice weekly basis, and will move onto other Crest whitening products when I come to the end of these tubes- probably the Crest 3d white polishing treatment in addition to my current natural toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Crest Pro Health HD whitening toothpaste for free to use and review from Crest via Bzzagent, and have only presented my honest opinions on the product as a consumer..

            <li> I have naturally white teeth but when you drink red wine or drink tea, you&#x27;ll notice your teeth aren&#x27;t nearly as white as they once were. I received this *free* from Crest to try since I am a BzzAgent. I started using this and I noticed almost immediately my teeth were brighter. I do have a veneer so I have to be careful when it comes to whitening my teeth. I have been happy with the results. It has a little bit of a grittiness to it that I honestly love! It makes my teeth feel so clean! If you don&#x27;t want to paint something on your teeth or stick on those little strips that make your gums feel weird, this is your answer!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I have never heard of brushing my teeth twice with 2 different tubes of toothpaste. Now I am a believer in this incredible product, after using it for 2 months. My mouth has never felt so clean before. The clean feeling is very long lasting as well. It also helps whitening better than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried in the past! It does take 2 minute longer to brush my teeth twice, but the result is totally worth it. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have been using this two step product for about a month and a half now. It works great and is perfect for use between or instead of teeth whitening sessions at the dentist or at home.  I can easily see the difference when I use the system vs regular toothpaste.  I was on vacation a week and didn&#x27;t take it with me and I could see the whiteness fading.  One brushing though and my teeth were back on their way to whiteness again.  I am using the product courtesy of Crest but I will definitely buy it on my own when my free sample runs out.</li>
            <li> Loved it! When I first received my product sample from Bzz agent I was a little skeptical of the two step process. I am a mother of two young children and my mornings are already hectic as it is, but the process literally only takes two minutes. After a week I already began noticing an improvement in the whiteness of my teeth. Also, after brushing my mouth felt cleaner and fresh. I&#x27;ll be continuing to use this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I received a sample kit of the Crest HD system through BzzAgent. I did use the product for two weeks following the directions but couldn&#x27;t manage any longer because of the taste and poorly designed lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 2 parts to this toothpaste: Step 1 is the cleaning step. It is normal toothpaste with refreshing flavor that actually left my teeth feeling pretty clean. After 1 minute you stop brushing and put step 2 onto your toothbrush without rinsing between steps. Step 2 is a bleaching gel and doesn&#x27;t taste good. At all...I think the strong flavor of step 1 helps mask the poor taste, but it leaves a bad flavor in your mouth for a long time. After another minute you are done and you rinse as normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This two part system is a little more inconvenient than normal toothpaste, but probably better than whitening trays. It wouldn&#x27;t have been a problem, except I didn&#x27;t see a difference in my tooth color after 2 weeks. For me, it was not worth the hassle. My mouth did feel clean, but I did not like the aftertaste or the sensation left by the bleaching agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found the packaging to be strange. Step 1 is a flip cap that is easy to open. Step 2 is a screw cap that if you forget to open before you brush, is hard to open one handed...it&#x27;s just stupid and I couldn&#x27;t manage the stupidity of it all for longer than two weeks. I&#x27;m back to my regular toothpaste now. I might consider finishing up the Step 1 tube and toss Step 2. I don&#x27;t need that kind of negativity in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applaud Crest for indulging somebody&#x27;s new idea. It just doesn&#x27;t deliver enough of a difference in results to make up for the extra hassle.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the results of a whiter smile! It was nice when other people noticed it even my clients at work noticed, I didn&#x27;t know if I was flattered or embarrassed but it proved to me that the product worked.  Brushing is a two step process and since I use a battery powered toothbrush I would have to remember to turn it off and not rinse it in between the process was a bit cumbersome but the results where real.  It did not leave me breath like ninja kickin&#x27; clean and fresh like other crest toothpaste.  I have a new dental routine and for now on it is going to be Crest HD in the morning and a regular crest at night just so I can get the freshness before bed. The results are real and I am a believer!</li>
            <li> This system is great!  My teeth look amazing, and I still have half tubes of each step!  I am so excited to see how much whiter my teeth can get, and I love that I have no sensitivity like when I use white strips.  The two-step process is really not a big deal to me and SO worth it!  I received it free from Crest as part of a promotion, but I will be purchasing this again when the time comes.  Amazing product!</li>
            <li> I received crest pro health hd two step free to review from bzz agent. At first I was thinking why brush my teeth twice.  That seems time consuming. But I was open minded and tried the product and was so glad I did.  It doesn&#x27;t take twice as long.  One minute with each step. In fact changing steps almost makes it feel faster.  The result is so worth it! My teeth have never felt so clean for so long with an at home product.  Honestly feel as clean as a trip to the dentist! The taste is good to me- not overpowering.  The gel is a little strange texturally at the beginning but not bad and got used to it quickly.  Overall I would highly highly recommended this product! I will be using again :)</li>
            <li> I received this to try through Bzzagent and I love it. From the very first use my teeth felt cleaner like I had just walked out of the dentist office. I also noticed that they were whiter, especially after a few uses. I also noticed that my teeth were not sensitive like when I use white strips.</li>
            <li> This new Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste system really makes my mouth feel super-clean, and I have noticed a slight improvement in the whiteness of my teeth as well.  But the primary advantage I feel of this is the the extra plaque removal and gingivitis protection.  The two steps, although a different way to brush, are very easy -- just a minute for each -- especially if have an electric toothbrush which already has timer.  The only one minor caution I would have is that it does not leave your breath very minty.  It doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming &amp;#34;medicine-y/peroxide&amp;#34; taste, but it also isn&#x27;t as refreshing as other toothpastes I typically use.  I could see this being a great item to rotate in and out of your brushing routine when want to up the cleanliness/whitening factor for a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I tried this for free thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love the all-day clean feeling I get from this toothpaste!  I was lucky enough to get a free sample to try out and I am a believer in the 2 tubes!  At first it seemed like the 2 tubes would take twice as long, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t.  I use a Sonicare brush and get started with step one.  While I wait for my timer beeps I get the 2nd tube open.  When its time I just spit and apply step 2 and restart my brush and wait for the brush cycle to end.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant change in the whiteness of my teeth, but I was happy with the color of my teeth to begin with.  I haven&#x27;t experienced any sensitivity that whitening toothpastes sometimes cause.  The big difference for me is how clean my teeth feel ALL DAY long, even after eating.  I would imagine that clean feeling translates to a healthier mouth as well.  Definitely worth a try and a little extra money than ordinary toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Saw whiter teeth in 1 week, no increase in improvement after 3 weeks.  Not the best taste, Slightly whiter teeth but not 6x as claim.  A little expensive for toothpaste, and a little more time consuming.  It also causes teeth sensativity and had to stop using. Got this product for free to try.</li>
            <li> The packaging is very attractive and colorful. The toothpaste squirts easily, and a little goes a long way. It leaves your teeth feeling clean and your breath so fresh that you don&#x27;t want to eat or drink anything after you&#x27;ve brushed!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember the last time I felt strongly enough about a product to write a review, but needed to share this one. I am so glad I got into Bzzagent and got a free sample of Crest Pro Health HD! I have never enjoyed brushing my teeth, but after this toothpaste my teeth actually feel like I just left the dentist - in a good way! They are smooth and shiny and after two weeks my family and I have all noticed that they are whiter than they had been. So sad I didn&#x27;t take a before picture. The smooth clean feeling lasts through food and sleep. Definitely encourages me to keep brushing.  My dentist tells me we are supposed to brush for 2 minutes anyway, so the 2 steps just keeps me honest.  Have not found it in the store yet so really glad to find it here on Amazon, and with a coupon no less.  Haven&#x27;t been letting my husband use it until I found out that I could get more :)</li>
            <li> I was able to receive this toothpaste as part of a promotion and I loved the clean, almost dentist visit feeling it gave my teeth.  I noticed that my teeth appeared a little whiter and brighter.  I was shocked at how the 2nd toothpaste made the foam/bubbles from the first go away.  I was hard to not rinse after the first brushing, but once I started bruching with Step 2, I understood why.  Will defintley be using until gone and purchasing a second kit.  I have sensitive teeth sometimes so I ususally use this toothpaste everyother day.  Good Job Crest!</li>
            <li> I received the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste to try for free compliments of Crest (and my being a Bzz agent).  I have to say that when I received the package  and saw that there were two products and two steps, I felt like it was going to make brushing my teeth more of a production and take longer than I had time for.  I was wrong.  It really takes about the same amount of time as with the toothpaste I regularly used in the past.  You use the first tube for a minute, spit and then brush with the second tube for a minute, spit, brush and rinse.  Two minutes is not long at all.  Plus I really like how clean my mouth felt afterwards.  It felt like I had just gone to the dentist; my teeth even felt really smooth.  My teeth do seem a little bit whiter after using for a few weeks so not only do I have clean teeth, they&#x27;re whiter.</li>
            <li> I really like the taste of this product. My mouth/teeth feel extra clean after using it.</li>
            <li> I found that the Crest PH Advanced kept my teeth feeling clean ALL day; even after eating. The whitening is a big bonus as my former sensitivity brand left my teeth looking dingy after several months use. I have sensitive teeth and will be using this product from now on!</li>
            <li> I found this product to leave my mouth and breath exceptionally fresh, even for hours afterwards. It had a lot of foam which I personally like and will be replacing my normal Sensodyne with this product!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this new Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste. Adding Crest Pro Health HD to my routine was easy.  First you spend 1 min brushing with what seems to be a traditional toothpaste and then you brush for 1 min with a polishing paste.  The polishing paste is where I think the magic happens.  It does taste a little different than typical toothpaste but is the same as whitening strips.  My teeth feel like I have just left the dentist chair.  I noticed this polished feeling after my very first use.  I also think my entire mouth feels fresher longer.  I have been using the product for about a month now and I think my teeth look whiter. I def plan on continuing to use Crest Pro Health HD.  It is way easire than using the whitening trays or strips.  Love that it doesn&#x27;t add any time to my routine. #gotitfree</li>
            <li> I received this kit for free from crest as a trial and boy am I glad I had the chance to try this out!  At first I thought it would be too time consuming with my hectic life but it takes as long as I would normally brush!  I am very happy with the result as well as I can definitely see a difference in my teeth appearance. They just look cleaner and whiter. I definitely recommend this product. Give it a try!!!</li>
            <li> I received a product sample as a member of Smiley 360. This is a truly amazing system! After only a few uses, I saw a HUGE difference in the appearance of my teeth and the brightness of my smile! Being a coffee and tea drinker, this is so beneficial! I love it and will continuer to use it regularly to keep my teeth and smile looking their best!</li>
            <li> About Me: I typically pick my toothpaste based on taste. I don&#x27;t have any special dental needs i.e. sensitivity, but do feel that I have thinner enamel. I normally use and continue to like Crest Complete with Scope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was sent to me free of charge for review through BzzAgent and Crest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Details: Crest Pro Health HD Two Step Daily System comes packaged with two tubes. Step 1 is a purifying cleanser that contains Stannous fluoride 0.454% as the active ingredient. This tube weights 4.0 oz. Step 2 is the whitening/polish step that contains a hydrogen peroxide whitening gel. This tube weighs 2.3 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage: The directions state to brush your teeth for 1 minute with Step 1. Spit. Do not rinse. Then brush your teeth for 1 minute with Step 2. At first, I was thoroughly annoyed with having to be bothered with having to do two separate steps. But in reality, it really wasn&#x27;t that much of a hassle. Once I got into the rhythm of brushing, spitting, remembering to not rinse!, and then repeating with step 2, I realized that it really wasn&#x27;t that more more work. If anything, I started to like it because it forced me to be more conscious about how long I was brushing my teeth. Sometimes, &amp;#34;two minutes&amp;#34; is probably more like 30 seconds when it&#x27;s late at night, and I&#x27;m a sleep zombie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: Honestly, I didn&#x27;t see much whitening effect. That might just be because I have thin enamel on my teeth which allows the yellower dentin to show through. The product claims to have 6x whiter teeth in 1 week. I used the product for about 3 weeks to see if I could see significant whitening, and unfortunately, I did not. This product also claims to have 6x healthier mouth. That I can almost believe, although I question how they truly quantify that. The purifying cleanser step definitely gave my mouth a squeaky clean feel that lasts all day. As far as the taste of the toothpaste, it&#x27;s not as minty fresh as Crest Complete Scope. But again, I didn&#x27;t mind because that because the &amp;#34;minty fresh&amp;#34; feeling was replaced by the &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; just got a &amp;#34;dental cleaning&amp;#34; feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: Overall, I think it&#x27;s a good product. I like the clean feeling that lasts all day. Again, maybe I have a predisposition with my teeth that does not allowing good whitening. I am going to have my husband test out the product to see if he sees any significant whitening. IF the whitening portion of the toothpaste does as it claims, then I can see the product being a good value. One of the things that I did have a question about was the large difference in tube size for Step1 and Step 2. I haven&#x27;t finished the product yet, so I can&#x27;t say if I will end up finishing one tube before the other. I will update as soon as I finish the product. Also, I noticed that some people stated sensitivity after using this product. Personally, I didn&#x27;t notice any sensitivity for me.again, I didn&#x27;t mind because that because the &amp;#34;minty fresh&amp;#34; feeling was replaced by the &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; just got a &amp;#34;dental cleaning&amp;#34; feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: Overall, I think it&#x27;s a good product.

            <li> I received Crest HD as part of the BzzAgent program and after a few weeks of using it I can see a visible difference in the shade of my teeth. I love that I can actually whiten my teeth without using strips or extra steps outside of my normal routine. However, it&#x27;s not totally within my normal routine because of the two step process which isn&#x27;t technically that much longer than the two minutes I typically brush, but seems ages longer when you&#x27;re tired at the end of the day. So much so that I sometimes drop the flossing from my routine on certain nights when I am normally a floss diehard. I think I would buy this product every six months as a way to refresh my smile but probably not as my daily go to...for both time and dollars.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Crest Pro Health® HD as a BzzAgent to test it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The official advertising copy reads: &amp;#34;Crest Pro Health® HD™, Crest’s biggest breakthrough in toothpaste since fluoride, changes the experience, from your routine to the results. You’ll feel the difference from the first use and have a 6x healthier mouth and 6x whiter teeth in one week.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 6x healthier and 6x whiter may be hard to measure, but here&#x27;s the lowdown (if you care).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell, if you use this product you spend an extra minute brushing, but the results are impressive. My teeth feel like I just left the dentist after a cleaning. Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first step involves a &amp;#34;not-too-abrasive cleaner.&amp;#34; (I&#x27;ve tried a lot worse.)&lt;br /&gt;The second step, I assume, is a protective polish of sorts.&lt;br /&gt;The combo works well, and the results certainly justify the extra minute of effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel &amp;#34;fresh from the dentist&amp;#34; clean and a little whiter. And that clean feeling lasts for hours!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ll bet much brighter or not, but it was easy, works well, and that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Good texture,flavor,leaves teeth and mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Crest Pro Health HD 2-step system for a few weeks now, thanks to Crest and BzzAgent. I&#x27;ve used other Crest and Crest Pro Health toothpastes in the past, but not for quite a while. I&#x27;ve also never used a 2-step teeth-cleaning system, so I was curious to see how it would compare with regular toothpaste. I&#x27;ve never really had luck with other whitening toothpastes making any sort of significant difference in the look/color of my teeth. For these reasons, I was hopeful that the Crest Pro Health HD paste would be noticeably different. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed and found this paste to just be average. While some other whitening toothpastes are too harsh/strong for me and irritate my gums/mouth, I am happy to say that this product did not. I also liked the mild minty flavor of the purifying cleanser (step 1). The perfecting gel used in step 2 doesn&#x27;t really seem to have a flavor to it (unless it&#x27;s masked by the mint of step 1 which isn&#x27;t rinsed out before you use step 2). I noticed on the label that the purifying cleanser contains stannous fluouride which, as the label also points out, can produce surface staining of the teeth. I found that fact a little bothersome and counterproductive. I&#x27;m not sure how much this product costs, but I&#x27;m guessing it is more expensive than your standard tube of toothpaste. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the extra money or the extra step that is required. I haven&#x27;t noticed any whitening of my teeth in the past few weeks, and someone actually took a close-up photo of me a couple weeks ago that made my teeth look more yellow than I thought they were! All in all, this toothpaste is nothing special, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I received this kit free from BzzAgent for honest opinion. After trying this for two weeks, I do not see a whiter difference in my teeth color. The instructions are easier to follow. The cleaner gave me a slight burning sensation when I put it on. My teeth felt very clean and my breath smelled fresh. Because the exciting part was how this could make your teeth 6x whiter, I diligently used this every time I brushed. But, I am disappointed to say it did not work for me. I will continue to use this until it is done. But, I would not go out and buy this.</li>
            <li> So, I received a free sample from Crest to try out. After being an avid Crest toothpaste user since my childhood, and hearing there was a new 2-part system for cleaning your teeth that would make them whiter and healthier, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I have always enjoyed the way Crest toothpaste leaves my mouth feeling and have always had great results keeping my teeth white with their products. Now before using this product, my teeth were already very white and knowing the results now,  I should have taken a photo before starting the new toothpaste. The toothpastes had a great taste to them and definitely left my mouth feeling clean, but there were two drawbacks in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;-The two step system just takes longer and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth the effort. That&#x27;s more to carry around when traveling and more times to setup/rinse the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;-The toothpaste was more liquid than other toothpastes, so this made brushing a mess. Usually there&#x27;s a little spray from washing the tops and bottoms of your teeth, but not like this toothpaste. The spray got everywhere and it just became a hassle to clean up..&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to the whitening power of this toothpaste system, which it make work much better than other toothpastes out there. After using this, I&#x27;m content with the other Crest toothpastes I&#x27;ve used in the past and don&#x27;t see a reason to switch.</li>
            <li> I am blown away by why Crest HD didn&#x27;t exist sooner! I don&#x27;t have to worry about my routine being altered. I already brush my teeth, so brushing with Crest HD is a no brainer because I literally have added no extra time in my quest for whiter teeth. I received this free by Crest to try out and I, hands down, will be buying this product every time.</li>
            <li> *I received Crest Pro Health HD free as a promotion from the brand and am reviewing it based on my experience with the product.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial review after 2 days of use (my update after 1 week is included at the bottom):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Teeth definitely feel cleaner: Before using this regimen, I used to feel plaque stuck to my teeth when running my tongue over my teeth throughout the day. I&#x27;ve noticed that after using CPH HD most of my teeth (with the exception of some back molars) feel smooth and plaque-less all day. And even though the molars do not feel completely clean all day, they still feel cleaner than they did before using this product. - Teeth slightly whiter: After 2 days, I think that my teeth do look a little bit whiter. Since the product claims teeth will be 6x whiter after 1 week, I will give it a few more days to see if I see more dramatic results.&lt;br /&gt;- 2 step system easy to use: Brushing 1 minute with each of the 2 toothpastes is easy enough. I love the feeling of the first step as it foams up and works to remove plaque - it kind of reminds me of scrubbing our tub clean! Its minty taste is on par with other toothpastes. As for the second step, I like it a little less because its taste is not as pleasant. Another reviewer described said it reminded her of how hydrogen peroxide tastes and I&#x27;d tend to agree. However, this step does really smooth out your teeth after the first step cleans it, which I suppose is the &amp;#34;polishing&amp;#34; part. All in all, after 2 days, I&#x27;m pretty happy with Crest Pro Health HD so far. Now I just have to check back in a week regarding the whitening results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE* After a week of using Crest Pro Health HD I still find its 2-step regimen very easy and convenient to use. In addition to the clean feeling I get from Step 1 and the polished feeling I get from Step 2 (which pretty much lasts throughout the day), I&#x27;ve noticed that my breath is indeed fresher (especially in the morning - I am no longer self conscious about lingering morning breath). And I no longer notice the peroxide-like taste from gel in Step 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the one thing I was most excited to test was Crest Pro Health HD&#x27;s claim to whiten teeth up to 6x after a week&#x27;s use. The product fell a bit short of the 6x claim, but I&#x27;d say that it whitened my teeth maybe about 2-3x, which I&#x27;d still consider a success (hence my 4 star rating). I&#x27;d also like to note that I think the color on my teeth looks a bit more even (meaning that specific stains do not seem to stand out as much).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all that said, I think I would repurchase this product (although I do acknowledge that the $15 price point is a little higher than I&#x27;d like to spend on toothpaste). However, I had taken a break from using Crest Pro Health HD for a few days and I felt plaque build up much quicker on my teeth throughout the day when using regular toothpaste. So even though I only partially experienced its claims for teeth whitening, I felt it did improve my overall oral health, making it worth buying.ous about lingering morning breath).

            <li> Good overall product.  Cleans well, lightened well, the only thing I did not like about it is I wish it had more flavor (mint).  Gradually whites teeth, with continued use.  No tingling problems, pain problems, or whitening of the gums as others have reported on their reviews. (Note: I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.)</li>
            <li> I am trying this product free thanks to Crest, my daughter and myself have been using this and have seen tremendous results. The dual process is kind of a hassle but the end results have been great.  I would highly recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> So far, I have really liked using the new Crest Pro Health HD. The two-step process has been a little difficult to get used to. You are supposed to use the first gel, spit it out but not rinse, then apply the second gel. Many times, I have just used the first - spit it out and rinsed because I forgot. It&#x27;s a small thing, but if there were some way it could be in one tube - it would be wonderful. It&#x27;s a great thing to do if you are wanting a cheap way to whiten teeth, super easy, and won&#x27;t make teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have been using this new 2 step process for a few weeks now. I am really liking the results. My teeth feel healthy but they also look healthier. I’ve noticed they are getting more whiter and brighter! I also feel that the 2 step process helps to force me to brush for a full 2 minutes. In the past, I never really paid attention to how long I brushed and I know it was never for 2 minutes like your supposed to. Now I pay more attention and make sure I brush for 1 minute using step 1 and another minute using step 2. I’m really happy with this product over all.</li>
            <li> I received the Crest Pro Health HD kit free from BzzAgent to review.  I am always looking for something new to try so I was excited to give this a go.  I used this product once a day for 14 days straight, without using any other products in-between.  I would set my timer for 1 minute for the cleaning gel and then again for 1 minute for the polishing gel.  I also tried very hard not to eat or drink anything for 30 minutes after using, although the package didn&#x27;t instruct me to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flavor: I wasn&#x27;t super excited about the flavor.  The polishing gel definitely had a chemical/bleachy taste to it.  The cleaning gel flavor wasn&#x27;t so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whitening: Im not sure this product did a superb job at making my teeth whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean feel:  I definitely feel like my teeth were very clean after using this product.  Im not sure if I attribute that to the product itself or the fact that I normally don&#x27;t brush for 2 solid minutes every day and I did during this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convenience: Not so much... it would be great if this product were combined into one gel.  Maybe that would eliminate or at least mask the bleach taste I had after the polishing gel.  I&#x27;m not sure if there is a scientific reason to using the two gels separately, other than committing to two minutes of brushing versus one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I would use this product again if it were given to me but would not run out and purchase it.  I don&#x27;t think I will be replacing my current regular toothpaste with this product as it didn&#x27;t&#x27; necessarily prove to be beneficial to me.</li>
            <li> Took some time to see results but when I did I loved it. Honestly I am an impatient person so  when I didn&#x27;t see results right away I hesitated to use again. But after reading the direction again it says that you will see results in about a week. So I gave it that amount of time and saw results. I could feel the difference in my teeth on how clean and white they were. It only takes a minute longer than using just one toothpaste. so it definitely isn&#x27;t time consuming.</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro-Health HD free from BzzAgent for testing purposes. I was initially unsure about the 2-step process but it&#x27;s super easy and really doesn&#x27;t take that much extra time. It leaves my teeth feeling dentist clean, and the feeling lasts so much longer than regular toothpaste! I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s helping with whitening my teeth really, but the clean feeling is enough to keep me using it. Step one is a simple toothpaste, but it&#x27;s weird because you aren&#x27;t to rinse after brushing, which is hard to get used to. The second step is a clear gel, and it&#x27;s hard to know just how much to use and the taste of it is a little weird but you get used to it. It&#x27;s a small thing but I wish that the 2 bottles were identical - either both with a flip cap or both with a screw on cap. The inconsistency is a little irritating but all in all, I would probably buy it again. However, I haven&#x27;t really seen a difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free, thanks to Crest &amp; BzzAgent. I am a regular Crest user, but had never tried this product before and I was really excited about this product! The 2 step process seemed a bit time consuming, (having 2 little ones, I&#x27;m lucky to get a quick brush in twice a day!), but it really didn&#x27;t take too long! After using the toothpaste for about a week, I was very pleasently surprised with the noticeable difference in my tooth color, much whiter! I was, however, disappointed with the taste of the toothpaste and the after taste it left when I was done brushing. I never really felt like I had that clean mouth feel or freshness. It lacked the minty taste that I like in a toothpaste. I feel like I need to have a piece of gum right after brushing. Ultimately, I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this product. I would like something that whitens and makes my mouth feel fresh!</li>
            <li> This product is really great for 2 reasons, 1) reduces morning breath, 2) whites teeth.  I have an upcoming dentist visit and i bet they will noticed a difference in my plaque build up - less of course!  I should note I received free product from Crest for a trial</li>
            <li> I tried this product free from Crest through the BuzzAgent campaign.  I had pretty high expectations, and hoped I had a solution for whiter teeth that wouldn&#x27;t require those gross strips.  Overall, it was ok but something I&#x27;m pretty ambivalent about.  I think the biggest difference came from me being very careful to time myself when brushing my teeth to make sure I was spending a full 60 seconds on each step...this honestly probably increased my total brush time by ~30 seconds twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For whitening: there may have been a slight difference, but it might have all been in my head - certainly not as much as I&#x27;d seen with some of the whitening strips in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For breath: no noticeable difference. If I had to say something, I think I actually prefer my old toothpaste, this felt more &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; and therefore less effective (but could again all be in my head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re looking to whiten, go with strips.  If you&#x27;re looking to improve breath, add mouthwash.  Was ok but not something I&#x27;d recommend or advise against...really nothing special.</li>
            <li> I got this product called Crest Pro-health HD Daily Two Step Toothpaste to try it for free through a Marketing Company. Let me first talk about the packaging because it what we see first. The kit had a pull tab at one end but it was still not very easy to open the kit. I absolutely dislike packaging that are hard to open, Inside there were two tubes in gray and blue color. I loved that both the tubes had different color to avoid confusion (like the step 1 one had a gray colored tube and blue cap and step 2 had gray cap and blue tube. All the steps are clearly written on both  tubes which is  very easy to understand. Step one has  flip cap and step 2 has a screw cap. But I found it very hard to understand that Step 1 has 4 oz of toothpaste and step 2 has 2.3 oz.I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to figure it out what will I do if the step 2 runs faster than the step 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I&#x27;m not a fan of Stand up Tubes because the toothpaste keeps seeping out until we are ready to use it next and gets clogged up in the cap and the mouth of the tube giving it a very messy appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions very well by reading it multiple times so that I don&#x27;t skip anything and do anything wrong which will give me wrong results. I had to use the step one first .Step 1 is a Purifying Cleanser  that strips away the plaque.This toothpaste is a bluish green in color and looks like a regular gel type toothpaste. But it has a medicinal flavor which I didn&#x27;t like and we have  to brush my teeth with this toothpaste for 1 minute. It doesn&#x27;t foam in the mouth so  I guess that it will take time  for me to to get used to this type of toothpaste because I have been using toothpastes that foam in the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After brushing with step 1 toothpaste , I felt a fuzzy feeling in my teeth that normally we get after eating spinach (I didn&#x27;t like this feeling at all). Next step was to use the step 2 with out rinsing mouth or the toothbrush which again I will  have to get used to it and I have to keep reminding myself not to put the toothbrush under water. The step 2 toothpaste is gel type too but it is in clear color and it is very runny and I guess that it warms up in our dry mouth and becomes further more runny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t tell as yet if it made my teeth white or not but it does give a clean feeling in the mouth when I run my tongue over my teeth. Flavor wise this toothpaste is very weak.Price wise this toothpaste is very expensive so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll be buying it in the future or not. It didn&#x27;t do anything to freshen up my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: Except for receiving the kit for free, I wasn&#x27;t compensated in any other way and all the thoughts in this reviews are mine based on my personal experience after using it for the required amount of days (5 days).d to it and I have to keep reminding myself not to put the toothbrush under water.

            <li> I recently received a free full size sample of Crest Pro Health HD to try,  and although I wasn&#x27;t expecting to, I love the feeling of my clean teeth after the 2 step process of Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste.  Previously I&#x27;ve used a baking soda/peroxide formula to brush, and it leaves a strange tingling feeling on my tongue. I don&#x27;t have that with my first month of using Crest Pro Health HD. My teeth get a good cleaning with the grit of Step 1&#x27;s Purifying Cleanser. It&#x27;s just the right amount and size so that you don&#x27;t have that sandy feeling when you&#x27;re ready for Step 2&#x27;s Perfecting Gel. Step 2 is a thin gel (not thick &amp; pasty like most gel toothpastes) that leaves the bristles squeaking over my teeth by the end of the minute you spend on Step 2. I was very surprised that Crest Pro Health HD did not have the powerful minty taste that most toothpastes leave afterward. It&#x27;s just a hint of fresh mint. 2 Steps, 1 minute each step - white and clean, polished feeling teeth. 2 more months until my next regular dental check-in and we&#x27;ll see how she feels about Crest Pro Health HD. I have a feeling she&#x27;s going to verify what I already feel - less plaque buildup and healthy, white teeth!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Crest Pro Health HD system for 4.5 weeks as part of a product testing campaign for bzzagent.  I am totally in love with the effects of this dental cleaning system.  I drink black tea most of the day, so my teeth do have some staining on them.  After a week of using this product, my teeth were noticeably whiter.  After several weeks, they were remarkably whiter.  My breath is fresher.  With the continued use, my oral health has continued to improve.  My bleeding gums have drastically improved along with the general feel of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working this into my general morning routine was easy, truthfully minimal change from what I did before.  It takes about 2 minutes to complete both steps, so there isn&#x27;t additional wait time like there is with the whitening strips or similar products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to find this product in my local stores, so that was a good thing for when I need a refill.  The price is higher than regular toothpaste, however that would be expected given that this is more than just a toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I was slightly skeptical as to whether or not this would actually work. I&#x27;d tried a few whitening toothpastes and hadn&#x27;t been impressed, but I&#x27;d received this as a free sample. I also didn&#x27;t like the idea of having to use two different products. However, I was pleasantly surprised. My teeth were whiter after a just a few uses.  My teeth feel cleaner and look extremely whiter. The two products still only take two minutes to use, so it&#x27;s actually not a huge change to my normal routine. After almost a month I&#x27;m never going back to regular toothpaste. However, I should state that I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth are mildly more sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a week now and I can definitely see that my teeth are getting whiter and they feel cleaner too. It did make my gums a little sensitive but that seems to be getting better as I have continued to use it.</li>
            <li> Give you a healthier and whiter smile in two easy steps.  I love the ease of use every morning.  Easy way to get a whiter smile and a fresh feeling all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample to trial from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I never thought that I&#x27;d switch from the Crest  3D White toothpaste and accompanying Crest Brilliance polish that I&#x27;ve been using for the past year, but I did and am very pleased, as was my dentist who feels that this new approach is the wave of the future.  He said that people won&#x27;t brush unless they like the taste of the toothpaste and he&#x27;s right.  This new Two-Step has a great taste and the fact that the first tube  helps to get rid of plaque while the second tube polishes and whitens makes it the best mouth product I&#x27;ve ever used.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I am a member of BzzAgent, a social marketing company. They sent me the new Crest Pro-Health HD two-step toothpaste system to try. Step 1 is a purifying cleanser that is supposed to strip plaque away, and Step 2 is a perfecting gel that is said to polish and whiten teeth. Crest claims a 6x healthier mouth and 6x whiter teeth in one week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the two-step system for about a week, I cannot say for sure that it has whitened my teeth, as I did not take a before photo or intensely study the color of my teeth.  However, it has many positives, including: I have not experienced any sensitivity like with other whitening systems I have tried before, neither gel has an unpleasant taste, and my teeth feel clean after brushing (although perhaps not as minty fresh as with other toothpastes). I had a dentist appointment last week and my dentist commented that my teeth are very white, but it was only a couple days after I had started using the system so I don’t think it was as a result of that, and he always says that anyway (but they are not as white as I would ultimately like them to be). My dentist said some whitening toothpastes are very harsh on teeth, but he was not concerned about me using Crest Pro-Health HD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives: The two-step process is a bit annoying and when you are using an electric toothbrush that automatically shuts off after two minutes, you have to carefully watch the clock to notice when it’s time to spit out the first step and move on to the second. It’s also expensive for toothpaste but if it works, the system is much cheaper and convenient than using whitening strips or getting your teeth professionally whitened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue to use Crest Pro-Health HD until the containers are empty, but I haven’t decided yet if I will purchase it on my own afterward.</li>
            <li> I received the new Crest Pro Health 2 step whitening system  free from Bzz Agent to sample for free.  I like this system because it is really easy to use. Step 1 involves stripping away plaque by putting the purifying cleanser on your toothbrush. The hardest thing to remember for me is not rinsing my mouth as has been my habit for years, just need to get use to this step so I can use product properly. The next step involves adding the clear perfecting gel to your toothbrush, and brushing for another minute or so to polish and whiten. Again trying not to split before you had enough time was difficult to remember but working on this so breaking habits of swishing a spiting to quickly.  But the effort seems to be working and looks to be worth it so far.  Step 2 gel taste different because it contains hydrogen peroxide in it. My teeth felt as smooth right after brushing and felt and stayed smooth for most of the tie till I ate another meal which is really a fantastic plus, I hate feeling my teeth are dity and constantly picking and cleaning at them all day long because I hate the feeling so much. My teeth are pretty white to begin with but I did notice a whiter appearance on a few teeth more than others so this is a plus for me.  I also worried that the lighting my cause sensitivity in my teeth as some whiting products have done in the past but so far I have not noticed a change in my teeth so far in using this product. The system at the store cost 14.99, so it is an economical way to take care of your teeth and look whiter and fresher. Definitely less cost than a dentist whiting for hundreds of dollars. I am Definitely recommending this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided to give this system a try for a week and see how I&#x27;d feel about the product then.&lt;br /&gt;The results after using Crest HD Pro-Health Daily 2 step System:&lt;br /&gt;- It was easy to incorporate 2 steps in my morning routine and it took 2 minutes of my time.&lt;br /&gt;- I like that 2 ingredients are marked Step 1 and 2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole process in the morning took almost the same amount of time I usually spend in the morning brushing my teeth but the feeling of freshness and cleanness AFTER was quite impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue to use Crest HD Pro-Health Daily 2 Step System in a place of my regular toothpaste and recommend it to people. If I can get double benefits in the same amount of time I&#x27;m all for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Crest HD Pro-Health Daily 2 step System for free thanks to BzzzAgent but all opinions 100% mine.</li>
            <li> As a BzzAgent, I got to try Crest Pro-Health HD from Crest.  I have been using Crest Pro-Health HD for almost a month and I think that my teeth feel super clean and have dramatically whitened.  After just brushing my teeth for a week with it, my teeth felt healthier and my smile looked brighter.  It&#x27;s a really easy process:  you use Step One for 1 minute to remove plaque and protect teeth with fluoride, then you use Step Two for 1 minute to whiten, polish, and rinse your teeth.  I really like the idea of keeping it simple by just brushing your teeth.  In the short time I&#x27;ve been using it, I feel like it&#x27;s made a big improvement with my teeth.  I especially like how easy it is to use and how great your mouth feels after; like you&#x27;ve had your teeth polished at the dentist.  I highly recommend this product and am sure this is going to be my regular \\&quot;toothpaste\\&quot; from now on.</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro Health HD complimentary from BzzAgent for testing purposes. All opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest Pro Health HD is a 2 step process to help make your mouth healthier and your teeth whiter. The smart thing that Crest did was making this your everyday brushing routine. It only takes 2 minutes... the same as your brushing routine already. Step 1 Purifying Cleanser helps strip away plaque. This toothpaste is thicker than most and doesn&#x27;t have a strong mint taste. After brushing with this, you spit but do not rinse. Then add Step 2 Perfecting Gel  to polish and whiten teeth. This step is the gel you would typically see in the whitening strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I did notice that my breath was fresher and that my teeth were whiter; however, I discovered this was only temporary. I stopped for a few days to see what would happen and my teeth were right back where they were before. Also, if you have  any sensitivity to other whitening products, you will probably have the same with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I thought the product was good. I would not use it for everyday, but rather save it for when I have an event or upcoming pictures.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of whitening treatments. Strips, gel, toothpaste, you name it. And I can honestly say that nothing has ever worked as well as Crest HD. I grew up in the South. Sweet tea and coffee are a must have, but they cause a lot of staining. After using Crest HD I felt like I could tell a difference after 1 use. My teeth were squeaky clean as though I has just been to the dentist. I really like that the whitening gel is hydrogen peroxide based. I usually have sensitivity after using whitening products but not this one. Some people say it&#x27;s expensive for toothpaste and I can see that argument. But on the other hand it&#x27;s no more expensive( and much cheaper) than other whitening products. Not only that but my mouth feels much cleaner and healthier after using it. Thanks Crest for finally making a product that works!</li>
            <li> OK so I bought these after I felt my regular whitening toothpaste wasn&#x27;t cutting it.  I tried it out, and within the first 2 days I dramatically saw the difference.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for a couple of weeks and am satisfied, but its not meant to completely whiten your teeth, it just lightens the shade, for a deeper whitening you might need to go to the Crest Strips.</li>
            <li> I received this toothpaste free to review and I was skeptical. I had been using my old toothpaste for years and never even wanted to try another one. But I did receive an email from Bzzagent about this two step toothpaste and I was intrigued. After using it one time I was hooked!!  I continued to use it and not only did my teeth feel cleaner they were whiter. I&#x27;ll be purchasing more when my sample runs out.</li>
            <li> It took me a few tries to get adjusted to the routine of spitting without rinsing before I went on to step 2 but within a week, I had it down pat! I love that it ensures I don&#x27;t rush when I brush, so my teeth ALWAYS feel cleaner - even when I am falling asleep while brushing. I believe it has whitened my teeth somewhat, but I am also a red wine &amp; coffee drinker, so at least it is keeping the new stains at bay. It is a little more on the expensive side than your usual toothpaste but it is less than the strips and I never liked the feeling of the strips on my teeth - too gunky. Overall,  I am happy with this new product.&lt;br /&gt;Note: I tried this for free, thanks to Crest. I would however, purchase it on my own to keep using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since around February 1st and I have to say I love the super clean feeling and no morning breath. I understand that some people may be hesitant to try it because its two tubes and you brush with each product for one minute. If you think about it its really no longer than you normally are suppose to brush (the recommended two minutes). The biggest issue I had was remembering not to rinse between products. I can not say how well the whitening system works as I did not see a difference because my teeth are already white. At the start of using the system I did have some gum irritation using step two but, the literature with the product warns of this. After a few days this irritation went away. I would love if they had just a tooth paste that provided the awesome clean feeling. Its as if I just had my teeth cleaned after every use my mouth feels fresh and clean and my teeth feel smooth as glass. I am rating this product a 4 out of 5 stars only because I truly can not comment on the whiting effect of this product. I got to try this product for free from Crest through Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li> Since quitting smoking 1.5 years ago I have been meticulous about oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt; What I like: I do notice a reduction in the visible hard plaque that resides on a particular area on my teeth. That plaque is no longer visible! My teeth are somewhat whiter but no where near the 6x whiter claimed (I drink coffee daily and red wine several times a week). The 2 step system forces me to brush thoroughly and longer than I normally would.&lt;br /&gt;What I Don&#x27;t like: The 2 steps are too complicated in the morning when I&#x27;m half asleep (but not a problem at night). I&#x27;m lucky I remember to put on pants in the morning never mind brush twice. It&#x27;s not that it takes longer it&#x27;s just an additional step I could do without. The price in relation to the amount of product you get is outrageous in my opinion even with 2 tubes. Daily use Toothpaste should not be a splurge. I was lucky enough to receive Crest Pro Health® HD complementary via bzzagent. My husband who does not take care of his teeth at all (hasn&#x27;t been to the dentist in a decade) has been sneaking my Crest Pro Health® HD because he has a lot of plaque and Step 1 makes him feel like he is doing something good for his health. This may be main reason why I purchase such an expensive kit again. The Bottom Line: Crest Pro Health® HD is expensive, product doesn&#x27;t last long,is annoying in the morning but does control plaque, may whiten teeth and makes you feel proactive about your oral hygiene in between dentist visits. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> Tastes great &amp; I notice a difference, slightly whiter teeth after a couple weeks use twice daily</li>
            <li> The Crest Pro-Health Two-Step system is amazing. Not only does my mouth feel fresher and healthier, but my teeth are noticeably whiter and my breath stays fresher. I would highly recommend this product to everyone. I now have my entire family using the Pro-Health Two-Step system! I was able to try this system free from BzzAgent, but now I purchase it regularly. Thanks, Crest, for a great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty good tooth brusher. My hygienist compliments my brushing and flossing each time I come in for a cleaning (2x/year). In other words, I know how to keep my teeth clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let me tell you about my experience with Crest Pro Health HD. When Bzzagent offered me the chance to try this product, I was somewhat excited. Hey, free toothpaste! Right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now that I&#x27;ve actually been using Pro Health HD, I&#x27;m really glad I signed up. The promise is that you&#x27;ll have 6x whiter teeth in a week. Tooth &amp;#34;whiteness&amp;#34; has never been that big of a deal to me, but maybe that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m not a smoker or coffee drinker, so my teeth stay pretty white on their own with regular brushing. So I was surprised that after only a few days, my teeth seemed whiter, brighter. Not in a fakey, car-salesman kind of way, but in a real, &amp;#34;hey- you-have-nice-teeth&amp;#34; kind of way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s how it works. Pro Health HD is a two-step brushing process. Step one feels and tastes like normal toothpaste, but with a little extra texture from the baking soda. You brush with that for one minute, then spit. DON&#x27;T RINSE YET! (And don&#x27;t rinse your toothbrush either.) Step 2 doesn&#x27;t look or taste or feel much like normal toothpaste. It&#x27;s absolutely clear, and less-viscous than toothpaste, and sort of absorbs into the bristles of your tooth brush. This is the peroxide, and I assume &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; step that Step 1 has just prepped you for. I&#x27;ll admit that the for the first few times, I didn&#x27;t like the taste of Step 2, but that was because of the peroxide. After that, I didn&#x27;t mind it so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of things you&#x27;ll have noticed. Yes, it takes longer, and yes, you&#x27;re brushing your teeth twice. Which begs the question: Could I get the same result just brushing my teeth twice with normal toothpaste?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(This is a non-scientific answer, but deal with it. I&#x27;m not a scientist.) No, and here&#x27;s why. The two-step process uses different products that are complementary, not the same product twice. Step 1 is the cleaner. It strips all the bad stuff away and preps your teeth for Step 2 by leaving some of the baking soda in your mouth. Step 2 is the polishing stage. Anything you missed in step one is annihilated, and the peroxide reacts with the baking soda to deep clean and polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what do I think? I think that I have never before used a toothpaste or cleaning system that has made my teeth feel so clean as Pro Health HD. Honest. It is literally the closest thing I&#x27;ve experienced to the feeling of getting my teeth cleaned at the dentist, only much more convenient. And my teeth seem whiter. I say &amp;#34;seem&amp;#34; because I didn&#x27;t take before and after photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any downsides? Brushing twice takes twice as long, so if you&#x27;re in a hurry, this is not the way to go. For the first couple of weeks trying this product, I used it exclusively. I&#x27;ll admit that it made my mouth and gums a little sensitive, but when I backed off a little, that went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this stuff rocks. I only use it once a day now, at night before bed. In the morning I use regular toothpaste. I think this method gives me the benefits of using Pro Health HD, but saves me time in the morning. Plus, this stuff is a little pricey, so I think this is a great way to get the product benefits but without having to buy it as often. I&#x27;d go full bore for a week or two when you first buy this, though. That way you get the full whitening effect.are complementary, not the same product twice. Step 1 is the cleaner.

            <li> I received this system as part of a promotion. I did some a slight improvement in the brightness of my teeth. My teeth didn&#x27;t feel as clean as they do with my regular toothpaste. I ended up using both this system and my regular toothpaste to ensure my teeth were totally clean</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try Crest Pro Health HD becasue I have noticed for some time that my teeth had a yellowinsh tint to them.  I tried this product as a promotion from the brand.  This product claimed to provide a healthier mouth and 6 times whiter teeth in one week.  I have used Crest toothpast my entire life so the product brought instant credibility to me.  The packaging of the Crest Pro Health HD was eye catching.  The packaging colors pop at you and had a sparkle that was appealing to me.  There are two tubes of paste inside the packaging.  This is a short two step process that takes two minutes each time you use it.  The insturctions could not be any simplier.  The first tube of paste is clearly marked Step 1. You brush with this cleaning paste for one minute.  After a minute you do not rinse and then move on to step 2.  Step 2 is the whitening gel.  Once again you brush for a minute and then rinse when finished.  How easier can this get?  You don&#x27;t have to mess around with sticking strips of bleeching tape on your teeth.  This was very easy and efficient!  After using the Crest Pro Health HD, my mouth definitely feels  cleaner than before. I really noticed that this product eliminates plaque build-up.  When I floss, I no longer have plaque.  My dental hygenist is going to be happy!  After using the whitening gel, I did notice an immiediate difference in my teeth getting whiter.  The yellow tint on my teeth was gone.  However, it seemed like that my teeth only got a few shades whiter.  They did not become glow in the dark white as I have seen on some of my co-workers after they get the whitening treatment from their dentist office.  I was a little disappointed in the lack of whitening and it just seemed like after hitting a certain shade right off the bat, the product stalled out even though I used it night after night.  I noticed somewhat of a difference but I did not get any comments from my wife or kids about my teeth getting whiter.  I did not have any difficulty with sensitivity after using this product.  Overall, I feel as though Crest Pro Health HD makes my mouth feel cleaner, but did not seem to make my teeth white enough to make me want to buy the product. I would only recommend this product if you wanted to get rid of plaque and at the same time get rid of any yellowish tint you might have to your teeth.ifficulty with sensitivity after using this product.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been on this for several weeks and so far i have seen notable brightness in my teeth. My fresh breath lasts longer and my mouth feels much cleaner. The first step cleans my mouth well and i like to focus the 2nd step gel on my teeth and it works great. Will keep using #gotitfree #Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I received a free package of the new Crest ProHealth HD as a BzzAgent. I like the original Crest ProHealth and was interested in getting whiter teeth without the aggravation  of using whitening strips or trays. I found that Crest ProHealth HD worked effectively and it was easy to use. Also, because you brush one minute first with the ProHealth tube and then brush for one minute with the whitening/polishing gel, you are making sure that you&#x27;re brushing as much as your dentist recommends! The whitening/polishing gel was gentle on my teeth, and didn&#x27;t cause sensitivity the way trays or whitening strips do sometimes, and also had a pleasant taste. Best of all, the whole procedure doesn&#x27;t take any longer than your usual brushing time. I drink tea and coffee every day, and I was able to notice visible whitening after a day&#x27;s brushing. It doesn&#x27;t get your teeth that &amp;#34;glow in the dark&amp;#34; white, but if you want a natural-looking, clean, healthy-looking white, this 2-step system works great.</li>
            <li> Amazing results after two weeks of use!  I got this free to test, and I was skeptical of needing two different toothpastes to get this job done.  I was quickly shown the difference:  The two products work in conjunction to whiten and polish teeth, removing stains and build up deposited over time.  It&#x27;s fabulous!  I liked it far better than the 3D Vivid White toothpastes and other whitening products I&#x27;ve used over the years.  The different toothpastes have unusual textures, but they&#x27;re not unlike other whitening or prescription toothpastes I&#x27;ve used.  I think you&#x27;ll like it too!</li>
            <li> After a week of using Crest Pro Health Advance, my mouth feels cleaner and my teeth are noticably whiter already.</li>
            <li> When I first heard about Crest Pro Health HD, I have to admit that I had hoped it would involve a bit of magic. I thought that maybe there was finally a simple (although a bit pricey) way to get impressive whitening + cleaning results in no time at all. What I found is that the toothpaste works well to clean my teeth and I do feel that the second gel tub adds a special layer of protection but I cannot say I&#x27;ve seen a stark change in the whiteness of my teeth. An unexpected benefit of the two tube system is that it makes the two minutes you&#x27;re supposed to brush your teeth go by a lot faster because you have more to do during that time. The instructions suggest using the paste from tube one for about one minute and the same for the gel (no rising till you&#x27;re done!). It took a few days for me to get the routine down but now I appreciate using a system that I feel not only cleans my teeth but then protects (and maybe slowly whitens?) them. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend Crest Pro Health HD because while it may not make magic in your mouth, it does make it feel clean and fresh all day with an added polish. I received the product for free from Crest as part of being a Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li> This hurt my teeth and gums. I did not like that it had the two steps, and the taste was a little blah. I wasn&#x27;t able to use it more than a couple days because of the pain on my gums so I am not sure if it whitened them at all.  I received this to try to free from BzzAgent and Crest.</li>
            <li> I received the Crest Pro Health® HD from Crest to try it out for over a month and to comment on my experience using this product.  Upon receiving this product, I noticed the easy instructions to following that are printed on the box and on each of the two tubes.  I did notice the warning statement which stated that I should discontinue use if there is any pain, discomfort, or whitening of the gums while using this product.  Based on my past experience using Crest Whitestripes that left my gums extremely sensitive, I was a bit hesitate in trying this product.&lt;br /&gt;After a month of use, I have not encountered any change in gum sensitivity which is great!  This two-step system which includes a purifying cleaner and perfecting gel does work to clean and brighten your teeth.  After the first use, I did notice some results.  My teeth did appear to be whiter but not six times whiter since it was the first use.  Over the course of a month, my teeth have become whiter.  In the course of a month, I had to use my old toothpaste while I was traveling and did not feel like my teeth were clean and bright afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;The retail cost for this product is around $13.00, which seems a bit much for toothpaste.  When you factor in the cost of whitening strips and toothpaste it is basically a wash.  This product is great for use in between dental cleanings to keep your teeth clean and white.</li>
            <li> After the first use, my teeth looked whiter and felt very clean, dentist clean! I was not expecting that as the box says it would take 6 weeks. I tried the product for free, courtesy of Crest. The picture is after 7 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 2 steps, first you brush for one minute with the toothpaste which has a nice subtle flavor. Then, you brush with the (kind of flavorless) gel for one minute. Then, you feel like you just left the dentist&#x27;s office. Your teeth are smooth and clean and your teeth really look whiter! I am a daily coffee drinker, but every morning, I get a fresh white smile. That clean feeling lasts the entire day. I have been brushing with this toothpaste for 7 weeks now and it really is my new healthy obsession. I have tried other whitening toothpastes. They have NOTHING on this one! They did not make my teeth look whiter. This toothpaste is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any &amp;#34;signals&amp;#34; as Crest calls them. No sensitivity in my teeth. No other issues with use. The only drawback for me is that I have to keep the tubes away from the children as it is not for use in people under age 12.</li>
            <li> I received sample of Crest Pro Health HD for free to try through BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;The product boasts 6x healthier and whiter teeth in a week, so I used it for a week before writing my reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Glad they came out with this instead of whiting stripes.&lt;br /&gt;Cause with whiting stripes you are not getting all in there… example yellowish / discolored between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;This process makes you feel clean and your teeth feel smooth.&lt;br /&gt;This is a 2 step process that was easier compared to other products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;The tubes are labeled which helps when rushing in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;The 2 part is like polishing your teeth (the hair spray for your hair) – the finishing touch&lt;br /&gt;In many wats I felt like the 2nd part replaced your mouthwash&lt;br /&gt;The wintergreen flavor was nice&lt;br /&gt;I did notice a slightly brighter smile at the end of the week.&lt;br /&gt;Even helped my breathe too.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health HD is the most amazing product ever! I don&#x27;t know how I went so long without it. It gives that fresh out of the dentist feeling every time you brush #HealthyObsession #Sponsored&lt;br /&gt;Since using the product there is not a speck of tarter on my teeth and they always feel squeaky clean. My teeth are noticeably whiter sine using Crest Pro Health HD.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Crest Pro Health HD for over three weeks now and this is my review after a good usage of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crest Pro Health HD is a two step process to get Healthier and Whiter teeth. As given in the instruction, Step 1 is to brush teeth using the STEP 1 paste for about 1 minute. After STEP 1 is done, SPIT but do not RINSE the teeth with water. Use the gel from STEP 2 tube and polish the teeth for about 1 minute. Once both the steps are done in the order defined; spit and rinse the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Crest HD for about three weeks now and I was able to see difference in my teeth from Yellow to a very light yellow (but not super white like few others has posted). The product is effective but not in a week&#x27;s time frame. I also thought that the idea of two different tubes could have been combined in one tube (like 2-in-1 toothpaste) and thus reducing the usage to just one toothpaste with shinning gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Crest Pro Health HD toothpaste to try for free.</li>
            <li> I am blown away by this toothpaste!  It makes my mouth feel like I have had a professional cleaning, and it is amazing to know I can get those results in a few minutes from the comfort of my own home.  On top of just feeling overall great, my teeth have whitened considerably.  I prefer this method of whitening to strips, because I don&#x27;t have to sit around with something slimy on my mouth for any length of time.  Instead, set a timer and brush for a few minutes!  So much easier and because of that I have been using this product regularly and getting great results.  I did receive this product free from the brand as part of a promotion, but I will definitely be repurchasing with my own money and recommending to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> Whitens my teeth pretty quick, though I&#x27;m not sure I have seen six shades whiter yet. I will for sure continue to use the product until it is gone. I was given a chance to try this product for free, and after three weeks I would recommend my friends and family to buy it and try for themselves. I&#x27;m not overly wowed, but it is a product that works!</li>
            <li> I recently received a full size PR Sample of this product.  I have used it now for about a month and I have to say I&#x27;m on the fence. The biggest positive to this product is the near instant and thus gratifying whiting.  I never have the patience for strips.  Its a given I will be brushing my teeth and for that reason, this is a time saver and less of a hassle.  I used mine with an oral b pro brush, and while you might think that skews the results, I have never seen whiting results like this with any other paste and my electric brush.  My superficial stains are noticeably gone and most importantly, my teeth always appear 1-2 shades lighter after use.  I prefer to brush my teeth for a full 2 minutes with the &#x27;step 1&#x27; to get an adequate clean and cavity prevention, and 1 minute with the &#x27;step 2&#x27; whitening paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The down side to this is this leaves a terrible film in you mouth. I felt it most noticeably on my cheeks.  It almost felt like I hadn&#x27;t rinsed my mouth completely.  In reality, I had rinsed probably 3-4 times in desperation to get the film off.  Despite this issue, if you are willing to go for a very thorough rinse and deal with a mild film thereafter which does fade.  This gives a great whitening effect. I will say, I have had poor experiences in the past with Crest whitening products tasting awful.  I think the combination of left over paste residue and the improved taste of the whitening product has really helped.  It&#x27;s very benign in my view and I&#x27;m very picky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a nice product to use a few times a week or on special occasions for an quick and noticeable whitening effect. Just save time for that 3th or 4th rinse!</li>
            <li> So I got  a change to try  Crest Pro Health® HD free courtesy of Crest. The following are my own opinions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying the two step process for over 2 weeks I did not see any improvement in the whiting in my teeth and my teeth never really felt all that clean no matter how many times I tried. All in all I wouldnt buy this again.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free courtesy of Crest.  I really enjoyed the way this product whitened my teeth.  My teeth did become noticeably whiter and I even had people comment on it.  I liked the taste and ease of use.  My only criticism is that I would prefer to just use one product not two.  I found that part of the product to be more time consuming than I would have preferred.  Other than that I would definitely recommend and will likely repurchase when depleted.  It did overall make my mouth feel and look healthier and my teeth felt smooth and polished.</li>
            <li> Great product! Tried it through bzzagent and made video link below:&lt;br /&gt;https://youtu.be/SuyVNFhyCio</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this 2 Step system. Went for my dental cleaning and she could not get over how great my teeth looked. They had less tartar build-up and we&#x27;re whiter. Love how my teeth look and feel!</li>
            <li> This product does what it advertises! Consistent whitening of teeth on a daily basis, not just a 10 minute, harsh, whitening product that doesn&#x27;t last. Mouth feels fresh and clean after every use!</li>
            <li> Step one was really difficult to dispence, as it was extremely thick. I really think it would be difficult for anyone who has difficulty squeezing hard. The toothpaste was a good quality and my teeth felt clean after using it. The step two gel was just the opposite: very easy to squeeze...so much so that I over squeezed the first time and it fell into the sink. As for making my teeth whiter...it&#x27;s a gradual process. Don&#x27;t expect results over night. It is easier on your teeth than those strips, though. My teeth were not sensitive after using it.</li>
            <li> With all the claims of one toothpaste being able to clean, whiten, etc it is refreshing to see a dental care system that shows specialized products are probably better. The system consists of two products; step 1 purifying cleanser and step 2 perfecting gel.&lt;br /&gt;The system worked well for me, leaving my mouth feeling very fresh for hours after brushing. I&#x27;m not sure about the whitening claim at this time and will withhold judgement on that for now. I am not sure what price point this product will be because I was given this free to review but hopefully it will be under $15.&lt;br /&gt;This product is worth trying if you are willing to use a two step dental care system.</li>
            <li> I recently received a sample of crest pro healthy HD daily two step toothpaste to try.  I was amazed just how great of a job it did on my teeth.  Crest has never let me down and this product is a keeper in our home.  It is well worth the money.  It works exactly as it says it will.  A very effective product from a very trusted brand.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Got this for free and was really excited to try it. Was a little put off at first by having to spend a bit more time brushing my teeth with a 2-step process, but it was really fast and easy and my teeth actually felt cleaner and smoother and brighter after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I got this as part of a promotion from the brand and was pretty excited to try it out. It was intense, like that feeling you get from that super powered stuff you get at the dentist or one of those breath strips. Except this lasts for quite a while. I would have given this 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t take that much longer than my usual routine and have the need for two separate tubes. Other than that I really liked it! I&#x27;m going to keep using it to see how much whiter my teeth get.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.  From day one I could feel the difference with this product! My teeth look and feel great for many hours after I&#x27;ve brushed them!  I&#x27;ve used  the product for about a week and I can noticebly see the difference!! HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It cleans teeth better than any toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s not too harsh, and it tastes pretty good too.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive and test the new Crest Pro Health HD system from BzzAgent. Using 2 separate pastes/gels seemed like it may be a hassle at first, but once I tried the product, I was hooked. The 2 step process doesn&#x27;t take anymore time than my usual routine and is honestly refreshing. Knowing that the 2 formulas work together to create a healthy (step one), brighter (step 2) smile made the extra step worth it. After brushing the first time, my mouth felt cleaner/fresher than after a usual brushing. After about a week my teeth are visibly whiter! I&#x27;ll be interested to see if my dentist &amp; hygienist notice the difference at my next appointment.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is HD. That would normally be expected to stand for &amp;#34;high definition&amp;#34;, at least in the realm of TV, which is where it is most often use. Whatever it means in this case is anyone&#x27;s guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, REALLY stupid marketing gimmicks aside, this is a decent toothpaste. It seems to really get my teeth clean and leaves them feeling clean throughout the day. The two-step process is a little &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34;. I&#x27;d have thought they&#x27;d be able to get it down to just one step, but apparently not. That said, it does get my teeth clean. However I expect that you could probably buy a different toothpaste for half the price that would do the same.</li>
            <li> I really like the clean feeling, and it lasts ALL day, even after eating and drinking! My only complaint is the taste and texture of the polish,which I can get over because of the results!</li>
            <li> Pretty good product. Makes your teeth feel healthy and clean. The whiting aspect is fair but the best part of this product is how clean and healthy it makes your teeth feel</li>
            <li> Got this as a bzz campaign- a free product from crest to review- and I cannot discourage you enough from purchasing this product. After about 4 uses this started burning my gums- and you can see where my gums turned white from the burning! Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I have always purchased the cheapest toothpaste, or whatever was on sale or I had a coupon for.  I never really thought much about it.  I also have issues with my gums and bleeding, despite the fact I brush and use mouthwash, I still bleed everytime I brush my teeth.  I also notice the feel of plaque on my teeth quite often, and not long after I brush my teeth.  I never felt like I got my teeth as clean as they could be...until now.  From the very first use on Crest Pro-Health HD, I noticed a difference in the look and feel of my teeth.  They felt healthier, whiter, plaque free and I noticed a decrease in the bleeding of my gums and that was on the very first use.  After using this product daily, my mouth is bright, my gums are pink and do not bleed and my teeth feel squeaky clean.  Now I know that there is a difference in buying quality toothpaste and I will never go back to my &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; brands because this really made a difference!  So glad I got to try this product for free thanks to bzzagent and crest!</li>
            <li> I had my package for a couple days from Crest &amp; BzzAgent for free but forgot about it in my car. (Mommy brain) I was excited to open it and start this trial. The package was simple and straight to the point which I liked. The directions were easy and printed on each tube which helped because I wasn&#x27;t use to &amp;#34;spit/no rinse, brush again, spit/and rinse&amp;#34; protocol. The first paste feels like a mini professional cleaning. You can feel the particles in action. Then after a minute, I added tube 2, which is the clear gel and it felt refreshing. My teeth were shiny and felt clean after the first brush and by day 2, I can notice the glossy look. I can&#x27;t wait for the week to go by and see the difference. It wasn&#x27;t as much work as wearing the strips and waiting around for those to work then removing them. This was part of your daily routine and simple. I do wish the flavor was a bit stronger, that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> This is such an easy way to get a cleaner, healthier mouth, just brush your teeth twice a day! The Crest Pro-Health HD system consists of two steps. You initially brush for (recommended) one minute with a fluoride based paste. After spitting, but not rinsing with water, you brush for another minute with a second tube containing a peroxide based gel.  My mouth feels so clean afterwards, like going to the dentist. There&#x27;s no gum or enamel sensitivity and no acrobatics of placing strips on your teeth and trying not to drool for 30 minutes. I&#x27;ve just started using the system for about two weeks and my teeth definitely look brighter and less stained and the enamel looks glossy.  I received this system from BzzAgent for my evaluation.</li>
            <li> I am part of a campaign through Bzz Agent to try this unique product.  I have been using these two step system for about five days now and have noticed extreme results.  The first use I was unsure on the texture and sensations of step 1 because it left my mouth feeling different.  There is not a real flavor to step 1 which also made the experience different from a standard toothpaste. Step 2 almost feels like relief gel because step 1 gets the teeth really clean.  Step 2 also does not have a flavor have a minty flavor so its still an adjustment.  I like how the gel does not feel like it gunks up on my teeth.  Throughout the day I notice that my teeth feel same smoothness as it did the moment I was done brushing my teeth.  I have noticed also that my teeth are getting whiter and I don&#x27;t feel as awkward at smiling after having coffee or tea.  The only change I would have is adding either a mint or spearmint flavor.</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro Health HD as part of a Bzz Campaign.  As with any new product, I was wary of the promises it made: 6 x whiter teeth, 6 x healthier mouth.  After using the product for a couple of weeks I do have to say I&#x27;m becoming a believer.  My mouth feels so fresh after brushing and still feels fresh the next morning.  I have never had a product that does such a great job of getting rid of morning breath.  The two part system is so easy to use; one minute with the purifying cleanser to help with plaque buildup and one minute with the perfecting gel which polishes and whitens your teeth.  So far I am thrilled with the purifying stage and I have begun to see a difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  I&#x27;m anxious to see the results with continued use.</li>
            <li> Product is great for whiter teeth, however I have to use a regular toothpaste afterwards because I prefer a more minty flavor after I brush my teeth.  It makes your teeth feel clean but it doesn&#x27;t leave my breath fresh like I would like.  I would advise a mouthwash follow up for sure.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive about the two step process of the Crest Pro Health® HD™, but after receiving a sample box and a couple of uses I&#x27;ve fallen into a steady and easy routine with it. My teeth are noticeably whiter and there&#x27;s definitely a cleaner mouth feel. The dreaded &amp;#34;hydrogen peroxide&amp;#34; feel/taste of white strips and whitening mouthwash is avoided while getting way better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The added bonus is that after my latest dental appointment I can say this stuff is dentist approved! Had my check up this week, which coincided with two weeks of testing the Crest Pro Health® HD™ two step product. My dentist is as impressed with the results as I am-- and even though I was somewhat skeptical about the product&#x27;s claims, my teeth are whiter and my overall oral health has become elevated. My dentist congratulated me on taking my oral care routine to the next level and I thank Crest Pro Health® HD™ for making it so easy and effective!</li>
            <li> I am really excited about this product! This was given to me free to try out by Crest.  I got this product with a little worry about teeth sensitivity. I&#x27;ve used white strips in the past and they hurt my teeth, even causing sore spots in my mouth.  I&#x27;ve been using this for 7 days, twice a day, and haven&#x27;t had any issues.  My teeth are noticeably whiter, I&#x27;ve even gotten comments on them!  The only reason I gave this product 4 stars is because I notice my teeth feel filmy after a few hours.  Other than that, my mouth feels fresh after brushing and not gritty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several whitening toothpastes in the the past. This, by far, is one of the most annoying to use. You brush for one minute using step one, then spit (don&#x27;t rinse) and then brush with step two with one minute, then you can rinse. One would think this level of whitening could be incorporated in a single step process. I don&#x27;t have overly sensitive teeth, however, this toothpaste really did a number on my teeth and gums. This is the first whitening product that actually turned my gums white. I had several white spots on my gum line, which was a bit concerning. After the second use, on the first day, I had to rinse with warm water, because my teeth were sensitive to cold. By the third day, (I really wanted to stick with this... even if I did have some sensitivity and temporary white spots), my gums began to bleed in spots. Since this product says your teeth will be six times whiter in one week, I was going to hang in there for the entire week. After a week of use as instructed on the packaging, the bleeding stopped and the white spots on my teeth had disappeared. I did notice slightly whiter teeth, but certainly not six times whiter teeth. Frankly, I&#x27;ve seen better results from one step tooth pastes that were less expensive and not as harmful to my teeth and gums. If your goal is whiter teeth, invest in whitening strips. They may cause temporary sensitivity, but the results are immediate and you, most likely, won&#x27;t have bleeding gums. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received the Crest Pro Health HD free, courtesy of Crest and for being a BzzAgent. However my review is true and unbiased.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this to try as a BzzAgent.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first step is a gritty toothpaste.  It&#x27;s not uncomfortably gritty - in fact it feels kind of nice.  After you use the gritty toothpaste, you don&#x27;t rinse, but put the second step paste onto your brush, and brush again.  The second step is a thinner toothpaste.  It gives your mouth a very fresh feel, but it doesn&#x27;t taste good.  I haven&#x27;t noticed my teeth being much whiter, but I think it&#x27;s hard to tell for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If nothing else, this toothpaste has to be good for your oral health, as it is getting you to brush for longer. Most people don&#x27;t brush for the recommended two minutes.  Brushing twice will probably increase the amount of time you spend brushing, and that can&#x27;t be a bad thing!</li>
            <li> I was given this to try out (via BzzAgent.)  I have been using the system for about a week now and have seen nice results.  I had some mild staining from the braces that I had as a teen long ago.  The staining appears to be fading and my teeth look whiter.  I have been using a Sonicare toothbrush for years, and this system works just fine with it too.  The texture of the Step 1 gel took some getting used to, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I used to use Sensodyne due to tooth sensitivity, but haven&#x27;t noticed any worsening of those symptoms since I started using the Crest Pro-Health HD system.  I plan to continue to use this system as it not only seems to work well, but it is easy.  I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of whitening strips, painting-on whiteners, or having to use a special light.  This is easy and effective.</li>
            <li> This new, 2-step teeth-brushing system provides amazing results!  I received a free trial of this system from Crest, and I am so thankful I gave it a try!  Not only does this toothpaste leave my teeth feeling clean and fresh, it also has whitened my teeth within one week of using it, so the results are amazing.  I highly recommend​ this system to anyone who cares about their teeth health and looking for some pearly whites in the process!</li>
            <li> After a recent visit to the dentist, the dentist talked me into trying Crest 3d toothpaste and to consider the whitening system. However, a couple days later, I was offered Crest Pro Health HD through BzzAgent for free, so I thought it was perfect timing and figured I would try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the product now for the past 8 days, I can say that my teeth are definitely whiter than they were (and would probably be even better if I didn&#x27;t drink coffee everyday).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another benefit I have noticed is that my teeth have a smoother feeling than I remember having before and my teeth have not been sensitive after using this 2 step process that takes about 2 minutes. Years ago, I had tried the whitening strips and my teeth became very sensitive after using that, so I am much happier with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I highly recommend this product, even if it means brushing for a slightly longer time than I used to. One other note - the taste of step 2 may take a little getting used to - the first time I used it, I was not thrilled but wanted to give it a shot so continued to use it and after a couple days, I stopped noticing the flavor, but like the results, so am sticking with it.</li>
            <li> When I received Crest HD Pro-Health Daily 2 Step System I was skeptical. Two steps? In the morning rush when I need to get out of the door FAST? You have to be joking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, until I tried it. I&#x27;ve decided to give this system a try for a week and see how I&#x27;d feel about the product then.&lt;br /&gt;The results after using Crest HD Pro-Health Daily 2 step System:&lt;br /&gt;- It was easy to incorporate 2 steps in my morning routine and it took 2 minutes of my time.&lt;br /&gt;- I like that 2 ingredients are marked Step 1 and Step 2. It might sound silly (after all there are only 2 tubes) but when you rush in the morning you don&#x27;t want to guess which one you have to use first. Trust me on this&lt;br /&gt;- I actually liked the smell and the taste of a Step 1 Purifying Cleanser that uses Stannous Fluoride to strip away plaque.  It has a nice touch of mint, blue/green color and a consistency of a regular toothpaste.  You do not rinse after you brush your teeth for 1 minute, you spit.&lt;br /&gt;- Step 2- a Hydrogen Peroxide Whitening Gel- is a clear substance with a very fresh smell. It is supposed to polish and whiten your teeth. Brushed for 1 minute, then spit and rinsed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole process in the morning took almost the same amount of time I usually spend in the morning brushing my teeth but the feeling of freshness and cleanness AFTER was quite impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue to use Crest HD Pro-Health Daily 2 Step System in a place of my regular toothpaste and recommend it to people. If I can get double benefits in the same amount of time I&#x27;m all for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Crest HD Pro-Health Daily 2 step System for free thanks to Crest but all opinions 100% mine.</li>
            <li> Thank you Crest for letting me try this product for free as a BzzAgent. As a dental hygienist I&#x27;m always looking for new products that I can recommend to my patients to help them have a healthier mouth. My husband and I have been using this for a little over a week now. I do feel that my teeth feel cleaner and stay that way longer using this 2 paste system. Since my gums are healthy and white already, I didn&#x27;t see a difference. It took some convincing to get my husband to agree to using the 2 paste system but he has been compliant. My main concern was that my patients might not want to do the two step process but since I was able to convince my husband to do it I&#x27;m not as concerned now.  He feels that there has been some improvement using the Crest Pro-Health HD. We both like the flavor of the first paste but don&#x27;t care for the flavor of the second. I also think the cost is a bit high and think that will keep me and others from purchasing it or using this regularly. I will recommend this to my patients because I believe it will help some of them.</li>
            <li> The first step gets your teeth extra clean.  I actually notice my teeth getting whiter after the first use.  I didn&#x27;t experience any irritation either.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I, too, was a bit skeptical of this product after receiving it as part of a promotional event. No longer am I skeptical! My teeth feel so shiny and clean after using this product...much more so than my regular toothpaste. The step two tastes a little funky, but I quickly got over that. I&#x27;ve been using now for about two weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed a significant improvement as far as whitening goes. I&#x27;m hoping to see more dramatic results after using this product a little longer. Overall, I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Saw this mentioned on Tv and looked it  up, it it&#x27;s less than half this price at CVS.</li>
            <li> I actually received this product for FREE through BzzAgent.com as part of a promotion. So, thats obviously a win! Before I wrote this review, I wanted to be sure that I used it for a solid week in order to determine if the claims being made were true. On the first use, I was shocked at how much plaque was removed with step 1. I was honestly a little concerned that I would experience some sensitivity because my teeth felt so... I don&#x27;t know. Bare? Raw? After using step 2, I did not get that same feeling. My teeth felt smooth and clean. I remember thinking that whether or not my teeth became whiter, they DEFINITELY felt healthier and cleaner than usual.&lt;br /&gt;I used both steps faithfully for over a week. I began to notice that my teeth were somewhat whiter on day 3 but I am always skeptical. Maybe I hadn&#x27;t drank as much coffee that day? By day 7 there was no question. My teeth were absolutely whiter and my gums looked a lot healthier. I did not notice a big change in \\&quot;morning breath\\&quot; but that is also not something I really think about.&lt;br /&gt;My sweet boyfriend has told me that my smile looks better than ever. I am still a little nervous about a lack of protection against sensitivity but I have not experienced it yet. It will take a longer period of time to see those effects, if any. The \\&quot;2-Step\\&quot; method was not a big deal. I don&#x27;t feel that it took more than a few seconds longer than usual to brush my teeth. I do wish that it was a little mintier in flavor. The toothpaste and gel both taste a little \\&quot;dentist-y.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall? Give it a try! I bet you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> Crest was nice enough to send me this for free. I&#x27;ve been using Crest Pro Health HD for a couple weeks now and every day I&#x27;m surprised how clean my teeth feel.  They feel shiny like when you leave the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it does take a little longer to use the 2 step process, the added effort is well worth it. My teeth feel cleaner and I&#x27;ve noticed a slight improvement in the whiteness week over week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I won&#x27;t likely use it every brushing, I will likely cycle between normal tooth paste and Crest Pro Health HD in the future to keep my teeth feeling wonderful and my smile nice and white.</li>
            <li> I got the Crest Pro-HD product free as part of a promotion from the brand but love the product so much I have stocked up on it for the rest of the family.  I love the 2 step process and how it really made a difference in the way my mouth feels.  It feels really clean and fresh and my teeth were noticeably whiter and quickly too.  So quickly more white that the rest of the family wanted to use the product I have bought some for all of them to use.  I would strongly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day before I started using it, three weeks ago, I happened to have a dentist appointment and I asked him to look at my teeth discoloration (which wasn&#x27;t all that bad).  Then when I returned for another appointment today, three weeks later, I asked him to compare the whiteness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His feelings were exactly the same as mine.  I followed the directions and brushed twice a day with both tubes, for over a minute with each one.  Truthfully, I noticed minimal difference after using it for three weeks ...forty two separate brushings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist said that there was approximately a 10% difference.  I didn&#x27;t tell him that I was testing it for VINE, and lead him to believe that I had purchased it myself in a local drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very conscientious about following the instructions faithfully.  Since there was not a lot of discoloration, I was hoping for much better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it,  no, would I recommend it, with reservations, as each case may be different.</li>
            <li> I received this from Bzzagent and I used this product from 3 days... and have to say, on a whiteness factor, it gets an &amp;#34;A&amp;#34; from me. I do not Smoke, drink Coffee or tea, so m teeth are ussually in good shape, but sometimes need freshened up a bit on the white factor regardless. It certainly met me expectations on that. The flavor of Step one was very pleasant and it was super easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The down side for me, was it made my mouth so sore that I couldn&#x27;t use it beyond day 3.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try this project for free as a BzzAgent. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week, and so far, I&#x27;m really liking the product! It doesn&#x27;t take much longer than my previous brushing regime, and it&#x27;s nice to have a reminder to brush for a longer amount of time. (I probably used to cut corners and not brush for the full 1-2 minutes a dentist recommends.) My mouth does feel fresh and clean after using the toothpaste and it has a pleasant taste. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ve noticed whiter teeth yet, but I did have a bit of tooth sensitivity one day, which I usually get when I try a whitening product - so that makes me think it&#x27;s working! Overall, I like this product and will continue using it, hoping to see continued results. The price listed here seems a little steep, although I guess you should figure that you&#x27;re basically buying two tubes&#x27; worth of toothpaste, even though this product won&#x27;t last any longer than a typical tube would last.</li>
            <li> You should seriously consider removing your products from your smoking area!  OMG this package smelled of cigarette smoke!</li>
            <li> I too received a free sample of this to try. I&#x27;m somewhat obsessed on my quest for whiter teeth, but find that my teeth are generally too sensitive for the strips, so I tend to experiment with different toothpastes to achieve similar results. I&#x27;m quite pleased with the results. I haven&#x27;t experienced any sensitivity or pain from using this. I also find the taste to be pleasant in general, and I do feel that the stains on my teeth are disappearing and my teeth are getting whiter. The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is that it is a 2 step process. I understand the logic behind it, but there are nights where I&#x27;m just too tired to mess with the 2 steps. I know that makes me sound incredibly lazy, but it is the truth. As a busy mom of 3 young kids, I consider it an achievement to wash my face, brush my teeth, and floss on some nights. That&#x27;s when I&#x27;m reaching for my old toothpaste. It&#x27;s definitely not a hard process and probably my own issue, but in the spirit of being completely honest that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m at with the toothpaste! I would recommend it to anyone looking for a way to whiten their teeth without the use of strips or other methods.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff ever!  I starting using this about two weeks ago and I can really tell a difference.  My teeth are definitely whiter than when I started and my mouth feels great.  The first time I used it I could tell a big difference between this and regular toothpaste.  My teeth felt smooth through the entire day and really fresh as well.  It wasn&#x27;t overpowering like a lot of really minty toothpastes and didn&#x27;t burn.  Very easy to use the two step system, not complicated at all.  I received a free product for the purpose of my review.  My opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received my free sample of Crest HD from Bzzagent about a week ago. I was excited to try out this new product. After three days of use, I noticed that my teeth were more sensitive than normal.  I also noticed that my teeth were  much brighter in about four days. Overall, I would use this toothpaste periodically and not everyday due to the effects that it has on my teeth. I rather have less sensitive teeth then a brighter smile (considering my teeth are not horribly dull).  Even using this product every couple of days still shown signs of my teeth becoming whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth, this product may be great for you. It is definitely a cheaper way to get whiter teeth. The process takes two minutes and consist of brushing your teeth with two different toothpaste for a minute each. I thought it was a little weird that you are not suppose to rinse your mouth between the two toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried out different whitening products before; whitening strips and mouthwash make my teeth hurt and end up being sensitive for days, and whitening toothpaste doesn&#x27;t really seem to do anything. Because of my previous experiences with whitening products, I was wary about trying this out. I received this free from Crest, though, and decided to at least give it a try. My teeth were uncomfortable the first day I used this, but nothing that wasn&#x27;t manageable. The sensitivity was gone the second day, although I noticed that I couldn&#x27;t rinse my mouth out with cool water without my tongue feeling like it was on fire. I started using warm water and it lessens the effect, although the feeling is still there. I like the fact that my teeth feel like I just had a cleaning at the dentist (without the pain of a dental cleaning) every time I use this, although I do wonder how safe this is to use long term. I suppose I&#x27;ll need to consult my dentist about that. I&#x27;ll continue to use what remains of the product and will decide at that time if I want to buy it to continue using it. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen the 6X whiter results in a week that they say on the box, but I have noticed at least some difference, without the sensitivity that usually accompanies whitening products, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a lot of different brands and types of toothpastes over the last few years and tried to keep as good care of my teeth as possible. I have a couple of sensitive teeth, so have recently tried sensitive tooth toothpaste to see if it helps and have had some luck with a couple of different brands, but never had any that also help with whitening or that give enough multiple benefits to be worth it. Often times I&#x27;ve ended up using one toothpaste for whitening or some other type of benefit and another for sensitive teeth. Since I&#x27;ve started using this new Crest HD 2 step product I&#x27;ve been very impressed/happy. I received this as part of a promotional product review, but I can certainly see buying this once I&#x27;m out of the promotional amount to keep up with the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The claim that it whitens 6x in one week are a bit difficult to compare, but I can definitely see a difference in the whitening. I also like that there is a separate product for cleaning/protecting and a separate one for whitening/polishing. If used properly, you do 1 minute with each and it really isn&#x27;t any more difficult than a normal toothpaste. I had to go back to read the instructions on a regular tube of toothpaste, and if followed correctly for that, you would need to brush for 2 minutes either way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only request/addition I could ask for would be one that includes the possibility of having sensitive teeth protection as well.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest and Bzzagent, I got to try this product for free. Opinions are entirely my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really picky about my toothpaste - taste, feel, flavor in my mouth after brushing, etc. So, I was a bit skeptical about trying a two step toothpaste, it could be twice as bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really pleased with this product. It cleans my teeth really well, my mouth feels super clean after using. My teeth were already pretty white so after a couple weeks of use I haven&#x27;t noticed a noticeable color difference but my teeth definitely feel cleaner and shinier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from step 2 tasting a little bitter to me (my husband has been using this too and loves it and doesn&#x27;t notice a bitter taste) the toothpaste tastes great, it&#x27;s not too minty but there&#x27;s just enough to leave my mouth feeling fresh and just brushed after I finish brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the clean no-plaque feeling that this toothpaste leaves me with all day long!</li>
            <li> I was lucky to receive a promotional sample of this product. If you&#x27;re like me, you love it when your mouth feels clean. Minty, fresh, and smooth. The problem with brushing at home, at least for me, is that within a half hour, my teeth feel dirty again. That doesn&#x27;t happen with Crest Pro Health HD - I seriously feel like I&#x27;m visiting the dentist every day I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two step process does take a bit of getting used to, as does the gritty feel of the first step of the process. But taking an extra 60 seconds twice a day is nothing compared to how clean and fresh my mouth feels. Both my husband and I are converts and we&#x27;ll be using Crest Pro Health HD from here on out.</li>
            <li> I already use crest 3-D white toothpaste and 3-D white luxe toothpaste so I have to admit I was excited when this product (Crest pro Health HD) came out and then when it was a buzz agent offer.  I really don&#x27;t mind a two-step process; it kind of makes me want to brush my teeth for two minutes without getting bored.  I have always switched back-and-forth when choosing toothpaste each day between some days using my whitening toothpaste and some days using my husbands sensitive toothpaste. I continued to do this, rather than the straight two-week trial so that I could give a fair comparison of the toothpastes.  I also had a dentist appointment scheduled for a cleaning in the middle of the trial, so it would not have been helpful for me to take pictures of before and after.  That also means I had fairly stained teeth when I first tried this product, and I have to say I was impressed.  Even my hygienist, said that my teeth seemed less stained than they had in the past.  And, I have to say, that maintaining the &#x27;right from the dentist&#x27; clean teeth feeling has been much easier with the help of this toothpaste.  The only downsides, or the initial taste differences from regular toothpaste.  I wasn&#x27;t very fond of the Wintergreen but has grown on me a bit.  I  didn&#x27;t like and still don&#x27;t like the gel taste and wish that it wasn&#x27;t the taste I was left with when I am finished brushing my teeth.  Overall, I like the product and probably would purchase it in the future, although, only if it is on sale or I have a coupon available.  The retail price is just too much for toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample to try out and review and thought \\&quot;sure why not\\&quot;.  I never really thought it was going to do anything my normal toothpaste hadn&#x27;t already done.  Boy was I wrong.  My teeth felt like they were clean by a dentist.  I brush and floss everyday so it&#x27;s not like my teeth needed help.  I found myself touching my teeth with my tongue all day.  There is really something to this two step deal.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was the two step deal.  I really wish it had been one step.  My husband did notice how \\&quot;brighter\\&quot; my teeth were so there is something to their claim.  I really do recommend this toothpaste if you can get your hands on it.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product from Crest.  So far after two weeks of use, this seems like a good product.  I have noticed a slight improvement in the color of my teeth and my teeth really are \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; clean when I rinse with mouthwash.  It is a little odd to have to use two different tubes of product and I wonder if that is really necessary for the product to work or if it was something the marketing folks at crest thought would command a higher price when sold.  Again, my teeth do \\&quot;feel\\&quot; and look cleaner, but I&#x27;m not sure if it is worth the price for this product.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary Crest Pro-Health HD Two-Step System and have been using it for about 2 months and LOVE it.  Crest Pro-Health HD lives up to it&#x27;s claims.  No morning breath and clean, smooth teeth.  I&#x27;ve been using a Sonicare toothbrush for many years now so brushing for 2 minutes is no longer than I&#x27;d normally brush and is recommended.  While this product is more expensive than traditional toothpaste, I am hooked and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and I&#x27;m definitely thinking about replacing my current toothpaste for it. I got it for reviewing purposes but I fell in love with it. After just 1 use I had people commenting on my teeth saying &amp;#34;did you get your teeth whitened?&amp;#34; Granted, my teeth have always been pretty white but now that I&#x27;m getting older and drinking more coffee, I can see some yellowing myself. I could also tell the difference with this toothpaste just after 1 use, they looked whiter and felt smoother to me somehow! I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothpaste. It made my teeth whiter and it feels like a &amp;#34;just from the dentist&amp;#34; clean after using it. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I recently had the opportunity to test and review this toothpaste system, thanks to Crest and BzzAgent, and I&#x27;m so glad I did! I&#x27;m super picky about how my toothpaste tastes, so I&#x27;ve always been a Colgate girl - typically, Crest toothpaste has been too &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; for me. But they&#x27;ve changed up the flavor this time (reminds me of Orbit Spearmint gum!) and with as clean as my mouth feels, I may never use Colgate again! The fresh-breath from this toothpaste lasts all day (well... until the next meal!) and my teeth feel every bit as clean as they do when I&#x27;ve just had a dental cleaning! I wasn&#x27;t super impressed with the whitening ability of this toothpaste - it claims to make teeth 6x whiter in a week, but I definitely didn&#x27;t see results even close to that. Maybe a shade whiter, but not significant enough for me to consider this a &amp;#34;whitening product.&amp;#34; Still, I love the clean feeling and the taste, so I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> I received a free kit from BzzAgent and was so excited to try this, however I have sensitive teeth. I have a high tolerence for pain, but my teeth are sensitive. I usually brush with Sensodyne, and my sensitivity is usually to temperature, so I was so surprised when my teeth were in total PAIN when I first used this. After reading the Q&amp;A from Crest, it did say there would be some discomfort but it was temporary. I started using this only at night and after 3 days, the pain subsided to a mild discomfort. I used it for about a week and quit. My teeth were whiter and my morning breath was under control, but it wasn&#x27;t worth the pain. Plus I found it super inconvenient to have two different toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I received this as a promotion from the brand Crest. I don&#x27;t drink coffee, alcohol, tea, or smoke. However I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s and my teeth are starting to show its age and staining from food. I&#x27;ve used Crest strips but they bother my gums so I was interested to try this. At first, brushing my teeth with 2 steps seemed high maintenance. Once I got used to the process it wasn&#x27;t so bad. One thing I&#x27;ll do every once in awhile is rinse after step 1 just out of habit but that&#x27;s my fault. I&#x27;m not crazy about the consistency of the toothpaste. It&#x27;s thick and doesn&#x27;t spread easily when I go in to brush. And the step 2 polish tastes like celery, which I absolutely hate. However the most important thing is if a product lives up to its claims. I noticed a very slight whitening after the first week. After having used this for a few weeks, my teeth do look better and I don&#x27;t have to worry about sensitive gums. I smile even more often because my teeth have been looking better!</li>
            <li> My wife received this free from Crest to try it out, but she couldn&#x27;t use it because she&#x27;s breastfeeding. She gave it to me and after using it for a week, I think I see a difference in my teeth. My wife says they look whiter, too. The only issue is that it&#x27;s not a great breath freshener. I get bad &#x27;morning breath&#x27; and this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t help with that at all. I have to use a different toothpaste to get that minty fresh scent. I just went to the dentist yesterday, and he said he wished everyone had teeth that looked like mine. Now that&#x27;s a compliment!</li>
            <li> Was given this  product for free to try and it is amazing.  It is easy to use and only takes 2 minutes, twice a day.  You use it has your normal toothpaste routine.  No more morning breath and whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> This product is GREAT! I was able to try if for free thanks to CREST. The two step process is easy but your teeth feel super clean when finished. I don&#x27;t know how dramatic the whitening is but I feel like my teeth look better after using it for a week.</li>
            <li> I got this free to try from Crest via BzzAgent.  At first I was not sure how I was going to like having two steps to brushing, twice a day.  BUT, after trying it, I love it!  The first step scrubs your teeth super clean.  It seems a bit gritty, but that makes it seem like it is doing its job!  The second step is the polishing/whitening gel.  It is super smooth and makes them sparkly white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spitting and switching the tooth paste half-way through brushing doesn&#x27;t bother me..I enjoy the two textures.  I am happy with the results so far after 2 weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> I received this from BzzAgent as a promotional product. The Crest Pro Health HD is a quality product. The toothpaste definitely gets your teeth feeling nice and clean. I was very skeptical of the whitening process. After one week, I was not 6 shades whiter. I was a little disappointed. However, I stopped drinking coffee and kept at it for another week and viola.  My teeth were much whiter. Overall, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Got this free through BzzAgent.  I like the taste and that it takes no longer than regular tooth brushing.  The whitening agent tastes like a diluted form of the gel used on the Crest Whitestrips.  I gave it shot, but was ultimately disappointed given that it costs 2-3 times more than regular toothpaste but only noticed a marginal whitening effect.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of the product from BzzAgent to try. I loved how clean my teeth felt after using Crest HD. It felt like I just had a cleaning from the dentist. As far as the whitening, I did take before and after photos and did notice some lightening of the teeth. I like using this two step system better than teeth whitening trays. The first step is a toothpaste that is mild and doesn&#x27;t burn. The second step, the bleaching step, you use without rinsing. I found myself getting lazy and not brushing as long as was suggested but I still had a noticeable change. My husband also tried this product and asked if I would buy it again as he really liked it. I would definitely recommend this. I did notice my teeth were slightly more sensitive during the time I used this but not enough to cause pain.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with the new Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step system toothpaste. I was interested to see how it worked as I figured it couldn&#x27;t be as good as it claimed. However, I was very pleasantly surprised! My teeth are noticeably whiter &amp; the toothpaste had a very good flavor. I highly recommend this product! I received a free sample through Smiley360, however the opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> This new duo has become my favorite part of the day. You know that fresh and clean feeling you get after the dentist? Well, now you can have it at home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1: is not your usual toothpaste cleaner. This one has a focus on plaque removal and gives you that really CLEAN feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2: is the gel that gives your mouth a thoroughly clean feeling. This gel helps to whiten teeth also, but doesn&#x27;t leave you with sensitivity, like the strips do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two step process in not time consuming, it just allows you to attack your teeth to achieve true freshness and that ultimate clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Crest Pro-Health HD to try and provide my honest feedback as a bzzagent.  When I first saw the package I thought that there was no way that I would like it, the package can make the two step process look like it’s going to be cumbersome and time consuming.  Also, I have very sensitive and have never been able to use whiting strips or other products without stopping due to the pain.  I’ve been using this toothpaste for two weeks now and I am hooked!  It is simple and easy to use and the extra bit of time that it takes to complete the entire process is totally worth it for the results!  I immediately noticed that my teeth were whiter and that has continued with use.  Best of all… I have not had any sensitivity issues but I’m still seeing results!!  I love how fresh and clean my mouth and teeth feels.  It’s similar to that ‘dentist clean’ feeling on a daily basis.  I wish that they used the same style cap for each tube to help simplify the routine but don’t let the packaging deter you from missing out on this amazing new product!!</li>
            <li> It actually works! ---  a bit different to get used to but &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; is it worth it!  --- incredible results within the first few times of using --- really, truly whiter!  Don&#x27;t know about &amp;#34;6 shades whiter&amp;#34; (since that&#x27;s a bit arbitrary) - but truly whiter and SQUEAKY clean, without a doubt.</li>
            <li> The fact that you brush one minute with each tube makes you keep track of the time that you are (and should) be brushing your teeth.  I love the way that my teeth feel after my two minute brush and polish.  I have noticed a definite color change in my teeth as well, they are a shade or two whiter than they were when I started using the product. Thank you #bzzagent for letting me try this great product!</li>
            <li> First I have to preface by saying that I do take very good care of my teeth, see my dentist regularly and always use whitening toothpaste and mouthwash.  Because of the products I always use, I really did not notice much in the way of whiter teeth from this product, but my teeth are pretty white as it is.  Step 1 is supposed to clean your teeth really well.  It is a gel consistency.  My teeth did feel cleaner after using this step.  Step 2 has a slightly minty taste to it, however the mintiness did not last long.  I normally use Crest 3D White and that toothpaste leaves a nice minty clean feeling in my mouth way longer than the HD did.  I found it somewhat time consuming to use two products for one minute each morning and evening.  I was given this to try for free.  Since my teeth are already white and in good condition, I probably would not purchase this product once I use this up.  With that said, however, If your teeth could use some help and need to be whiter, than this could be a good product for you.</li>
            <li> I received the Crest Pro-Health HD as a promotion and have been very pleased with it.  It is great tasting and leaves my mouth feeling very clean.  There was a noticeable whitening of my teeth after about a week and even more so after two weeks.  It definitely took a few days to get in the habit of using the two step process but after a week I wasn&#x27;t even thinking about it.  I will be buying this and would recommend trying this yourself.</li>
            <li> If you get your teeth cleaned professionally and want to keep them cleaned then use this product otherwise I don&#x27;t see it making much difference.</li>
            <li> After using this product for about a month, I can say that my mouth does feel cleaner and my teeth are definitely whiter!  I have also noticed that my mouth still feels clean in the morning, which is so nice.  I thought the 2-step process was going to be annoying, but it was actually very easy and after just a few days I started doing both steps without even really having to think about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that my teeth seem extra sensitive since I started using it, but this toothpaste has cavity protection and I have issues with sensitivity with any toothpaste that has cavity protection/tartar control/etc.  I was lucky to get this toothpaste to try for free from BzzAgent and Crest, but the retail price is pretty high for toothpaste. Although, if you factor in the cost of whitening strips, it&#x27;s really not that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pretty impressed with how nice my mouth feels and looks after using this toothpaste, and despite the hefty cost and extra sensitivity, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase Crest Pro Health HD in the future.</li>
            <li> As a coffee drinker, I&#x27;m always looking for ways to brighten/whiten my teeth. I was very excited when I was able to test this product (for free!) for BzzAgent. I&#x27;ve had professional teeth whitening before and my biggest complaint is the sensitivity after the whitening. With this product, I was able to use it twice daily (morning and night) and experience absolutely no sensitivity. The minty taste left my mouth feeling fresh and clean (not as minty as mouthwash, but a fresh taste) and my teeth were noticeably shinier and whiter after the first use. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now (all whilst drinking coffee!) and continue to maintain a whiter smile. My only complaint is that step 1 left my mouth feeling &amp;#34;chalky&amp;#34;. After step 2 is added and complete, a good thorough rinse takes away the &amp;#34;chalky&amp;#34; feeling. My family has noticed that my teeth appear whiter. I would definitely recommend this product---easy to use---I just switched out my regular toothpaste for this, and no sensitivity. A-okay by me!</li>
            <li> My teeth have always been an area of concern for me. Good teeth do not run in my family, and I struggle with teeth that are not as white as I would like and the occasional bout of halitosis. Because of this, I am always on the lookout for better oral hygiene products. Immediately upon beginning to use Crest Pro Health® HD™, I noticed a fresher, cleaner feeling in my mouth. After a week or two, I noticed a visible difference in the whiteness of my teeth, and I didn&#x27;t feel quite as self-conscious about my breath. The best part is that I didn&#x27;t feel I was sacrificing the cleaning quality of my toothpaste for these other benefits. I would definitely recommend this new product to others if you are concerned about any of the same dental issues as I am. In my opinion, Crest makes the best oral hygiene products. Thanks to Crest for letting me try this for free!</li>
            <li> I got to try this product for free thanks to Crest and I really wanted to like this product because it sounded great and I love whitening toothpastes.  However, I did not fall in love with this product as I expected.  The whole process of using two toothpastes really did not work for me.  I often forgot the second tube or spit and rinsed after the first tube out of habit.  The second tube did not taste great and I never noticed a difference in my teeth when I used the product.  I eventually threw out the second tube and just used the first one.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I&#x27;m big on having a real healthy mouth...I brush, floss, massage my gums and brush my tongue every day.  Now I add this product to my routine.  It&#x27;s very easy and simple to use and look forward to the continued use of the product.</li>
            <li> I am a member of Smiley360 and I got a chance to try this product for free. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product I love that it is something I can use daily and my teeth are not even more sensitive like with some whitening methods. It does not take any extra time for me. The hardest part of this is to remember to spit after step one but NOT RINSE. I had AMAZING results I would say 6x whiter is no joke it really worked for me and I am a smoker pop drinker and HAD the stains to prove it. I have since purchased another set as my other half has been using it too. I used Crest pro health before and I love that the step one gives me that super clean feeling and the step two polishes and shines. GREAT PAIR and I give Crest and P&amp;G 5 stars. Great product I will for sure be recommending to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this toothpaste, as it had a different texture than other ones I have used. It seemed to have a grainy texture that felt like it was cleaning deeper than other toothpastes, similar to a dental cleaning. The taste was good and I love the Texture.</li>
            <li> I love the Crest PH Advanced because it freshens my breath, and cleans my teeth. I also love that it&#x27;s perfect to use on sensitive teeth like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: Product sent for testing purposes. However, the opinions expressed are 100% my own based on my experience with the product.</li>
            <li> I recently had the opportunity to try This product thanks to Smiley360. I am so happy that I had this opportunity- I found my new favorite toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt; The instructions for use are clearly printed on each tube and are very easy to follow. One tip I have would be to be sure not to rinse before using step 2. I made this mistake the first time &amp; the system works much better when directions are followed.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave this product 4 stars rather than 5 is because of the taste of step 2. The first time I put this in my mouth, I immediately wanted to spit it out. I was caught off guard. If I had been prepared for the taste, it wouldn&#x27;t have been so bad- I learned this on day 2.  Once I was prepared for the taste, it was no longer an issue.&lt;br /&gt;My smile is brighter and my truth have never felt cleaner- that&#x27;s why I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was asked to try  Crest Pro Health® HD by Crest via Bzz Agent almost a month ago, and I have to say that it takes some commitment beyond the usual brush and go. You brush with the toothpaste and then brush again with the peroxide gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step one left my teeth squeaky clean, and step two caused some sensitivity. My gums had a burning feeling and there was some whiteness around the gumline, which was predicted in the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the very clean feeling after brushing with both steps. My teeth were definitely cleaner, and looked good to me. I decided to continue with the program and see if it would help. I did notice that my teeth became gradually whiter. I drink a lot of coffee, especially during the colder months, and I was glad to see some of the superficial coffee stains were removed.  I also noticed that my teeth became more sensitive to heat and cold, so I had to tread gingerly when having something too hot or too cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that at this 13.00 price point you get your money&#x27;s worth when it comes to the whitening. It seems to work better than white strips but perhaps not as well as one of those expensive bleachings at the dentist. My recommendation would be to try it and then switch off after finishing, go back to regular toothpaste, and then try it again when needed. Thanks, Crest and BzzAgent for giving me the opportunity to try and review this product.</li>
            <li> I received the Crest Pro-Health HD toothpaste for free as a part of a promotion from Crest via BuzzAgent. Admittedly, I was rather skeptical at first about this toothpaste. I mean I&#x27;ve tried a number of toothpastes over the years and while I&#x27;m happy with the kind I&#x27;m using now, toothpastes always seem to overstate how effective they are. To be honest that happens a little here too, but overall I was very pleased by how this toothpaste turned out even despite a few drawbacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most significant thing that I noticed was that my felt a lot cleaner after brushing with this toothpaste. At first I thought this was just my mouth getting used to a new toothpaste, but after a month or so of using it, my mouth still tends to feel cleaner than it did before using this. That may make the toothpaste worth it just on that alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the toothpaste does also claim a whitening effect. This I noticed less, but did still notice at least a little. It wasn&#x27;t 6x whiter, whatever was exactly meant by that, but I did notice that my teeth were a little whiter. I simply considered this a little perk in addition to the cleaner feeling teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I mentioned some drawbacks and there are a few. The first is that the two step process takes some getting used to. You just need to have a timer or a watch handy when brushing your teeth. It&#x27;s a little annoying, but they tell you this straight out. It&#x27;s still a minor hassle, but not enough to take anything away from the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another drawback was that we experienced a little sensitivity after we started using it. This cleared up after a bit, but I&#x27;m sure that something like this varies from person to person. So it&#x27;s something to be aware of. Again we didn&#x27;t experience it much so I&#x27;m not really holding it against the toothpaste either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably the most significant drawback is the price. While I received the toothpaste for free as I mentioned above, the toothpaste is a bit pricey. While I do think that the added clean feeling to my teeth and a subtle whitening effect may be worth it, it would be the one block towards regularly purchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though, I was more impressed with the toothpaste than I thought I would be. It has some drawbacks but none that are too bad. The worst is the price, but even then it may be worth it. If I could I&#x27;d probably give it a 4.5 stars instead of a 5 overall, but I had a good experience with this toothpaste and do recommend that you at least give it a try.think that the added clean feeling to my teeth and a subtle whitening effect may be worth it, it would be the one block towards regularly purchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though, I was more impressed with the toothpaste than I thought I would be.

            <li> I recently received the opportunity to try this product thanks to BzzAgent &amp; Crest. I was skeptical of the results I would see in just 6 days, but I was pleasantly surprised! The two step process is easy to follow. Brush for 1 minute with step #1, spit (but don&#x27;t rinse), then brush with step #2 for another minute, spit and rinse! Do this twice a day for 6 days and you will notice your teeth are whiter! I also loved how clean my teeth felt and how fresh my breath was. I&#x27;ve tried other whitening processes in the past and this is so much easier. I definitely wasn&#x27;t disappointed. I&#x27;m so happy with the results!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has a nice texture and grit to it. Not a smooth feel, so it seems like you&#x27;re getting a better cling to yout teeth.</li>
            <li> When this product arrived, I was both excited and skeptical. I have been using home whitening kits/products off and on for the better part of 15 years. I have found that, like most things, some worked well, and others flopped. This product, however, is a big win. My teeth in general are generally white, but I drink soda and coffee throughout the day, so it seems like from bed to morning my teeth lose their shine. I also only brush in the mornings due to somewhat sensitive gums. The first time I used this product I was amazed. My teeth were instantly whiter and had an overall whiter tone. I have found that every time I use this product my teeth are brighter, and whiter. I also deviate from the directions slightly and do 2mins for each cycle. I do this because Im too lazy to count the vibrations and beeps from my sonicare in the morning. So I just go the full 2mins for each step. lol I did include a before and after picture from this morning. You can see my teeth are still somewhat dingy in the tell tale corners and crevices, but overall much brighter and whiter looking. I will say the only two things I noticed as a negative was that I saw some occasional white spotting on my gums. This may be just my experience or a combination of having lightly sensitive gums, and doing it for 4 minutes total. My best guess would be that the peroxide in step one lightens any irritated area. My only other negative would be that the mouth feel of step one is... odd. It drys out your mouth like crazy. Like cotton mouth x100, hangover dehydration mouth and not having water for 5 days dry. You get used to it (ish) - but still worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> i got to try this item and i really love it!!! i won&#x27;t lie, i didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in terms of how white my teeth were, but i did notice that my teeth feel like i just came from the dentist! they feel smooth and feel VERY clean after using this vs normal toothpaste. i got to try this item as i&#x27;m a bzzagent.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste is whitening power! I received this for free from BzzAgent and I was thrilled with the results. My teeth went from coffee and wine stained to brilliant, youthful white in under two-weeks. Step One - Cleanse, Step Two Whiten. After that, just show off your progressively whiter smile daily. Yes, its another step in the brushing process, but the results make it worth it. Plus, it is so much easier than trays, strips, or brush on whitening products. Great price, great results. Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li> FYI it does make your teeth sensitive BUT they your teeth do get whiter!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;HD&amp;#34; is getting used for almost everything these days - but for toothpaste? I have been using this for the past couple weeks (courtesy of free samples supplied by Crest) without a lot of success on the whitening side. Certainly the fresh taste is great - my mouth does feel brighter and tangy after use - but the sunglass needing white smile has eluded me - sorry Crest!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I gave it an OK</li>
            <li> Tried this new toothpaste through a sampling program with BzzAgent.  Am pleasantly surprised at how smooth and clean my mouth feels throughout the day!  I was a bit skeptical at first when I saw two tubes of toothpaste instead of one, and was slightly uncomfortable the first couple of days since I was changing a brushing habit I&#x27;ve had for my entire life.  However, I loved the smooth mint flavor of the toothpaste and my teeth did, in fact, feel cleaner throughout the day!  I&#x27;m not sure whether I&#x27;ve had the 6x whiter teeth that the product claims, but I&#x27;m very happy about how clean my teeth feel.  Definitely can tell the difference vs. when I use my previous toothpaste.  Will definitely continue using Crest Pro Health HD and am happy to change my brushing habits from here on out!</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to try Crest Pro-health HD through BuzzAgent!!! I loved the product and noticed a difference in how my teeth felt and looked within a few days. My dentist even said &amp;#34;your doing a great job brushing you teeth&amp;#34;. They&#x27;ve never said that to me before. I would definately recommend this to friends!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a moderate improvement over the whitening paste I was using prior to receiving a promotional pack from the manufacturer. The polishing paste really does give you a &#x27;dentist clean feel&#x27; - I was impressed, however the whitening agent was only slightly more effective than the Crest (non-HD) whitening toothpaste. Also I understand the benefit of separating out the two steps but it does add time to my morning when I&#x27;m trying to get out the door. YMMV but I did not notice a significant improvement in the whiteness of my teeth or significantly improved oral health after using the product for a month when compared to a tube of toothpaste that costs 1/3rd the price.</li>
            <li> Just like with everything else I&#x27;ve tried, my teeth didn&#x27;t get any whiter, and I&#x27;ve used up 2 of these packages (4 tubes). My teeth remain yellowy.</li>
            <li> I received sample of Crest Pro Health HD to try through BzzAgent. I gave it a try for a few weeks and love the results!  In the past, I have used white stripes but found them to be a hassle and sometimes messy., so I have stayed clear from them for awhile. This 2-step toothpaste is a great to add into my daily routine with no additional time considering my busy schedule.  The taste doesn&#x27;t bother me, its a tad different from your everyday toothpaste. It felt like I got my bi-annual cleaning at the dentist office! I have sensitive teeth and this does not bother me at all.  I (and my fianc&amp;eacute;) have noticed a difference in how white our teeth are now compared to before using Crest Pro Health HD!</li>
            <li> I was sent Crest Pro Health HD whitening toothpaste to try and review from Crest. I was not impressed with this 2-step whitening toothpaste. I am not one to consider myself having sensitive teeth and/or gums, but I couldn&#x27;t use this as directed for more than 3 days. The first three days I used it in the morning and in the evening. At the beginning of day 3, my mouth was so sensitive and all the product was doing was turning my gums white. I couldn&#x27;t eat or drink anything for an hour because it heightened my sensitivity so much. After three days I didn&#x27;t notice a difference but I thought that if I could at least use it once a day I would see results in about 4 weeks. Other than only using it once per day, I followed the directions exactly as written and still saw no results after 4 weeks. I was so disappointed that even after three weeks of pain, white gums, and even bleeding gums, I saw absolutely no results. I&#x27;m sure this 2-step Crest Pro-Health HD works for some people, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> After using Crest Pro Health HD for several weeks now, I do feel like my mouth is healthier, but since my teeth weren&#x27;t really in need of whitening before, I can&#x27;t really attest to its whitening abilities. I couldn&#x27;t see a noticeable difference in whitening. It does leave my mouth feeling different and cleaner than before, but I would prefer it to have a stronger mint taste. I don&#x27;t really feel like the mint is strong enough to freshen my breath. The taste is fine for both steps, but it&#x27;s just very mild, which I suppose is good for people who don&#x27;t like a strong mint taste. The two-step process isn&#x27;t really a big deal for me, since I have an electric toothbrush that has a 1-minute setting on it. I brush with the first step until my toothbrush stops after a minute, and then I add the gel and brush for another minute. I don&#x27;t really need to spit in between the two steps like the directions say to do, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a requirement. The main thing, I think, is just to make sure you don&#x27;t rinse in between. Since the gel tube is nearly half the size of the purifying cleanser tube, I took that to mean I shouldn&#x27;t use as much of the gel, but I still think I will run out of gel before I run out of cleanser. When I first read the packaging, I was a little concerned about the warning that you may experience temporary symptoms like white spots or oral discomfort when using this product, but I didn&#x27;t experience anything like that. Overall, though, I think that for the price and the fact that I don&#x27;t really need to whiten my teeth on a daily basis, I will continue to use the original Crest Pro Health that I was using before I tried their new HD product, but I really appreciate being given this to try out for free from BzzAgent and Crest.</li>
            <li> Once  I received free Crest Pro Health® HD™ to try through BzzAgent, I was really excited to use it. I waited for almost a month before writing a review to see the improvement and consistency  on the results. Here it goes.&lt;br /&gt;1.) packing -&lt;br /&gt;It contains two pieces with clear and easy to understand instructions. It has step1- for cleaning and step2- for whitening. When you are using it, there is no confusion on which one is 1st and second. It is clearly written on the package and tubes are made differently which eliminates any confusion.&lt;br /&gt;2.) product-&lt;br /&gt;Once I started using once a day in the morning, I was very curious to see the results. And After a week or so I started seeing improvements. By the time it was two weeks, it was prominent difference. It cleans your teeth and freshens your breath as well as improves the whitening.&lt;br /&gt;I was little worried too that it might make my teeth sensitive after using step2-whitening piece every day but I have not seen any problem with sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item truly deserves full 5 stars and serves up to the expectations.</li>
            <li> I have tried to use teeth whitening products off and on for years. I say off and on, because usually the only ones that I have really seen work are the products that require you to pour some really nasty tasting gel into a plastic tray and put it in your mouth every day. Between work, being a single dad and all the things that requires, trying to remember to add in an extra step in my daily routine to deal with those trays meant I never completed a regimen. Crest Pro-Heath HD solves this problem by creating a system which can whiten my teeth without adding any extra steps to my daily routine. That&#x27;s a big winner in my book. When I saw the opportunity to try this out thanks to BzzAgent, I couldn&#x27;t wait. Crest Pro-Health HD doesn&#x27;t taste bad, and does what it says in regards to whitening my teeth. The time requirements (a min for step 1 and then for step 2) could be a bit tricky as most people don&#x27;t really have a timer for their teeth brushing. Fortunately, my Sonicare toothbrush handled that for me. My mouth also felt fresh afterwards which again was a HUGE win for me over other products. Still not sure if I got six shades whiter in two weeks, but I definitely noticed a difference and can see myself using this as my new Crest toothpaste.</li>
