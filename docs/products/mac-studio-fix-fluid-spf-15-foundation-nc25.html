            <li>Good.</li>
            <li>Received in good condition.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>And I love that it includes SPF 15!</li>
            <li>I have ordered it many times and it was true to the excellent brand quality.  </li>
            <li>The coverage is also amazing.  </li>
            <li>This was either expired or a knock off because it was not like the kind from the store.</li>
            <li>what kind of foundation I use.  </li>
            <li>This was received in a reasonable amount of time and in perfect condition, i was completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I tried the much pricier Laura Mercier oil-free foundation which was very good too</li>
            <li>This is the really deal, I love this MAC foundation, blends in beautifully.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I love this foundation, it does have a tendency to break people out and can sometimes cause the problems that we wish to cover.  </li>
            <li>I love this foundation.</li>
            <li>Having freckles, there isn&#x27;t many brands out there that can cover them without looking caked on, but Mac does.</li>
            <li>The upfront cost is more than what your grocery or pharmacy carries</li>
            <li>I have been wearing MAC makeup for many years.  </li>
            <li>this makeup is ok.....</li>
            <li>great product i love it, looks really nice when I apply it on my face, the only reason I give 4 stars is because come broke the top, but other then that is great</li>
            <li>but this is easily solved by using a damp sponge or by spraying your brush with either water or Fix+ (also by Mac).  </li>
            <li>almost seems like it&#x27;s not an original MAC product, but in a MAC glass bottle.</li>
            <li>but when time is limited, I apply with my fingertips and still get great results.</li>
            <li>It smells super chemically and when applied, it feels like my skin can&#x27;t breathe.</li>
            <li>Having such a fair skin tone, it&#x27;s often to find drugstore foundations that are the right color.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way thicker, goes on splotchy, doesn&#x27;t stay on all day like the real stuff does, and it even has a strong odor.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who is interested.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I prefer.</li>
            <li>Much thicker than any MAC foundation I&#x27;ve used before.  </li>
            <li>I really like how I found this product at a way cheaper price than any Mac stores around where I live.</li>
            <li>I particularly like this foundation because of its coverage.  </li>
            <li>Why is this foundatio ten dollars more than on the MAC cosmetics actual website?</li>
            <li>The coverage is crappy and you can tell by the bottle cap, that its clearly not Mac original product.</li>
            <li>Also, if you&#x27;re going to invest in a make-up product I would always suggest foundation because no matter how amazing your eyeshadow looks, if you&#x27;re skin looks bad it will detract the beauty of your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this foundation and will continue to repurchase it.  </li>
            <li>I love that Mac has such a wide shade range.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and Mac doesn&#x27;t cause irritations for me.</li>
            <li>I think the foundation was old or used..</li>
            <li>In this case I was pleasantly surprised and will continue to use MAC Foundation.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t want it anywhere near my skin.</li>
            <li>I live in the South and the spf has been enough to prevent new freckles and skin darkening from happening.</li>
            <li>I use the Studio Fix Fluid in NC15 everyday that I wear a full face of foundation which is about four days a week.  </li>
            <li>The only other downside really for some people is the price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super thick and oily.</li>

            <li> The only other downside really for some people is the price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super thick and oily.</li>
            <li> This particular formula goes on very easily, a little covers a lot</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really watery, no coverage and 3 shades lighter than NC30 usually is.</li>
            <li> , this actually ends up being cheaper in the long run.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth sending back since the shipping was like $8</li>
            <li> but I have to say that I feel this formula is less oily and &#x27;thick&#x27; and amazingly reasonable</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to buying drugstore foundations that usually range between $7-$15, $36 may seem like a lot to fork over for a foundation, especially when you think about all the money you&#x27;re spending on your other products, but I have had the same bottle of foundation for 4 months</li>
            <li> Only thing I wish they had a different container for these because it&#x27;s so hard to take out.</li>
            <li> I have been using Mac Cosmetics for the last few years now and they never cease to amaze me.  </li>
            <li> Spend a few extra dollars and get 2014 product at the MAC store.</li>
            <li> so I always have to be careful</li>
            <li> It was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for this time around, it seemed extra thick.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way without clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re often too dark or too pink for my skin.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not even half empty and</li>
            <li> I took it to MAC, and the lady started laughing and flipped the bottle upside down.  </li>
            <li> No matter how red my skin is or how tired I look, this foundation makes my skin look flawless.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a heavy film</li>
            <li> For those who wanted to save a few dollars.</li>
            <li> , it does NOT feel at all greasy and doesn&#x27;t look dried out on the skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a heavy foundation.  </li>
            <li> I have used Mac for years and usually get it from the Mac Store.</li>
            <li> no where near going bad.  </li>
            <li> It can also get cake-y and thick looking</li>
            <li> Just goes to show that sometimes a less expensive brand doesn&#x27;t mean the quality will be lessened.  </li>
            <li> I waited an entire month to receive this product only to find that it&#x27;s horrible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also guilty of using past the expiration date and haven&#x27;t noticed a change in quality but use your judgement on that.</li>
            <li> It is very thick.</li>
            <li> Also, the cap is weird...</li>
            <li> So fake!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Je suis contente de l&#x27;honnêteté du vendeur, envoi rapide, produit décrit, tout est ent ordre.  Le fond va bien, mais j&#x27;ai quelques boutons avec, tout dépend de la peau, donc pas de panique, ce n&#x27;est peut-être pas le cas pour vous, et de plus, les boutons s&#x27;en vont après...  merci.</li>
            <li> This was received in a reasonable amount of time and in perfect condition, i was completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> everything was perfect</li>
            <li> I have used Mac for years and usually get it from the Mac Store. I decided to order it online for the price and convenience. Big Mistake! This was either expired or a knock off because it was not like the kind from the store. It&#x27;s way thicker, goes on splotchy, doesn&#x27;t stay on all day like the real stuff does, and it even has a strong odor. Yuck! I will never order this again.</li>
            <li> I have been using Mac Cosmetics for the last few years now and they never cease to amaze me.  I use the Studio Fix Fluid in NC15 everyday that I wear a full face of foundation which is about four days a week.  Having such a fair skin tone, it&#x27;s often to find drugstore foundations that are the right color.  They&#x27;re often too dark or too pink for my skin.  I love that Mac has such a wide shade range.  The coverage is also amazing.  No matter how red my skin is or how tired I look, this foundation makes my skin look flawless.&lt;br /&gt;Although I love this foundation, it does have a tendency to break people out and can sometimes cause the problems that we wish to cover.  It can also get cake-y and thick looking but this is easily solved by using a damp sponge or by spraying your brush with either water or Fix+ (also by Mac).  The only other downside really for some people is the price.  If you&#x27;re used to buying drugstore foundations that usually range between $7-$15, $36 may seem like a lot to fork over for a foundation, especially when you think about all the money you&#x27;re spending on your other products, but I have had the same bottle of foundation for 4 months and it&#x27;s not even half empty and no where near going bad.  Also, if you&#x27;re going to invest in a make-up product I would always suggest foundation because no matter how amazing your eyeshadow looks, if you&#x27;re skin looks bad it will detract the beauty of your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this foundation and will continue to repurchase it.  It never oxidizes on my skin or makes me look orange.  Also, if applied correctly and finished with powder it will last all day without making me look oily.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is interested.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation. It has great coverage. It&#x27;s not powdery or greasy. It&#x27;s exactly what I prefer. And I love that it includes SPF 15! As always, MAC is the best.</li>
            <li> This is the really deal, I love this MAC foundation, blends in beautifully.</li>
            <li> I like it stay on all day</li>
            <li> I get best results when using a makeup brush but when time is limited, I apply with my fingertips and still get great results. Having freckles, there isn&#x27;t many brands out there that can cover them without looking caked on, but Mac does. I don&#x27;t have a heavy film feel to my skin when I wear it, it doesn&#x27;t run if I sweat or am outdoors. I live in the South and the spf has been enough to prevent new freckles and skin darkening from happening. A little goes a long way without clogging my pores. The upfront cost is more than what your grocery or pharmacy carries but when you take into consideration how often you replace the cheaper stuff compared to this, this actually ends up being cheaper in the long run. I&#x27;m also guilty of using past the expiration date and haven&#x27;t noticed a change in quality but use your judgement on that. I have sensitive skin and Mac doesn&#x27;t cause irritations for me.</li>
            <li> Add me to the list of reviewers who received a pasty product that can&#x27;t even be applied through a makeup applicator!  I took it to MAC, and the lady started laughing and flipped the bottle upside down.  She showed me that it says &amp;#34;AC 9&amp;#34; which means that it was made in 2009.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lesson I learned?  Spend a few extra dollars and get 2014 product at the MAC store.</li>
            <li> I think the foundation was old or used.. It is very thick. It won&#x27;t even come out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I really like how I found this product at a way cheaper price than any Mac stores around where I live. Great buy. Only thing I wish they had a different container for these because it&#x27;s so hard to take out.</li>
            <li> This is $27 on the actual MAC site. For those who wanted to save a few dollars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had oily skin that tends to break out so I always have to be careful what kind of foundation I use.  This particular formula goes on very easily, a little covers a lot, it does NOT feel at all greasy and doesn&#x27;t look dried out on the skin.  I tried the much pricier Laura Mercier oil-free foundation which was very good too but I have to say that I feel this formula is less oily and &#x27;thick&#x27; and amazingly reasonable ($26 - pump is optional at $6 extra).  Just goes to show that sometimes a less expensive brand doesn&#x27;t mean the quality will be lessened.  In this case I was pleasantly surprised and will continue to use MAC Foundation.</li>
            <li> I buy this makeup from the MAC store all the time. I thought I&#x27;d save myself a trip and buy it here, which was a mistake. The consistency is paste like, which is way different than the MAC foundation I get from the store. I can&#x27;t even get it out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> great product i love it, looks really nice when I apply it on my face, the only reason I give 4 stars is because come broke the top, but other then that is great</li>
            <li> I have been wearing MAC makeup for many years.  I particularly like this foundation because of its coverage.  It&#x27;s a heavy foundation.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for this time around, it seemed extra thick.  Much thicker than any MAC foundation I&#x27;ve used before.  Also, the cap is weird...almost seems like it&#x27;s not an original MAC product, but in a MAC glass bottle.</li>
            <li> DO not buy this product. It is not Mac. It smells super chemically and when applied, it feels like my skin can&#x27;t breathe. The coverage is crappy and you can tell by the bottle cap, that its clearly not Mac original product. It&#x27;s super thick and oily. I waited an entire month to receive this product only to find that it&#x27;s horrible. It&#x27;s not worth sending back since the shipping was like $8 so I just threw it away. don&#x27;t want it anywhere near my skin.</li>
            <li> this makeup is ok..... but it does not stay on all day if you have oily skin.  I had to re-apply. This can get pricey if you have to keep re-applying.</li>
            <li> It was everything I expected. It´s all. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good.</li>
            <li> Received in good condition.</li>
            <li> So fake! I used to work for MAC. It&#x27;s really watery, no coverage and 3 shades lighter than NC30 usually is.</li>
            <li> Why is this foundatio ten dollars more than on the MAC cosmetics actual website? That&#x27;s what I want to know.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the product.  I have ordered it many times and it was true to the excellent brand quality.  Thank you!</li>
