            <li>Seacret is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li>It has cleared those area&#x27;s up pretty good</li>
            <li>I wish it were available in a pump form (i don&#x27;t love bars), and wish it were $10 here as it is in the mall  </li>
            <li>Very flattering to receive comments on how good my skin</li>
            <li>Beautiful soft skin and clean</li>
            <li>I want to order more Original product, not expired or repackaged.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product is just amazing!</li>
            <li>and it seemed to work fine.</li>
            <li>if i only use it sparingly, it works great.</li>
            <li>great product especially for those with skin problems.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get enough of this great brand.</li>
            <li>Love, love the product but the product wasn&#x27;t packed very well.  </li>
            <li>Works very good will buy it again and also will recommend it to others and will try other product of this brand</li>
            <li>It was getting better at first</li>
            <li>Bought my first bars in Israel and it worked so well on my husband&#x27;s skin that I bought more.</li>
            <li>This was an original Seacret Product.</li>
            <li>my face felt so clean no residue at all</li>
            <li>totally clean  </li>
            <li>Seacret always leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturised.</li>
            <li>im loving it,need  to  order  more  later  </li>
            <li>My skin feels squeaky clean after cleansing.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my skin nice and clear!</li>
            <li>I have used this soap for over a year and just love it, my skin is smooth, and always feels clean after the shower,No drying of my skin, I always make sure I have extra in the cupboard so as to not run out.</li>
            <li>this is my absolute favorite face wash, I prefer to buy it on here though because seacret&#x27;s s&amp;h fees are outa control</li>
            <li>So one would definitely have to follow-up with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>not a bad product.</li>
            <li>Very gentle!</li>
            <li>sure i  will put a new  order</li>
            <li>It also keeps a good balance between oily and dry.</li>
            <li>It seemed to last a pretty good amount of uses.</li>
            <li>I have used this product over the last 2 years and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I have been using it and don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s worth $11.</li>
            <li>I count on the soap to clean without residue and yet be gentle and enriching.</li>
            <li>I had acne in the past and used Desert Essence&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil face cleansing wash which cleared up my skin greatly, but this soap is a bit easier to carry around when traveling.</li>
            <li>Sometimes most cleanser that clean oil will dry my skin</li>
            <li>Or not, if your skin isn&#x27;t originally naturally dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I just love this particular soap \\&quot;because\\</li>
            <li>So glad the sales rep stopped me at the local malls kiosk.</li>
            <li>If you use this soap, just be aware what it can do.</li>
            <li>This soap leaves the skin oil free and soft as ever.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out and lasts FOREVER!</li>
            <li>This product did exactly what it said it was going to do.</li>
            <li>This soup becomes my family&#x27;s fav face cleanser ever since their first time using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds of soaps.  </li>
            <li>i need soap for good skin, this time i buyed the dead sea .&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face feels soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>I was a seacret agent in the past and loved its products</li>
            <li>I have combo skin and very acne</li>
            <li>It pulls out every bit of oil from facial pores, leaving the skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>Bottom line is I really like the product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recomend it for all skin-types!</li>
            <li>She really likes it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I also purchased a bar for myself and really like it.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t drying and can also be used on your whole body.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper to buy through amazon than in the shops.  </li>
            <li>Fast service.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You really just have to try this soap out for yourself.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t believe that it works the same on everyone, I do believe that cleansing with it -- does leave your skin feeling clean, fresh, yet somewhat of a dry type of clean feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li>I believe I got more compliments while using this soap along with their other products.</li>
            <li>I have been using it a few Weeks now, seems to be ok, won&#x27;t really know the real result until a month or so.   </li>
            <li>My skin looks better than ever and take away dark spots in neck and between legs.</li>
            <li>My skin was exfoliated now my elbows have new skin!</li>
            <li>Black Soap is doing its job cleaning,  don&#x27;t expect a magical result, soap is soap.</li>
            <li>&quot; it contains ingredients that&#x27;s less potent than most soaps do without harsh chemicals to get a similar effect of giving you that squeaky clean feeling.</li>
            <li>This product is nothing short of making my skin clear, clean and vibrant.</li>
            <li>Definitely saw a significant decrease in breakouts, improved overall skin tone after first couple uses.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin</li>
            <li>The minerals from the dead sea, along with being paraben free is very helpful and healing for the skin.</li>
            <li>Only drawback is that the suds are black which isn&#x27;t a good look when you have a white tile bathroom and soap holder.  </li>
            <li>I decided I was interested in the mud soap (A) Because it was only $10  </li>
            <li>Wow !</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft!</li>
            <li>My feet are soft and my face  is soft!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other facial cleansing soaps in the past but this by far does a great job.</li>
            <li>My face is clear and is no longer oily.  </li>
            <li>Was told it would help clear up body acne and have seen no improvement after using for a couple months.  </li>
            <li>My skin has improved SO much in the last 4 nights.</li>
            <li>and my skin was so soft.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favourite skin care brand and soap.</li>
            <li>My face is really sensitive and it&#x27;s combination, i recommended it to my family and my brother even stole one from me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to a lot of products.  </li>
            <li>I had a third degree burn on my face and neck from being exposed to the sun (I live in Phoenix AZ where the temperature could rise to 120F).</li>
            <li>It is the only thing that is gentle enough to keep my face from breaking out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also unconvinced about the dead sea minerals part, the bar has a very translucent and waxy look to it, very synthetic.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyone who&#x27;s every purchased multiple over-the-counter products or specially ordered products online before know that there are a ton of soaps out that that do the same exact thing, whether they&#x27;re more or less expensive, name brand or no name brand.</li>
            <li>i will stick to my old facial wash .</li>
            <li>The only thing it has over my homemade soap is soft skin.</li>
            <li>Brand new generic screen protector.&lt;br /&gt;Clear, ultra thin and durable.&lt;br /&gt;Custom designed to fit your tablet.&lt;br /&gt;Shield and protect your screen from unwanted</li>

            <li> This soap leaves the skin oil free and soft as ever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out and lasts FOREVER!</li>
            <li> This product did exactly what it said it was going to do.</li>
            <li> This soup becomes my family&#x27;s fav face cleanser ever since their first time using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds of soaps.  </li>
            <li> i need soap for good skin, this time i buyed the dead sea .&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face feels soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> I was a seacret agent in the past and loved its products</li>
            <li> I have combo skin and very acne</li>
            <li> It pulls out every bit of oil from facial pores, leaving the skin smooth.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line is I really like the product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recomend it for all skin-types!</li>
            <li> She really likes it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I also purchased a bar for myself and really like it.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t drying and can also be used on your whole body.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper to buy through amazon than in the shops.  </li>
            <li> Fast service.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You really just have to try this soap out for yourself.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t believe that it works the same on everyone, I do believe that cleansing with it -- does leave your skin feeling clean, fresh, yet somewhat of a dry type of clean feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> I believe I got more compliments while using this soap along with their other products.</li>
            <li> I have been using it a few Weeks now, seems to be ok, won&#x27;t really know the real result until a month or so.   </li>
            <li> My skin looks better than ever and take away dark spots in neck and between legs.</li>
            <li> My skin was exfoliated now my elbows have new skin!</li>
            <li> Black Soap is doing its job cleaning,  don&#x27;t expect a magical result, soap is soap.</li>
            <li> &quot; it contains ingredients that&#x27;s less potent than most soaps do without harsh chemicals to get a similar effect of giving you that squeaky clean feeling.</li>
            <li> This product is nothing short of making my skin clear, clean and vibrant.</li>
            <li> Definitely saw a significant decrease in breakouts, improved overall skin tone after first couple uses.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin</li>
            <li> The minerals from the dead sea, along with being paraben free is very helpful and healing for the skin.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is that the suds are black which isn&#x27;t a good look when you have a white tile bathroom and soap holder.  </li>
            <li> I decided I was interested in the mud soap (A) Because it was only $10  </li>
            <li> Wow !</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> My feet are soft and my face  is soft!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other facial cleansing soaps in the past but this by far does a great job.</li>
            <li> My face is clear and is no longer oily.  </li>
            <li> Was told it would help clear up body acne and have seen no improvement after using for a couple months.  </li>
            <li> My skin has improved SO much in the last 4 nights.</li>
            <li> and my skin was so soft.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favourite skin care brand and soap.</li>
            <li> My face is really sensitive and it&#x27;s combination, i recommended it to my family and my brother even stole one from me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to a lot of products.  </li>
            <li> I had a third degree burn on my face and neck from being exposed to the sun (I live in Phoenix AZ where the temperature could rise to 120F).</li>
            <li> It is the only thing that is gentle enough to keep my face from breaking out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also unconvinced about the dead sea minerals part, the bar has a very translucent and waxy look to it, very synthetic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyone who&#x27;s every purchased multiple over-the-counter products or specially ordered products online before know that there are a ton of soaps out that that do the same exact thing, whether they&#x27;re more or less expensive, name brand or no name brand.</li>
            <li> i will stick to my old facial wash .</li>
            <li> The only thing it has over my homemade soap is soft skin.</li>
            <li> Brand new generic screen protector.&lt;br /&gt;Clear, ultra thin and durable.&lt;br /&gt;Custom designed to fit your tablet.&lt;br /&gt;Shield and protect your screen from unwanted</li>
            <li> The scars and the pimples i had all started to fade, i had blisters all over my face and neck and literally a month after using this product my face became clear, the pimples went away, it left my face moisturized and it reduced the scars and dark spots left by acne and the sun burn a lot.</li>
            <li> I have been using african black soap for months with fairly clear skin from this soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mild acne for years which has only gotten worse with time.</li>
            <li> I love the Secret Minerals From the Dead Sea Mud Soap</li>
            <li> I think the soap ordered online may have been sitting in someone&#x27;s inventory too long.</li>
            <li> It heals and prevents breakouts without over drying my sensitive skin with harsh acids.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve personally been told that the Seacret Mud Soap contains minerals from the Dead Sea that has healing powers, and that it has potential for eliminating acne, which I occasionally have, including eczema.</li>
            <li> But, it did leave it dry.</li>
            <li> Now I dry skin peeling off plus acne.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Keep the bar dry</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling dry &amp; patchy looking.</li>
            <li> I bought it because my face, elbows and feet were dry.</li>
            <li> May leave dark rings and soap stains in a white tub (if that matters).</li>
            <li> My face is less red and its clearing up.</li>
            <li> prone the last few months.</li>
            <li> At home I lathered up the mud soap, applied it, left it on until it dried out (about 5 mins).  </li>
            <li> I got this bar for $15 and I have to say it was money well spent.</li>
            <li> disadvantage is although I keep the soap in a closed soap dish the soap gets a bit soggy.  </li>
            <li> Plus I never feel all that clean after using it since it&#x27;s &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; and leaves the tub dirty as well.  </li>
            <li> My homemade soap makes my skin feel tight and dry after a shower.</li>
            <li> so I usually have to put lotion on afterwards to make it smell like I actually took a shower</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also using it other area&#x27;s on my body where I have skin problems.  </li>
            <li> Was hoping this would help clear my skin, but unfortunately it did only slightly so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to review face products because everyone is different.</li>
            <li> Not worth $15 a bar at all.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it</li>
            <li> Not worth a fraction of the price tag.</li>
            <li> i think, for me at least, it should only be used every few days.</li>
            <li> No more dry skin!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling tight.</li>
            <li> Just wish it was a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> The soap was out of the box and the box was mashed, thus the&lt;br /&gt;soap was a little crumbly.</li>
            <li> As a P.S., all the prescribed medications I have used have never worked for any length of time; and Ded Sea Mud Soap is not letting me down!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who is tired of using regular soap and is looking to improve their skin condition.</li>
            <li> I WILL say that I think this slightly helper my pityriasis rosea but acne, NO!</li>
            <li> Her skin is softer, less dry and has decreased the itching.</li>
            <li> It gets all that gunk out of my face and seems to dry up zits I already have without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for the past 4-5 years.</li>
            <li> My soap purchased at Amazon had a faintly stale odor, very different from the odor of the soap bought at the home show.</li>
            <li> I have psoriais on my elbpws and knees; the soap reduces the hard scale and soothes the itch...</li>
            <li> product came a day late but that wasnt a problem.</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> They say it&#x27;s unscented but it has some awful smell right out of the package.</li>
            <li> This product is making my acne worse.</li>
            <li> Expensive, doesn&#x27;t do what it says.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would help my daughter&#x27;s eczema but mad it worse.</li>
            <li> I have always had very bad skin due to hormone issues ---</li>
            <li> I must comment when it comes to this product, and I mean MUST!!!</li>
            <li> The bad news is I can&#x27;t tell the difference between this soap and storebought soap.</li>
            <li> Awful I dont like how my skin feels after I use it</li>
            <li> My acne has never been horrible.</li>
            <li> but now my face is horrible</li>
            <li> Horrible !</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> 4 nights of use... I don&#x27;t know how I have went without this product until now. I absolutely LOVE this soap for my face. The 1st night I used it, it felt like I just deeply exfoliated. It leaves my skin like silk. I use it once a day at nights before bed. It&#x27;s hard to review face products because everyone is different. I have combo skin and very acne prone the last few months. My skin has improved SO much in the last 4 nights. Strongly reccommend!!</li>
            <li> I use this as both facial and body wash, and I like it. Don&#x27;t expect to smell good afterwards though... so I usually have to put lotion on afterwards to make it smell like I actually took a shower lol. I have normal skin so I do not have any miracle stories from this soap. but it is okay.</li>
            <li> The shipping was on time and I didnt having any problems with gettting my products. Overall, I love this soap; it is truly a wonderful item for your skin. The soap will help improve the texture. This is a must try, give it 90 Days. :-)</li>
            <li> I bought this at a kiosk at the mall --- reluctantly.  It was one of those things where they trap you while you&#x27;re walking on your way somewhere.  Anyway, I wanted to get moving...  I decided I was interested in the mud soap (A) Because it was only $10  (B) Because my skin is heinous and I thought mud might be helpful.  At home I lathered up the mud soap, applied it, left it on until it dried out (about 5 mins).  Result: Phenomenal.    I have always had very bad skin due to hormone issues --- that has never resolved itself.  I have needed to go to a dermatologist since age 15, and have never stopped needing medical help resolving these problems.  The mud helps from an external standpoint:  It pulls out every bit of oil from facial pores, leaving the skin smooth.  It leaves the skin and pores receptive to moisturizer, bioidentical hormone cream, prescription creams.... what-have-you.  Bottom line is I really like the product.  I wish it were available in a pump form (i don&#x27;t love bars), and wish it were $10 here as it is in the mall  (seller, take note?).  But I will keep it as part of my facial regimen.</li>
            <li> product came a day late but that wasnt a problem. about the product itself.... when u first use it, its the best soap ive ever tried. my face felt so clean no residue at all and my skin was so soft. however, when i used it everyday for a week straight, it started to strip my skin. it started to burn. i think, for me at least, it should only be used every few days. if i only use it sparingly, it works great.</li>
            <li> Not worth $15 a bar at all.  Dries out my face. Doesn&#x27;t have a nice smell.  Not worth it</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for the past 4-5 years. It is the only thing that is gentle enough to keep my face from breaking out. It also keeps a good balance between oily and dry. I don&#x27;t have any oily patches on my face when I use it. I highly recomend it for all skin-types!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I&#x27;ve used other facial cleansing soaps in the past but this by far does a great job. My face is clear and is no longer oily.  I&#x27;m also using it other area&#x27;s on my body where I have skin problems.  It has cleared those area&#x27;s up pretty good and I&#x27;m looking forward to see how well it does the longer I use it.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is tired of using regular soap and is looking to improve their skin condition.</li>
            <li> This product along with the salt scrub and body butter helped my daughters eczema. So glad the sales rep stopped me at the local malls kiosk. I went on to buy the soap online and the rest of the products from the kiosk. Wow ! great product especially for those with skin problems. The minerals from the dead sea, along with being paraben free is very helpful and healing for the skin. Thank you Amazon and thank you Tommy.</li>
            <li> Its a good product. It cleaned my pores and face isnt so oily. ?. But, it did leave it dry. But my body feels awesome.  I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Expensive, doesn&#x27;t do what it says. Dries my skin out without clearing it up. Now I dry skin peeling off plus acne.</li>
            <li> The product is great and the expectation has been met in a timely manner.  Thank you for making us a satisfied customers.</li>
            <li> this is my absolute favorite face wash, I prefer to buy it on here though because seacret&#x27;s s&amp;h fees are outa control</li>
            <li> I have been using it a few Weeks now, seems to be ok, won&#x27;t really know the real result until a month or so.   It&#x27;s been awhile now. Black Soap is doing its job cleaning,  don&#x27;t expect a magical result, soap is soap. Made for cleaning your body.</li>
            <li> Works very good will buy it again and also will recommend it to others and will try other product of this brand</li>
            <li> I Have not been using this product for long(3weeks) but I surely seen the difference. My face is less red and its clearing up.</li>
            <li> Awful I dont like how my skin feels after I use it my face felt as if their was residue  on it just didnt  feeI  totally clean  i will stick to my old facial wash .</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this soap for my daughter who has eczema.  She really likes it. Her skin is softer, less dry and has decreased the itching. I plan on buying more.</li>
            <li> I count on the soap to clean without residue and yet be gentle and enriching. Perfect balance of both for me.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favourite skin care brand and soap. Seacret always leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturised. Can&#x27;t get enough of this great brand. Just wish it was a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> really  good im loving it,need  to  order  more  later  on,if its  running  out  i  will  make  sure i  will put a new  order</li>
            <li> Brand new generic screen protector.&lt;br /&gt;Clear, ultra thin and durable.&lt;br /&gt;Custom designed to fit your tablet.&lt;br /&gt;Shield and protect your screen from unwanted</li>
            <li> This soap is great! I use it every morning. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Very gentle!</li>
            <li> I love this soap. My face and body have not had any acne breakouts since I started using this soap. My skin is so soft! My daughter loves this mud soap too.</li>
            <li> Clears up acne and psoriasis. Seriously.  My sister used it on my niece&#x27;s psoriasis and it cleared it up by 75% within a week. I bought it for my teenager for acne and it worked just as well. Keep the bar dry and it will last 2-3 months with daily use.</li>
            <li> I must comment when it comes to this product, and I mean MUST!!! Lol. This product is nothing short of making my skin clear, clean and vibrant. I believe I got more compliments while using this soap along with their other products. However the soap alone is enough!! Try today!!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Leaves your skin SQUEAKY clean!!  Only drawback is that the suds are black which isn&#x27;t a good look when you have a white tile bathroom and soap holder.  Still a great product though....</li>
            <li> I have been using african black soap for months with fairly clear skin from this soap. I read great reviews on this product and thought okay maybe this will be my answer. My acne has never been horrible. Well, now it is. This product is making my acne worse. It was getting better at first but now my face is horrible and I am embarrassed to go anywhere. I&#x27;m even glad it&#x27;s winter so I can wear a scarf around my neck and hide my face in it. If you use this soap, just be aware what it can do. For some people it may work great. I WILL say that I think this slightly helper my pityriasis rosea but acne, NO!</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would help my daughter&#x27;s eczema but mad it worse. I have been using it and don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s worth $11.</li>
            <li> Definitely saw a significant decrease in breakouts, improved overall skin tone after first couple uses. At $15 One of seacrets best bang for your buck value deals without a doubt.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product and she is very pleased with it. If she is happy then so am I.</li>
            <li> i need soap for good skin, this time i buyed the dead sea .&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s nice and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;have you good time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> This soap is absolutely amazing! I have psoriais on my elbpws and knees; the soap reduces the hard scale and soothes the itch...I can never be without it again! As a P.S., all the prescribed medications I have used have never worked for any length of time; and Ded Sea Mud Soap is not letting me down!</li>
            <li> This is the best soap I have found to use on my sensitive skin.  It leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> This soap leaves the skin oil free and soft as ever.</li>
            <li> Probably some of the best soap that I have had the pleasure of using. It seemed to last a pretty good amount of uses. not a bad product.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap on my face for years. It&#x27;s gentle, doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out and lasts FOREVER! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for over a year and just love it, my skin is smooth, and always feels clean after the shower,No drying of my skin, I always make sure I have extra in the cupboard so as to not run out.</li>
            <li> Horrible ! Will not purchase again! It leaves my face feeling dry &amp; patchy looking. &amp; it burns my face.</li>
            <li> I love the Secret Minerals From the Dead Sea Mud Soap it leaves a glow to my skin. I would like to purchase the produce again.</li>
            <li> This soap is like magic for your face. I had a third degree burn on my face and neck from being exposed to the sun (I live in Phoenix AZ where the temperature could rise to 120F). The scars and the pimples i had all started to fade, i had blisters all over my face and neck and literally a month after using this product my face became clear, the pimples went away, it left my face moisturized and it reduced the scars and dark spots left by acne and the sun burn a lot. My face is really sensitive and it&#x27;s combination, i recommended it to my family and my brother even stole one from me.</li>
            <li> Love it will be all over again.  Beautiful soft skin and clean well.  My skin looks better than ever and take away dark spots in neck and between legs. It is amazing</li>
            <li> Thanks great product and service!</li>
            <li> I bought this soap at a Seacret home show before buying it online. My soap purchased at Amazon had a faintly stale odor, very different from the odor of the soap bought at the home show. I think the soap ordered online may have been sitting in someone&#x27;s inventory too long. I used it anyway and it seemed to work fine. Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy online again, though.</li>
            <li> Love, love the product but the product wasn&#x27;t packed very well.  The soap was out of the box and the box was mashed, thus the&lt;br /&gt;soap was a little crumbly.</li>
            <li> Love it! You will never use another product on your face again, I promise!</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s acne has disappear!</li>
            <li> This can be used on your face too, not just the body.  And it leaves the skin feeling like silk and does not leave a residue on your skin like some.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Excellent facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> This product did exactly what it said it was going to do. I&#x27;m very satisfied. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Bought this from a mall kiosk. I&#x27;ve had mild acne for years which has only gotten worse with time. I got this bar for $15 and I have to say it was money well spent. It gets all that gunk out of my face and seems to dry up zits I already have without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> Was recommended by my hairdresser for my teenage sons.  My oldest uses it faithfully and you can tell, my youngest doesn&#x27;t and you can tell!!!  I also purchased a bar for myself and really like it.  It isn&#x27;t drying and can also be used on your whole body.  Great price!!!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product is just amazing! You do need to use a moisturizer after wash. I have used this product over the last 2 years and absolutely love it! Keeps my skin nice and clear! I had acne in the past and used Desert Essence&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil face cleansing wash which cleared up my skin greatly, but this soap is a bit easier to carry around when traveling. Both products delivered great results but I will keep it at the mud soap for now.</li>
            <li> Recommend it to people with acne. My daughter has had great success with this soap , it has cleared her skin beautifully</li>
            <li> wont go without it...I was a seacret agent in the past and loved its products but I prefer getting it here!</li>
            <li> They say it&#x27;s unscented but it has some awful smell right out of the package. The good news is there&#x27;s no smell in the shower. The bad news is I can&#x27;t tell the difference between this soap and storebought soap. I&#x27;m also unconvinced about the dead sea minerals part, the bar has a very translucent and waxy look to it, very synthetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I had a recent outbreak of acne on my chin and after a week of washing with this soap, my acne has only spread. The only thing it has over my homemade soap is soft skin. My homemade soap makes my skin feel tight and dry after a shower. But I&#x27;m not about to pay $15 for one bar of soap.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.  My skin feels squeaky clean after cleansing.  Much cheaper to buy through amazon than in the shops.  Very flattering to receive comments on how good my skin looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only disadvantage is although I keep the soap in a closed soap dish the soap gets a bit soggy.  Prefer to use a foaming facial cleanser but seacret don&#x27;t have one.  Tried the cleansing milk but prefer the soap.</li>
            <li> This soup becomes my family&#x27;s fav face cleanser ever since their first time using it. It is so amazing because it wash out oil but leave my face moisturized. Sometimes most cleanser that clean oil will dry my skin but this one does not! I purchased it many times and will keep using it forever !</li>
            <li> Was told it would help clear up body acne and have seen no improvement after using for a couple months.  Plus I never feel all that clean after using it since it&#x27;s &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; and leaves the tub dirty as well.  Not worth a fraction of the price tag.</li>
            <li> Bought my first bars in Israel and it worked so well on my husband&#x27;s skin that I bought more. Good for psoriasis-like problems.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling tight. Was hoping this would help clear my skin, but unfortunately it did only slightly so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has no scent, which I like. May leave dark rings and soap stains in a white tub (if that matters).</li>
            <li> Fast service.  I&#x27;m sensitive to a lot of products.  I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds of soaps.  This soap doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  My face feels soft and clean.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful facial soap and has done wonders for my skin. It heals and prevents breakouts without over drying my sensitive skin with harsh acids.</li>
            <li> Anyone who&#x27;s every purchased multiple over-the-counter products or specially ordered products online before know that there are a ton of soaps out that that do the same exact thing, whether they&#x27;re more or less expensive, name brand or no name brand. And people will tell you that there product out there that works, so that they may get you to purchase them. But what we all are most impressed about, are results: what it says it will do, along with leaves us feeling as though we&#x27;ve made the right decision in purchasing them. Preferably, one that was designed for our specific skins types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really just have to try this soap out for yourself. I&#x27;ve personally been told that the Seacret Mud Soap contains minerals from the Dead Sea that has healing powers, and that it has potential for eliminating acne, which I occasionally have, including eczema. While I don&#x27;t believe that it works the same on everyone, I do believe that cleansing with it -- does leave your skin feeling clean, fresh, yet somewhat of a dry type of clean feeling afterwards. So one would definitely have to follow-up with a good moisturizer. Or not, if your skin isn&#x27;t originally naturally dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I just love this particular soap \\&quot;because\\&quot; it contains ingredients that&#x27;s less potent than most soaps do without harsh chemicals to get a similar effect of giving you that squeaky clean feeling. The cost for it on Amazon though seems pretty steep, so I&#x27;ve opted to purchasing them here with some really great discounts instead: [...]</li>
