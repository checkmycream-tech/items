            <li>This is a great product and I recommend it very highly</li>
            <li>fragrant lovely silkening stuff...</li>
            <li>I was able to start washing my hair every three days.</li>
            <li>I love the pump.</li>
            <li>I can get better coverage with moist and tend not to over apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /</li>

            <li>Love the smell though.</li>

            <li>This is such a wonderful product for your hair and even as a hand lotion!  </li>
            <li>Buy this product you will love it.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice - vegan - and cheap.</li>
            <li>Did nothing to make it look better.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive and try this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>As a product reviewer of other hair products on my blog, (including those I have tried and sold and the ones that I just tried) I can say with great confidence that this product is superior to all the rest.  </li>
            <li>Which is great since I have 2 year old</li>
            <li>It is great for untangling my hair and making it really soft</li>
            <li>love it,  light and smells delish</li>
            <li>I wash my hair once a week because my hair is in incredible condition (even though the individual hairs fall out from my thyroid condition).  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best conditioner I have used to date.</li>
            <li>I love the heavenly, fresh aroma.</li>
            <li>Light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Made my hair nice and shiny and is an all natural product.  </li>
            <li>strong smell and doesn&#x27;t do much that I notice</li>
            <li>Definetly worth the money.</li>
            <li>it was very dry and brittle now my hair is nice and shiny using this product</li>
            <li>First off</li>
            <li>ever had the effects I was looking for , then I found Aja and fell in love instantly.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair pretty shiny, considering that I color it.</li>
            <li>For my hair to tame the frizz, it works best applying it when still wet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about what I put in my hair.</li>
            <li>I always get so much of the product in my finger nails when getting out of jars.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser recommended provana nevo intense therapy.  </li>
            <li>but I like L&#x27;anza healing color care trauma treatment for my hair when I have a perm and when my hair is straight.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other products and nothing</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>Because I have found this product I will be able to share it now with at least 30 vegetarian and vegan friends on the Internet and in real life.</li>
            <li>On wet hair I have to use more than I expected.</li>
            <li>This products natural ingredients helps with not having to wash.</li>
            <li>AYA Naturals is all natural.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>The cream is soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Hair is soft and protected from the harshness of heat from the hair drier.</li>
            <li>It mended a lot of my split ends allowing me to go few more weeks on my next hair trim.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using a bit more each day until I find the right amount to use for my short, thin hair.</li>
            <li>Whether I blow dry straight or air dry wavy, it works very well and doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t work well on dry hair.</li>
            <li>This conditioner has all the right ingredients for hair and doesn&#x27;t feel oily or weigh it down.</li>
            <li>I could barely comb my hair either.  </li>
            <li>At first I was  little hesitant to buy this product</li>
            <li>I have no grey</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s thick to much for my kind of hair, so I ended up adding water in small spray bottle &amp; a few pumps of conditioner it does seem to work on my Frizzed hair.</li>

            <li> I will be sharing it in the social media, not only on my blog, but in the various groups where my vegan and vegetarian friend are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that I will be trying other products in this Aya line here on Amazon.com  </li>
            <li> the order of this leave in conditioner is rather offensive, it does moisturize but the small is much to be disired.</li>
            <li> I am a senior with long hair needing some extra moisture between shampoos.  </li>
            <li> My last conditioner is really not of this quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Directions state to apply to moist or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tough on deciding what to use in my hair since I have a thyroid condition and lose certain amounts of hair when I wash and condition it.  </li>
            <li> but I use it when I am not wearing my hair down because it is so nutritious for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money trying all those other moisturizers out there</li>
            <li> It only takes a very small drop of the cream or it will make your hair too greasy.</li>
            <li> Usually I&#x27;m not able to brush my hair after shower I have very dry hair</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel heavy.</li>
            <li> Additionally, it is so heavily perfumed that after using it two times, I tossed it in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using it in his hair everyday since it arrived.  </li>
            <li> I found the product too thick and hard to use.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly thick hair</li>
            <li> I tried to use a very small amount to begin with, just to see what it did to my hair.  </li>
            <li> Not good for my perm</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling waxy and dirty!  </li>
            <li> Sadly, it doesn&#x27;t work well on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Sorry,</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t look or feel greasy or dirty after using.  </li>
            <li> I hate products in jars.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel terrible.  </li>

            <li> fragrant lovely silkening stuff...</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel amazing. I was able to start washing my hair every three days. This products natural ingredients helps with not having to wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about what I put in my hair. AYA Naturals is all natural. Only made with products you can EAT! Which is great since I have 2 year old that is always playing with or trying to eat my hair. Before I never used products in my hair for fear of hurting her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; First off I love the pump. I hate products in jars. I always get so much of the product in my finger nails when getting out of jars. So the pump is an awesome idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions state to apply to moist or dry hair. I tried both ways and I found it easier to apply in moist. I can get better coverage with moist and tend not to over apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Warning: People may sniff your hair. It has a very pleasant fruity smell. My daughter keeps smelling my hair and saying \\&quot;MMMMM!\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It makes my hair so soft. I actually play with it all the time now. My frizz is so much better and more manageable. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel heavy. My hair doesn&#x27;t look or feel greasy or dirty after using.  My hair is so healthy looking after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product! I will be recommending to family and friends!</li>
            <li> I have curly/frizzy hair. After shampooing and conditioning, I need a leave-in conditioner to bring it back to a curl from being frizzy. This product does not perform that function. Additionally, it is so heavily perfumed that after using it two times, I tossed it in the garbage. I wasted my money. For my purpose and sensitivities, I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Made my hair nice and shiny and is an all natural product.  As a Vegan, I appreciate that.  Great company to do business with.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other products and nothing ever had the effects I was looking for , then I found Aja and fell in love instantly. This is one of the best products I have found out there and Definetly worth the money. Don&#x27;t waste your money trying all those other moisturizers out there Aja has everything you could ever need and at a great cost.</li>
            <li> At first I was  little hesitant to buy this product and I am so glad I did. It is one of the best leave in conditioners I have bought! It smells great and it leaves my hair silky smooth and smelling great.  I have fairly thick hair and I color it every four weeks, my hair was drying at the ends which was why I was shopping for a leave in conditioner. This is a great product and I recommend it very highly</li>
            <li> Wonderful leave in conditioner.  Nice aroma, not too strong.  Easy to apply</li>
            <li> I have started to use the product and it&#x27;s great -- I&#x27;m very glad I ordered it</li>
            <li> this product is amazing it did my hair wonders it was very dry and brittle now my hair is nice and shiny using this product</li>
            <li> Your product smells great but it&#x27;s thick to much for my kind of hair, so I ended up adding water in small spray bottle &amp; a few pumps of conditioner it does seem to work on my Frizzed hair. I don&#x27;t use a lot. Seems to help. Love the smell though.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t work well on dry hair. On wet hair I have to use more than I expected. I&#x27;m using a bit more each day until I find the right amount to use for my short, thin hair. I love the heavenly, fresh aroma. The cream is soft and silky. It leaves my hair pretty shiny, considering that I color it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has all the right ingredients for hair and doesn&#x27;t feel oily or weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Love everything about this product... the ingredients. the scent,  and the wonderful results. Hair is soft and protected from the harshness of heat from the hair drier. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> It mended a lot of my split ends allowing me to go few more weeks on my next hair trim. For my hair to tame the frizz, it works best applying it when still wet. It smells great too.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Ul.  It is great for hair.  I have a perm and this conditioner makes my hair straighten.  Not good for my perm but I use it when I am not wearing my hair down because it is so nutritious for my hair.  Definitely not for permed hair if you want the curly look. I read the reviews before I bought it and thought it would be good for a perm.  My hairdresser recommended provana nevo intense therapy.  It works good for a perm but I like L&#x27;anza healing color care trauma treatment for my hair when I have a perm and when my hair is straight.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best conditioner I have used to date. I have never used vegan products before, but I am glad I got this! It is great for untangling my hair and making it really soft</li>
            <li> Received this great hair cream!! Love the way my hair feels after use!! It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent which is great! Usually I&#x27;m not able to brush my hair after shower I have very dry hair but I put this product in my hair and was able to brush it out with no problems!!</li>
            <li> Nice! Really great good my hair,but the scent is strong.</li>
            <li> strong smell and doesn&#x27;t do much that I notice</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a lovely product.  Light fragrance.  Truly conditions.  I use shampoo bars and I put this in after shower as my only conditioner.  I have long, fine, wavy hair.  Whether I blow dry straight or air dry wavy, it works very well and doesn&#x27;t take much.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is such a wonderful product for your hair and even as a hand lotion!  The smell is amazing!!  My husband has been using it in his hair everyday since it arrived.  We have never used a product with so many wonderful natural ingredients.  You can actually pronounce the ingredients. This conditioner  was made in Israel not China. Buy this product you will love it.  It only takes a very small drop of the cream or it will make your hair too greasy.</li>
            <li> love it,  light and smells delish</li>
            <li> As a product reviewer of other hair products on my blog, (including those I have tried and sold and the ones that I just tried) I can say with great confidence that this product is superior to all the rest.  I&#x27;m tough on deciding what to use in my hair since I have a thyroid condition and lose certain amounts of hair when I wash and condition it.  I wash my hair once a week because my hair is in incredible condition (even though the individual hairs fall out from my thyroid condition).  Hair dressers are always in awe of the condition of my hair and that I use no color at age 54!  I have no grey hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an animal activist, I am always looking for products that not only are not tested on animals, but are vegan if at all possible. So when I was presented with the opportunity to review this product I was also looking for a product to change to.  My last conditioner is really not of this quality. Because I have found this product I will be able to share it now with at least 30 vegetarian and vegan friends on the Internet and in real life. And they can share it as well.  I will be sharing it in the social media, not only on my blog, but in the various groups where my vegan and vegetarian friend are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that I will be trying other products in this Aya line here on Amazon.com  This is where I do most all of my shopping now days because I find quality products on Amazon and trust the reviews!</li>
            <li> the order of this leave in conditioner is rather offensive, it does moisturize but the small is much to be disired.</li>
            <li> Made my head itchy and swollen</li>
            <li> Smells nice - vegan - and cheap. Perfect combination.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel terrible.  Did nothing to make it look better.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it out!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive and try this conditioner.  Sadly, it doesn&#x27;t work well on my hair.  I am a senior with long hair needing some extra moisture between shampoos.  I found the product too thick and hard to use.  I tried to use a very small amount to begin with, just to see what it did to my hair.  It left my hair feeling waxy and dirty!  I could barely comb my hair either.  I had to wash it out the same day.  Sorry, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
