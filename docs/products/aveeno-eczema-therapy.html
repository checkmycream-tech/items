            <li>I can&#x27;t say how it works for people with chronic eczema, but if you have a temporary dermatitis rash, this lotion would be great as a part of your treatment strategy.</li>
            <li>I have no doubts that this works great for the non-pregnant.  </li>

            <li>Works amazingly on my eczema!</li>
            <li>We love this product and it is so soothing and works great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many remedies for the eczema on my hands and this has worked the best.</li>
            <li>:o)  </li>
            <li>nice try!).</li>
            <li>you using this cream in winter, it will provide perfect protection. :-)</li>
            <li>I suffer from eczema and thought this product would be great (it has really good reviews after all)</li>
            <li>This product is excellent and will buy more.  </li>
            <li>best to put it on when skin is damp ... and make sure to put it on at night before bed .... also using the soap-free wash for showers ...</li>
            <li>Great value &amp; good for the winter.</li>
            <li>Love this; it&#x27;s great for my eczema!</li>
            <li>Works great - Good deal</li>
            <li>Pleasant oatmeal scent.</li>
            <li>Others are very good, but this one is better.</li>
            <li>and it has worked so good</li>
            <li>I suffer from eczema and my doctor gave me a sample of this cream, which surprisingly works</li>
            <li>In conclusion, this lotion is not as good as it claims, neither did it heal or soothe the redness</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good moisturizer and makes my eczema look faded, until it wears off.</li>
            <li>&quot; I got on-line to look for eczema treatments, and as I knew Aveeno products were good, I ordered the Aveeno Eczema Cream.  </li>
            <li>Cera-Ve is a good cream, although not for my problem.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>I read that this product was superior to another product I ordered by mail.</li>
            <li>I tried this based on the good reviews on here.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this based on the good reviews</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find this cream in Canada, but I heard good reviews about it.</li>
            <li>but it is always good to know what you are allergic to)</li>
            <li>Bath bombs have baking soda which is good for the skin.</li>
            <li>A seemingly good product, but it shouldn&#x27;t be used even around your eyes (even though the warning just prohibits in eyes)</li>
            <li>The lotion is also non greasy and feels good on skin.</li>
            <li>The steroid cream has done good to my eyelids</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved the Aveeno Baby lotion for my kids</li>
            <li>It’s been a good 4 months that we are using this</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer and eczema cream.</li>
            <li>I gave this cream a try based on the good reviews</li>
            <li>And it smells good also.</li>
            <li>And her skin is absolutely smooth and great !</li>
            <li>He even like to show me just how good his legs look in the mornings.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>but this is really good moisturizer anyway.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>This is a good cream, but i think the revitol eczema dermatitis cream is good as well.</li>
            <li>Good product and good price.  </li>
            <li>Was as good as advertised.  </li>
            <li>good product</li>
            <li>However, if you want a really good cream for severe eczema, I found that I had to just make it myself.  </li>
            <li>This is a good cream for when you are on the go.</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>I think that it is a good product</li>
            <li>If you have skin problems, go to a dermatologist and get the good stuff.</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>good cream</li>
            <li>not as good as California baby, but cheaper.</li>
            <li>I wish it work, as good as I had read.</li>
            <li>It worked exceptionally well within just a couple days.  </li>
            <li>Amazon.com&#x27;s price is the best I&#x27;ve found anywhere and shipping was quick to Canada.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I am happy to report, it continued to improve and after 2 weeks of use, I feel fairly confident that it is quite healed.</li>
            <li>I am so happy and glad that I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>i am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve seen how many great reviews this one has</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the product and the service.</li>
            <li>For best result, apply it right after bath to keep the body moisturized.</li>

            <li>Moisturizes, relieves itch, no burn, amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>Amazing results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>, I think putting any kind of baby moisturizer on it, including this one, just irritates it.  </li>
            <li>A nice aid to what ever your using for your eczema.</li>
            <li>It might work as some kind of lotion if you haven&#x27;t rubbed or scratched your skin in any way.  </li>
            <li>While the lotion is a nice one in that (1) there is no offending smell, (2) it is quite moisturizing without being overly greasy (2)</li>
            <li>Probably contemplating the amputation of my own hands...</li>
            <li>I honestly thought it was just another type of lotion that just had eczema on the product.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly tell you that this product SAVED ME SKIN AND MY LIFE.</li>
            <li>Very beautiful, very like</li>
            <li>I used to have really nice skin</li>
            <li>i have eczema, and it acutely burns my skin</li>
            <li>ITS NOT GREASY.VERY NICE STUFF</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Aveeno products.</li>
            <li>but it works nicely without excema .  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m honestly amazed.</li>
            <li>so to be honest</li>
            <li>I googled pictures of it and it was like looking at my own face.</li>
            <li>In a day or two, if memory serves.&lt;br /&gt;Why grow any kind of beard if it causes excema rashes, you ask?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a good cream for eczema on my hands and nothing worked well until I tried this -- definitely better for my eczema than Burt&#x27;s Bees, Vaseline and YuBe.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-somewhat effective for reducing eczema lesions&lt;br /&gt;-pricy</li>
            <li>you so much Aveeno for this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>I thought it was some kind of allergic reaction or sensitiveness</li>
            <li>so I just hoped it would go away on its own.</li>
            <li>Nice smell.  </li>
            <li>I liked this.........great for my skin.</li>
            <li>It was really one of the best impulse buys of my life.  </li>
            <li>This lotion isn&#x27;t greasy, absorbs nicely and has no scent at all.</li>
            <li>Smothering her up 3 times a day with this prevents any kind of flares.</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li>Great for mild ecezma.  </li>
            <li>I replaced it with regular creams and everything was good after a couple days :D</li>
            <li>It is wonderful to have such good friends.  </li>
            <li>I have mild eczema on my hands and this cream is great for treating it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s probably the best product for my eczema thus far!</li>

            <li>By far the best cream against eczema!  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best lotion I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It is even more effective then the prescription.  </li>
            <li>I used CeraVe instead and liked it much better.</li>
            <li>Figured let&#x27;s Google some of the best eczema creams out there with natural ingredients and give it a shot.</li>
            <li>By far the best moisturizer on the market.</li>
            <li>I made this purchase after reading all the amazing reviews on how this product cured eyelid eczema like magic.</li>
            <li>far it is the best cream I have used ,including a cream that was prescribed for me by a physician.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend,excellent price.</li>
            <li>The best Eczema therapy treatment if have tried so far.</li>
            <li>Though the eczema isn&#x27;t completely gone, it is a great moisturizer and prevents itchy rashes!</li>
            <li>It is the best lotion for eczema I have used so far.</li>
            <li>This is the very best I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best.</li>
            <li>She said it is one of the most effective over the counter creams for her eczema she has ever had.</li>
            <li>It works on our 2 year old wonderfully!</li>
            <li>I have tried many creams and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Great for the whole family!</li>
            <li>very good to help with eczema and to prevent new outbreak</li>
            <li>but it seems very light compared to the one I always get.</li>
            <li>but it leaves this very light sticky residue</li>
            <li>This does have a very light tinge of oatmeal scent that dissipates.</li>
            <li>, it is very light and...</li>
            <li>Nice product, easy on the hands, and works well.</li>
            <li>so my baby loves it, which is a very important point as it makes her much more cooperative when I apply the cream.</li>
            <li>The very first time I put it on my hands my burning and itching stopped immediately!!</li>
            <li>The subscribe and save makes it a great deal on a large bottle</li>
            <li>A huge relief!</li>
            <li>I mostly get eczema on my knees and elbows, so this regimen works well for me.</li>
            <li>My eczema got better.</li>
            <li>I needed something that was safe to use all over...</li>
            <li>I decided to do some internet research to find a better solution and came across the National Eczema Associate site regarding Infants and Toddlers.</li>
            <li>but if I apply this every day the problem is mostly gone.</li>
            <li>I have done a lot research and tried so many products, and none of them worked until Aveeno Eczema cream.  </li>
            <li>so I tried it and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>I will be using Aveeno from now on :)</li>
            <li>My mom suggested using this and after one application, I was better.  </li>
            <li>Also did not leave a greasy feel as so many others do.</li>
            <li>I received Cetaphil Restoraderm today and hope it will be better than this product.</li>
            <li>do your homework to make sure a subscription pays for you).  </li>
            <li>and I had no reaction, so I am confident that ingredients must not be too harmful.</li>
            <li>Works excellent against Eczema related issues.</li>
            <li>I love this cream and wish I had discovered it years ago.  </li>
            <li>Every winter for many years I get eczema on the shins of both my legs.  </li>
            <li>My sons skin got better in 3 days.</li>
            <li>The more I used it the more softer it got.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many lotions and potions and attempts to get it</li>
            <li>I love this cream, it works and it is odorless.</li>
            <li>So while some people may be allergic to the oats, apparently many find it helpful.</li>
            <li>they were okay</li>
            <li>I love Aveeno for skin problems.  </li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>I put it on immediately after getting out of the shower and put Cetaphil moisturizing lotion on top of it.</li>
            <li>Although those work somewhat, this stuff works much much better.</li>
            <li>have to switch to a milder hand soap, or wear disposable gloves more</li>
            <li>This eczema treatment has made my eczema even better.  </li>
            <li>Love this lotion</li>
            <li>I found it worked better than RX cortisone cream, and it&#x27;s safer to use through the winter.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to go to a dermatologist because I was always able to hide it.</li>
            <li>For many years, I have struggled with eczema.  </li>
            <li>and after i tried this product everything went much better.</li>
            <li>so I am very happy that i found this cream especially now during my pregnancy.</li>
            <li>This cream you can use as many times.</li>
            <li>After using the product liberally for a week I&#x27;ve found that this lotion irritates my skin more than anything else.</li>
            <li>This works like magic.</li>
            <li>I sure hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t recommend it more.</li>
            <li>I love this cream and so does my baby.</li>
            <li>and I already seem to know more about it then these people leaving reviews.</li>
            <li>Sure fire way to figure it out take an oatmeal bath and see what happens</li>
            <li>My skin immediately felt better.</li>
            <li>Once I started applying the steroid cream at night and the Aveeno lotion in the morning, the results have been much more pronounced.    </li>
            <li>As for more severe, I would recommend using it in conjunction with a steroid cream.</li>
            <li>I have eczema that is naturally more irritable in the winter.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s changed my life for the better.</li>
            <li>and my doctor recommended that I put on non-perfumed hand cream many times a day.</li>
            <li>The product solved my itching skin immediately and was able to reduce the redness.</li>
            <li>the pediatrician gave us the okay to use it.  </li>
            <li>I like the 24 hour aveeno lotion better than this lotion.  </li>
            <li>This lotion burns more in deeper cracked skin.  </li>
            <li>This stuff did not help my eczema person but as a regular lotion, it&#x27;s GREAT!</li>
            <li>I love it, simply love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li>But the Aveeno Eczema cream has made my kids&#x27; skin SO smooth!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had doctor prescribed creams, but I think the Aveeno works better for me.</li>
            <li>The most problematic area are his cheeks because the dryness causes him to itch his face to the point of drawing blood.</li>
            <li>I have now been using it for 5 days and my face looks better than it has in years.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that this product is not at all greasy and that it&#x27;s unscented.</li>
            <li>My son has also been prescribed medicated cream for his skin, but most of the time we don&#x27;t need to use it because the Aveeno cream alone is sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will keep using it to see if it keeps getting better.</li>
            <li>I assume more healing could take place if I applied it more often during the day.</li>
            <li>she uses it on her 2-year-old daughter--and was rather pleased with it.</li>
            <li>And deffantly buying some more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve suffered from severe eczema for many years, all over my body including most of my face, and this cream has changed everything.</li>
            <li>Could not do better.</li>
            <li>Wil most definetely recommand it to people with eczema.</li>
            <li>we have struggled with so many products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really love this cream and hope it continues to do what its been doing for me.</li>
            <li>It was begging me to scratch it, but I resisted most of the time.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many many creams, lotions over the counter and prescription ones.</li>
            <li>its the only one he uses and it works the best.</li>
            <li>It was ok not what I wanted it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it does a better job, but it makes a difference.</li>
            <li>more so than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand that the shops aren&#x27;t filled with this ointment in the Netherlands!</li>
            <li>Price online is much better than store prices.</li>
            <li>makes it even more affordable.</li>
            <li>This lotion has more moisture to it</li>
            <li>Works better than those with hydrocortisone in my opinion too.</li>
            <li>I love this product and can buy it cheaper hear than anywhere else.</li>
            <li>After 12 hours of using them, my face was much better, and after 3 days I could not even see the eczema on my face.</li>
            <li>I will still get my skin tests for allergy, but I will continue using them until I feel safe to stop.</li>
            <li>A bonus is that my acne even gets better.</li>
            <li>so I thought for sure this would be a product that worked.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The best you can do is to avoid over washing the area, moisturize as much as possible and be patient...</li>
            <li>My favorite.</li>
            <li>I can safely say Aveeno has wonme over.</li>
            <li>IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE OF PARABENS. :)</li>
            <li>(-4F) which made my face more upset with me.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t work for everyone, just like Cerave doesn&#x27;t work for me but works with many others.  </li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>they just prescribed MORE steroid and antibiotic creams and allergy medicine..</li>
            <li>I initially used this lotion based upon a friends suggestion and was really impressed then decided to buy it for myself.</li>
            <li>So now we use the Aveeno Baby Cleansing Wash and follow with this moisturizing cream and Aquaphor (to give a thicker top coat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started using this product and in days her skin was so much better.</li>
            <li>kinda smells like..:)</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love how moisturizing this lotion is</li>
            <li>I used it in conjunction with MG271 and found the Aveeno to smell better and was easier to use, not to mention doesn’t stain clothes.</li>
            <li>5/5 stars, one of the better treatments I’ve used for eczema</li>
            <li>Safe the trip to the dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I just make sure to rinse the skin with water when it gets too itchy and reapply.</li>
            <li>It keeps the skin moisturized better than lotions.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use it after bathing your child and 1 or 2 more times throughout the day for maximum benefit.</li>
            <li>So glad I did.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Love this....</li>
            <li>It also smells better than its competition eczema lotion.</li>
            <li>and I have tried so many things from Aquaphor, Vaseline, aloe vera gel, coconut oil, cetaphil and many more.</li>
            <li>One Cause, Many Ailments: Leaky Gut Syndrome&lt;</li>
            <li>Works very well and even great on face during the winter season.</li>
            <li>This product is SAFE and it is accepted by National Eczema Association.  </li>
            <li>However, his hands were noticeably better by the morning.</li>
            <li>The eczema is gone now, and because my skin looks better than ever, I&#x27;m continuing to use this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>so maybe if you used it as soon as the eczema started appearing maybe it would help more.</li>
            <li>I have been using Aveeno Eczema more than 4 years.</li>
            <li>when I received ,it was open,cannot sure been used by someone</li>
            <li>The eucerin worked ok for a while but was too greasy and made my skin redder.</li>
            <li>It did feel better afterward, though.</li>
            <li>He said it made his skin feel on fire and Vaseline seemed to work better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better results with O&#x27;Keefes.</li>
            <li>Of the dozen creams/ointments I have tried, this cream helps the most with itch relief and healing.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, even if you don&#x27;t have eczema</li>
            <li>I love this product for my eczema.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad this came along</li>
            <li>The redness is all gone, his skin is not flaking and looks to have more moisture too it.</li>
            <li>My sister loves this stuff and so do I for helping him feel better :)</li>
            <li>I love Aveeno products.</li>
            <li>This cream works as a lotion would, nothing more from what I can tell.</li>
            <li>, nice and light and creamy.</li>
            <li>but sure it</li>
            <li>product is a nice, light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Notably, during a flare up, this cream did not provide any relief, the itching was unbearable.</li>
            <li>She said to find out what is causing my skin flare and to stop touching it.  </li>
            <li>Very happy that companies are finally tailoring lotion to be more eczema</li>
            <li>Touching fabric used to be a nightmare, my skin would catch on everything, and I lost my finger prints for a while.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, this is possibly the best lotion I have ever used, even better than some of the prescribed lotions I have used.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it.</li>
            <li>I am sure it works on many babies, but please make sure save your receipt just in case.</li>
            <li>I started using this product every couple of hours and the eczema got much better over the course of about a week.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with thi product and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>Love this for my daughter who had eczema as a newborn</li>
            <li>Have not tried another product, or have nothing to compare it with, or know if another product works better.  </li>
            <li>It even worked better than my prescribed cream.</li>
            <li>He is pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I just love that after I apply this to my hands, they look and feel moisturized.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They still have breakouts that are triggered mostly by heat or stress, but this lotion helps keep the breakouts to a minimum</li>
            <li>I found it ONE TIME in the grocery store and have not been able to find it ANYWHERE since.</li>
            <li>tried this in a lark just hoping for a wee bit of relief and in two treatments my life was so much better.</li>
            <li>I have suffered from eczema for many years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands and types of lotions: Vaseline, Curel, St. Ives, Goldbond, Burt&#x27;s Bees, the list goes on.</li>
            <li>I thought it would work like a charm however it created even more problems</li>
            <li>We use Cerave now and it works better.</li>
            <li>Love the Aveeno line of products</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love how it makes her skin feels and it stops the itching.</li>
            <li>This is a very effective cream that has really helped my hands a lot.</li>
            <li>absorbs quickly, heals skin, pleasant feel and fragrance free.</li>
            <li>My daughter is three years old now, and with this lotion and good habits we&#x27;ve kept her eczema under control ever since!</li>
            <li>Nice one.. works well and pretty effective..</li>
            <li>Recommend buying this, I feel pretty good, although the baby face still have eczema, but much better than before the</li>
            <li>This item is good when you first start using it.</li>
            <li>this product is pretty good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>For the first time to use this product feels good, as for the effect need to continue to observe......</li>
            <li>Pretty good, and no smell.</li>
            <li>I am finding this an effective emollient and one more of Aveeno&#x27;s products that are useful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve come to truly enjoy Aveeno products and was happy to find this and come to the conclusion that it really does what I&#x27;d need it to - moisturize and help with eczema.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist told me it was &amp;#34;dermatitis,&amp;#34; wasn&#x27;t sure of the cause and gave me a strong steroid cream.</li>
            <li>This is the best cream to use for dry shin.</li>
            <li>Best lotion I&#x27;ve found for my dry skin, and my sons.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful protector of dry skin.</li>
            <li>Best thing ever for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I love it most because in comparison to what we were using on our daughter for her itching, this product is cheap and works just as well.  </li>
            <li>far, I am most happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Firstly, packaging was great and shipping was quick.  </li>
            <li>My elbows get very dry and scaly in the winter and this is the perfect remedy.</li>
            <li>This is the best moisturizer for my (very) dry skin.</li>
            <li>I ordered this off of Amazon, and was in love from the very first application!</li>
            <li>I also love that it&#x27;s fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Within 6 hours of using this my hands are completely healed and feel great.  </li>
            <li>Since my skin stays soft the itching has diminished greatly.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this product, as I must have tried almost every lotion commonly available at supermarkets and drugstores (in the US).</li>
            <li>its very soothing and smells good.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a good gentle moisturizer for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend using this on palms or soles, but it&#x27;s been good elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I love that this helps soothe and calm my daughters skin before bed!</li>
            <li>Excellent product, I will recommend to other moms.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other OTC products (including the neosporin eczema moisturizing cream) and this is the best.</li>
            <li>Perfect for Eczema or people with skin allergy or other conditions.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and does not feel sticky.    </li>
            <li>I have never been diagnosed because mine is very mild.</li>
            <li>soothing and healing my skin very quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cream but easy to absorb from skin.</li>
            <li>The absolute best thing Ive found so far.</li>
            <li>I like lotions that smell good, but the lack of smell is great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>It does a nice job of covering and staying on her hot spots without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>I tried this cream first and liked it.</li>
            <li>This lotion is perfect for those who suffer from super dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This, hands down, is the best lotion for eczema!</li>
            <li>It was the first time in many days that I was actually able to forget about the rashes and had no discomfort.</li>
            <li>We tried this product to help my son with his eczema and it helped tremendously!  </li>
            <li>We have tried many products for my son&#x27;s (age 2) full-body mild eczema.</li>
            <li>However, I would gladly recommend this cream for anyone with dry hands, feet and elbows - it would be a great preventative lotion for those areas in the wintertime.</li>
            <li>Nice to find in large size and cheaper than grocery store.</li>
            <li>I had some issues with contact dermatitis, tried so many different ointments, and this by far is the best, great improvement just after a few applications, high recommend, it is a great over all lotion for aged skin, the best.</li>
            <li>I saw a huge difference within minutes of using it.  </li>
            <li>I went to the GP and they prescribed me a huge tub of Hydromol.</li>
            <li>Being 7 pound per tube, I am not looking forward to shelling out huge amounts of money for this cream.</li>
            <li>This product has made a huge impact in my life.</li>
            <li>The lotion is light and does not smell.  </li>
            <li>The itching stopped, and my skin is now smooth just as before.</li>
            <li>As for the price tag, being able to decrease the use of prescription steroid cream is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This cream is steroid free and fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>Also, I like that this cream is steroid free; would purchase again.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s available on the product page) and that this lotion is free of parabens.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and is not greasy or oily.  </li>
            <li>Works as well as the over the counter steroid creams and with this being steroid free cream</li>
            <li>if it is in fact an allergic reaction however I do eat oats in my diet (almost daily)  and his skin has been great until today.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product with the attitude of \\&quot;it can&#x27;t hurt\\&quot;, and honestly, I didn&#x27;t expect much from it.</li>
            <li>not too oily but also leaves my skin rather smooth.</li>
            <li>My arms are smooth again</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cream rubs in smoothly, has no odor, and absorbs in about 3-5 min.</li>
            <li>Retains moisture, keeps skin smooth and no itching.  </li>
            <li>the important thing any one  should realize is that with one application eczema won&#x27;t disappear .</li>
            <li>It is non-greasy and quickly is absorbed, so it does not interfere with my being able to use my hands typing at work.</li>
            <li>and the face still stays smooth.</li>
            <li>We got a free sample of this at dr office.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m looking for a cream that has this as an ingredient (to anyone else who has experienced the same problems as I have).  </li>
            <li>This is a great price at Amazon especially with Subscribe and save and amazon mom..</li>
            <li>He liked this one the best, however, it doesn&#x27;t come in a big enough size, so we get the Curel Itch Defense instead.</li>
            <li>I had to wash my clothes practically every day!), so with that in mind I looked around and found Aveeno&#x27;s paraben free products.</li>
            <li>&quot; smell either, which is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I finally figured out that it was eyelid eczema and after reading the great reviews on this product</li>
            <li>My baby has eczema free skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and absorbs well.</li>
            <li>This is a total win, y&#x27;all.</li>
            <li>Important points:&lt;br /&gt;-good moisture retainment&lt;</li>
            <li>Sometimes when playing he&#x27;ll stop what he&#x27;s doing and start scratching lightly seemingly out of curiosity.</li>
            <li>but since this product it makes her smooth and no itching I am baying the second&lt;br /&gt; one...</li>
            <li>My ears were smooth about 5 minutes after applying it.</li>
            <li>Light and not too greasy...</li>
            <li>and it is really light.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin hydrated and looking smooth.  </li>
            <li>However, this works great as a regular body lotion.</li>
            <li>and it works great though I worry about the daily cortisone exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keeps skin smooth and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I have found nothing else better that works to calm my eczema flare-ups.</li>
            <li>Even though I am cheap, my skin is the largest organ I have</li>
            <li>Fabulous.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t extremely comfortable applying steroid cream to my eyelids and face, so I tried this out, and it has truly helped me out.</li>
            <li>Having it available from Amazon is a plus.</li>
            <li>It had such great reviews online</li>
            <li>In fact, my husband commented on how sleek and smooth my legs felt.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice product, but it is very sticky.</li>
            <li>It really works and is better than most brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>She really likes the Aveeno products and find they help her better than most others.</li>
            <li>Aveeno eczema, its a fantastic product, I love it, and my baby skin is so much better,,  thanks aveeno</li>
            <li>Very useful for skin</li>
            <li>This is not greasy and has only a very mild and pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I try to be light handed because its rich.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve began to have issues with cracking on my hands &amp; this lotions is perfect because it applies greasy which really soothes my dry skin, and it drys within minutes and creates a great barrier for further irritation.</li>
            <li>but I never noticed a significant improvement on his skin.</li>
            <li>Ordered two and will order two more, since I&#x27;m almost finishing the first one.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the $$$!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad the first she used was the Ultra Calming cream because it&#x27;s helping me out a lot.</li>
            <li>He doesnt itch anymore and rarely has outbreaks!</li>
            <li>I applied it many times a day for the first couple of days</li>
            <li>I made sure I put this after I washed my hands and noticed my moisture levels we getting higher.</li>
            <li>I love the quality of the product and it is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I read the customer reviews and they seemed pretty convincing but turns out it didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li>She shared it with a coworker who has eczema on her hands, and said coworker snuck back to keep using it until we got her her own tube!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased both of these products, and they&#x27;re much cheaper than what I had been using!</li>
            <li>After 2 years of trying on my child&#x27;s feet every cream I had been suggested,its the first time within 2 weeks use that we have smooth skin!My daughter is amazed!!!Thanks!</li>
            <li>but so far I am very very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>worth the price!</li>
            <li>works great on eczema and dry skin...</li>
            <li>/&gt;After searching the net, I found Aveeno Eczema therapy moisturizing cream was the most effective.</li>
            <li>This is a great lotion for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Works great for dry hands.</li>
            <li>I do not have eczema, but this product is great for anyone who either washes their hands a lot (i.e.l food industry) or lives in a climate with dry air.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great relief for itchy, dry skin.</li>
            <li>Aveeno Eczema is GREAT for rashes as well as dry skin.  </li>
            <li>We have tried several creams and the is by far the best one.</li>
            <li>The only best moisturizer out in market that controls my 2 year old son&#x27;s eczema since his birth till now.</li>
            <li>I was putting on a ton of other products religiously - Honest Company lotion, Honest Co. organic healing balm, Aquafor.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think this stuff smells like anything special</li>
            <li>I think you could&#x27;ve gotten more of the cream into that large dispenser.</li>
            <li>This is really smart of this manufacturer, why don&#x27;t they add some sugar on top for the fungus to have a feast, too?</li>
            <li>nothing special.</li>
            <li>Great for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have a very dry skin and there is no moisturizer that give me this great result, it makes my skin like the baby skin and keep the skin moisturized 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Mainly used on elbows and feet but guess it&#x27;s good for whole body use.</li>
            <li>The ones carefully formulated without fragrance are especially important to those of us who are allergic to fragrances, estimated to be a quarter of the population.</li>
            <li>I have same experience as others who experienced a burning sensation upon application, but I endured it the first day, thinking my skin had to adjust.</li>
            <li>so i can just hop in after work and cool off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She applies the moisturizing cream about 4 times a day and sleeps with a cool mist humidifier at night to keep the air moist.  </li>
            <li>We gave it some  time to see if it might clear up on its own</li>
            <li>Aveeno never stung and felt light after it was absorbed.</li>
            <li>Hello short sleeves good</li>
            <li>Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream is my absolute favorite product for my hands and feet to treat my Eczema.</li>
            <li>This is a nice lotion for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so when you put it on, it&#x27;s cool and silky, like you&#x27;re just putting water on your face.</li>
            <li>They are good at suppressing local inflammation which is the cause of eczema.</li>
            <li>Many experts claim that topical administration is innocent but I never feel comfortable so those are out of consideration for me.</li>
            <li>Since I have been using it on a regular basis, I do not have to use my prescription cream at all....which is good.</li>
            <li>nice on sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>After using this product continuously for two weeks (morning and night) - make sure you wash your face with Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser - before you apply the Aveeno .  </li>
            <li>Works good when I don&#x27;t want the smell or the grease from my regular psoriasis salve.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed even though there were a number of negative reviews, as well.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I did since it really is clearing up</li>
            <li>my skin felt nice and soft upon application.</li>
            <li>What do you really have to lose at this point, since we wouldn&#x27;t be on here if nothing else has worked :-)</li>
            <li>Use it on damp, cool skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a good number at all different prices, staying with this one going forward.</li>
            <li>Also its not bad for you as cortisone products ...</li>
            <li>and my doctor wasn&#x27;t available to see me right away.</li>
            <li>The lotion is a bit too sticky for people with normal skin, but may be good for once-in-a-while application, particularly in winter.</li>
            <li>Amazingly it will calm the symptoms in couple of days and make your skin soft.</li>
            <li>I seriously consider this one of the best buys I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li>It goes thru quickly though.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend this for atopic eczema sufferers, but if you have mild eczema it may work.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a scent, and it&#x27;s mildly oily.  </li>
            <li>I have to apply it twice a day, though, so it is quickly disappearing.  </li>
            <li>The itching abated quickly and now the redness is rapidly lightening.</li>
            <li>I was surprised so many tubes were available on the shelf..</li>
            <li>and it has made a tremendous difference.</li>
            <li>It felt soothed and refreshed, quickly fading away after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>Sure  enough, within about 3 days the spots were noticeably better.</li>
            <li>My son has mild eczema on his cheeks, chin, arms and legs.</li>
            <li>When I say mild</li>
            <li>Of course it doesn&#x27;t clear it up completely like a medicated ointment would, it does a great job.</li>
            <li>Quick background of my eczema and what I&#x27;ve tried to do in order to help with relief.</li>
            <li>This works super</li>
            <li>This cream cleared up my Grandson&#x27;s eczema quickly.</li>
            <li>Caused a mild rash, stopped using</li>
            <li>It is mild lotion, and I found that I needed hydrocortisone cream as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My daughter age 2 has mild form of eczema since birth.</li>
            <li>Both of my children have had mild eczema.  </li>
            <li>My baby girl has mild seborrheic dermatitis around her neck.  </li>
            <li>My son has always had mild eczema, since birth.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy and absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>So I went to the dermatologist and found out that I had a mild case of eczema.  </li>
            <li>Super sticky.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist thought it might be mild eczema, and gave me a steroid cream.</li>
            <li>After taking my son to the doctor, she diagnosed a mild case of baby eczema.</li>
            <li>goes in to skin quickly.</li>
            <li>She gave me a mild ointment to use to ease the itch.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for almost 4 years on him now and it clears up his eczema so quick.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s super soothing.</li>
            <li>I get a mild case of eczema flare-up every now and</li>
            <li>I used this as well as Avenno %1 hydrocortisone anti itch cream on his face that was super chapped and irritated.</li>
            <li>(she had mild eczema as a toddler) and decided it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try it.</li>
            <li>I normally have pretty nice skin.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply, the texture is nice and a little sweet</li>
            <li>I love Aveeno products, and based on the reviews here, had high hopes for the Eczema Therapy</li>
            <li>and I love and highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Pretty pleasant overall.</li>
            <li>From the first time I used it I saw a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>This is probably better than normal lotions (does make the skin on my hand ofter), but doesn&#x27;t relieve the itching.</li>
            <li>I guess you could switch back to your regular lotion (I like Lubriderm and St Ives which are much more affordable and work great).</li>
            <li>I have EXTREME eczema problems and this was the BEST BY FAR cream I ever used.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nice that some people apparently have their eczema cured by this stuff.</li>
            <li>This product is a first product where I can say that I will be comfortable leaving my house without prescription cream.</li>
            <li>I have got some success with those despite not having achieved a full recovery yet...</li>
            <li>I have got some success with those despite not having achieved a full recovery yet...</li>
            <li>He uses this regularly and the eczema has not returned, very satisfied, HIGHLY recommended!!!</li>
            <li>Most lists I came across mentioned the Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturising Cream as the best out there, especially with its natural ingredients such as oatmeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
            <li>new spots and his skin in actually smooth!</li>
            <li>I started getting signs of Eczema in new areas and it worried me, so along with recommendations from my dermatologist, I researched and found this as a solution that worked for many online.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good, but definitely not a substitute for prescriptions for eczema.</li>
            <li>the price, this stuff was totally worth it, and is a tremendous help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>good for moisturizing eczema dry skin, but did not eleviate symptoms.</li>
            <li>Good for moisturizing eczema dry skin, but did not elevate symptoms.</li>
            <li>This is gentle, easy to apply, and doesn&#x27;t have an overbearing scent.</li>
            <li>She also told me to use a good lotion of my hands since she noticed that they were a bit dry.  </li>
            <li>Really good for dry skin and eczema.  </li>
            <li>The cream absorbs really well and smells a bit like oatmeal but the smell disappears very quickly.</li>
            <li>If you are considering purchasing this lotion from Amazon, be aware that the product may have been tampered with!</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended!!!</li>
            <li>According to their evaluation this item gets 2/10 ( lower the better) and is considered to be pretty safe for human use.</li>
            <li>I intend to switch at some point to a much more natural alternative, but for now it is doing the jobbeautifully!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always heard Aveeno did great things for people with dry skin, but this really does seem like a miracle cream.  </li>
            <li>Great product and really helps with dry skin.</li>
            <li>It has a very creamy,  smooth, non greasy texture that absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>We love this lotion to help control my 3.5 year old&#x27;s mild eczema.</li>
            <li>My skin would get so dry in the winter time they were constantly cracking and bleeding but this worked perfect and my problem is gone.</li>
            <li>I love this product for my daughter who has sensitive skin and mild eczema.</li>
            <li>Wonderful for dry winter skin, especially hands.  </li>
            <li>The cream worked fine for a while, but I didn&#x27;t like to use it too much because of the side effects it could have.</li>
            <li>Good stuff for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;HOWEVER, what I was -really- looking for was a Paraben free cream (not an greasy ointment like Vaseline OR Hydromol.</li>
            <li>This cream is amazing and a total life saver for me!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Cera-ve with some success.</li>
            <li>So I checked the ingredients on the back of the label, and nothing spectacular.  </li>
            <li>It is far cheaper for me to buy one bottle of the Aveeno than the four or five bottles of another kind that really wasn&#x27;t working well.</li>
            <li>I have some kind of eczema reaction from using dish soaps on the back of my hands.</li>
            <li>I bought this lotion after reading reviews of several eczema lotions - this one seemed effective and affordable.</li>
            <li>This cream is quite similar to Neutrogena Norwegian Formula, Intense Moisture Wrap, which is also excellent.  </li>
            <li>Baking soda will leave your kids skin hydrated and fresh.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s eczema started when she was 3 months old, and covered most of her body.  </li>
            <li>We use the baby formula on our 4-year old for 3 years and it works great, now we are using the regular Aveeno eczema cream</li>
            <li>Apply that once a day, wait until it&#x27;s absorbed into the skin and then put clothes on.</li>
            <li>Considering how pricey it is, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>and I guess offers a bit more protection.</li>
            <li>was recently thrilled however, to find a different use-</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price, plus having it on subscription with Amazon</li>
            <li>We started doing luke warm baths daily and applying this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny I paid; I just wish this cream was around 3 years ago.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a particularly big earner and at this rate I would have to spend 70 quid a month to keep my skin smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>, I decided it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li>Worth the money, and Amazon has one of the cheapest prices I can find online.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the $11</li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying if nothing else is working for you.</li>
            <li>I have to say totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff for my 2 year old.</li>
            <li>dermatologist mentioned ceramides as a useful ingredient but for another product that didn&#x27;t work that well for him.</li>
            <li>Love this cream, it leaves skin so soft and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>it is worth the money</li>
            <li>I think there are better options for an adult.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will give you a fresh start at life, its all about what you eat that brings forth</li>
            <li>the product was useful and did serve our expectations.</li>
            <li>Bought some cheap Suave lotion in the grocery store last night and already my skin feels a lot better, my cloths aren&#x27;t sticking to my body, and I don&#x27;t feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth a try</li>
            <li>I woke up one morning and there was a distinct, different kind of rash I had on my pinky finger.  </li>
            <li>I wish I remembered when I started using this to track my progress, but it was definitely not overnight for me, which shows you what kind of dermatitis</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth every cent.</li>
            <li>My wife and I use subscriptions for toilet paper, paper towels and diapers and save more than even Sam&#x27;s Club bulk prices on many things (diapers are much cheaper, but Zip Locs are cheaper at Sam&#x27;s...</li>
            <li>This stuff works way better than most other hand creams.</li>
            <li>Absorbs pretty quickly and doesn&#x27;t make you feel greasy for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li>Well surprise, surprise - 72 hours after using it for the first time, my skin felt great, the scales were gone and the marks on the back of my hands started to clear up.  </li>
            <li>This lotion doesn&#x27;t help major flare-ups, only prescription or  anti-itch cream work for us, but it does do a great job of preventing flare-ups.</li>
            <li>I have used this reliably and find it a good alternative to other vendors/ solutions.  </li>
            <li>I have had it over a month now and bought it mostly due to the good reviews in amazon.</li>
            <li>When you have eczema, you search high and low for a good lotion to provide relief for your skin.</li>
            <li>It is a tad bit oily, but I put on leggings right after applying</li>
            <li>And it clears it right up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unscented and is just the right level of moisturizing . . .</li>
            <li>This year, the rash reappeared and spread across my right hand.</li>
            <li>or so I had noticed the skin on the inside of two fingers on my right hand</li>
            <li>I use it right after giving him a bath with the Aveeno eczema soothing bath treatment.  </li>
            <li>It clears it right up and keeps it away.</li>
            <li>This cream is just right</li>
            <li>This morning the product arrived, right away I applied the cream to his face after cleansing.</li>
            <li>Whenever he starts itching he goes right to the Aveeno and ask me to put it on.</li>
            <li>This product is good, but I am going to try Cetaphil upon my doctors recommendation, because one bottle has more than twice as much lotion, and I can get a two-pack at Costco for only a few more dollars than one tube of this.  </li>
            <li>Even my husband has been impressed with the dramatic improvements since he has been so used to seeing me look like I partake in rubbing sandpaper on my chin.  </li>
            <li>Non-greasy, no perfume or dye, very mild oatmeal scent, leaves the skin very soft and calms irritations.</li>
            <li>Try it, it is at least good in the short term, hoping things get better and better.</li>
            <li>, it has another primary product in it and is much less effective.</li>
            <li>I have been plagued by two extremely dry, incredibly itchy, red and peeling patches of skin for over two years.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer is great for people with dry and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I tried coconut oil which I applied many times a day, a homemade shea butter recipe, a homemade aloe vera/shea butter lotion (which cause her skin to become super red where I applied it), lanolin and tried blending up some oatmeal for her bath.</li>
            <li>I am not sure how well it would work for severe eczema, but it&#x27;s been great for me</li>
            <li>I wash my foot in cool water with a gentle cleanser like CeraVe, then slather Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream all over, and then seal with a cotton sock.</li>
            <li>its gentle on the skin and true to what it says it reduces itching.</li>
            <li>Amazon has many times better offers for this product than local stores in my area.</li>
            <li>have what I would called mild eczema, with certain areas affect.</li>
            <li>The person who used it claims good results in easing down the eczema effects</li>
            <li>It also worked incredibly well on my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s hands that were a little chapped.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first year was full of trials and errors, but we have finally found a combination of skin care products that work best for my son&#x27;s delicate skin that we now cannot live without:  California Baby Shampoo &amp; Body Wash for super sensitive skin, the Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream and good old Vasaline.</li>
            <li>A few patches on his face were the most notable.  </li>
            <li>It does an excellent job of keeping my skin moisturized, and even after only a few days of use, the peeling has stopped.  </li>
            <li>Love it, really helps my 11m old&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li>It was incredibly itchy, painful in warm water</li>
            <li>so we have since switched to a more natural lotion that is very moisturizing as well.</li>
            <li>It really worked for me and is totally natural and safe.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just hoping this effect will last, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>It is also nice in the winter for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Nice for dry skin too.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write many reviews (and this product is very well reviewed), but this lotion is worth another nod as it has found a solution for a major problem.  </li>
            <li>The ONLY medicine that would help my infant with dry eczema and the price is better than most stores!</li>
            <li>the redness has reduced very much and it seems like I am healing.</li>
            <li>Its also very gentle as I use it on my face too</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin moisturized throughout the day and is free of the medicinal smell most other creams have.</li>
            <li>This is OK but seems less effective than Wild Naturals Eczema and Psoriasis Cream with Manuka, etc.</li>
            <li>Now my younger has a big deal of eczema especially prominent in her right hand fourth finger area.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my son who has suffered with very mild patches of eczema on his torso, I just put it on after his bath and it keeps it smooth and gets rid of the dry patches.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re suffering from itchy dry skin, give this a try - $10 isn&#x27;t that much when it comes to feeling (and looking) better!</li>
            <li>since I forgot her steroid cream at home) and after only one use I saw a huge difference!</li>
            <li>Pretty picey product but works.</li>
            <li>What I love about this product is not only</li>
            <li>I treated my skin problem with hot water compress three times a day for 30 mins.</li>
            <li>(mine effects only the top of my hands wrists to finger tips, not the bottom).  </li>
            <li>She had that issue since born, but was ok the winter before last spring.</li>
            <li>It was alright for by hands but very unsuitable for my face!</li>
            <li>The bottle says it&#x27;s safe enough for a baby, and I believe it.  </li>
            <li>Love it and definitely recommend a try!!!</li>
            <li>He gave a steroid cream which I did not want to try as the first remedy.</li>
            <li>I could tell how much better he felt as soon as I rubbed it on to his back and hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then it&#x27;s all better by the next day.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>We tested about 5 different creams, and this has helped most (we apply twice a day) -</li>
            <li>we tried many different creams and lotions</li>
            <li>My eczema has not only disappeared, my skin feels healthy for the first time in years.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even use it after washing my hands (which I do constantly) but it would be even better to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not big on the oatmeal kinda smell, but it&#x27;s almost scentless and after a couple uses I was ok with it.</li>
            <li>I have used Amazon several times and am usually pleased with the products and service.  </li>
            <li>but I was willing to try anything...</li>
            <li>I bought this product when I saw it on my most recent shopping trip and immediately bought it.  </li>
            <li>I tried so many different lotions and creams, nothing worked.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I finally gave this product a try!</li>
            <li>I would use aquaphor to help heal and soothe his wounds but never thought there was anything I could do to prevent him from itching in the first place.</li>
            <li>It was soft, silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>haha!  </li>
            <li>By the next day (using twice more), the flaky skin and itching was also gone.</li>
            <li>My son suffered from eczema when he was first born.  </li>
            <li>He saw relief from the first time he used it.  </li>
            <li>Those two products work pretty well for my resistant eczema.</li>
            <li>Ive had to deal with eczema since my first flare up when i was 10.</li>
            <li>This really helps calm my skin and keep it moisturized.</li>
            <li>It had to be applied every hour for the first couple of days or the skin started flaking off.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well!&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>, I just hope it&#x27;s not a fake or</li>
            <li>Exactly as ordered.</li>
            <li>I use this daily more as a preventative than a cure.  </li>
            <li>They also scheduled an appointment for me to get skin tests to find out exactly what i am allergic too.</li>
            <li>Within days it was better and within three weeks entirely disappeared.</li>
            <li>I at first used the product three times a day, once in the morning, once after work, and</li>
            <li>I have been to countless dermatologists  over the years and have had more prescriptions than you can fathom.</li>
            <li>it is very soothing and helped improve her condition!</li>
            <li>I first bought it at target for 12.99 to try it out and really glad I checked on Amazon before I bought the second bottle.  </li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!!</li>
            <li>I went to the clinic and the doctor put me on an extensive course of steroids and it got better.</li>
            <li>;-)  </li>
            <li>This is what pediatricians agree too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second best treatment is unfortunately steroids.</li>
            <li>Therefore, despite not believing the magical therapeutic potential, I still decided to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would try to avoid scratching by running the areas under hot water, but sometimes the itching was unbearable.  </li>
            <li>It really keeps my skin moisturized and soothes itching!</li>
            <li>I am ready to rave about this product!</li>
            <li>When I first used it, I was putting it on 4-5 times a day.</li>
            <li>I went out and bought Cerave moisturiser and at first it was...</li>
            <li>I have been using various creams for many years for bothersome itch,cracking caused by eczema.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First found this on a trip to Phoenix, AZ, the driest climate I have been in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight but it does the job!</li>
            <li>Not too greasy but really hydrate my skin!</li>
            <li>Must use it consistently for desired results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s on my neck, and I&#x27;ve used many things to help heal it while going to multiple doctors&#x27; offices.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s getting better, but it&#x27;s a constant struggle.  </li>
            <li>better than our local WalMart.</li>
            <li>This summer she could wear shorts and dresses for the first time in 3 years.</li>
            <li>My son already looked slightly better the next day.</li>
            <li>Firstly; there was no sting whatsoever when applying the cream.</li>
            <li>Thanks Aveeno!</li>
            <li>Aveeno has many different products but none of the others works well for me.</li>
            <li>Ok so my ezcema problem just appeared back in Feb. 2013.</li>
            <li>Very moisture intensive!</li>
            <li>First time using.</li>
            <li>Aveeno for many things is terrific.  </li>
            <li>First of all, it absolutley breaks my heart to read the reviews where this product did not help.  </li>
            <li>Now that summer has arrived in Toronto, I had my first breakout of 2014.  </li>
            <li>those who care about chemicals/toxins know that this reads on the back \\&quot;safe for baby\\&quot;</li>
            <li>People constantly compliment me on my smooth skin!</li>
            <li>starts suthung, it works from the instant I put it on, truly a life saver for me,,, love this product .</li>
            <li>During the summer after my first year of college, I noticed that I had a habit of washing my hands too often during the day.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it was just a rash</li>
            <li>Its main ingredient is water so it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Not only is my eczema better, my skin color is evening out.</li>
            <li>but my skin clearly tells me that it is a NO GO and to stop being cheap.</li>
            <li>I am glad we finally did.</li>
            <li>But when I run out, I will most likely purchase from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto</li>
            <li>I carefully removed the skin with a warm wash cloth and....</li>
            <li>It mostly flares up in the winter and we&#x27;ve tried many different things: cortisone cream, steroid cream, neospotine for eczema, cetaphil lotions/soap, acquaphor, Vaseline and the only thing that helps is the steroid cream, which you can&#x27;t use all the time.</li>
            <li>This is the first day I&#x27;ve used it on him</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s so much happier too!</li>
            <li>Once I put it on, my hands felt so much better almost instantly.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different and more expensive creams, and this has been the best in not only relieving but treating the breakouts.</li>
            <li>Once you put the cream on, your skin will feel sort of rubbery and feels funny for awhile.</li>
            <li>I see more improvement with this product in 12 hours than others in 12 days... will buy again if necessary.</li>
            <li>skin friendly product.i strongly recommend this product for dry skin treatment.no side effect.no burning after application.light smell with moisture.like it</li>
            <li>this cream is great, stops itching dry skin and gets rid of red spots.</li>
            <li>This cream is great for my daugher&#x27;s eczema, especially during the dry winter months.</li>
            <li>This is surprisingly effective, better than any other such product I&#x27;ve tried (non-prescription).  </li>
            <li>I read of the effects on prolong use of steroid creams so decided to look up a more natural route; we’ve tried coconut oil, olive oil, Aquaphor, Eucerin, Cetaphil, Vanicream, other Aveeno products and more.</li>
            <li>My eczema is always present but at certain times it just seems to aggrevate me more than others (hot and itchiness).  </li>
            <li>It is a very nice thick lotion, but I didn&#x27;t realize it was an oral medication my doctor had me on that took care of the eczema and not this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I will use it, but will have to look elsewhere for the amazing results that other reviewers describe.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a huge fan of Aveeno, ever since my first was born because their products are so gentle and natural...</li>
            <li>I paid nearly $10 for it there, but it was worth it!</li>
            <li>In short, this stuff is amazing on mild to moderate eczema.  </li>
            <li>used with decent success for SEVERE eczema on my hands.</li>
            <li>Stopped itching immediately, flaking is getting better, worse section of psoriasis is getting better quickly also.</li>
            <li>I tried many different creams and this one really does soothe all day.</li>
            <li>I love this cream so much and will definitely keep using aveeno products.</li>
            <li>Well, very much to the contrary this cream really aggravated the hell out of my skin</li>
            <li>and it really doesn&#x27;t help very much.</li>
            <li>The itching stops nearly right away and the redness and rough skin are smoother and look better after just one application.</li>
            <li>and then I ordered this  based on the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I saw noticeable positive results within 3 days</li>
            <li>Saw positive results within 12hrs.</li>
            <li>Aveeno make great non-perfumed products and I found that this cream helps relieve the itch and prevent the cracking of the skin, where other non-perfumed hand creams did not provide the same relief.</li>
            <li>I have also tried other remedies on my own, which include Derm Essentials, Cetophil cream, Organic Virgin Coconut Oil (which really inflamed my skin), Dandruff shampoo, and Aquaphor.  </li>
            <li>First day of use, I noticed that it moisturized very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much Aveeno!</li>
            <li>this season is pretty much freezing.</li>
            <li>After trying other products, including regular Aveeno skin creams, I am really happy to find the Eczema Therapy cream.</li>
            <li>This product (in addition to Cetaphil &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34;) really helps to mitigate those affected areas.</li>
            <li>I ordered this and it doesn&#x27;t work as good as the aveeno baby eczema , im not sure</li>
            <li>but I have to say that I have been suffering for a good couple of months with eye eczema due to the humidity and my low immune system and this really was like a miracle!!</li>
            <li>No icky greasy film left on your skin, absorbs fast and the smell is very light.</li>
            <li>I love this cream, my skin gets back to normal again without steroids.</li>
            <li>Granted, I now have to have the cream with me at all times, but it&#x27;s certainly better than having dry, hands, cracked skin and cuts all over my hands at all times.  </li>
            <li>The Aveeno cream dispenses easily from the tube and it&#x27;s simple to control the amount you want.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very simply and easy to make</li>
            <li>Works well on our son&#x27;s super sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The tightness has totally gone now and there&#x27;s very mild</li>
            <li>My son , 1 year old, gets mild eczema flare ups every now and then, and using this lotion twice a day gets rid of it within a couple days.</li>
            <li>I am on some medication that gives me some incredibly dry skin and on top of that I have eczema in places.</li>
            <li>I tried many creams for dry skin and eczema on my arms.</li>
            <li>It used to pop up in small patches on my arms but in recent years it has progressed to large, ashy, cracking, incredibly itchy patches on my elbows and between my fingers.</li>
            <li>This Aveeno product works very well to stop the scratching and makes his skin feel moisturized, soft and smooth, and much more so than any other lotion we tried.</li>
            <li>and it certainly did not help prevent flare ups for my eczema.</li>
            <li>I do wish it came in a large pump bottle.</li>
            <li>This product certainly does leave a moist feeling; however, it leaves my skin a bit sticky.  </li>
            <li>Rarely itched but is almost completely gone after 3 days of keeping it moisturized with this stuff!</li>
            <li>Thought we would have to live with eczema and was very excited that after a few uses I saw tremendous improvement!</li>
            <li>It is fine as a regular moisturizer, but it didn&#x27;t do anything to help his neck - in fact</li>
            <li>I usually only need to use it once or twice every day or two, and my skin is fine.</li>
            <li>Body Wash. Feels great, very soothing feel and a mild scent that is actually reminiscent of oatmeal (least to me</li>
            <li>Very thick and creamy, great for coating your skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks God this product is available for international shipping.</li>
            <li>My dad recommended this cream (now I sound like a commercial) and there is no visible eczema at all on my legs!</li>
            <li>lotion is very moisturizing and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>B002CML1XE La Roche-Posay Anthelios 60 Ultra Light Sunscreen Fluid for Face, 1.7-Ounce Bottle]]</li>
            <li>does it stop the itch fast</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to give her much medicine, and started to try this cream.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t helped me much.</li>
            <li>I thought there&#x27;s no way this stuff could really be doing anything.  </li>
            <li>This is the real deal</li>
            <li>and I think it is quite reasonably priced</li>
            <li>Also realised that my son was not itching as much as he was scratching his face so much before I used this product.    </li>
            <li>Available in 5oz and 7.3oz tubes only.  </li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t very creamy or oily -</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s very emollient.</li>
            <li>Thanks for nothing aveeno and lower</li>
            <li>So to really cure my hands</li>
            <li>Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Excellent company</li>
            <li>I have had eczema my whole life and no prescribed lotions have ever worked on me.  </li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for only a week now and have been eczema free for 5 days.</li>
            <li>You really should try it to see for yourself.</li>
            <li>I suffered with eczema whole my life</li>
            <li>This really helped my daughter&#x27;s eczema.  </li>
            <li>It works fast too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very suit my baby~</li>
            <li>We went to a doctor and to a dermatologist, and they both just readily prescribed steroid-based creams.  </li>
            <li>I found that it works very well for eczema.</li>
            <li>During the winter time, my skin gets very dy</li>
            <li>This has really helped our baby&#x27;s eczema.  </li>
            <li>This lotion absolutely SAVED my skin.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this lotion, I still use it every day and have been eczema free for three years now.</li>
            <li>When Eczema shows up on my skin I find this lotion to be very soothing and it stops any itching too.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for three or four days now, and I think it is really helping.  </li>
            <li>This seems to work really well on my elbows.  </li>
            <li>This one does not irritate him much and also heals his skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>My hands are smooth, don&#x27;t hurt or itch and the discoloration is finally starting to disappear.</li>
            <li>I use this in combination with Neutrogena&#x27;s Swedish hand cream on really stubborn eczema spots and the two together work like a miracle cure.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, works well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not seeing much healing but Aveeno seems to stay on the skin longer</li>
            <li>couldnt believe it wotked so fast also</li>
            <li>The reviews are real, it truly works.</li>
            <li>The smell is very &amp;#34;oatmeal like&amp;#34; so just be warned.</li>
            <li>I really wished this product worked for me, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It worked very well for him.</li>
            <li>He also gets skin infections from scratching the surface of his skin off (yikes, I know) and this cream really helped minimize those as well.</li>
            <li>i wanted to avoid steroids as much as i could.</li>
            <li>This cream has really helped...</li>
            <li>Very uncool.</li>
            <li>and it has really helped his outbreaks with eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I guess I will ask him if I really do have eczema.</li>
            <li>A gentle lotion for baby who&#x27;s suffering for eczema.</li>
            <li>Nothing we have tried before has really helped with the break outs</li>
            <li>I have had eczema my whole life and some products work, and some do not.</li>
            <li>She loves this lotion, and it really helps with redness/roughness/itching.</li>
            <li>Off all the things I&#x27;ve tried, this cream was the first one to bring relief and help my skin return to normal.</li>
            <li>Within 3 days, there was a very noticeable improvement and he stopped scratching his legs and arms on about day 2.</li>
            <li>This cream works really well.</li>
            <li>I was very upset that they decided to discontinue making this</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even know my facial skin had the ability to be so smooth.</li>
            <li>This cleared it up very quicky.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>SO I tried this Aveeno product, figuring I didn&#x27;t have much to lose.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this sounded like a very soothing type of product.</li>
            <li>It does not have much of a scent which means you add whatever you want.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>After a weeks or two, my skin problem really got improved.</li>
            <li>but it wasnt much of a problem</li>
            <li>However, if chemicals are not of concern to you, then I highly recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Is a very usful cream for baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>This cream has really helped our family through the winter.  </li>
            <li>Much to my surprise, it worked well, and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about frequency as I use it as needed and as often as I want.</li>
            <li>Really helps keep skin moisturized all day.</li>
            <li>I have this on auto-ship as my whole family loves this moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li>This cream is very soothing and healing.  </li>
            <li>It really does wonders for his skin.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t help my baby&#x27;s eczema much.</li>
            <li>It has really improved the looks and feel of my skin all over.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend to those with eczema!</li>
            <li>She loves it and it has really helped her discomfort.  </li>
            <li>the item shipped fast and works well for my skin.</li>
            <li>I apply it on her whole body twice every day</li>
            <li>and I coudl really feel the difference.</li>
            <li>Fast forward to Sept. 2013</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve really tried just about every lotion and cream out there.</li>
            <li>has a very silky feel.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely notice a difference in the softness of her skin.</li>
            <li>If you have a rash problem, I really recommend this product to try.  </li>
            <li>much relief</li>
            <li>The colloidal oatmeal is very soothing and it is not at all greasy...........just don&#x27;t over-do.</li>
            <li>This really seemed to help.</li>
            <li>Works very well keeps the redness off his face.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to apply their prescription medicated ointment very often.</li>
            <li>semi-cheap and non-prescription that finally really worked.</li>
            <li>If you are upset, going crazy, and feel you are never going to get through this eczema nightmare, BUY THIS RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>and she doesn&#x27;t scratch as much.  </li>
            <li>give it a shot because if it works for you, you will be so much happier.</li>
            <li>me tell you, this lotion really is like a miracle.</li>
            <li>None of this even touched it really.</li>
            <li>The auto-ship feature makes it very convenient.</li>
            <li>I kinda gave up and just accepted eczema as a part of my life and was looking for some lotion to relieve the intense dryness and pain</li>
            <li>We use this on our infant and toddler and it really helps prevents their eczema outbreaks.</li>
            <li>I like this product so much, I subscribed to it.</li>
            <li>I also bought the body wash and that really helps in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Feels very soothing.</li>
            <li>but I really didn&#x27;t know what to do anymore</li>
            <li>My only wish is that it was more naturally based but</li>
            <li>My son actually asks for it, now, and his daycare provider is thrilled since she no longer has to monitor him for constant scratching.</li>
            <li>After having had continuous eczema that wouldn&#x27;t clear up for 6 months, I started to look at my collection of moisturisers more critically.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was surprised to find this lotion smells decent, works rather quickly (two days), and isn&#x27;t quite as greasy as Cortizone 10.  </li>
            <li>I finally wound up making my own and that finally did the trick.</li>
            <li>I tried every single hand cream available, from cheap to fancy, and this aveeno product is the only one that really helped!</li>
            <li>I am glad (based on other reviews here)</li>
            <li>that so many other users have found relief using this product; perhaps my spot needs something stronger than OTC lotion.</li>
            <li>(ok maybe don&#x27;t go to that extreme</li>
            <li>I ended up trying many other baby products.</li>
            <li>It did not irritate the skin, and it was somewhat better at moisturizing than other creams.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work better than any other eczema creams we have triws.</li>
            <li>May be better for other parts of the body.</li>
            <li>My other lotions don&#x27;t work for my neck, but this lotion does &amp; I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>this works better than any other over the counter eczema lotion I have found</li>
            <li>It soothes itchy dry skin right away and even heals cracks in the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>Only need a small amount &amp; works great.</li>
            <li>you want a better shoot for your money, I suggest trying any of the diaper rash creams that has zinc oxide in it as the active ingredient.</li>
            <li>you want a better shoot for your money, I suggest trying any of the diaper rash creams that has zinc oxide in it as the active ingredient.</li>
            <li>It will leave your little ones skin super hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li>Now the issues haven&#x27;t disappeared, and since I am African American discoloration will apparently stay with me for years to come, but the roughness and apparent obviousness of the issues I had on my forehead, cheek and eyelids have diminished at a great capacity.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had eczema on my hands since high school (6 years ago) and nothing really worked, not even the corticosteroid creams from the dermatologists.</li>
            <li>I have to be consistent about putting the lotion on or it comes right back.  </li>
            <li>If there was a way to get a bigger bottle of it, the current size is nice but it just doesn&#x27;t last long enough, otherwise good semi greasy lotion for eczema.</li>
            <li>It has worked for our son since he was 3 months old and we are still going strong 3 years later!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and it makes my hands soft and heals dry skin after one use.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy, it keeps skin soft, and it keeps itchy red eczema patches at bay.</li>
            <li>This is the only moisturizing that effectively solves the problem of my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li>My three month old son had developed mild Eczema.</li>
            <li>I bought this items at a local drug store for $13 and it was worth every penny (luckily my daughter only has one spot that keeps &amp;#34;breaking out&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>I just bought this product a few days ago and WOW, am I glad!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only cream that has ever really soothed my skin and made it feel soft and comfortable</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin and there were no problems.  </li>
            <li>His pediatrician also recommends applying vasaline over the cream in areas more prone to flare ups such as back of the knees &amp; elbows; this really helps.  </li>
            <li>I felt a cool sensation after applying it, the itch began to go away, and the next morning the amount of rashes was reduced and the itch was gone.  </li>
            <li>First I tried natural remedies.</li>
            <li>Also works as normal moisturizing cream for more sensitive dry</li>
            <li>when I&#x27;m told to be super careful not to let the steroid cream touch my face or armpits, I couldn&#x27;t imagine it was that safe for long term use).</li>
            <li>I tried several different brands and this one feels most smooth, and doesn´t get cakey after long massaging.</li>
            <li>Then I rewashed all my clothes and sheets in a new gentle detergent.</li>
            <li>Unless you&#x27;ve got more than one eczema sufferer, I can&#x27;t imagine going through one bottle in less than three months, and at $9, the cost of this lotion is negligible.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also 15% less &amp; the shipping is free!</li>
            <li>and it moisturizes my skin better than previous cream.</li>
            <li>just 24 hours----i tried all kinds of lotions that were for dry skin including petroleum jelly but nothing worked----my wrists were dry and red from what i dont know----but all i know is this stuff works and it works fast----buy it and you will be happy too</li>
            <li>For people with mild to moderate eczema - 1x after you shower, 1x before bed - should be sufficient.</li>
            <li>I have had mild eczema for about 15 years on my upper arm/shoulders.  </li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s a cream and not a lotion, it doesn&#x27;t evaporate from the skin as quickly and actually has a chance to do its job.</li>
            <li>I mildly exfoliated my skin, put this lotion on, and I kid you not after the FIRST application my dry patches were gone!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s done wonders for my skin, not only in the itchiness department, but also keeping my skin extremely soft and smooth</li>
            <li>For about a month now, I have been using this cream - about a one inch strip in my hands - and then applied to my sides (my main prone area) after showering each day.  </li>
            <li>we come to this particular item...</li>
            <li>Because this particular product (Eczema Therapy) is not available in the UK, I bought their regular moisturiser which also claimed to be good for eczema.</li>
            <li>I researched my condition properly and realised I most likely had something called perioral eczema.</li>
            <li>(she&#x27;s 2) because she has a mild case of eczema on her back, tummy, legs and arms.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different types of lotions, anti-itch creams, etc to give relief to my hand eczema, but this is the only lotion that helps.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is great for keeping eczema very manageable and I no longer have to explain to people what was wrong with my skin.  </li>
            <li>Again, the first time I used it there was a noticeable difference in the amount of dryness even though the area was still pretty red.  </li>
            <li>It has only been a couple of weeks and the dryness is considerably better and the skin softer and definitely smoother.  </li>
            <li>She got it mostly on her chin, neck, upper back and her armpits.</li>
            <li>stuff is decent as a stop-gap.</li>
            <li>This works better than more expensive creams or lotions...</li>
            <li>We also keep baths super short and wash with aquaphor baby.</li>
            <li>I found this cream while cleaning my older daughter&#x27;s room</li>
            <li>After the very first application of the Aveeno cream, I woke up the next morning with peaches and cream skin.</li>
            <li>While Gold Bond is usually my favorite brand over perfumed products due to having sensitive skin, I thought this particular cream felt &amp;#34;thinner&amp;#34; than the Aveeno.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to ANYONE out there.</li>

            <li>I am a sceptical person and don&#x27;t easily believe the whole &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; fad (even though I am inclined to believe Oatmeal DOES help), I was simply trying to get away from any -possible- irritants my skin could overreact to.</li>
            <li>Since using this (at night before bed and in the morning before I put on makeup), it has completely gone away!!</li>
            <li>It would get a little better</li>
            <li>It may be a good general moisturizer and may prevent eczema or other skin conditions if applied routinely but over an existing eczema it has no healing potential.</li>
            <li>It may be a good general moisturizer and may prevent eczema or other skin conditions if applied routinely but over an existing eczema it has no healing potential.</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>Ive used it too and it helps clear up dry skin and chapped skin and some very mild rash like skin.  </li>
            <li>It helped reduce the redness a lot but the light pink patch always existed and it would cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>This rehydrates her skin so well and is gentle on her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It really works and keep skin soft for hours.</li>
            <li>Moisturizing helps, but only the Aveeno Eczema seems to actually calm the skin.  </li>
            <li>Tried a lot of anti-eczema moisturizing creams before this one, but this one has really done a lot to help clear it up.</li>
            <li>This really worked for my daughter(8month old) eczema.  </li>
            <li>However they have huge adverse effects ranging from the decline in general immunity to total growth suppression and psychiatric problems.</li>
            <li>I found it to be very slimy and as far as I could tell it</li>
            <li>I developed eczema on my eyelids and couldn&#x27;t find anything that really worked.</li>
            <li>Tried prescription creams given by doctor and some all natural one from whole foods.</li>
            <li>then and this is the only moisturizer that helps keep my skin moist and calm.</li>
            <li>normally apply this lotion once a day.  </li>
            <li>However it is a nice lotion that does soothe, but it will not get rid of eczema (at least in my case).&lt;br</li>
            <li>next best thing would be straight neosporin, but that stuff is so greasy and unpleasant, and you really dont want to rub it everywhere because then it will not absorb and just transfer to everything else.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, no longer did it itch like HELL.</li>
            <li>I found that applying this lotion first and African shea butter over really helps moisturize her skin.</li>
            <li>or so my elbows and hands looked completely normal and were no longer itchy at all.</li>
            <li>The only thing that worked was hydrocortisone, but i heard long term use would cause more problems than it solved.</li>
            <li>Soothes dried heated itchy skin better than any cream I&#x27;ve tried in 10 years</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t doubt that a few more applications of the cream will heal him.</li>
            <li>My sweet 2 year old daughter has eczema and the only medicne that treats it</li>
            <li>Works well, not too thick, goes on nicely.  </li>
            <li>It goes on really thick, but it absorbs into the skin nicely and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li>Goes on kind of thick, but doesn&#x27;t feel cloggy, stifling, or oily.</li>
            <li>I started using Aveeno last week and within 2 days I felt a real relief and my skin got less rough, it is the first time that my skin reacts so good to a cream.</li>
            <li>It works fine on other areas of the body though.</li>
            <li>lotion is amazing, and although I have used Aveeno previously for years at different times, I never knew of this version.</li>
            <li>It would be better for people who have only moderately dry skin, not eczema.</li>
            <li>As soon as I stopped, it would come right back.  </li>
            <li>his redness comes right back.</li>
            <li>Right after using it for the second time, my eyelids became severely inflamed and irritated.</li>
            <li>so it was such a peace of mind to know I have found the right cream.</li>
            <li>so I can get to it quickly (and frequently) so this one little tube (costs as much as all the other things combined)does the job and does it quickly!!  </li>
            <li>MOst lotions burns my skin or is TOO HEAVY for all over the body, but this is creamy yet light enough for a body lotion and doesn&#x27;t burn my skin (excema is several places all over my body).</li>
            <li>I am truly grateful for this product and hope that other eczema products (face wash, soap, etc) become readily available too.</li>
            <li>I just wanted to try something new, but I guess like the saying goes &amp;</li>
            <li>I signed up for the automatic program where I get a new cream every 3 months</li>
            <li>and I believe my body must&#x27;ve just been adjusting to this new treatment.</li>
            <li>I gotta try the new Gold bond eczema cream I heard that&#x27;ll work if this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It was recommended by my new dermatologist.</li>
            <li>After hearing all the horror stories of eczema and how hard it is to treat I was thrilled when this worked for my four year old daughter.</li>
            <li>I rarely get excemea anymore, but developed it recently with a new hand soap.  </li>
            <li>P.S. changing the diet and eliminating sugar, white flour, dairy and drinking pure water will do wonders, too!</li>
            <li>This lotion&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found so far for this random patch of dry skin.</li>
            <li>The actual healing process took a few days to start, but the results have been amazing nonetheless.</li>
            <li>Works so well on super dry and itchy skin (not officially eczema).  </li>
            <li>He also prescribed Sulfacetamide which made my cheeks super dry.  </li>
            <li>I have mild eczema on my hands that tends to pop up when it&#x27;s dry out</li>
            <li>My older child has almost completely grown out of it by the age of three.</li>
            <li>I was also quite pleased with the size of the product, much bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li>I have mild eczema with itchy, dry, flaky skin on my hands.  </li>
            <li>Can you imagine the turmoil in being a 17 year old high school senior with eyelid eczema?  </li>
            <li>He has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My son has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have to admit that I&#x27;m surprised at the results and would highly recommend it to anyone suffering from eczema.  </li>
            <li>used the Aveeno a few days in a row instead, and found that it was fine as moisturizer, but my eczema flared right back up.</li>
            <li>I have had a consistent butterfly rash for the last 8 years.  </li>
            <li>One week later - red rashes on my hands, neck and face significantly reduced or gone.      </li>
            <li>I only put it on my eyelid and am still on my first bottle.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my brother who has Enczema and this is the first over the counter cream that has actually worked for him.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, give this cream a try!</li>
            <li>and then I found this, which is the exact same thing with oatmeal extract.</li>
            <li>but this is my preference by far!</li>
            <li>and my skin is completely healed and almost normal looking.</li>
            <li>It has been 3 days, since I started using this product and WOW!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found out BEFORE I wasted my money on it!  </li>
            <li>I bought a bottle of this at rite aid , same exact stuff.</li>
            <li>I only wish I&#x27;d tried this first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many creams in the past, before I purchased this for my son.</li>
            <li>So far straight neosporin has actually worked really well</li>
            <li>This lotion works wonders for my husbands sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m not sure which one helped more</li>
            <li>but it totally made his face look way better than it did when he was using all those other creams.</li>
            <li>I usually do not write any reviews but for this I have to share my story.</li>
            <li>I had healed the initial problem with other products but the skin didn&#x27;t heal until I started using this product (recommended by a nurse), its fantastic!</li>
            <li>This cream usually stops those itching sessions after a minute or so and also helps him sleep better at night.</li>
            <li>First time writing a review, but i felt the need to help out my fellow eczema friends because i know how big the burden can be.</li>
            <li>This one is the first one which has actually helped me remove my itch.</li>
            <li>i have had eczema all of my life, and I have found something that is a complete life changer!  </li>
            <li>They have exactly the same ingredients.</li>
            <li>At first it actually irritated my skin a bit.</li>
            <li>When I first saw him the skin around his ankles was flared up with scaling, red blotches and lots of dryness.</li>
            <li>2 year old daughters exema is almost gone!  </li>
            <li>We usually do this before bedtime and make sure he wears cotton pajamas.</li>
            <li>I do not usually write reviews.</li>
            <li>and my skin is super sensitive, dry, scaly, patchy, itchy (you get the idea).</li>
            <li>I noticed that because I lived in the dorm for my first year of college, I&#x27;ve developed a germ issue (not the extent of OCD or germophobia, but I washed my hands all the time), which really made my hands dry and irritated.  </li>
            <li>But this should have been a clue - there are simply too many chemicals in this lotion irritating my skin, and isn&#x27;t this the opposite of what we&#x27;re supposed to do with eczema, which is expose it to even more irritants.</li>
            <li>My mom bought this when I was away and when I returned 3 days later our daughter&#x27;s back was soft, smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>It is not as thick as some of the other lotions we use, but it soothes irritated skin very effectively.</li>
            <li>Even with the hot weather we&#x27;ve recently had, her skin is still clear.</li>
            <li>The way I did it, is first BEFORE I tried the Aveeno, I applied a prescription triamcinolone acetonide cream for several days to clear the eczema up</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just extremely dry, scaly, and rarely cracks and bleeds.</li>
            <li>He had a few spots that resembled eczema and it cleared up very quickly.</li>
            <li>I have used hydro-cortisone in the past, but saw this more natural product and figured I&#x27;d give it a shot this winter.  </li>
            <li>My 2 yr old daughter has eczema pretty badly, especially in the summer months.</li>
            <li>We followed other recommendations and they were right!</li>
            <li>It doesnt cure it, but it sure does help to take the red out and tone down flare-ups.</li>
            <li>After a day of applying very hot compresses, the eczema shrink in size, the redness became pink and it relieved the itchiness.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I have a couple of eczema patches on my hands, and thought I&#x27;d try something other than my tried and true Hydrocortisone 1% plus Aloe.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After only 2 days of using it, all I can say is WOW WOW WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>M doctor recommended this for my baby as she had very dry skin during the winter months when she was born ,it cleared out all the dry patches and slight redness on her skin ,Amazing product !</li>
            <li>and this will help your little ones skin stay free of dryness, redness and itchiness.</li>
            <li>Within a couple of days my hands look almost like that of a normal person&#x27;s, which is a major thing for me.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, this stuff applies easily and doesn&#x27;t make me feel sticky or gross like some other lotions do.</li>
            <li>She began using this cream a few months ago and has noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>After a week of use, the eczema is beginning to clear up.    </li>
            <li>After about two weeks my legs are completely clear.  </li>
            <li>With it, she keeps her skin hydrated, and clear.</li>
            <li>I bought this and the eczema body wash, used both for a week, and my sons skin started to clear up....</li>
            <li>It has helped clear up her eczema and has also prevented any break outs since we started using it almost 4 months ago.</li>
            <li>Worked great on a small patch of redness under my eye that was worsening over the past 4-5 weeks.</li>
            <li>but I know that aveeno is gentle enough on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>However, I still need to use steroid based creams to clear up my eczema.</li>
            <li>but clearly it was not working.</li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t use body wash directly on my arms and legs to keep from scrubbing away my natural moisturizers.</li>
            <li>No scent, doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>In addition, I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My son&#x27;s eczema since he was 6 months&#x27; old relief by this product.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this lotion to anyone with eczema especially on their hands</li>
            <li>I am surprised Aveeno tends to be nicer quality.  </li>
            <li>If you give it a try, be sure to reserve judgement at least a week.  </li>
            <li>(1x/wk v. nearly every day).  </li>
            <li>I have tested it on my sensitive skin face</li>
            <li>Yet when using this Aveeno product alone, my eczema was kept nearly all away.  </li>
            <li>My six year old has eczema on his legs</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>My 16 year old daughter has severe eczema.  </li>
            <li>It has been a constant struggle to find an over the counter cream that REALLY helps my eczema.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old daughter has suffered from eczema since birth.  </li>
            <li>We have been using the cream for the last 1.5 years and it really helps with the severe eczema problems caused by food allergies.</li>
            <li>she is now 19 months and her eczema is completely under control because of this product.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work for my 2 year old</li>
            <li>For $11 I found a product that has almost completely faded all of the spots of eczema and taken away the itch/pain completely.  </li>
            <li>She is 17 years old and hasn&#x27;t had an eczema flare since she was about 10 years old.  </li>
            <li>wow.  </li>
            <li>When I came upon this product I found it priced much lower than my traditional solution.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 32 years old and been struggling with eczema on my hands for all my life.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s almost completely cleared up my hands completely.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this lotion for my 4.5 yrs old toddler recommended by her doctor.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get rid of it completely.  </li>
            <li>His need to itch his face stopped completely.</li>
            <li>Also, instead of looking like a layer of skin has been removed, it looks like my skin is almost completely healed.  </li>
            <li>that has worked for my 10 month old and her eczema.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on how soft my skin is.</li>
            <li>, I just cover the area up and after about 2-3 days, the area is completely healed.</li>
            <li>My daughter developed eczema when she was 2 years old for 10 years</li>
            <li>I had been using the steroid cream more lately.  </li>
            <li>Within a week, the rash is completely gone.</li>
            <li>So much that it feels gross on you</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My 11 month old recently developed a rash that the doctor diagnosed as eczema.  </li>
            <li>After a week or two, it was completely gone.</li>
            <li>Really feels like its a deep moisturiser.</li>
            <li>And thats when I realized how much aveeno is helping my daughter&#x27;s skin on a daily basis!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t over power you and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I use a sensitive laundry soap, California baby eczema wash in the bath</li>
            <li>Leave it to a 30 year old guy to never go to the doctor and just let things figure themselves out.</li>
            <li>If your baby is suffering with exema or really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Both my daughters have eczema, and one also has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but the chlorine really dries out her skin, especially in the winter.  </li>
            <li>It is the only thing that really seems to work on my hands.</li>
            <li>The redness went away almost completely.  </li>
            <li>I applied it on my 2 year old son and it works</li>
            <li>you have extremely sensitive skin, you may consider the following&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003BJZ1P6/ref&#x3D;as_li_tl?ie&#x3D;</li>
            <li>I know for a fact I don&#x27;t react to Paraffin, using Vaseline every day on my hyper sensitive face, so what else could it be?</li>
            <li>It has your hands feeling so soft and within a week&#x27;s time, my symptoms were cleared.  </li>
            <li>I will keep putting it on once every night at least to make sure the eczema stays away.</li>
            <li>yeah, the red skin was still there, but it felt so much calmer.</li>
            <li>This works wonders for my 1 year old who has eczema.</li>
            <li>I just started using it and so far, it seems to work well with no irritation noted.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The patches are nearly gone</li>
            <li>My 3 year old was suffering a lot with her eczema.</li>
            <li>My 7 week old had eczema patches all over his face and neck.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this every day to keep my face soft and moisturize.  </li>
            <li>Anyway I wanted to try something natural</li>
            <li>I have used this on our 18 months old since he was around 8 months old.</li>
            <li>Completely clears it up after a week of once a day use.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t solve all of the symptoms associated with eczema, but it sure keeps my skin moisturized for at least 12 hours</li>
            <li>I developed eczema on my chin this winter.  </li>
            <li>I applied it 2 more times the next day, and the rashes were dried up or had completely disappeared.  </li>
            <li>My baby nephew is a year old and has eczema.</li>
            <li>After dealing with it for two years, it was still there and it developed into a rash with blisters that would crust and sometimes bleed.  </li>
            <li>Baby skin is really sensitive.</li>
            <li>and while it&#x27;s subsided in my adult years I still get itchiness and dryness on my hands a lot and sometimes on my stomach and thighs.</li>
            <li>So far the eczema is on and off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had psoriasis for over 25 years and recently developed eczema, too.</li>
            <li>I have a 5 month old son that needed an eczema cream, as do I.</li>
            <li>my job require frequent hand wash.</li>
            <li>My child has had eczema from bout a month old.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use this on your face if you get acne naturally.</li>
            <li>I have an almost 2 year old, that has sporadic flare ups of eczema.  </li>
            <li>My 4 year old daughter has had eczema since she was born.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re completely gone.</li>
            <li>We got this to try out for our 3 months old since she has Eczema.</li>
            <li>It really gave me hope when I had none left.</li>
            <li>Our 2yr old has eczema bumps on her arms and chest.</li>
            <li>She has eczema since 2 weeks after birth, and she &#x27;s 6 months old now.</li>
            <li>I use this on my infant daughter since she has sensitive and eczema.</li>
            <li>After a few applications I found that my skin is no longer cracking and is actually smooth.</li>
            <li>I developed a blistery rash, which turned into a blotchy reddened and itchy skin.</li>
            <li>and twin girls (8 months) all have sensitive and eczematic skin</li>
            <li>and this is the only (gentle) product that clears it up.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any improvement from the Aquaphor and the CeraVe seemed to keep things from getting worse but didn&#x27;t really make them better.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t exactely what I was looking for because I already knew that Vaseline helped my skin from getting worse (although not healing it either), Hydromol has become a useful (SLS free) soap substitute in the shower</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried using prescription cortisone cream covered with regular hand lotion, which actually dried out my hands even more.  </li>
            <li>I love how thick the lotion is.</li>
            <li>This is perhaps the best and least irritating lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this for anyone who really struggles with dry skin or eczema.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my husband&#x27;s very persistent itch due to a certain condition.  </li>
            <li>For the last 2 years, I noticed that I started itching a lot by my right wrist and my left shin.  </li>
            <li>Pretty much a recombination of typical Aveeno ingredients.      </li>
            <li>His face went from red, peeling and itchy to perfectly normal, seemingly overnight!</li>
            <li>My hands finally look normal again!  </li>
            <li>and my eyelids are 80% back to normal!  </li>
            <li>I treated it in part with a 1% hydrocortisone cream, but the skin was pretty dry, too</li>
            <li>I get dry hands easily and therefore have several places on my hands that are issues for me (which is why I always carried lotion in each bag and in my pockets if I could), and although I haven&#x27;t seen the same result on my hands that i have of my face, I will not give up.</li>
            <li>This was the first winter I did not have dry skin issues.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say if you have moderate or mild eczema this will help you, but if your eczema is severe or you&#x27;ve had it a very long time, either try another product or go ask a doctor for something prescription.</li>
            <li>This calms his itches down quickly.</li>
            <li>I have two little boys that have battled eczema pretty much since they were born.</li>
            <li>they other day , my foot flared up, and i rubbed this lotion on it until it was completely absorbed, and within 2 minutes, it stopped itching been using for a week, i was amazed</li>
            <li>But it goes away much more quickly than other products, especially if you wipe your hands on other patches of dry</li>
            <li>I still use the Cortizone-10 specifically for the eczema but the CeraVe, or the generic version available at a drug store, has been helpful for daily treatment of dry hands.</li>
            <li>When I applied this product for the first time my eczema became so red, swollen,itchy and it multiplied all over my left leg.</li>
            <li>I have used lots of Aveeno products in the past, and have been satisfied, but this one goes above and beyond anything I have tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used different Aveeno lotions for years with decent results on my eczema, but after discovering this cream...</li>
            <li>It was dark red and now It is light</li>
            <li>This is the first lotion I have used that actually shows improvement within a day or two and isn&#x27;t geeasy or sting my open eczema patches.</li>
            <li>Now that my baby is older, I only have to use it 1-2 times a day to keep the eczema at bay.</li>
            <li>Remember letting your little one play in the bath will dry out their skin causing more dryness, redness and even itchiness to the skin.</li>
            <li>A little greasy, but not bad.</li>
            <li>But I highly recommend this to anyone with skin issues such as Eczema or Psoriasis.</li>
            <li>But I highly recommend this to anyone with skin issues such as Eczema or Psoriasis.</li>
            <li>In my case, I have a minor dry skin on my hand, I try to apply it as many time as needed when my hand feel dry.</li>
            <li>I have minor eczema on each size of my nose, right on my inner cheek.</li>
            <li>We used this for just a few days twice per day and his skin cleared right up!</li>
            <li>Its light, theres very little cast, and</li>
            <li>I did get some itchiness a couple of hours later, but applying a little more cream helped immensely.  </li>
            <li>Also, as to previous comments saying that Aveeno&#x27;s products \\&quot;smell horrible,\\&quot; they don&#x27;t have a \\&quot;scent\\&quot; because people with eczema are highly sensitive to scented stuff, so there isn&#x27;t a distinct smell.  </li>
            <li>and I have to wait for it to dry somewhat before I get back in bed, but that is so worth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many other products that claim to help with dry skin, but this one actually works.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s fine for a regular after-bath cream, but I wouldn&#x27;t count on it to work miracles on those little fat rolls.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s what I have tried with limited success: hydro-cortisone cream, aloe vera, prescription steroid creams, oral anti-histamine, topical anti-histamine, oatmeal baths, bandages to limit skin contact with fabric, tons of OTC moisturizers, oils, petroleum gel as a barrier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and really works well as a barrier cream.</li>
            <li>Within 24 hours-- her red, swollen, wrinkled eyelids returned to normal.  </li>
            <li>In a day or two I expect it will look completely normal and for once my hands aren&#x27;t in pain, and let me tell you, it&#x27;s a godsend especially since I&#x27;m a Chef and a sales clerk.</li>
            <li>This size isn&#x27;t normally found in stores,  especially at this price.</li>
            <li>It is normal they have rushes in his arms, legs or back.</li>
            <li>I do apply normally about 3 to 4 times daily.</li>
            <li>With regular use, my eczema stays away, and my skin returned to normal.  </li>
            <li>When I got down to the bottom of the bottle I decided to look around for another product since even though it helped more than other products I had used, I still had the problem.  </li>
            <li>I notice the redness is much less and what is to me the most compelling reason to try it, is that my skin is getting better and better each and every day to the point where it is FINALLY clearing up after suffering with that horrible itch day in and day out for so long.  </li>
            <li>One might due better with just plain old vaseline!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s still a spot of severely stubborn inflammation, but for mild to moderate cases, I couldn&#x27;t imagine recommending any other brand or lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I moved to the US last November and temperatures where I live have reached -20C</li>
            <li>and this is the only moisturizer that seems to work in the New England winter for them.</li>
            <li>Great foe my 2 yr old with bad skin issues.</li>
            <li>I believe this is from washing my hands so much and irritation from warm water along with the cold weather.</li>
            <li>Dry skin with eczema is a real problem.  </li>
            <li>Very helpful in stopping dry, itching skin.  </li>
            <li>Works really well on eczema, dry patches</li>
            <li>In my case, I developed eczema when I became pregnant with my 3rd (never had this problem with my previous pregnancies)--I was getting unbearable itchy rashes everywhere on my body.  </li>
            <li>It really soothes dry skin with a trace of eczema.</li>
            <li>All three of my kids suffer with eczema and this cream really does penetrate the dry skin and alleviate their itching.</li>
            <li>Within 2 days I really noticed a decrease in the dry, scaly patches.  </li>
            <li>It really helps with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite as smooth as regular lotion, but it doesn&#x27;t feel harsh.  </li>
            <li>A day later, I didn&#x27;t really anything different on Kent&#x27;s leg.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times so far, but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It only takes a tiny bit to do a whole baby.</li>
            <li>she has super dry skin, redness and dry patches.</li>
            <li>My 3mo old&#x27;s eczema was under control by his regular baby cream; however I was hoping to clear out by using this product.</li>
            <li>My 5 month old has eczema and this is the only lotion I have found that completely helps.</li>
            <li>I really felt a big relief not only for my skin</li>
            <li>Granted, it isn&#x27;t as effective on the eczema on my back, which is much worse and has been there a lot longer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clearing up a trouble area on my leg so quick :&#x27;)...</li>
            <li>because as some people have tried to make very clear in these reviews everyone is different and all products don&#x27;t work for all people.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and just had a severe eczema breakout where every moisturizer burned (area turned red and inflamed like a chemical burn), including shea butter-based creams.</li>
            <li>Being a eczema patient from birth its hard finding the right product that helps moisturizing part, but this really works...</li>
            <li>No other product worked besides Eucerin, until I discovered this Aveeno.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t consider this a major drawback.</li>
            <li>Boy, oh boy, what a major difference in her skin.  </li>
            <li>When i tried it the first time, my eyelid skin get extremely irritated, inflamed, and swollen.</li>
            <li>While it does a good job moisturising the normal parts of my face, as the summer went on and the cold snap of autumn has arrived, my eczema has come back with a vengeance and now this cream and the baby wash</li>
            <li>This mosturizing cream suprised me.&lt;br /&gt;it helps my psoriasis like no other.</li>
            <li>It takes a little work to rub it in, but it shows results within the first use!</li>
            <li>And then after my skin got mostly cleared up, I started applying the Aveeno lotion at least once a day, sometimes twice, and I haven&#x27;t had any eczema breakouts since!</li>
            <li>Just after a few days, the dry skin on my face is cured, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It would only get slightly smaller but after using this it completely gone my skin is back to normal as if I never had eczema!</li>
            <li>Helps my husbands very dry skin on legs and arms that can cause him intense itching.</li>
            <li>This really helped with my infant&#x27;s very dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li>Its a little pricey, but its so worth it.</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey, but well worth it.  </li>
            <li>if u looked closely on the back this one has black bar strip on top meaning its all chemicals , and the baby eczema has blue bar which means that it has some natural in it , I wish I knew that earlier , I thought they were both the same cuz they have same ingredient list.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t sting like other products have and it made the stiff skin pliable and more flexible and it stayed that way.</li>
            <li>Lately I also developed a very very small amount right at the top of my nose between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Obviously not wanting to take any drugs or use any creams that could endanger the baby, I was hesitant in using anything other than a mild topical steroid cream, to no avail.  </li>
            <li>This by far is this best productive used for my eczema, and it is bad year round.</li>
            <li>For those with sun sensitivity (which is common for anyone with a butterfly / malar rash) you may want to give La Roche-Posay Anthelios 60 Ultra Light Sunscreen a try.  </li>
            <li>my rash has cleared up, I&#x27;m going to keep this around and use it as a general moisturizing body lotion.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use this tube for my hands as a general moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and my arms, chest, and back are perfectly clear.</li>
            <li>matter, 1 week later and my skin is clear.  </li>
            <li>and this is the only cream that helps clear it up.</li>
            <li>I literally applied it two times over two days and my neck is clear from any red scaly patches of skin.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for two days and can already see a marked difference.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it morning and night and the redness and scaliness of the area</li>
            <li>This cream is the only one so far to soothe her skin.  </li>
            <li>My one year old son has eczema, which tends to flare up regularly.</li>
            <li>So far, Baby Eczema Cream is the only cream I can use on her that doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li>Steroid cream made the skin on my face red and sensitive, so I am reluctant to use it.    </li>
            <li>Steam facial done by professional aesthetician&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Before, I was experiencing a near constant &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; sensation.  </li>
            <li>Our daughter has had eczema on her back, hips and arms since she was 4 months old</li>
            <li>I am not a medical professional and this is a recommendation based solely on my experience and should not be consider advice on to purchase.</li>
            <li>This is the only cream we&#x27;ve tried so far that heals up our toddler&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li>and I barely scratch anymore.</li>
            <li>Apparently, it happens.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finally going to a dermatologist on Monday about a completely unrelated bump on my shoulder (wish me luck)</li>
            <li>As soon as I applied it, I felt relief and actually said &amp;#34;Ahhh&amp;#34; out loud.</li>
            <li>My newborn son developed eczema recently around his neck, folds of his arms and legs.  </li>
            <li>They completely healed a couple of weeks later and I continue to use this to keep outbreaks in check.  </li>
            <li>Immediately I cleaned his face and went back to apply his regular cream which he cried the entire process because his face was hurting so much.</li>
            <li>but this is the only lotion I use for my eczema and it has worked wonders for me so far.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how much money i&#x27;ve spent and</li>
            <li>but I use this when my skin is red and sensitive after using Retin A</li>
            <li>By the time my baby turned 2 weeks old, he had red patches on his cheeks.  </li>
            <li>I am currently 23 years old, and I have had skin issues for (what it seems) all my life.</li>
            <li>If I follow up with this lotion immediately, my hands stay soft and moisturized until the next time I wash them.</li>
            <li>With regular use my skin was completely healed within a week.</li>
            <li>After only three days of use my hand has gone from cracked, red and bleeding to almost normal.</li>
            <li>Sure, it is really gentle and non irritating, but the moisturizing effected not that long lasting.</li>
            <li>I was still holding my breath though, hoping it would continue since sometimes it can get better then worse again.</li>
            <li>The eczema therapy cream decreased the depth of wrinkles, most visible on my arms.</li>
            <li>In fact, applying this made my eczema worse because it was a lot more itchy.</li>
            <li>Tired of having to resort to steroid ointments, I started looking for a better alternative.</li>
            <li>Back to coconut oil for me - 10 minutes after which, my skin began to immediately calm down from aveeno experience.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely continue to purchase for my dry winter skin!!</li>
            <li>first few days it made my skin very dry / flaky, tight and more red (when the cream was washed off).</li>
            <li>highly recommended for dry skin.</li>
            <li>My advice for any new product-test it first in a small way.</li>
            <li>Around 6 1/2-7m old my baby started developing patches of dry skin near her fingers and on her cheeks and nose.</li>
            <li>As much as I&#x27;ve tried other natural products to treat my eczema this is the only one that works, time and time again.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live with the suspicion of doing a general harm to my child while trying to cure a relatively limited problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used other products that are reliable, but very costly.  </li>
            <li>Some other creams either hurt his skin or do not have much effect.</li>
            <li>I never expected this and was more than ready for another disappointment, but this...</li>
            <li>Ww tried pretty much every type of lotion before Aveeno, because I&#x27;ve broken out in hives from some of their adult products.</li>
            <li>I have tried the following moisturizers (Johnson &amp; Johnson Baby oil, Olive oil, SebaMed Baby Lotion, SebaMed Baby Cream, Cetaphil Skin Moisturizer (Formulated for Eczema),  Eucerin Professional Repair Lotion, Eucerin Calming Cr&amp;egrave;me, Eucerin Original Healing Repair Cr&amp;egrave;me, Eucerin Intensive Repair Extra-Enriched Hand Cr&amp;egrave;me, Medela Tender Care Lanolin, Aquaphor Healing Ointment (Dry, Cracked, and Irritated Skin Protectant), Laroche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5, Organic Coconut oil, Eucerin Baby Eczema Cr&amp;egrave;me, Aveeno Eczema Cream, Lucas Papaw Ointment, Raw Apothecary</li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t live without it and still use it once in awhile even in the summer if I notice a dry or itchy spot anywhere on my body.</li>
            <li>I am a college student and I live in a dry and elevated area.</li>
            <li>/&gt;----------------------&lt;br /&gt;I have had eczema for most of my life and except for a bad case as a child, it has been mild, but constant for 30 years.  </li>
            <li>The red dry skin is still just barely visible on the inside of one of my fingers, but I&#x27;m willing to take that over itchy, blistering dry skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been suffering from dry skin especially on my face which can be very embarrassing when you&#x27;re in public.</li>
            <li>the only lotion that actually helps clear my excema.  </li>
            <li>It does not matter how old you are, whether your a male or female, or what color skin you have.</li>
            <li>My husband recently developed eczema and has tried several different creams.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I didn&#x27;t see it necessary to give him something steroid based at such a young age.</li>
            <li>Tried several moisturizers, but only this worked so far.</li>
            <li>Not only did it make my existing eczema worse, but cause more of it to pop up, in the surrounding area that applied the cream.</li>
            <li>No dry skin, just moisturized skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different types of their products and they all make it worse.</li>
            <li>It is extremely moisturizing but isn&#x27;t greasy like some of the other &amp;#34;eczema&amp;#34; products full of mineral oil.</li>
            <li>The cost is not cheap, i have to pay thrice the price for shipping only, but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s exactly as described, very soothing for irritated skin which is always an issue for me in the winters and year round due to my allergy to soap.</li>
            <li>I was searching high and low for an OTC products to help with my sore dry hands.</li>
            <li>I read the other reviews very carefully because as many other reviewers mentioned, I was looking for something to sooth my itchy skin.  </li>
            <li>No more itching, no more redness, plus an amazing smooth patch of skin in the areas where its usually been a tad bit rough or peeling, and sometimes itchy as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick, didn&#x27;t last as long as thicker creams, and left my hands a bit slippery.</li>
            <li>the cream last long for a long time plus fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and we live in a very dry climate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Aveeno for 7 days in order to get ride of an eczema and after this time is exactly the same or even a little worse.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing and helps stop the itch mildly, and the &amp;#34;non scent&amp;#34; it has is clearly made to not &amp;#34;have a smell&amp;#34; and in turn, has an empty bland smell to it - so much that I just can&#x27;t stand smelling for a few minutes after putting it on - but that could just be me!</li>
            <li>For everyone out there with eczema, I highly recommend using this and any other Aveeno product, including their shower and oatmeal bath.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty optimistic no matter how bad it looks at the moment she will be okay within a year or so.</li>
            <li>This creme has helped to clear my eczema and treat dry skin problems.</li>
            <li>I had previously been using a hydrocortisone lotion that claimed to be \\&quot;intensively healing\\&quot; to eczematous skin, but my hands would continue to burn for up to 20 minutes after applying it, and it really didn&#x27;t seem to keep my hands moisturized like it claimed it would.</li>
            <li>I used this on my son when he was  2 months old because he had really dry peeling skin.  </li>
            <li>This has a slightly &#x27;medicinal&#x27; smell but really does the job.</li>
            <li>It does not heal my eczema in any way, but I find it to be slightly soothing and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>My 2-year old daughter has atopic dermatitis (chronic dry skin).</li>
            <li>It gave my dried and hot skin a cooling effect and moistened it enough to stop itching.</li>
            <li>we slather him down religiously in this and it has just helped so much.</li>
            <li>Every single one of them contained Parabens, except for my trusty old Vaseline.</li>
            <li>I use this constantly and have found myself with very few flare ups, and truly feel like it delves into my skin and keeps it fresh and feeling healthy/moisturized throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I need to reapply so much, the very small amounts of this isn&#x27;t worth the money compared to other products.</li>
            <li>I am extremely hopeful that in a couple of weeks, my cheeks will look completely normal again.  </li>
            <li>After a few days of using this the results are fantastic, within a week in a half the rash became non-existent.</li>
            <li>My LO&#x27;s eczema got worse last week and it appeared itchy because he&#x27;s easily irritated and always scraching his face.</li>
            <li>But February of last year I spotted a small light pink patch on my the left side of my face.</li>
            <li>This product really helped smooth out my dry, irritated skin after an unfortunate tangle with toxic plants.</li>
            <li>, I have very bad dry, cracked skin on my hands in the winter, and this lotion has been great for that too!</li>
            <li>After my rash was completely gone, I kept using this cream on my skin, which tends to be very dry.  </li>
            <li>After a week twice daily, the eczema disappeared completely from one hand and you can barely see it on the other.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product partially due to the positive feedbacks on this site and partially out of desperation as I&#x27;ve been suffering from eczema for decades.  </li>
            <li>I love that there are no dyes or artificial fragrances, since I have sensitive</li>

            <li> this works great for eczema</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t say how it works for people with chronic eczema, but if you have a temporary dermatitis rash, this lotion would be great as a part of your treatment strategy.</li>
            <li> I have no doubts that this works great for the non-pregnant.  </li>
            <li> but it is greatly diminished and their skin is the smoothest it has ever been.</li>

            <li> Works amazingly on my eczema!</li>
            <li> We love this product and it is so soothing and works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many remedies for the eczema on my hands and this has worked the best.</li>
            <li> :o)  </li>
            <li> nice try!).</li>
            <li> you using this cream in winter, it will provide perfect protection. :-)</li>
            <li> I suffer from eczema and thought this product would be great (it has really good reviews after all)</li>
            <li> This product is excellent and will buy more.  </li>
            <li> best to put it on when skin is damp ... and make sure to put it on at night before bed .... also using the soap-free wash for showers ...</li>

            <li> Others are very good, but this one is better.</li>
            <li> and it has worked so good</li>
            <li> I suffer from eczema and my doctor gave me a sample of this cream, which surprisingly works</li>
            <li> In conclusion, this lotion is not as good as it claims, neither did it heal or soothe the redness</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good moisturizer and makes my eczema look faded, until it wears off.</li>
            <li> &quot; I got on-line to look for eczema treatments, and as I knew Aveeno products were good, I ordered the Aveeno Eczema Cream.  </li>
            <li> Cera-Ve is a good cream, although not for my problem.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> I read that this product was superior to another product I ordered by mail.</li>
            <li> I tried this based on the good reviews on here.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this based on the good reviews</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this cream in Canada, but I heard good reviews about it.</li>
            <li> but it is always good to know what you are allergic to)</li>
            <li> Bath bombs have baking soda which is good for the skin.</li>
            <li> A seemingly good product, but it shouldn&#x27;t be used even around your eyes (even though the warning just prohibits in eyes)</li>
            <li> The lotion is also non greasy and feels good on skin.</li>
            <li> The steroid cream has done good to my eyelids</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the Aveeno Baby lotion for my kids</li>
            <li> It’s been a good 4 months that we are using this</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer and eczema cream.</li>
            <li> I gave this cream a try based on the good reviews</li>
            <li> And it smells good also.</li>
            <li> And her skin is absolutely smooth and great !</li>
            <li> He even like to show me just how good his legs look in the mornings.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> but this is really good moisturizer anyway.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a good cream, but i think the revitol eczema dermatitis cream is good as well.</li>
            <li> Good product and good price.  </li>
            <li> Was as good as advertised.  </li>
            <li> good product</li>
            <li> However, if you want a really good cream for severe eczema, I found that I had to just make it myself.  </li>
            <li> This is a good cream for when you are on the go.</li>
            <li> Good luck</li>
            <li> I think that it is a good product</li>
            <li> If you have skin problems, go to a dermatologist and get the good stuff.</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> good cream</li>
            <li> not as good as California baby, but cheaper.</li>
            <li> I wish it work, as good as I had read.</li>
            <li> It worked exceptionally well within just a couple days.  </li>
            <li> Amazon.com&#x27;s price is the best I&#x27;ve found anywhere and shipping was quick to Canada.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I am happy to report, it continued to improve and after 2 weeks of use, I feel fairly confident that it is quite healed.</li>
            <li> I am so happy and glad that I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> i am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve seen how many great reviews this one has</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product and the service.</li>
            <li> For best result, apply it right after bath to keep the body moisturized.</li>
            <li> Very good, my baby eczema because often itch, use have significantly improved after 3 day</li>

            <li> Im pretty impressed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Then, I came across this cream and decided to give it a try, and my rash looked significantly better within a day!  </li>
            <li> It is the best lotion I have found to date (if you are interested in moisturizing).</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>

            <li> What a pleasant surprise &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This cream is absolutely AMAZING for eczema.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I use this on my eczema where I need to itch, and it amazingly sooth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazing for my eczema</li>
            <li> this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> I recommend this stuff to everyone it is amazing.</li>
            <li> The change in his skin was amazing.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> , I think putting any kind of baby moisturizer on it, including this one, just irritates it.  </li>
            <li> A nice aid to what ever your using for your eczema.</li>
            <li> It might work as some kind of lotion if you haven&#x27;t rubbed or scratched your skin in any way.  </li>
            <li> While the lotion is a nice one in that (1) there is no offending smell, (2) it is quite moisturizing without being overly greasy (2)</li>
            <li> Probably contemplating the amputation of my own hands...</li>
            <li> I honestly thought it was just another type of lotion that just had eczema on the product.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly tell you that this product SAVED ME SKIN AND MY LIFE.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful, very like</li>
            <li> I used to have really nice skin</li>
            <li> i have eczema, and it acutely burns my skin</li>
            <li> ITS NOT GREASY.VERY NICE STUFF</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Aveeno products.</li>
            <li> but it works nicely without excema .  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly amazed.</li>
            <li> so to be honest</li>
            <li> I googled pictures of it and it was like looking at my own face.</li>
            <li> In a day or two, if memory serves.&lt;br /&gt;Why grow any kind of beard if it causes excema rashes, you ask?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good cream for eczema on my hands and nothing worked well until I tried this -- definitely better for my eczema than Burt&#x27;s Bees, Vaseline and YuBe.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-somewhat effective for reducing eczema lesions&lt;br /&gt;-pricy</li>
            <li> you so much Aveeno for this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I thought it was some kind of allergic reaction or sensitiveness</li>
            <li> so I just hoped it would go away on its own.</li>
            <li> Nice smell.  </li>
            <li> I liked this.........great for my skin.</li>
            <li> It was really one of the best impulse buys of my life.  </li>
            <li> This lotion isn&#x27;t greasy, absorbs nicely and has no scent at all.</li>
            <li> Smothering her up 3 times a day with this prevents any kind of flares.</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> Great for mild ecezma.  </li>
            <li> I replaced it with regular creams and everything was good after a couple days :D</li>
            <li> It is wonderful to have such good friends.  </li>
            <li> I have mild eczema on my hands and this cream is great for treating it.  </li>

            <li> Figured let&#x27;s Google some of the best eczema creams out there with natural ingredients and give it a shot.</li>
            <li> By far the best moisturizer on the market.</li>

            <li> far it is the best cream I have used ,including a cream that was prescribed for me by a physician.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend,excellent price.</li>
            <li> The best Eczema therapy treatment if have tried so far.</li>

            <li> It is the best lotion for eczema I have used so far.</li>
            <li> This is the very best I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best.</li>
            <li> She said it is one of the most effective over the counter creams for her eczema she has ever had.</li>
            <li> It works on our 2 year old wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I have tried many creams and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Great for the whole family!</li>
            <li> very good to help with eczema and to prevent new outbreak</li>
            <li> but it seems very light compared to the one I always get.</li>
            <li> but it leaves this very light sticky residue</li>
            <li> This does have a very light tinge of oatmeal scent that dissipates.</li>
            <li> , it is very light and...</li>
            <li> Nice product, easy on the hands, and works well.</li>
            <li> so my baby loves it, which is a very important point as it makes her much more cooperative when I apply the cream.</li>
            <li> The very first time I put it on my hands my burning and itching stopped immediately!!</li>
            <li> The subscribe and save makes it a great deal on a large bottle</li>
            <li> A huge relief!</li>
            <li> I mostly get eczema on my knees and elbows, so this regimen works well for me.</li>
            <li> My eczema got better.</li>
            <li> I needed something that was safe to use all over...</li>
            <li> I decided to do some internet research to find a better solution and came across the National Eczema Associate site regarding Infants and Toddlers.</li>
            <li> but if I apply this every day the problem is mostly gone.</li>
            <li> I have done a lot research and tried so many products, and none of them worked until Aveeno Eczema cream.  </li>
            <li> so I tried it and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> I will be using Aveeno from now on :)</li>
            <li> My mom suggested using this and after one application, I was better.  </li>
            <li> Also did not leave a greasy feel as so many others do.</li>
            <li> I received Cetaphil Restoraderm today and hope it will be better than this product.</li>
            <li> do your homework to make sure a subscription pays for you).  </li>
            <li> and I had no reaction, so I am confident that ingredients must not be too harmful.</li>
            <li> Works excellent against Eczema related issues.</li>
            <li> I love this cream and wish I had discovered it years ago.  </li>
            <li> Every winter for many years I get eczema on the shins of both my legs.  </li>
            <li> My sons skin got better in 3 days.</li>
            <li> The more I used it the more softer it got.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many lotions and potions and attempts to get it</li>
            <li> I love this cream, it works and it is odorless.</li>
            <li> So while some people may be allergic to the oats, apparently many find it helpful.</li>
            <li> they were okay</li>
            <li> I love Aveeno for skin problems.  </li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> I put it on immediately after getting out of the shower and put Cetaphil moisturizing lotion on top of it.</li>
            <li> Although those work somewhat, this stuff works much much better.</li>
            <li> have to switch to a milder hand soap, or wear disposable gloves more</li>
            <li> This eczema treatment has made my eczema even better.  </li>
            <li> Love this lotion</li>
            <li> I found it worked better than RX cortisone cream, and it&#x27;s safer to use through the winter.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to go to a dermatologist because I was always able to hide it.</li>
            <li> For many years, I have struggled with eczema.  </li>
            <li> and after i tried this product everything went much better.</li>
            <li> so I am very happy that i found this cream especially now during my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> This cream you can use as many times.</li>
            <li> After using the product liberally for a week I&#x27;ve found that this lotion irritates my skin more than anything else.</li>
            <li> This works like magic.</li>
            <li> I sure hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t recommend it more.</li>
            <li> I love this cream and so does my baby.</li>
            <li> and I already seem to know more about it then these people leaving reviews.</li>
            <li> Sure fire way to figure it out take an oatmeal bath and see what happens</li>
            <li> My skin immediately felt better.</li>
            <li> Once I started applying the steroid cream at night and the Aveeno lotion in the morning, the results have been much more pronounced.    </li>
            <li> As for more severe, I would recommend using it in conjunction with a steroid cream.</li>
            <li> I have eczema that is naturally more irritable in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I love this cream</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s changed my life for the better.</li>
            <li> and my doctor recommended that I put on non-perfumed hand cream many times a day.</li>
            <li> The product solved my itching skin immediately and was able to reduce the redness.</li>
            <li> the pediatrician gave us the okay to use it.  </li>
            <li> I like the 24 hour aveeno lotion better than this lotion.  </li>
            <li> This lotion burns more in deeper cracked skin.  </li>
            <li> This stuff did not help my eczema person but as a regular lotion, it&#x27;s GREAT!</li>
            <li> I love it, simply love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> But the Aveeno Eczema cream has made my kids&#x27; skin SO smooth!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had doctor prescribed creams, but I think the Aveeno works better for me.</li>
            <li> The most problematic area are his cheeks because the dryness causes him to itch his face to the point of drawing blood.</li>
            <li> I have now been using it for 5 days and my face looks better than it has in years.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that this product is not at all greasy and that it&#x27;s unscented.</li>
            <li> My son has also been prescribed medicated cream for his skin, but most of the time we don&#x27;t need to use it because the Aveeno cream alone is sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will keep using it to see if it keeps getting better.</li>
            <li> I assume more healing could take place if I applied it more often during the day.</li>
            <li> she uses it on her 2-year-old daughter--and was rather pleased with it.</li>
            <li> And deffantly buying some more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from severe eczema for many years, all over my body including most of my face, and this cream has changed everything.</li>
            <li> Could not do better.</li>
            <li> Wil most definetely recommand it to people with eczema.</li>
            <li> we have struggled with so many products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really love this cream and hope it continues to do what its been doing for me.</li>
            <li> It was begging me to scratch it, but I resisted most of the time.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many many creams, lotions over the counter and prescription ones.</li>
            <li> its the only one he uses and it works the best.</li>
            <li> It was ok not what I wanted it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it does a better job, but it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> more so than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand that the shops aren&#x27;t filled with this ointment in the Netherlands!</li>
            <li> Price online is much better than store prices.</li>
            <li> makes it even more affordable.</li>
            <li> This lotion has more moisture to it</li>
            <li> Works better than those with hydrocortisone in my opinion too.</li>
            <li> I love this product and can buy it cheaper hear than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> After 12 hours of using them, my face was much better, and after 3 days I could not even see the eczema on my face.</li>
            <li> I will still get my skin tests for allergy, but I will continue using them until I feel safe to stop.</li>
            <li> A bonus is that my acne even gets better.</li>
            <li> so I thought for sure this would be a product that worked.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The best you can do is to avoid over washing the area, moisturize as much as possible and be patient...</li>
            <li> My favorite.</li>
            <li> I can safely say Aveeno has wonme over.</li>
            <li> IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE OF PARABENS. :)</li>
            <li> (-4F) which made my face more upset with me.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t work for everyone, just like Cerave doesn&#x27;t work for me but works with many others.  </li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> they just prescribed MORE steroid and antibiotic creams and allergy medicine..</li>
            <li> I initially used this lotion based upon a friends suggestion and was really impressed then decided to buy it for myself.</li>
            <li> So now we use the Aveeno Baby Cleansing Wash and follow with this moisturizing cream and Aquaphor (to give a thicker top coat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started using this product and in days her skin was so much better.</li>
            <li> kinda smells like..:)</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I love how moisturizing this lotion is</li>
            <li> I used it in conjunction with MG271 and found the Aveeno to smell better and was easier to use, not to mention doesn’t stain clothes.</li>
            <li> 5/5 stars, one of the better treatments I’ve used for eczema</li>
            <li> Safe the trip to the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I just make sure to rinse the skin with water when it gets too itchy and reapply.</li>
            <li> It keeps the skin moisturized better than lotions.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use it after bathing your child and 1 or 2 more times throughout the day for maximum benefit.</li>
            <li> So glad I did.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Love this....</li>
            <li> It also smells better than its competition eczema lotion.</li>
            <li> and I have tried so many things from Aquaphor, Vaseline, aloe vera gel, coconut oil, cetaphil and many more.</li>
            <li> One Cause, Many Ailments: Leaky Gut Syndrome&lt;</li>
            <li> Works very well and even great on face during the winter season.</li>
            <li> This product is SAFE and it is accepted by National Eczema Association.  </li>
            <li> However, his hands were noticeably better by the morning.</li>
            <li> The eczema is gone now, and because my skin looks better than ever, I&#x27;m continuing to use this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> so maybe if you used it as soon as the eczema started appearing maybe it would help more.</li>
            <li> I have been using Aveeno Eczema more than 4 years.</li>
            <li> when I received ,it was open,cannot sure been used by someone</li>
            <li> The eucerin worked ok for a while but was too greasy and made my skin redder.</li>
            <li> It did feel better afterward, though.</li>
            <li> He said it made his skin feel on fire and Vaseline seemed to work better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better results with O&#x27;Keefes.</li>
            <li> Of the dozen creams/ointments I have tried, this cream helps the most with itch relief and healing.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, even if you don&#x27;t have eczema</li>
            <li> I love this product for my eczema.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad this came along</li>
            <li> The redness is all gone, his skin is not flaking and looks to have more moisture too it.</li>
            <li> My sister loves this stuff and so do I for helping him feel better :)</li>
            <li> I love Aveeno products.</li>
            <li> This cream works as a lotion would, nothing more from what I can tell.</li>
            <li> , nice and light and creamy.</li>
            <li> but sure it</li>
            <li> product is a nice, light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Notably, during a flare up, this cream did not provide any relief, the itching was unbearable.</li>
            <li> She said to find out what is causing my skin flare and to stop touching it.  </li>
            <li> Very happy that companies are finally tailoring lotion to be more eczema</li>
            <li> Touching fabric used to be a nightmare, my skin would catch on everything, and I lost my finger prints for a while.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, this is possibly the best lotion I have ever used, even better than some of the prescribed lotions I have used.</li>
            <li> So glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I am sure it works on many babies, but please make sure save your receipt just in case.</li>
            <li> I started using this product every couple of hours and the eczema got much better over the course of about a week.  </li>
            <li> Very happy with thi product and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li> Love this for my daughter who had eczema as a newborn</li>
            <li> Have not tried another product, or have nothing to compare it with, or know if another product works better.  </li>
            <li> It even worked better than my prescribed cream.</li>
            <li> He is pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I just love that after I apply this to my hands, they look and feel moisturized.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They still have breakouts that are triggered mostly by heat or stress, but this lotion helps keep the breakouts to a minimum</li>
            <li> I found it ONE TIME in the grocery store and have not been able to find it ANYWHERE since.</li>
            <li> tried this in a lark just hoping for a wee bit of relief and in two treatments my life was so much better.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from eczema for many years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands and types of lotions: Vaseline, Curel, St. Ives, Goldbond, Burt&#x27;s Bees, the list goes on.</li>
            <li> I thought it would work like a charm however it created even more problems</li>
            <li> We use Cerave now and it works better.</li>
            <li> Love the Aveeno line of products</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love how it makes her skin feels and it stops the itching.</li>
            <li> This is a very effective cream that has really helped my hands a lot.</li>
            <li> absorbs quickly, heals skin, pleasant feel and fragrance free.</li>
            <li> My daughter is three years old now, and with this lotion and good habits we&#x27;ve kept her eczema under control ever since!</li>
            <li> Nice one.. works well and pretty effective..</li>
            <li> Recommend buying this, I feel pretty good, although the baby face still have eczema, but much better than before the</li>
            <li> This item is good when you first start using it.</li>
            <li> this product is pretty good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> For the first time to use this product feels good, as for the effect need to continue to observe......</li>
            <li> Pretty good, and no smell.</li>
            <li> I am finding this an effective emollient and one more of Aveeno&#x27;s products that are useful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve come to truly enjoy Aveeno products and was happy to find this and come to the conclusion that it really does what I&#x27;d need it to - moisturize and help with eczema.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me it was &amp;#34;dermatitis,&amp;#34; wasn&#x27;t sure of the cause and gave me a strong steroid cream.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream to use for dry shin.</li>
            <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve found for my dry skin, and my sons.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful protector of dry skin.</li>
            <li> Best thing ever for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love it most because in comparison to what we were using on our daughter for her itching, this product is cheap and works just as well.  </li>
            <li> far, I am most happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Firstly, packaging was great and shipping was quick.  </li>
            <li> My elbows get very dry and scaly in the winter and this is the perfect remedy.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer for my (very) dry skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this off of Amazon, and was in love from the very first application!</li>
            <li> I also love that it&#x27;s fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Within 6 hours of using this my hands are completely healed and feel great.  </li>
            <li> Since my skin stays soft the itching has diminished greatly.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this product, as I must have tried almost every lotion commonly available at supermarkets and drugstores (in the US).</li>
            <li> its very soothing and smells good.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a good gentle moisturizer for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend using this on palms or soles, but it&#x27;s been good elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I love that this helps soothe and calm my daughters skin before bed!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I will recommend to other moms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other OTC products (including the neosporin eczema moisturizing cream) and this is the best.</li>
            <li> Perfect for Eczema or people with skin allergy or other conditions.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and does not feel sticky.    </li>
            <li> I have never been diagnosed because mine is very mild.</li>
            <li> soothing and healing my skin very quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cream but easy to absorb from skin.</li>
            <li> The absolute best thing Ive found so far.</li>
            <li> I like lotions that smell good, but the lack of smell is great for everyday use.</li>
            <li> It does a nice job of covering and staying on her hot spots without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I tried this cream first and liked it.</li>
            <li> This lotion is perfect for those who suffer from super dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This, hands down, is the best lotion for eczema!</li>
            <li> It was the first time in many days that I was actually able to forget about the rashes and had no discomfort.</li>
            <li> We tried this product to help my son with his eczema and it helped tremendously!  </li>
            <li> We have tried many products for my son&#x27;s (age 2) full-body mild eczema.</li>
            <li> However, I would gladly recommend this cream for anyone with dry hands, feet and elbows - it would be a great preventative lotion for those areas in the wintertime.</li>
            <li> Nice to find in large size and cheaper than grocery store.</li>
            <li> I had some issues with contact dermatitis, tried so many different ointments, and this by far is the best, great improvement just after a few applications, high recommend, it is a great over all lotion for aged skin, the best.</li>
            <li> I saw a huge difference within minutes of using it.  </li>
            <li> I went to the GP and they prescribed me a huge tub of Hydromol.</li>
            <li> Being 7 pound per tube, I am not looking forward to shelling out huge amounts of money for this cream.</li>
            <li> This product has made a huge impact in my life.</li>
            <li> The lotion is light and does not smell.  </li>
            <li> The itching stopped, and my skin is now smooth just as before.</li>
            <li> As for the price tag, being able to decrease the use of prescription steroid cream is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This cream is steroid free and fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> Also, I like that this cream is steroid free; would purchase again.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s available on the product page) and that this lotion is free of parabens.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and is not greasy or oily.  </li>
            <li> Works as well as the over the counter steroid creams and with this being steroid free cream</li>
            <li> if it is in fact an allergic reaction however I do eat oats in my diet (almost daily)  and his skin has been great until today.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with the attitude of \\&quot;it can&#x27;t hurt\\&quot;, and honestly, I didn&#x27;t expect much from it.</li>
            <li> not too oily but also leaves my skin rather smooth.</li>
            <li> My arms are smooth again</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cream rubs in smoothly, has no odor, and absorbs in about 3-5 min.</li>
            <li> Retains moisture, keeps skin smooth and no itching.  </li>
            <li> the important thing any one  should realize is that with one application eczema won&#x27;t disappear .</li>
            <li> It is non-greasy and quickly is absorbed, so it does not interfere with my being able to use my hands typing at work.</li>
            <li> and the face still stays smooth.</li>
            <li> We got a free sample of this at dr office.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m looking for a cream that has this as an ingredient (to anyone else who has experienced the same problems as I have).  </li>
            <li> This is a great price at Amazon especially with Subscribe and save and amazon mom..</li>
            <li> He liked this one the best, however, it doesn&#x27;t come in a big enough size, so we get the Curel Itch Defense instead.</li>
            <li> I had to wash my clothes practically every day!), so with that in mind I looked around and found Aveeno&#x27;s paraben free products.</li>
            <li> &quot; smell either, which is fabulous.</li>
            <li> I finally figured out that it was eyelid eczema and after reading the great reviews on this product</li>
            <li> My baby has eczema free skin.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> This is a total win, y&#x27;all.</li>
            <li> Important points:&lt;br /&gt;-good moisture retainment&lt;</li>
            <li> Sometimes when playing he&#x27;ll stop what he&#x27;s doing and start scratching lightly seemingly out of curiosity.</li>
            <li> but since this product it makes her smooth and no itching I am baying the second&lt;br /&gt; one...</li>
            <li> My ears were smooth about 5 minutes after applying it.</li>
            <li> Light and not too greasy...</li>
            <li> and it is really light.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin hydrated and looking smooth.  </li>
            <li> However, this works great as a regular body lotion.</li>
            <li> and it works great though I worry about the daily cortisone exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keeps skin smooth and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I have found nothing else better that works to calm my eczema flare-ups.</li>
            <li> Even though I am cheap, my skin is the largest organ I have</li>
            <li> Fabulous.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t extremely comfortable applying steroid cream to my eyelids and face, so I tried this out, and it has truly helped me out.</li>
            <li> Having it available from Amazon is a plus.</li>
            <li> It had such great reviews online</li>
            <li> In fact, my husband commented on how sleek and smooth my legs felt.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice product, but it is very sticky.</li>
            <li> It really works and is better than most brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> She really likes the Aveeno products and find they help her better than most others.</li>
            <li> Aveeno eczema, its a fantastic product, I love it, and my baby skin is so much better,,  thanks aveeno</li>
            <li> Very useful for skin</li>
            <li> This is not greasy and has only a very mild and pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I try to be light handed because its rich.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve began to have issues with cracking on my hands &amp; this lotions is perfect because it applies greasy which really soothes my dry skin, and it drys within minutes and creates a great barrier for further irritation.</li>
            <li> but I never noticed a significant improvement on his skin.</li>
            <li> Ordered two and will order two more, since I&#x27;m almost finishing the first one.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the $$$!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad the first she used was the Ultra Calming cream because it&#x27;s helping me out a lot.</li>
            <li> He doesnt itch anymore and rarely has outbreaks!</li>
            <li> I applied it many times a day for the first couple of days</li>
            <li> I made sure I put this after I washed my hands and noticed my moisture levels we getting higher.</li>
            <li> I love the quality of the product and it is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I read the customer reviews and they seemed pretty convincing but turns out it didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> She shared it with a coworker who has eczema on her hands, and said coworker snuck back to keep using it until we got her her own tube!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased both of these products, and they&#x27;re much cheaper than what I had been using!</li>
            <li> After 2 years of trying on my child&#x27;s feet every cream I had been suggested,its the first time within 2 weeks use that we have smooth skin!My daughter is amazed!!!Thanks!</li>
            <li> but so far I am very very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> worth the price!</li>
            <li> works great on eczema and dry skin...</li>
            <li> /&gt;After searching the net, I found Aveeno Eczema therapy moisturizing cream was the most effective.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Works great for dry hands.</li>
            <li> I do not have eczema, but this product is great for anyone who either washes their hands a lot (i.e.l food industry) or lives in a climate with dry air.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great relief for itchy, dry skin.</li>
            <li> Aveeno Eczema is GREAT for rashes as well as dry skin.  </li>
            <li> We have tried several creams and the is by far the best one.</li>
            <li> The only best moisturizer out in market that controls my 2 year old son&#x27;s eczema since his birth till now.</li>
            <li> I was putting on a ton of other products religiously - Honest Company lotion, Honest Co. organic healing balm, Aquafor.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think this stuff smells like anything special</li>
            <li> I think you could&#x27;ve gotten more of the cream into that large dispenser.</li>
            <li> This is really smart of this manufacturer, why don&#x27;t they add some sugar on top for the fungus to have a feast, too?</li>
            <li> nothing special.</li>
            <li> Great for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have a very dry skin and there is no moisturizer that give me this great result, it makes my skin like the baby skin and keep the skin moisturized 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Mainly used on elbows and feet but guess it&#x27;s good for whole body use.</li>
            <li> The ones carefully formulated without fragrance are especially important to those of us who are allergic to fragrances, estimated to be a quarter of the population.</li>
            <li> I have same experience as others who experienced a burning sensation upon application, but I endured it the first day, thinking my skin had to adjust.</li>
            <li> so i can just hop in after work and cool off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She applies the moisturizing cream about 4 times a day and sleeps with a cool mist humidifier at night to keep the air moist.  </li>
            <li> We gave it some  time to see if it might clear up on its own</li>
            <li> Aveeno never stung and felt light after it was absorbed.</li>
            <li> Hello short sleeves good</li>
            <li> Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream is my absolute favorite product for my hands and feet to treat my Eczema.</li>
            <li> This is a nice lotion for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> so when you put it on, it&#x27;s cool and silky, like you&#x27;re just putting water on your face.</li>
            <li> They are good at suppressing local inflammation which is the cause of eczema.</li>
            <li> Many experts claim that topical administration is innocent but I never feel comfortable so those are out of consideration for me.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using it on a regular basis, I do not have to use my prescription cream at all....which is good.</li>
            <li> nice on sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> After using this product continuously for two weeks (morning and night) - make sure you wash your face with Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser - before you apply the Aveeno .  </li>
            <li> Works good when I don&#x27;t want the smell or the grease from my regular psoriasis salve.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed even though there were a number of negative reviews, as well.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I did since it really is clearing up</li>
            <li> my skin felt nice and soft upon application.</li>
            <li> What do you really have to lose at this point, since we wouldn&#x27;t be on here if nothing else has worked :-)</li>
            <li> Use it on damp, cool skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a good number at all different prices, staying with this one going forward.</li>
            <li> Also its not bad for you as cortisone products ...</li>
            <li> and my doctor wasn&#x27;t available to see me right away.</li>
            <li> The lotion is a bit too sticky for people with normal skin, but may be good for once-in-a-while application, particularly in winter.</li>
            <li> Amazingly it will calm the symptoms in couple of days and make your skin soft.</li>
            <li> I seriously consider this one of the best buys I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> It goes thru quickly though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this for atopic eczema sufferers, but if you have mild eczema it may work.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a scent, and it&#x27;s mildly oily.  </li>
            <li> I have to apply it twice a day, though, so it is quickly disappearing.  </li>
            <li> The itching abated quickly and now the redness is rapidly lightening.</li>
            <li> I was surprised so many tubes were available on the shelf..</li>
            <li> and it has made a tremendous difference.</li>
            <li> It felt soothed and refreshed, quickly fading away after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Sure  enough, within about 3 days the spots were noticeably better.</li>
            <li> My son has mild eczema on his cheeks, chin, arms and legs.</li>
            <li> When I say mild</li>
            <li> Of course it doesn&#x27;t clear it up completely like a medicated ointment would, it does a great job.</li>
            <li> Quick background of my eczema and what I&#x27;ve tried to do in order to help with relief.</li>
            <li> This works super</li>
            <li> This cream cleared up my Grandson&#x27;s eczema quickly.</li>
            <li> Caused a mild rash, stopped using</li>
            <li> It is mild lotion, and I found that I needed hydrocortisone cream as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My daughter age 2 has mild form of eczema since birth.</li>
            <li> Both of my children have had mild eczema.  </li>
            <li> My baby girl has mild seborrheic dermatitis around her neck.  </li>
            <li> My son has always had mild eczema, since birth.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy and absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> So I went to the dermatologist and found out that I had a mild case of eczema.  </li>
            <li> Super sticky.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist thought it might be mild eczema, and gave me a steroid cream.</li>
            <li> After taking my son to the doctor, she diagnosed a mild case of baby eczema.</li>
            <li> goes in to skin quickly.</li>
            <li> She gave me a mild ointment to use to ease the itch.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost 4 years on him now and it clears up his eczema so quick.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s super soothing.</li>
            <li> I get a mild case of eczema flare-up every now and</li>
            <li> I used this as well as Avenno %1 hydrocortisone anti itch cream on his face that was super chapped and irritated.</li>
            <li> (she had mild eczema as a toddler) and decided it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try it.</li>
            <li> I normally have pretty nice skin.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to apply, the texture is nice and a little sweet</li>
            <li> I love Aveeno products, and based on the reviews here, had high hopes for the Eczema Therapy</li>
            <li> and I love and highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Pretty pleasant overall.</li>
            <li> From the first time I used it I saw a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> This is probably better than normal lotions (does make the skin on my hand ofter), but doesn&#x27;t relieve the itching.</li>
            <li> I guess you could switch back to your regular lotion (I like Lubriderm and St Ives which are much more affordable and work great).</li>
            <li> I have EXTREME eczema problems and this was the BEST BY FAR cream I ever used.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s nice that some people apparently have their eczema cured by this stuff.</li>
            <li> This product is a first product where I can say that I will be comfortable leaving my house without prescription cream.</li>
            <li> I have got some success with those despite not having achieved a full recovery yet...</li>
            <li> I have got some success with those despite not having achieved a full recovery yet...</li>
            <li> He uses this regularly and the eczema has not returned, very satisfied, HIGHLY recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Most lists I came across mentioned the Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturising Cream as the best out there, especially with its natural ingredients such as oatmeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
            <li> new spots and his skin in actually smooth!</li>
            <li> I started getting signs of Eczema in new areas and it worried me, so along with recommendations from my dermatologist, I researched and found this as a solution that worked for many online.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, but definitely not a substitute for prescriptions for eczema.</li>
            <li> the price, this stuff was totally worth it, and is a tremendous help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> good for moisturizing eczema dry skin, but did not eleviate symptoms.</li>
            <li> Good for moisturizing eczema dry skin, but did not elevate symptoms.</li>
            <li> This is gentle, easy to apply, and doesn&#x27;t have an overbearing scent.</li>
            <li> She also told me to use a good lotion of my hands since she noticed that they were a bit dry.  </li>
            <li> Really good for dry skin and eczema.  </li>
            <li> The cream absorbs really well and smells a bit like oatmeal but the smell disappears very quickly.</li>
            <li> If you are considering purchasing this lotion from Amazon, be aware that the product may have been tampered with!</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommended!!!</li>
            <li> According to their evaluation this item gets 2/10 ( lower the better) and is considered to be pretty safe for human use.</li>
            <li> I intend to switch at some point to a much more natural alternative, but for now it is doing the jobbeautifully!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always heard Aveeno did great things for people with dry skin, but this really does seem like a miracle cream.  </li>
            <li> Great product and really helps with dry skin.</li>
            <li> It has a very creamy,  smooth, non greasy texture that absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> We love this lotion to help control my 3.5 year old&#x27;s mild eczema.</li>
            <li> My skin would get so dry in the winter time they were constantly cracking and bleeding but this worked perfect and my problem is gone.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my daughter who has sensitive skin and mild eczema.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for dry winter skin, especially hands.  </li>
            <li> The cream worked fine for a while, but I didn&#x27;t like to use it too much because of the side effects it could have.</li>
            <li> Good stuff for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;HOWEVER, what I was -really- looking for was a Paraben free cream (not an greasy ointment like Vaseline OR Hydromol.</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing and a total life saver for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Cera-ve with some success.</li>
            <li> So I checked the ingredients on the back of the label, and nothing spectacular.  </li>
            <li> It is far cheaper for me to buy one bottle of the Aveeno than the four or five bottles of another kind that really wasn&#x27;t working well.</li>
            <li> I have some kind of eczema reaction from using dish soaps on the back of my hands.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion after reading reviews of several eczema lotions - this one seemed effective and affordable.</li>
            <li> This cream is quite similar to Neutrogena Norwegian Formula, Intense Moisture Wrap, which is also excellent.  </li>
            <li> Baking soda will leave your kids skin hydrated and fresh.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s eczema started when she was 3 months old, and covered most of her body.  </li>
            <li> We use the baby formula on our 4-year old for 3 years and it works great, now we are using the regular Aveeno eczema cream</li>
            <li> Apply that once a day, wait until it&#x27;s absorbed into the skin and then put clothes on.</li>
            <li> Considering how pricey it is, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> and I guess offers a bit more protection.</li>
            <li> was recently thrilled however, to find a different use-</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price, plus having it on subscription with Amazon</li>
            <li> We started doing luke warm baths daily and applying this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny I paid; I just wish this cream was around 3 years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a particularly big earner and at this rate I would have to spend 70 quid a month to keep my skin smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> , I decided it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li> Worth the money, and Amazon has one of the cheapest prices I can find online.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the $11</li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying if nothing else is working for you.</li>
            <li> I have to say totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for my 2 year old.</li>
            <li> dermatologist mentioned ceramides as a useful ingredient but for another product that didn&#x27;t work that well for him.</li>
            <li> Love this cream, it leaves skin so soft and not greasy.  </li>
            <li> it is worth the money</li>
            <li> I think there are better options for an adult.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It will give you a fresh start at life, its all about what you eat that brings forth</li>
            <li> the product was useful and did serve our expectations.</li>
            <li> Bought some cheap Suave lotion in the grocery store last night and already my skin feels a lot better, my cloths aren&#x27;t sticking to my body, and I don&#x27;t feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth a try</li>
            <li> I woke up one morning and there was a distinct, different kind of rash I had on my pinky finger.  </li>
            <li> I wish I remembered when I started using this to track my progress, but it was definitely not overnight for me, which shows you what kind of dermatitis</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth every cent.</li>
            <li> My wife and I use subscriptions for toilet paper, paper towels and diapers and save more than even Sam&#x27;s Club bulk prices on many things (diapers are much cheaper, but Zip Locs are cheaper at Sam&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> This stuff works way better than most other hand creams.</li>
            <li> Absorbs pretty quickly and doesn&#x27;t make you feel greasy for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> Well surprise, surprise - 72 hours after using it for the first time, my skin felt great, the scales were gone and the marks on the back of my hands started to clear up.  </li>
            <li> This lotion doesn&#x27;t help major flare-ups, only prescription or  anti-itch cream work for us, but it does do a great job of preventing flare-ups.</li>
            <li> I have used this reliably and find it a good alternative to other vendors/ solutions.  </li>
            <li> I have had it over a month now and bought it mostly due to the good reviews in amazon.</li>
            <li> When you have eczema, you search high and low for a good lotion to provide relief for your skin.</li>
            <li> It is a tad bit oily, but I put on leggings right after applying</li>
            <li> And it clears it right up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unscented and is just the right level of moisturizing . . .</li>
            <li> This year, the rash reappeared and spread across my right hand.</li>
            <li> or so I had noticed the skin on the inside of two fingers on my right hand</li>
            <li> I use it right after giving him a bath with the Aveeno eczema soothing bath treatment.  </li>
            <li> It clears it right up and keeps it away.</li>
            <li> This cream is just right</li>
            <li> This morning the product arrived, right away I applied the cream to his face after cleansing.</li>
            <li> Whenever he starts itching he goes right to the Aveeno and ask me to put it on.</li>
            <li> This product is good, but I am going to try Cetaphil upon my doctors recommendation, because one bottle has more than twice as much lotion, and I can get a two-pack at Costco for only a few more dollars than one tube of this.  </li>
            <li> Even my husband has been impressed with the dramatic improvements since he has been so used to seeing me look like I partake in rubbing sandpaper on my chin.  </li>
            <li> Non-greasy, no perfume or dye, very mild oatmeal scent, leaves the skin very soft and calms irritations.</li>
            <li> Try it, it is at least good in the short term, hoping things get better and better.</li>
            <li> , it has another primary product in it and is much less effective.</li>
            <li> I have been plagued by two extremely dry, incredibly itchy, red and peeling patches of skin for over two years.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer is great for people with dry and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I tried coconut oil which I applied many times a day, a homemade shea butter recipe, a homemade aloe vera/shea butter lotion (which cause her skin to become super red where I applied it), lanolin and tried blending up some oatmeal for her bath.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how well it would work for severe eczema, but it&#x27;s been great for me</li>
            <li> I wash my foot in cool water with a gentle cleanser like CeraVe, then slather Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream all over, and then seal with a cotton sock.</li>
            <li> its gentle on the skin and true to what it says it reduces itching.</li>
            <li> Amazon has many times better offers for this product than local stores in my area.</li>
            <li> have what I would called mild eczema, with certain areas affect.</li>
            <li> The person who used it claims good results in easing down the eczema effects</li>
            <li> It also worked incredibly well on my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s hands that were a little chapped.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first year was full of trials and errors, but we have finally found a combination of skin care products that work best for my son&#x27;s delicate skin that we now cannot live without:  California Baby Shampoo &amp; Body Wash for super sensitive skin, the Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream and good old Vasaline.</li>
            <li> A few patches on his face were the most notable.  </li>
            <li> It does an excellent job of keeping my skin moisturized, and even after only a few days of use, the peeling has stopped.  </li>
            <li> Love it, really helps my 11m old&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li> It was incredibly itchy, painful in warm water</li>
            <li> so we have since switched to a more natural lotion that is very moisturizing as well.</li>
            <li> It really worked for me and is totally natural and safe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just hoping this effect will last, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> It is also nice in the winter for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Nice for dry skin too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews (and this product is very well reviewed), but this lotion is worth another nod as it has found a solution for a major problem.  </li>
            <li> The ONLY medicine that would help my infant with dry eczema and the price is better than most stores!</li>
            <li> the redness has reduced very much and it seems like I am healing.</li>
            <li> Its also very gentle as I use it on my face too</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin moisturized throughout the day and is free of the medicinal smell most other creams have.</li>
            <li> This is OK but seems less effective than Wild Naturals Eczema and Psoriasis Cream with Manuka, etc.</li>
            <li> Now my younger has a big deal of eczema especially prominent in her right hand fourth finger area.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son who has suffered with very mild patches of eczema on his torso, I just put it on after his bath and it keeps it smooth and gets rid of the dry patches.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re suffering from itchy dry skin, give this a try - $10 isn&#x27;t that much when it comes to feeling (and looking) better!</li>
            <li> since I forgot her steroid cream at home) and after only one use I saw a huge difference!</li>
            <li> Pretty picey product but works.</li>
            <li> What I love about this product is not only</li>
            <li> I treated my skin problem with hot water compress three times a day for 30 mins.</li>
            <li> (mine effects only the top of my hands wrists to finger tips, not the bottom).  </li>
            <li> She had that issue since born, but was ok the winter before last spring.</li>
            <li> It was alright for by hands but very unsuitable for my face!</li>
            <li> The bottle says it&#x27;s safe enough for a baby, and I believe it.  </li>
            <li> Love it and definitely recommend a try!!!</li>
            <li> He gave a steroid cream which I did not want to try as the first remedy.</li>
            <li> I could tell how much better he felt as soon as I rubbed it on to his back and hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then it&#x27;s all better by the next day.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> We tested about 5 different creams, and this has helped most (we apply twice a day) -</li>
            <li> we tried many different creams and lotions</li>
            <li> My eczema has not only disappeared, my skin feels healthy for the first time in years.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use it after washing my hands (which I do constantly) but it would be even better to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not big on the oatmeal kinda smell, but it&#x27;s almost scentless and after a couple uses I was ok with it.</li>
            <li> I have used Amazon several times and am usually pleased with the products and service.  </li>
            <li> but I was willing to try anything...</li>
            <li> I bought this product when I saw it on my most recent shopping trip and immediately bought it.  </li>
            <li> I tried so many different lotions and creams, nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I finally gave this product a try!</li>
            <li> I would use aquaphor to help heal and soothe his wounds but never thought there was anything I could do to prevent him from itching in the first place.</li>
            <li> It was soft, silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> haha!  </li>
            <li> By the next day (using twice more), the flaky skin and itching was also gone.</li>
            <li> My son suffered from eczema when he was first born.  </li>
            <li> He saw relief from the first time he used it.  </li>
            <li> Those two products work pretty well for my resistant eczema.</li>
            <li> Ive had to deal with eczema since my first flare up when i was 10.</li>
            <li> This really helps calm my skin and keep it moisturized.</li>
            <li> It had to be applied every hour for the first couple of days or the skin started flaking off.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well!&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> , I just hope it&#x27;s not a fake or</li>
            <li> Exactly as ordered.</li>
            <li> I use this daily more as a preventative than a cure.  </li>
            <li> They also scheduled an appointment for me to get skin tests to find out exactly what i am allergic too.</li>
            <li> Within days it was better and within three weeks entirely disappeared.</li>
            <li> I at first used the product three times a day, once in the morning, once after work, and</li>
            <li> I have been to countless dermatologists  over the years and have had more prescriptions than you can fathom.</li>
            <li> it is very soothing and helped improve her condition!</li>
            <li> I first bought it at target for 12.99 to try it out and really glad I checked on Amazon before I bought the second bottle.  </li>
            <li> Highly Recommend!!</li>
            <li> I went to the clinic and the doctor put me on an extensive course of steroids and it got better.</li>
            <li> ;-)  </li>
            <li> This is what pediatricians agree too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second best treatment is unfortunately steroids.</li>
            <li> Therefore, despite not believing the magical therapeutic potential, I still decided to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would try to avoid scratching by running the areas under hot water, but sometimes the itching was unbearable.  </li>
            <li> It really keeps my skin moisturized and soothes itching!</li>
            <li> I am ready to rave about this product!</li>
            <li> When I first used it, I was putting it on 4-5 times a day.</li>
            <li> I went out and bought Cerave moisturiser and at first it was...</li>
            <li> I have been using various creams for many years for bothersome itch,cracking caused by eczema.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First found this on a trip to Phoenix, AZ, the driest climate I have been in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lightweight but it does the job!</li>
            <li> Not too greasy but really hydrate my skin!</li>
            <li> Must use it consistently for desired results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s on my neck, and I&#x27;ve used many things to help heal it while going to multiple doctors&#x27; offices.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting better, but it&#x27;s a constant struggle.  </li>
            <li> better than our local WalMart.</li>
            <li> This summer she could wear shorts and dresses for the first time in 3 years.</li>
            <li> My son already looked slightly better the next day.</li>
            <li> Firstly; there was no sting whatsoever when applying the cream.</li>
            <li> Thanks Aveeno!</li>
            <li> Aveeno has many different products but none of the others works well for me.</li>
            <li> Ok so my ezcema problem just appeared back in Feb. 2013.</li>
            <li> Very moisture intensive!</li>
            <li> First time using.</li>
            <li> Aveeno for many things is terrific.  </li>
            <li> First of all, it absolutley breaks my heart to read the reviews where this product did not help.  </li>
            <li> Now that summer has arrived in Toronto, I had my first breakout of 2014.  </li>
            <li> those who care about chemicals/toxins know that this reads on the back \\&quot;safe for baby\\&quot;</li>
            <li> People constantly compliment me on my smooth skin!</li>
            <li> starts suthung, it works from the instant I put it on, truly a life saver for me,,, love this product .</li>
            <li> During the summer after my first year of college, I noticed that I had a habit of washing my hands too often during the day.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was just a rash</li>
            <li> Its main ingredient is water so it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Not only is my eczema better, my skin color is evening out.</li>
            <li> but my skin clearly tells me that it is a NO GO and to stop being cheap.</li>
            <li> I am glad we finally did.</li>
            <li> But when I run out, I will most likely purchase from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto</li>
            <li> I carefully removed the skin with a warm wash cloth and....</li>
            <li> It mostly flares up in the winter and we&#x27;ve tried many different things: cortisone cream, steroid cream, neospotine for eczema, cetaphil lotions/soap, acquaphor, Vaseline and the only thing that helps is the steroid cream, which you can&#x27;t use all the time.</li>
            <li> This is the first day I&#x27;ve used it on him</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s so much happier too!</li>
            <li> Once I put it on, my hands felt so much better almost instantly.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different and more expensive creams, and this has been the best in not only relieving but treating the breakouts.</li>
            <li> Once you put the cream on, your skin will feel sort of rubbery and feels funny for awhile.</li>
            <li> I see more improvement with this product in 12 hours than others in 12 days... will buy again if necessary.</li>
            <li> skin friendly product.i strongly recommend this product for dry skin treatment.no side effect.no burning after application.light smell with moisture.like it</li>
            <li> this cream is great, stops itching dry skin and gets rid of red spots.</li>
            <li> This cream is great for my daugher&#x27;s eczema, especially during the dry winter months.</li>
            <li> This is surprisingly effective, better than any other such product I&#x27;ve tried (non-prescription).  </li>
            <li> I read of the effects on prolong use of steroid creams so decided to look up a more natural route; we’ve tried coconut oil, olive oil, Aquaphor, Eucerin, Cetaphil, Vanicream, other Aveeno products and more.</li>
            <li> My eczema is always present but at certain times it just seems to aggrevate me more than others (hot and itchiness).  </li>
            <li> It is a very nice thick lotion, but I didn&#x27;t realize it was an oral medication my doctor had me on that took care of the eczema and not this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I will use it, but will have to look elsewhere for the amazing results that other reviewers describe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a huge fan of Aveeno, ever since my first was born because their products are so gentle and natural...</li>
            <li> I paid nearly $10 for it there, but it was worth it!</li>
            <li> In short, this stuff is amazing on mild to moderate eczema.  </li>
            <li> used with decent success for SEVERE eczema on my hands.</li>
            <li> Stopped itching immediately, flaking is getting better, worse section of psoriasis is getting better quickly also.</li>
            <li> I tried many different creams and this one really does soothe all day.</li>
            <li> I love this cream so much and will definitely keep using aveeno products.</li>
            <li> Well, very much to the contrary this cream really aggravated the hell out of my skin</li>
            <li> and it really doesn&#x27;t help very much.</li>
            <li> The itching stops nearly right away and the redness and rough skin are smoother and look better after just one application.</li>
            <li> and then I ordered this  based on the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I saw noticeable positive results within 3 days</li>
            <li> Saw positive results within 12hrs.</li>
            <li> Aveeno make great non-perfumed products and I found that this cream helps relieve the itch and prevent the cracking of the skin, where other non-perfumed hand creams did not provide the same relief.</li>
            <li> I have also tried other remedies on my own, which include Derm Essentials, Cetophil cream, Organic Virgin Coconut Oil (which really inflamed my skin), Dandruff shampoo, and Aquaphor.  </li>
            <li> First day of use, I noticed that it moisturized very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much Aveeno!</li>
            <li> this season is pretty much freezing.</li>
            <li> After trying other products, including regular Aveeno skin creams, I am really happy to find the Eczema Therapy cream.</li>
            <li> This product (in addition to Cetaphil &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34;) really helps to mitigate those affected areas.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and it doesn&#x27;t work as good as the aveeno baby eczema , im not sure</li>
            <li> but I have to say that I have been suffering for a good couple of months with eye eczema due to the humidity and my low immune system and this really was like a miracle!!</li>
            <li> No icky greasy film left on your skin, absorbs fast and the smell is very light.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, my skin gets back to normal again without steroids.</li>
            <li> Granted, I now have to have the cream with me at all times, but it&#x27;s certainly better than having dry, hands, cracked skin and cuts all over my hands at all times.  </li>
            <li> The Aveeno cream dispenses easily from the tube and it&#x27;s simple to control the amount you want.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very simply and easy to make</li>
            <li> Works well on our son&#x27;s super sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The tightness has totally gone now and there&#x27;s very mild</li>
            <li> My son , 1 year old, gets mild eczema flare ups every now and then, and using this lotion twice a day gets rid of it within a couple days.</li>
            <li> I am on some medication that gives me some incredibly dry skin and on top of that I have eczema in places.</li>
            <li> I tried many creams for dry skin and eczema on my arms.</li>
            <li> It used to pop up in small patches on my arms but in recent years it has progressed to large, ashy, cracking, incredibly itchy patches on my elbows and between my fingers.</li>
            <li> This Aveeno product works very well to stop the scratching and makes his skin feel moisturized, soft and smooth, and much more so than any other lotion we tried.</li>
            <li> and it certainly did not help prevent flare ups for my eczema.</li>
            <li> I do wish it came in a large pump bottle.</li>
            <li> This product certainly does leave a moist feeling; however, it leaves my skin a bit sticky.  </li>
            <li> Rarely itched but is almost completely gone after 3 days of keeping it moisturized with this stuff!</li>
            <li> Thought we would have to live with eczema and was very excited that after a few uses I saw tremendous improvement!</li>
            <li> It is fine as a regular moisturizer, but it didn&#x27;t do anything to help his neck - in fact</li>
            <li> I usually only need to use it once or twice every day or two, and my skin is fine.</li>
            <li> Body Wash. Feels great, very soothing feel and a mild scent that is actually reminiscent of oatmeal (least to me</li>
            <li> Very thick and creamy, great for coating your skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks God this product is available for international shipping.</li>
            <li> My dad recommended this cream (now I sound like a commercial) and there is no visible eczema at all on my legs!</li>
            <li> lotion is very moisturizing and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li> B002CML1XE La Roche-Posay Anthelios 60 Ultra Light Sunscreen Fluid for Face, 1.7-Ounce Bottle]]</li>
            <li> does it stop the itch fast</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to give her much medicine, and started to try this cream.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t helped me much.</li>
            <li> I thought there&#x27;s no way this stuff could really be doing anything.  </li>
            <li> This is the real deal</li>
            <li> and I think it is quite reasonably priced</li>
            <li> Also realised that my son was not itching as much as he was scratching his face so much before I used this product.    </li>
            <li> Available in 5oz and 7.3oz tubes only.  </li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t very creamy or oily -</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s very emollient.</li>
            <li> Thanks for nothing aveeno and lower</li>
            <li> So to really cure my hands</li>
            <li> Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Excellent company</li>
            <li> I have had eczema my whole life and no prescribed lotions have ever worked on me.  </li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for only a week now and have been eczema free for 5 days.</li>
            <li> You really should try it to see for yourself.</li>
            <li> I suffered with eczema whole my life</li>
            <li> This really helped my daughter&#x27;s eczema.  </li>
            <li> It works fast too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very suit my baby~</li>
            <li> We went to a doctor and to a dermatologist, and they both just readily prescribed steroid-based creams.  </li>
            <li> I found that it works very well for eczema.</li>
            <li> During the winter time, my skin gets very dy</li>
            <li> This has really helped our baby&#x27;s eczema.  </li>
            <li> This lotion absolutely SAVED my skin.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this lotion, I still use it every day and have been eczema free for three years now.</li>
            <li> When Eczema shows up on my skin I find this lotion to be very soothing and it stops any itching too.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for three or four days now, and I think it is really helping.  </li>
            <li> This seems to work really well on my elbows.  </li>
            <li> This one does not irritate him much and also heals his skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> My hands are smooth, don&#x27;t hurt or itch and the discoloration is finally starting to disappear.</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with Neutrogena&#x27;s Swedish hand cream on really stubborn eczema spots and the two together work like a miracle cure.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not seeing much healing but Aveeno seems to stay on the skin longer</li>
            <li> couldnt believe it wotked so fast also</li>
            <li> The reviews are real, it truly works.</li>
            <li> The smell is very &amp;#34;oatmeal like&amp;#34; so just be warned.</li>
            <li> I really wished this product worked for me, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It worked very well for him.</li>
            <li> He also gets skin infections from scratching the surface of his skin off (yikes, I know) and this cream really helped minimize those as well.</li>
            <li> i wanted to avoid steroids as much as i could.</li>
            <li> This cream has really helped...</li>
            <li> Very uncool.</li>
            <li> and it has really helped his outbreaks with eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I guess I will ask him if I really do have eczema.</li>
            <li> A gentle lotion for baby who&#x27;s suffering for eczema.</li>
            <li> Nothing we have tried before has really helped with the break outs</li>
            <li> I have had eczema my whole life and some products work, and some do not.</li>
            <li> She loves this lotion, and it really helps with redness/roughness/itching.</li>
            <li> Off all the things I&#x27;ve tried, this cream was the first one to bring relief and help my skin return to normal.</li>
            <li> Within 3 days, there was a very noticeable improvement and he stopped scratching his legs and arms on about day 2.</li>
            <li> This cream works really well.</li>
            <li> I was very upset that they decided to discontinue making this</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even know my facial skin had the ability to be so smooth.</li>
            <li> This cleared it up very quicky.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> SO I tried this Aveeno product, figuring I didn&#x27;t have much to lose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this sounded like a very soothing type of product.</li>
            <li> It does not have much of a scent which means you add whatever you want.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> After a weeks or two, my skin problem really got improved.</li>
            <li> but it wasnt much of a problem</li>
            <li> However, if chemicals are not of concern to you, then I highly recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Is a very usful cream for baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> This cream has really helped our family through the winter.  </li>
            <li> Much to my surprise, it worked well, and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about frequency as I use it as needed and as often as I want.</li>
            <li> Really helps keep skin moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> I have this on auto-ship as my whole family loves this moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> This cream is very soothing and healing.  </li>
            <li> It really does wonders for his skin.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t help my baby&#x27;s eczema much.</li>
            <li> It has really improved the looks and feel of my skin all over.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend to those with eczema!</li>
            <li> She loves it and it has really helped her discomfort.  </li>
            <li> the item shipped fast and works well for my skin.</li>
            <li> I apply it on her whole body twice every day</li>
            <li> and I coudl really feel the difference.</li>
            <li> Fast forward to Sept. 2013</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve really tried just about every lotion and cream out there.</li>
            <li> has a very silky feel.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely notice a difference in the softness of her skin.</li>
            <li> If you have a rash problem, I really recommend this product to try.  </li>
            <li> much relief</li>
            <li> The colloidal oatmeal is very soothing and it is not at all greasy...........just don&#x27;t over-do.</li>
            <li> This really seemed to help.</li>
            <li> Works very well keeps the redness off his face.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to apply their prescription medicated ointment very often.</li>
            <li> semi-cheap and non-prescription that finally really worked.</li>
            <li> If you are upset, going crazy, and feel you are never going to get through this eczema nightmare, BUY THIS RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> and she doesn&#x27;t scratch as much.  </li>
            <li> give it a shot because if it works for you, you will be so much happier.</li>
            <li> me tell you, this lotion really is like a miracle.</li>
            <li> None of this even touched it really.</li>
            <li> The auto-ship feature makes it very convenient.</li>
            <li> I kinda gave up and just accepted eczema as a part of my life and was looking for some lotion to relieve the intense dryness and pain</li>
            <li> We use this on our infant and toddler and it really helps prevents their eczema outbreaks.</li>
            <li> I like this product so much, I subscribed to it.</li>
            <li> I also bought the body wash and that really helps in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Feels very soothing.</li>
            <li> but I really didn&#x27;t know what to do anymore</li>
            <li> My only wish is that it was more naturally based but</li>
            <li> My son actually asks for it, now, and his daycare provider is thrilled since she no longer has to monitor him for constant scratching.</li>
            <li> After having had continuous eczema that wouldn&#x27;t clear up for 6 months, I started to look at my collection of moisturisers more critically.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was surprised to find this lotion smells decent, works rather quickly (two days), and isn&#x27;t quite as greasy as Cortizone 10.  </li>
            <li> I finally wound up making my own and that finally did the trick.</li>
            <li> I tried every single hand cream available, from cheap to fancy, and this aveeno product is the only one that really helped!</li>
            <li> I am glad (based on other reviews here)</li>
            <li> that so many other users have found relief using this product; perhaps my spot needs something stronger than OTC lotion.</li>
            <li> (ok maybe don&#x27;t go to that extreme</li>
            <li> I ended up trying many other baby products.</li>
            <li> It did not irritate the skin, and it was somewhat better at moisturizing than other creams.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work better than any other eczema creams we have triws.</li>
            <li> May be better for other parts of the body.</li>
            <li> My other lotions don&#x27;t work for my neck, but this lotion does &amp; I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> this works better than any other over the counter eczema lotion I have found</li>
            <li> It soothes itchy dry skin right away and even heals cracks in the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> Only need a small amount &amp; works great.</li>
            <li> you want a better shoot for your money, I suggest trying any of the diaper rash creams that has zinc oxide in it as the active ingredient.</li>
            <li> you want a better shoot for your money, I suggest trying any of the diaper rash creams that has zinc oxide in it as the active ingredient.</li>
            <li> It will leave your little ones skin super hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li> Now the issues haven&#x27;t disappeared, and since I am African American discoloration will apparently stay with me for years to come, but the roughness and apparent obviousness of the issues I had on my forehead, cheek and eyelids have diminished at a great capacity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had eczema on my hands since high school (6 years ago) and nothing really worked, not even the corticosteroid creams from the dermatologists.</li>
            <li> I have to be consistent about putting the lotion on or it comes right back.  </li>
            <li> If there was a way to get a bigger bottle of it, the current size is nice but it just doesn&#x27;t last long enough, otherwise good semi greasy lotion for eczema.</li>
            <li> It has worked for our son since he was 3 months old and we are still going strong 3 years later!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and it makes my hands soft and heals dry skin after one use.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy, it keeps skin soft, and it keeps itchy red eczema patches at bay.</li>
            <li> This is the only moisturizing that effectively solves the problem of my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> My three month old son had developed mild Eczema.</li>
            <li> I bought this items at a local drug store for $13 and it was worth every penny (luckily my daughter only has one spot that keeps &amp;#34;breaking out&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> I just bought this product a few days ago and WOW, am I glad!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only cream that has ever really soothed my skin and made it feel soft and comfortable</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and there were no problems.  </li>
            <li> His pediatrician also recommends applying vasaline over the cream in areas more prone to flare ups such as back of the knees &amp; elbows; this really helps.  </li>
            <li> I felt a cool sensation after applying it, the itch began to go away, and the next morning the amount of rashes was reduced and the itch was gone.  </li>
            <li> First I tried natural remedies.</li>
            <li> Also works as normal moisturizing cream for more sensitive dry</li>
            <li> when I&#x27;m told to be super careful not to let the steroid cream touch my face or armpits, I couldn&#x27;t imagine it was that safe for long term use).</li>
            <li> I tried several different brands and this one feels most smooth, and doesn´t get cakey after long massaging.</li>
            <li> Then I rewashed all my clothes and sheets in a new gentle detergent.</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;ve got more than one eczema sufferer, I can&#x27;t imagine going through one bottle in less than three months, and at $9, the cost of this lotion is negligible.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also 15% less &amp; the shipping is free!</li>
            <li> and it moisturizes my skin better than previous cream.</li>
            <li> just 24 hours----i tried all kinds of lotions that were for dry skin including petroleum jelly but nothing worked----my wrists were dry and red from what i dont know----but all i know is this stuff works and it works fast----buy it and you will be happy too</li>
            <li> For people with mild to moderate eczema - 1x after you shower, 1x before bed - should be sufficient.</li>
            <li> I have had mild eczema for about 15 years on my upper arm/shoulders.  </li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s a cream and not a lotion, it doesn&#x27;t evaporate from the skin as quickly and actually has a chance to do its job.</li>
            <li> I mildly exfoliated my skin, put this lotion on, and I kid you not after the FIRST application my dry patches were gone!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s done wonders for my skin, not only in the itchiness department, but also keeping my skin extremely soft and smooth</li>
            <li> For about a month now, I have been using this cream - about a one inch strip in my hands - and then applied to my sides (my main prone area) after showering each day.  </li>
            <li> we come to this particular item...</li>
            <li> Because this particular product (Eczema Therapy) is not available in the UK, I bought their regular moisturiser which also claimed to be good for eczema.</li>
            <li> I researched my condition properly and realised I most likely had something called perioral eczema.</li>
            <li> (she&#x27;s 2) because she has a mild case of eczema on her back, tummy, legs and arms.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of lotions, anti-itch creams, etc to give relief to my hand eczema, but this is the only lotion that helps.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is great for keeping eczema very manageable and I no longer have to explain to people what was wrong with my skin.  </li>
            <li> Again, the first time I used it there was a noticeable difference in the amount of dryness even though the area was still pretty red.  </li>
            <li> It has only been a couple of weeks and the dryness is considerably better and the skin softer and definitely smoother.  </li>
            <li> She got it mostly on her chin, neck, upper back and her armpits.</li>
            <li> stuff is decent as a stop-gap.</li>
            <li> This works better than more expensive creams or lotions...</li>
            <li> We also keep baths super short and wash with aquaphor baby.</li>
            <li> I found this cream while cleaning my older daughter&#x27;s room</li>
            <li> After the very first application of the Aveeno cream, I woke up the next morning with peaches and cream skin.</li>
            <li> While Gold Bond is usually my favorite brand over perfumed products due to having sensitive skin, I thought this particular cream felt &amp;#34;thinner&amp;#34; than the Aveeno.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to ANYONE out there.</li>

            <li> I am a sceptical person and don&#x27;t easily believe the whole &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; fad (even though I am inclined to believe Oatmeal DOES help), I was simply trying to get away from any -possible- irritants my skin could overreact to.</li>
            <li> Since using this (at night before bed and in the morning before I put on makeup), it has completely gone away!!</li>
            <li> It would get a little better</li>
            <li> It may be a good general moisturizer and may prevent eczema or other skin conditions if applied routinely but over an existing eczema it has no healing potential.</li>
            <li> It may be a good general moisturizer and may prevent eczema or other skin conditions if applied routinely but over an existing eczema it has no healing potential.</li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> Ive used it too and it helps clear up dry skin and chapped skin and some very mild rash like skin.  </li>
            <li> It helped reduce the redness a lot but the light pink patch always existed and it would cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> This rehydrates her skin so well and is gentle on her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It really works and keep skin soft for hours.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing helps, but only the Aveeno Eczema seems to actually calm the skin.  </li>
            <li> Tried a lot of anti-eczema moisturizing creams before this one, but this one has really done a lot to help clear it up.</li>
            <li> This really worked for my daughter(8month old) eczema.  </li>
            <li> However they have huge adverse effects ranging from the decline in general immunity to total growth suppression and psychiatric problems.</li>
            <li> I found it to be very slimy and as far as I could tell it</li>
            <li> I developed eczema on my eyelids and couldn&#x27;t find anything that really worked.</li>
            <li> Tried prescription creams given by doctor and some all natural one from whole foods.</li>
            <li> then and this is the only moisturizer that helps keep my skin moist and calm.</li>
            <li> normally apply this lotion once a day.  </li>
            <li> However it is a nice lotion that does soothe, but it will not get rid of eczema (at least in my case).&lt;br</li>
            <li> next best thing would be straight neosporin, but that stuff is so greasy and unpleasant, and you really dont want to rub it everywhere because then it will not absorb and just transfer to everything else.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, no longer did it itch like HELL.</li>
            <li> I found that applying this lotion first and African shea butter over really helps moisturize her skin.</li>
            <li> or so my elbows and hands looked completely normal and were no longer itchy at all.</li>
            <li> The only thing that worked was hydrocortisone, but i heard long term use would cause more problems than it solved.</li>
            <li> Soothes dried heated itchy skin better than any cream I&#x27;ve tried in 10 years</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t doubt that a few more applications of the cream will heal him.</li>
            <li> My sweet 2 year old daughter has eczema and the only medicne that treats it</li>
            <li> Works well, not too thick, goes on nicely.  </li>
            <li> It goes on really thick, but it absorbs into the skin nicely and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li> Goes on kind of thick, but doesn&#x27;t feel cloggy, stifling, or oily.</li>
            <li> I started using Aveeno last week and within 2 days I felt a real relief and my skin got less rough, it is the first time that my skin reacts so good to a cream.</li>
            <li> It works fine on other areas of the body though.</li>
            <li> lotion is amazing, and although I have used Aveeno previously for years at different times, I never knew of this version.</li>
            <li> It would be better for people who have only moderately dry skin, not eczema.</li>
            <li> As soon as I stopped, it would come right back.  </li>
            <li> his redness comes right back.</li>
            <li> Right after using it for the second time, my eyelids became severely inflamed and irritated.</li>
            <li> so it was such a peace of mind to know I have found the right cream.</li>
            <li> so I can get to it quickly (and frequently) so this one little tube (costs as much as all the other things combined)does the job and does it quickly!!  </li>
            <li> MOst lotions burns my skin or is TOO HEAVY for all over the body, but this is creamy yet light enough for a body lotion and doesn&#x27;t burn my skin (excema is several places all over my body).</li>
            <li> I am truly grateful for this product and hope that other eczema products (face wash, soap, etc) become readily available too.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to try something new, but I guess like the saying goes &amp;</li>
            <li> I signed up for the automatic program where I get a new cream every 3 months</li>
            <li> and I believe my body must&#x27;ve just been adjusting to this new treatment.</li>
            <li> I gotta try the new Gold bond eczema cream I heard that&#x27;ll work if this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my new dermatologist.</li>
            <li> After hearing all the horror stories of eczema and how hard it is to treat I was thrilled when this worked for my four year old daughter.</li>
            <li> I rarely get excemea anymore, but developed it recently with a new hand soap.  </li>
            <li> P.S. changing the diet and eliminating sugar, white flour, dairy and drinking pure water will do wonders, too!</li>
            <li> This lotion&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found so far for this random patch of dry skin.</li>
            <li> The actual healing process took a few days to start, but the results have been amazing nonetheless.</li>
            <li> Works so well on super dry and itchy skin (not officially eczema).  </li>
            <li> He also prescribed Sulfacetamide which made my cheeks super dry.  </li>
            <li> I have mild eczema on my hands that tends to pop up when it&#x27;s dry out</li>
            <li> My older child has almost completely grown out of it by the age of three.</li>
            <li> I was also quite pleased with the size of the product, much bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> I have mild eczema with itchy, dry, flaky skin on my hands.  </li>
            <li> Can you imagine the turmoil in being a 17 year old high school senior with eyelid eczema?  </li>
            <li> He has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My son has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I&#x27;m surprised at the results and would highly recommend it to anyone suffering from eczema.  </li>
            <li> used the Aveeno a few days in a row instead, and found that it was fine as moisturizer, but my eczema flared right back up.</li>
            <li> I have had a consistent butterfly rash for the last 8 years.  </li>
            <li> One week later - red rashes on my hands, neck and face significantly reduced or gone.      </li>
            <li> I only put it on my eyelid and am still on my first bottle.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my brother who has Enczema and this is the first over the counter cream that has actually worked for him.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, give this cream a try!</li>
            <li> and then I found this, which is the exact same thing with oatmeal extract.</li>
            <li> but this is my preference by far!</li>
            <li> and my skin is completely healed and almost normal looking.</li>
            <li> It has been 3 days, since I started using this product and WOW!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found out BEFORE I wasted my money on it!  </li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this at rite aid , same exact stuff.</li>
            <li> I only wish I&#x27;d tried this first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many creams in the past, before I purchased this for my son.</li>
            <li> So far straight neosporin has actually worked really well</li>
            <li> This lotion works wonders for my husbands sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure which one helped more</li>
            <li> but it totally made his face look way better than it did when he was using all those other creams.</li>
            <li> I usually do not write any reviews but for this I have to share my story.</li>
            <li> I had healed the initial problem with other products but the skin didn&#x27;t heal until I started using this product (recommended by a nurse), its fantastic!</li>
            <li> This cream usually stops those itching sessions after a minute or so and also helps him sleep better at night.</li>
            <li> First time writing a review, but i felt the need to help out my fellow eczema friends because i know how big the burden can be.</li>
            <li> This one is the first one which has actually helped me remove my itch.</li>
            <li> i have had eczema all of my life, and I have found something that is a complete life changer!  </li>
            <li> They have exactly the same ingredients.</li>
            <li> At first it actually irritated my skin a bit.</li>
            <li> When I first saw him the skin around his ankles was flared up with scaling, red blotches and lots of dryness.</li>
            <li> 2 year old daughters exema is almost gone!  </li>
            <li> We usually do this before bedtime and make sure he wears cotton pajamas.</li>
            <li> I do not usually write reviews.</li>
            <li> and my skin is super sensitive, dry, scaly, patchy, itchy (you get the idea).</li>
            <li> I noticed that because I lived in the dorm for my first year of college, I&#x27;ve developed a germ issue (not the extent of OCD or germophobia, but I washed my hands all the time), which really made my hands dry and irritated.  </li>
            <li> But this should have been a clue - there are simply too many chemicals in this lotion irritating my skin, and isn&#x27;t this the opposite of what we&#x27;re supposed to do with eczema, which is expose it to even more irritants.</li>
            <li> My mom bought this when I was away and when I returned 3 days later our daughter&#x27;s back was soft, smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> It is not as thick as some of the other lotions we use, but it soothes irritated skin very effectively.</li>
            <li> Even with the hot weather we&#x27;ve recently had, her skin is still clear.</li>
            <li> The way I did it, is first BEFORE I tried the Aveeno, I applied a prescription triamcinolone acetonide cream for several days to clear the eczema up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just extremely dry, scaly, and rarely cracks and bleeds.</li>
            <li> He had a few spots that resembled eczema and it cleared up very quickly.</li>
            <li> I have used hydro-cortisone in the past, but saw this more natural product and figured I&#x27;d give it a shot this winter.  </li>
            <li> My 2 yr old daughter has eczema pretty badly, especially in the summer months.</li>
            <li> We followed other recommendations and they were right!</li>
            <li> It doesnt cure it, but it sure does help to take the red out and tone down flare-ups.</li>
            <li> After a day of applying very hot compresses, the eczema shrink in size, the redness became pink and it relieved the itchiness.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have a couple of eczema patches on my hands, and thought I&#x27;d try something other than my tried and true Hydrocortisone 1% plus Aloe.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After only 2 days of using it, all I can say is WOW WOW WOW!!!!</li>
            <li> M doctor recommended this for my baby as she had very dry skin during the winter months when she was born ,it cleared out all the dry patches and slight redness on her skin ,Amazing product !</li>
            <li> and this will help your little ones skin stay free of dryness, redness and itchiness.</li>
            <li> Within a couple of days my hands look almost like that of a normal person&#x27;s, which is a major thing for me.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, this stuff applies easily and doesn&#x27;t make me feel sticky or gross like some other lotions do.</li>
            <li> She began using this cream a few months ago and has noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> After a week of use, the eczema is beginning to clear up.    </li>
            <li> After about two weeks my legs are completely clear.  </li>
            <li> With it, she keeps her skin hydrated, and clear.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the eczema body wash, used both for a week, and my sons skin started to clear up....</li>
            <li> It has helped clear up her eczema and has also prevented any break outs since we started using it almost 4 months ago.</li>
            <li> Worked great on a small patch of redness under my eye that was worsening over the past 4-5 weeks.</li>
            <li> but I know that aveeno is gentle enough on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> However, I still need to use steroid based creams to clear up my eczema.</li>
            <li> but clearly it was not working.</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t use body wash directly on my arms and legs to keep from scrubbing away my natural moisturizers.</li>
            <li> No scent, doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> In addition, I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s eczema since he was 6 months&#x27; old relief by this product.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this lotion to anyone with eczema especially on their hands</li>
            <li> I am surprised Aveeno tends to be nicer quality.  </li>
            <li> If you give it a try, be sure to reserve judgement at least a week.  </li>
            <li> (1x/wk v. nearly every day).  </li>
            <li> I have tested it on my sensitive skin face</li>
            <li> Yet when using this Aveeno product alone, my eczema was kept nearly all away.  </li>
            <li> My six year old has eczema on his legs</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old daughter has severe eczema.  </li>
            <li> It has been a constant struggle to find an over the counter cream that REALLY helps my eczema.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter has suffered from eczema since birth.  </li>
            <li> We have been using the cream for the last 1.5 years and it really helps with the severe eczema problems caused by food allergies.</li>
            <li> she is now 19 months and her eczema is completely under control because of this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my 2 year old</li>
            <li> For $11 I found a product that has almost completely faded all of the spots of eczema and taken away the itch/pain completely.  </li>
            <li> She is 17 years old and hasn&#x27;t had an eczema flare since she was about 10 years old.  </li>
            <li> wow.  </li>
            <li> When I came upon this product I found it priced much lower than my traditional solution.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 32 years old and been struggling with eczema on my hands for all my life.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s almost completely cleared up my hands completely.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion for my 4.5 yrs old toddler recommended by her doctor.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get rid of it completely.  </li>
            <li> His need to itch his face stopped completely.</li>
            <li> Also, instead of looking like a layer of skin has been removed, it looks like my skin is almost completely healed.  </li>
            <li> that has worked for my 10 month old and her eczema.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on how soft my skin is.</li>
            <li> , I just cover the area up and after about 2-3 days, the area is completely healed.</li>
            <li> My daughter developed eczema when she was 2 years old for 10 years</li>
            <li> I had been using the steroid cream more lately.  </li>
            <li> Within a week, the rash is completely gone.</li>
            <li> So much that it feels gross on you</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My 11 month old recently developed a rash that the doctor diagnosed as eczema.  </li>
            <li> After a week or two, it was completely gone.</li>
            <li> Really feels like its a deep moisturiser.</li>
            <li> And thats when I realized how much aveeno is helping my daughter&#x27;s skin on a daily basis!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t over power you and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I use a sensitive laundry soap, California baby eczema wash in the bath</li>
            <li> Leave it to a 30 year old guy to never go to the doctor and just let things figure themselves out.</li>
            <li> If your baby is suffering with exema or really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Both my daughters have eczema, and one also has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but the chlorine really dries out her skin, especially in the winter.  </li>
            <li> It is the only thing that really seems to work on my hands.</li>
            <li> The redness went away almost completely.  </li>
            <li> I applied it on my 2 year old son and it works</li>
            <li> you have extremely sensitive skin, you may consider the following&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003BJZ1P6/ref&#x3D;as_li_tl?ie&#x3D;</li>
            <li> I know for a fact I don&#x27;t react to Paraffin, using Vaseline every day on my hyper sensitive face, so what else could it be?</li>
            <li> It has your hands feeling so soft and within a week&#x27;s time, my symptoms were cleared.  </li>
            <li> I will keep putting it on once every night at least to make sure the eczema stays away.</li>
            <li> yeah, the red skin was still there, but it felt so much calmer.</li>
            <li> This works wonders for my 1 year old who has eczema.</li>
            <li> I just started using it and so far, it seems to work well with no irritation noted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The patches are nearly gone</li>
            <li> My 3 year old was suffering a lot with her eczema.</li>
            <li> My 7 week old had eczema patches all over his face and neck.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this every day to keep my face soft and moisturize.  </li>
            <li> Anyway I wanted to try something natural</li>
            <li> I have used this on our 18 months old since he was around 8 months old.</li>
            <li> Completely clears it up after a week of once a day use.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t solve all of the symptoms associated with eczema, but it sure keeps my skin moisturized for at least 12 hours</li>
            <li> I developed eczema on my chin this winter.  </li>
            <li> I applied it 2 more times the next day, and the rashes were dried up or had completely disappeared.  </li>
            <li> My baby nephew is a year old and has eczema.</li>
            <li> After dealing with it for two years, it was still there and it developed into a rash with blisters that would crust and sometimes bleed.  </li>
            <li> Baby skin is really sensitive.</li>
            <li> and while it&#x27;s subsided in my adult years I still get itchiness and dryness on my hands a lot and sometimes on my stomach and thighs.</li>
            <li> So far the eczema is on and off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had psoriasis for over 25 years and recently developed eczema, too.</li>
            <li> I have a 5 month old son that needed an eczema cream, as do I.</li>
            <li> my job require frequent hand wash.</li>
            <li> My child has had eczema from bout a month old.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this on your face if you get acne naturally.</li>
            <li> I have an almost 2 year old, that has sporadic flare ups of eczema.  </li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter has had eczema since she was born.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re completely gone.</li>
            <li> We got this to try out for our 3 months old since she has Eczema.</li>
            <li> It really gave me hope when I had none left.</li>
            <li> Our 2yr old has eczema bumps on her arms and chest.</li>
            <li> She has eczema since 2 weeks after birth, and she &#x27;s 6 months old now.</li>
            <li> I use this on my infant daughter since she has sensitive and eczema.</li>
            <li> After a few applications I found that my skin is no longer cracking and is actually smooth.</li>
            <li> I developed a blistery rash, which turned into a blotchy reddened and itchy skin.</li>
            <li> and twin girls (8 months) all have sensitive and eczematic skin</li>
            <li> and this is the only (gentle) product that clears it up.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any improvement from the Aquaphor and the CeraVe seemed to keep things from getting worse but didn&#x27;t really make them better.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t exactely what I was looking for because I already knew that Vaseline helped my skin from getting worse (although not healing it either), Hydromol has become a useful (SLS free) soap substitute in the shower</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried using prescription cortisone cream covered with regular hand lotion, which actually dried out my hands even more.  </li>
            <li> I love how thick the lotion is.</li>
            <li> This is perhaps the best and least irritating lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this for anyone who really struggles with dry skin or eczema.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband&#x27;s very persistent itch due to a certain condition.  </li>
            <li> For the last 2 years, I noticed that I started itching a lot by my right wrist and my left shin.  </li>
            <li> Pretty much a recombination of typical Aveeno ingredients.      </li>
            <li> His face went from red, peeling and itchy to perfectly normal, seemingly overnight!</li>
            <li> My hands finally look normal again!  </li>
            <li> and my eyelids are 80% back to normal!  </li>
            <li> I treated it in part with a 1% hydrocortisone cream, but the skin was pretty dry, too</li>
            <li> I get dry hands easily and therefore have several places on my hands that are issues for me (which is why I always carried lotion in each bag and in my pockets if I could), and although I haven&#x27;t seen the same result on my hands that i have of my face, I will not give up.</li>
            <li> This was the first winter I did not have dry skin issues.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say if you have moderate or mild eczema this will help you, but if your eczema is severe or you&#x27;ve had it a very long time, either try another product or go ask a doctor for something prescription.</li>
            <li> This calms his itches down quickly.</li>
            <li> I have two little boys that have battled eczema pretty much since they were born.</li>
            <li> they other day , my foot flared up, and i rubbed this lotion on it until it was completely absorbed, and within 2 minutes, it stopped itching been using for a week, i was amazed</li>
            <li> But it goes away much more quickly than other products, especially if you wipe your hands on other patches of dry</li>
            <li> I still use the Cortizone-10 specifically for the eczema but the CeraVe, or the generic version available at a drug store, has been helpful for daily treatment of dry hands.</li>
            <li> When I applied this product for the first time my eczema became so red, swollen,itchy and it multiplied all over my left leg.</li>
            <li> I have used lots of Aveeno products in the past, and have been satisfied, but this one goes above and beyond anything I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used different Aveeno lotions for years with decent results on my eczema, but after discovering this cream...</li>
            <li> It was dark red and now It is light</li>
            <li> This is the first lotion I have used that actually shows improvement within a day or two and isn&#x27;t geeasy or sting my open eczema patches.</li>
            <li> Now that my baby is older, I only have to use it 1-2 times a day to keep the eczema at bay.</li>
            <li> Remember letting your little one play in the bath will dry out their skin causing more dryness, redness and even itchiness to the skin.</li>
            <li> A little greasy, but not bad.</li>
            <li> But I highly recommend this to anyone with skin issues such as Eczema or Psoriasis.</li>
            <li> But I highly recommend this to anyone with skin issues such as Eczema or Psoriasis.</li>
            <li> In my case, I have a minor dry skin on my hand, I try to apply it as many time as needed when my hand feel dry.</li>
            <li> I have minor eczema on each size of my nose, right on my inner cheek.</li>
            <li> We used this for just a few days twice per day and his skin cleared right up!</li>
            <li> Its light, theres very little cast, and</li>
            <li> I did get some itchiness a couple of hours later, but applying a little more cream helped immensely.  </li>
            <li> Also, as to previous comments saying that Aveeno&#x27;s products \\&quot;smell horrible,\\&quot; they don&#x27;t have a \\&quot;scent\\&quot; because people with eczema are highly sensitive to scented stuff, so there isn&#x27;t a distinct smell.  </li>
            <li> and I have to wait for it to dry somewhat before I get back in bed, but that is so worth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many other products that claim to help with dry skin, but this one actually works.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s fine for a regular after-bath cream, but I wouldn&#x27;t count on it to work miracles on those little fat rolls.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what I have tried with limited success: hydro-cortisone cream, aloe vera, prescription steroid creams, oral anti-histamine, topical anti-histamine, oatmeal baths, bandages to limit skin contact with fabric, tons of OTC moisturizers, oils, petroleum gel as a barrier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and really works well as a barrier cream.</li>
            <li> Within 24 hours-- her red, swollen, wrinkled eyelids returned to normal.  </li>
            <li> In a day or two I expect it will look completely normal and for once my hands aren&#x27;t in pain, and let me tell you, it&#x27;s a godsend especially since I&#x27;m a Chef and a sales clerk.</li>
            <li> This size isn&#x27;t normally found in stores,  especially at this price.</li>
            <li> It is normal they have rushes in his arms, legs or back.</li>
            <li> I do apply normally about 3 to 4 times daily.</li>
            <li> With regular use, my eczema stays away, and my skin returned to normal.  </li>
            <li> When I got down to the bottom of the bottle I decided to look around for another product since even though it helped more than other products I had used, I still had the problem.  </li>
            <li> I notice the redness is much less and what is to me the most compelling reason to try it, is that my skin is getting better and better each and every day to the point where it is FINALLY clearing up after suffering with that horrible itch day in and day out for so long.  </li>
            <li> One might due better with just plain old vaseline!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s still a spot of severely stubborn inflammation, but for mild to moderate cases, I couldn&#x27;t imagine recommending any other brand or lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I moved to the US last November and temperatures where I live have reached -20C</li>
            <li> and this is the only moisturizer that seems to work in the New England winter for them.</li>
            <li> Great foe my 2 yr old with bad skin issues.</li>
            <li> I believe this is from washing my hands so much and irritation from warm water along with the cold weather.</li>
            <li> Dry skin with eczema is a real problem.  </li>
            <li> Very helpful in stopping dry, itching skin.  </li>
            <li> Works really well on eczema, dry patches</li>
            <li> In my case, I developed eczema when I became pregnant with my 3rd (never had this problem with my previous pregnancies)--I was getting unbearable itchy rashes everywhere on my body.  </li>
            <li> It really soothes dry skin with a trace of eczema.</li>
            <li> All three of my kids suffer with eczema and this cream really does penetrate the dry skin and alleviate their itching.</li>
            <li> Within 2 days I really noticed a decrease in the dry, scaly patches.  </li>
            <li> It really helps with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite as smooth as regular lotion, but it doesn&#x27;t feel harsh.  </li>
            <li> A day later, I didn&#x27;t really anything different on Kent&#x27;s leg.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times so far, but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> It only takes a tiny bit to do a whole baby.</li>
            <li> she has super dry skin, redness and dry patches.</li>
            <li> My 3mo old&#x27;s eczema was under control by his regular baby cream; however I was hoping to clear out by using this product.</li>
            <li> My 5 month old has eczema and this is the only lotion I have found that completely helps.</li>
            <li> I really felt a big relief not only for my skin</li>
            <li> Granted, it isn&#x27;t as effective on the eczema on my back, which is much worse and has been there a lot longer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clearing up a trouble area on my leg so quick :&#x27;)...</li>
            <li> because as some people have tried to make very clear in these reviews everyone is different and all products don&#x27;t work for all people.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and just had a severe eczema breakout where every moisturizer burned (area turned red and inflamed like a chemical burn), including shea butter-based creams.</li>
            <li> Being a eczema patient from birth its hard finding the right product that helps moisturizing part, but this really works...</li>
            <li> No other product worked besides Eucerin, until I discovered this Aveeno.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider this a major drawback.</li>
            <li> Boy, oh boy, what a major difference in her skin.  </li>
            <li> When i tried it the first time, my eyelid skin get extremely irritated, inflamed, and swollen.</li>
            <li> While it does a good job moisturising the normal parts of my face, as the summer went on and the cold snap of autumn has arrived, my eczema has come back with a vengeance and now this cream and the baby wash</li>
            <li> This mosturizing cream suprised me.&lt;br /&gt;it helps my psoriasis like no other.</li>
            <li> It takes a little work to rub it in, but it shows results within the first use!</li>
            <li> And then after my skin got mostly cleared up, I started applying the Aveeno lotion at least once a day, sometimes twice, and I haven&#x27;t had any eczema breakouts since!</li>
            <li> Just after a few days, the dry skin on my face is cured, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It would only get slightly smaller but after using this it completely gone my skin is back to normal as if I never had eczema!</li>
            <li> Helps my husbands very dry skin on legs and arms that can cause him intense itching.</li>
            <li> This really helped with my infant&#x27;s very dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> Its a little pricey, but its so worth it.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey, but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> if u looked closely on the back this one has black bar strip on top meaning its all chemicals , and the baby eczema has blue bar which means that it has some natural in it , I wish I knew that earlier , I thought they were both the same cuz they have same ingredient list.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t sting like other products have and it made the stiff skin pliable and more flexible and it stayed that way.</li>
            <li> Lately I also developed a very very small amount right at the top of my nose between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Obviously not wanting to take any drugs or use any creams that could endanger the baby, I was hesitant in using anything other than a mild topical steroid cream, to no avail.  </li>
            <li> This by far is this best productive used for my eczema, and it is bad year round.</li>
            <li> For those with sun sensitivity (which is common for anyone with a butterfly / malar rash) you may want to give La Roche-Posay Anthelios 60 Ultra Light Sunscreen a try.  </li>
            <li> my rash has cleared up, I&#x27;m going to keep this around and use it as a general moisturizing body lotion.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this tube for my hands as a general moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and my arms, chest, and back are perfectly clear.</li>
            <li> matter, 1 week later and my skin is clear.  </li>
            <li> and this is the only cream that helps clear it up.</li>
            <li> I literally applied it two times over two days and my neck is clear from any red scaly patches of skin.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for two days and can already see a marked difference.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it morning and night and the redness and scaliness of the area</li>
            <li> This cream is the only one so far to soothe her skin.  </li>
            <li> My one year old son has eczema, which tends to flare up regularly.</li>
            <li> So far, Baby Eczema Cream is the only cream I can use on her that doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> Steroid cream made the skin on my face red and sensitive, so I am reluctant to use it.    </li>
            <li> Steam facial done by professional aesthetician&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before, I was experiencing a near constant &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; sensation.  </li>
            <li> Our daughter has had eczema on her back, hips and arms since she was 4 months old</li>
            <li> I am not a medical professional and this is a recommendation based solely on my experience and should not be consider advice on to purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the only cream we&#x27;ve tried so far that heals up our toddler&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li> and I barely scratch anymore.</li>
            <li> Apparently, it happens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finally going to a dermatologist on Monday about a completely unrelated bump on my shoulder (wish me luck)</li>
            <li> As soon as I applied it, I felt relief and actually said &amp;#34;Ahhh&amp;#34; out loud.</li>
            <li> My newborn son developed eczema recently around his neck, folds of his arms and legs.  </li>
            <li> They completely healed a couple of weeks later and I continue to use this to keep outbreaks in check.  </li>
            <li> Immediately I cleaned his face and went back to apply his regular cream which he cried the entire process because his face was hurting so much.</li>
            <li> but this is the only lotion I use for my eczema and it has worked wonders for me so far.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how much money i&#x27;ve spent and</li>
            <li> but I use this when my skin is red and sensitive after using Retin A</li>
            <li> By the time my baby turned 2 weeks old, he had red patches on his cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I am currently 23 years old, and I have had skin issues for (what it seems) all my life.</li>
            <li> If I follow up with this lotion immediately, my hands stay soft and moisturized until the next time I wash them.</li>
            <li> With regular use my skin was completely healed within a week.</li>
            <li> After only three days of use my hand has gone from cracked, red and bleeding to almost normal.</li>
            <li> Sure, it is really gentle and non irritating, but the moisturizing effected not that long lasting.</li>
            <li> I was still holding my breath though, hoping it would continue since sometimes it can get better then worse again.</li>
            <li> The eczema therapy cream decreased the depth of wrinkles, most visible on my arms.</li>
            <li> In fact, applying this made my eczema worse because it was a lot more itchy.</li>
            <li> Tired of having to resort to steroid ointments, I started looking for a better alternative.</li>
            <li> Back to coconut oil for me - 10 minutes after which, my skin began to immediately calm down from aveeno experience.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely continue to purchase for my dry winter skin!!</li>
            <li> first few days it made my skin very dry / flaky, tight and more red (when the cream was washed off).</li>
            <li> highly recommended for dry skin.</li>
            <li> My advice for any new product-test it first in a small way.</li>
            <li> Around 6 1/2-7m old my baby started developing patches of dry skin near her fingers and on her cheeks and nose.</li>
            <li> As much as I&#x27;ve tried other natural products to treat my eczema this is the only one that works, time and time again.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live with the suspicion of doing a general harm to my child while trying to cure a relatively limited problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used other products that are reliable, but very costly.  </li>
            <li> Some other creams either hurt his skin or do not have much effect.</li>
            <li> I never expected this and was more than ready for another disappointment, but this...</li>
            <li> Ww tried pretty much every type of lotion before Aveeno, because I&#x27;ve broken out in hives from some of their adult products.</li>
            <li> I have tried the following moisturizers (Johnson &amp; Johnson Baby oil, Olive oil, SebaMed Baby Lotion, SebaMed Baby Cream, Cetaphil Skin Moisturizer (Formulated for Eczema),  Eucerin Professional Repair Lotion, Eucerin Calming Cr&amp;egrave;me, Eucerin Original Healing Repair Cr&amp;egrave;me, Eucerin Intensive Repair Extra-Enriched Hand Cr&amp;egrave;me, Medela Tender Care Lanolin, Aquaphor Healing Ointment (Dry, Cracked, and Irritated Skin Protectant), Laroche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5, Organic Coconut oil, Eucerin Baby Eczema Cr&amp;egrave;me, Aveeno Eczema Cream, Lucas Papaw Ointment, Raw Apothecary</li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t live without it and still use it once in awhile even in the summer if I notice a dry or itchy spot anywhere on my body.</li>
            <li> I am a college student and I live in a dry and elevated area.</li>
            <li> /&gt;----------------------&lt;br /&gt;I have had eczema for most of my life and except for a bad case as a child, it has been mild, but constant for 30 years.  </li>
            <li> The red dry skin is still just barely visible on the inside of one of my fingers, but I&#x27;m willing to take that over itchy, blistering dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from dry skin especially on my face which can be very embarrassing when you&#x27;re in public.</li>
            <li> the only lotion that actually helps clear my excema.  </li>
            <li> It does not matter how old you are, whether your a male or female, or what color skin you have.</li>
            <li> My husband recently developed eczema and has tried several different creams.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I didn&#x27;t see it necessary to give him something steroid based at such a young age.</li>
            <li> Tried several moisturizers, but only this worked so far.</li>
            <li> Not only did it make my existing eczema worse, but cause more of it to pop up, in the surrounding area that applied the cream.</li>
            <li> No dry skin, just moisturized skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of their products and they all make it worse.</li>
            <li> It is extremely moisturizing but isn&#x27;t greasy like some of the other &amp;#34;eczema&amp;#34; products full of mineral oil.</li>
            <li> The cost is not cheap, i have to pay thrice the price for shipping only, but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s exactly as described, very soothing for irritated skin which is always an issue for me in the winters and year round due to my allergy to soap.</li>
            <li> I was searching high and low for an OTC products to help with my sore dry hands.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews very carefully because as many other reviewers mentioned, I was looking for something to sooth my itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> No more itching, no more redness, plus an amazing smooth patch of skin in the areas where its usually been a tad bit rough or peeling, and sometimes itchy as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thick, didn&#x27;t last as long as thicker creams, and left my hands a bit slippery.</li>
            <li> the cream last long for a long time plus fast shipping.</li>
            <li> and we live in a very dry climate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Aveeno for 7 days in order to get ride of an eczema and after this time is exactly the same or even a little worse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing and helps stop the itch mildly, and the &amp;#34;non scent&amp;#34; it has is clearly made to not &amp;#34;have a smell&amp;#34; and in turn, has an empty bland smell to it - so much that I just can&#x27;t stand smelling for a few minutes after putting it on - but that could just be me!</li>
            <li> For everyone out there with eczema, I highly recommend using this and any other Aveeno product, including their shower and oatmeal bath.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty optimistic no matter how bad it looks at the moment she will be okay within a year or so.</li>
            <li> This creme has helped to clear my eczema and treat dry skin problems.</li>
            <li> I had previously been using a hydrocortisone lotion that claimed to be \\&quot;intensively healing\\&quot; to eczematous skin, but my hands would continue to burn for up to 20 minutes after applying it, and it really didn&#x27;t seem to keep my hands moisturized like it claimed it would.</li>
            <li> I used this on my son when he was  2 months old because he had really dry peeling skin.  </li>
            <li> This has a slightly &#x27;medicinal&#x27; smell but really does the job.</li>
            <li> It does not heal my eczema in any way, but I find it to be slightly soothing and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> My 2-year old daughter has atopic dermatitis (chronic dry skin).</li>
            <li> It gave my dried and hot skin a cooling effect and moistened it enough to stop itching.</li>
            <li> we slather him down religiously in this and it has just helped so much.</li>
            <li> Every single one of them contained Parabens, except for my trusty old Vaseline.</li>
            <li> I use this constantly and have found myself with very few flare ups, and truly feel like it delves into my skin and keeps it fresh and feeling healthy/moisturized throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I need to reapply so much, the very small amounts of this isn&#x27;t worth the money compared to other products.</li>
            <li> I am extremely hopeful that in a couple of weeks, my cheeks will look completely normal again.  </li>
            <li> After a few days of using this the results are fantastic, within a week in a half the rash became non-existent.</li>
            <li> My LO&#x27;s eczema got worse last week and it appeared itchy because he&#x27;s easily irritated and always scraching his face.</li>
            <li> But February of last year I spotted a small light pink patch on my the left side of my face.</li>
            <li> This product really helped smooth out my dry, irritated skin after an unfortunate tangle with toxic plants.</li>
            <li> , I have very bad dry, cracked skin on my hands in the winter, and this lotion has been great for that too!</li>
            <li> After my rash was completely gone, I kept using this cream on my skin, which tends to be very dry.  </li>
            <li> After a week twice daily, the eczema disappeared completely from one hand and you can barely see it on the other.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product partially due to the positive feedbacks on this site and partially out of desperation as I&#x27;ve been suffering from eczema for decades.  </li>
            <li> I love that there are no dyes or artificial fragrances, since I have sensitive</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find right now</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my daughter&#x27;s dry skin for a few months and it has really helped!  </li>
            <li> If you have experienced the extreme redness and irritation that can come from this, you know how painful it can be.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> After washing my hands (something I do VERY often) my skins immediately become dry, white and tight.</li>
            <li> My most recent case was a strip on the back of my knee that was about an inch long and half inch wide that felt and looked like tough old red leather.  </li>
            <li> It makes me extremely concerned that the products have been tampered with and I refuse to use them, as they are for my two young children, and I do not want to take any chances.  </li>
            <li> I have tried the usual go-to creams (steroid creams, allergy creams), but only with minimal success.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is that I cannot get it here in the UK which makes it more expensive and the waiting time was long.</li>
            <li> This product caused more pimples, nasty ones!&lt;br /&gt;The cream is a little too greasy, you can feel the grease even after many hours of applying!</li>
            <li> so my right hand is generally exposed to less than my left, however for the past year</li>
            <li> It only takes a few applications for my skin to return to its normal color.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the least expensive kind of all of the specialty eczema lotions!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;ll do the same for every single person that tries it, but as far as my experience goes, its a lifesaver and</li>
            <li> The itch relief is very fast and lasts at least 6 to 8 hours.  </li>
            <li> It provides very long lasting moisture and has actually repaired the skin.</li>
            <li> and it seems to feel about the same on my skin, where it doesn&#x27;t instantly absorb and I feel totally dry and itchy after an hour.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dry skin on the back of my hands and this is the only thing that gets rid of it!</li>
            <li> With the harsh weather lately and hard water my skin has been completely damaged, dry, and I started breaking out in a more severe form of eczema that I never had before!</li>
            <li> We bought it at a local CVS because our poor baby just diagnosed with mild eczema.</li>
            <li> I put this on my 23 month old last night because his skin was really dry due to eczema.</li>
            <li> I had tried other Aveeno products in the past (bath soak, oatmeal lotion) and found them slimy, irritating and not effective, however, this is the best thing out there for eczema or extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> I tried a bunch a things, but this actually healed it in 2 days flat!!!</li>
            <li> Ordinary lotions seem to help very little.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> - you have to reapply pretty often during the day (at least I did).  </li>
            <li> My whole family uses this which means that we spend a small fortune every month.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve been using Eucerin for a long time, but for about the last 8 months suffered from breakouts).  </li>
            <li> The 7.3oz is also a big tube so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Used it when my kids was little as he has a very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I even had eczema on my face (usually it happens on my legs and hands), which was really embarrassing because there were red dry scaly patches all over my face, no amount of foundation could hide it.</li>
            <li> the prescription creams and ointments stop the itching but do little to clear up the demarcation left by the rash.</li>
            <li> If I have a breakout, i use a little extra the night before I work, and the next morning, when I am looking/reapplying, its much, much calmer and less irritated.</li>
            <li> so dry it cracked open.</li>
            <li> My skin will still get dry and crack but only when I neglect to use this lotion like I should.</li>
            <li> The lotion does burn my skin when it is REALLY dry, but, again, this only happens if I neglect to use it every day or two.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with dry red flakey skin around my nose, chin and forehead for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> While I have been using the cream, I have noticed far less itching and discomfort.</li>
            <li> Previously I used a bit of my young nephew&#x27;s prescription cream, which worked.</li>
            <li> I have hand eczema which causes the skin on my hands to split and crack open along with dry itchy patches.  </li>
            <li> His skin cleared up instantly although still dry.  </li>
            <li> I was out and his back and shoulders were dry</li>
            <li> It gets so dry the skin cracks open and bleeds.  </li>
            <li> gave it 24 hours and the red dry skin was almost gone.</li>
            <li> I have terribly dry skin that can crack and bleed at times, especially on my hands.</li>
            <li> legs had deep wrinkles and dry patches.</li>
            <li> this is the only product that has helped heal dry, cracked fingers ....</li>
            <li> I have some seriously dry skin on my hand that has migrated around over 7 years from finger tip to the rest of the finger pads to the palm and back of hand.</li>
            <li> Her skin felt dry and scaly and some areas red.</li>
            <li> Especially during winter or when I travel to dry environment</li>
            <li> My kids (3 yrs and 10 mos, respectively) have keratosis pilaris, which is a condition that creates a rough, red rash on the face and arms.  </li>
            <li> Now saying all that I really do not like to use any chemicals - especially petroleum - however, I was considering using a cortisone cream and thought this was the lesser of the two &#x27;evils&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> It Only take a few days before the eczema spots clear up.</li>
            <li> As I am writing this, my cheeks are still slightly pink, but the rash is gone and they feel moisturized, not dry.  </li>
            <li> We use it twice a day and the itching for both children has decreased tremendously.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from severe and painful eczema and have tried every lotion and potion there is, you will love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I started to apply it twice a day, and after a few days, his skin was completely clear!</li>
            <li> My husband uses this for an itchy dry scalp and it is one of the only things that work well and all day long too, ever since he started taking it</li>
            <li> The change is slight the first few days, but noticeable given some time.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered from dry, itchy, weeping (clear fluid) skin patches on the sides of my nose and my chin on and off for a few years of my life.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to generalize and say it won&#x27;t work for you since that would not be a scientific claim, but based on my experience and  other reviewers complaining about the same inadequacy, I can not recommend the cream as a treatment for moderate to severe eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to generalize and say it won&#x27;t work for you since that would not be a scientific claim, but based on my experience and  other reviewers complaining about the same inadequacy, I can not recommend the cream as a treatment for moderate to severe eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other day my patches got out of control and one patch almost seemed to have some kind of crazy allergic reaction</li>
            <li> I bought this product as my son&#x27;s skin was getting very dry and had red spots on the knees</li>
            <li> had become red and very dry.</li>
            <li> My skin is very very dry and this lotion simply did not cut it for me.</li>
            <li> I had been experiencing red rashes, very dry and itchy skin on my arms.</li>
            <li> My husband, baby, and toddler all get very dry skin/eczema especially in the winter.  </li>
            <li> and it actually made her skin very dry.</li>
            <li> she has developed a little rash..</li>
            <li> So far it works a little.</li>
            <li> Cleared up my 3 month old daughters dry, scaly, cracked skin in less than 1 day.</li>
            <li> Also, afterwards I became allergic to other normal aveeno products which is just odd.</li>
            <li> For my neck too she suggested the same steroid cream, but the first time I applied it sting pretty bad.</li>
            <li> We were so desperate for a healthy solution, that I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> After a few days of use, my hands are almost completely clear.</li>
            <li> The lotion is fine, but the cover was broken when it arrived, half of it leaked out.</li>
            <li> the affected and unaffected areas.</li>
            <li> When I leave it on my red, rough eczema patches on my face, it seem to stay on my face</li>
            <li> and then I stumbled across this fragrance-free, steroid-free wonder lotion that has literally reduced my scaley alligator hands to baby soft smootheness in a few days time.</li>
            <li> The itchiness is completely gone and at this point I find I just need to use it a few times a week to maintain.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a long time for me.</li>
            <li> My eczema consists all over my body (front and back) and would feel rough to the touch.</li>
            <li> After just a few days of using it, my hands cleared up completely.</li>
            <li> but I dont want to use it for too long.</li>
            <li> Now I use this and Dove sensitive soap bar year round.</li>
            <li> After years of torment with &#x27;winter eczema, while trying to use steroid creams as sparingly as possible, I tried Aveeno Eczema Therapy Cream.&lt;br /&gt;After a few days of use, the rash and itching were gone, and with daily use, it has not come back.  </li>
            <li> Doctors I&#x27;ve seen believe it is caused by wearing long sleeved jackets, sweaters, gloves etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a month of regular use, I have observed ABSOLUTELY NO improvement in my daughter&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li> One word of caution: The moisturiser goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and stays on a long time.</li>
            <li> The first lotion specifically for eczema that I&#x27;ve used that actually made my eczema hurt even worse and didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li> Not too thick, soaks in fast.  </li>
            <li> A few hours later, his shoulders and back were flared red, dry and peeling.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products that consistently works and usually you can see a marked difference in less than 24</li>
            <li> I expected no less from my order, but when I received it, the seal from all four tubes of Aveeno cream were missing, and in its place, there was scotch tape over the cap to \\&quot;indicate\\&quot; that it had not been open.  </li>
            <li> only complaint about this cream is that it leaves an oily feel on my skin for hours after applying, but it serves its purpose well, so I can live with that.</li>
            <li> Our son has pretty bad eczema, I put this cream on all over his body right after his bath when the skin is still damp to seal in moisture.  </li>
            <li> Second day, my hands were getting less red and inflamed.</li>
            <li> Lasts much used little by little</li>
            <li> Yes, this is a little more expensive than some other regular lotions, but once I finally broke down and gave it a try, I realized I would spend double what they charge!  </li>
            <li> Comes in similar packaging like other Aveeno soothing moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li> I used it for several months (every other day).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everything I&#x27;ve tried from the above has either helped only a little if not none whatsoever.</li>
            <li> bye long sleeves!</li>
            <li> and I have not found its equal with any of the other products on the market.</li>
            <li> I have been visited my doctor and two other dermatology doctors, and often time they ended up recommended me prescription medicines that contained \\&quot;steroid\\&quot; such as Hydrocortisone Cream or other drugs such as: Protopic or Elidel.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t appear to be any different than any other OTC lotion, had to get prescription Ammonium Lactate lotion before I found relief after this and</li>
            <li> As many of you know, who can sleep when you are so uncomfortable!</li>
            <li> so i really only used that in real extreme cases but in 5 years i&#x27;ve probably only used  cortizone twice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use or need any other eczema products, only this lotion.</li>
            <li> Other lotions only provided temporary relief.  </li>
            <li> and because I&#x27;m someone who had rashes due to dry skin since I was a kid, I thought it was the same type of rash.  </li>
            <li> Eczema on my hand, ankles, and really dry legs.</li>
            <li> Our son was getting dry skin</li>
            <li> One had baby acne and dry skin</li>
            <li> Helps with any dry skin care needs.  </li>
            <li> I always have really dry itchy skin in the winter and this winter</li>
            <li> , I did not find that it did anything for the dry skin on my neck.</li>
            <li> I tried this as after a couple days he had dry skin all over and after reading the reviews gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I would even recommend this to people without eczema who may just have extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin also doesn&#x27;t get as dry.  </li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;ve always had a problem with dry skin).      </li>
            <li> If you have eczema or even just really dry skin</li>
            <li> I use it whenever she gets dry skin or flare ups of the excema.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been diagnosed with eczema, but have suffered through dry patches on my face and arms for years.  </li>
            <li> If you suffer from severly dry skin, dry skin patches, etc.</li>
            <li> but I do have dry skin</li>
            <li> so i got him this cream because whenever he stays over he cant take a shower because he didnt have his cream and would end up shriveling to death of dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have had dry face for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> We used it in winter when my kids have really dry skin</li>
            <li> Works for dry skin and eczema.</li>
            <li> Dry skin - have some Therapy</li>
            <li> My skin started to dry and flake up.</li>
            <li> have had dry skin all my life</li>
            <li> This cream worked wonders on me and within one day dry itchy patches on my arms disappeared.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice his dry scalp anymore.</li>
            <li> I use it whenever my skin gets dry.  </li>
            <li> This cream worked on my dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> I recomended for dry skin, irritated skin, and skin conditions like mine, because it nurses the skin.</li>
            <li> Also, my lips have been so dry</li>
            <li> and my ear lobes have been dry and cracking....</li>
            <li> It seems to help with winter dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have beens earching for years for a lotion to help my dry hands.  </li>
            <li> It still feels dry to the touch</li>
            <li> It heals the dry, itchy patches.</li>
            <li> The problem for me is that even lotions marketed as being for &amp;#34;severely dry and cracked skin&amp;#34; don&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> The expiration date is in 13 months, which is plenty, the tube is convenient to use, the moisturizer is helping my dry skin</li>
            <li> I find that with some lotions after I apply them to my hands, they still look dry.</li>
            <li> All the dry skin exfoliated off after applying it 3 times a day for 2 days.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> My hands would get so dry I could sandpaper a wall.</li>
            <li> My husband is an electrician and his hands get really dry-</li>
            <li> I put it on that night and when baby woke up her dry patches were 80% gone.</li>
            <li> I got it for my daughter as she was scratching her dry skin to the point that her skin was bleeding.</li>
            <li> I have horribly dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> It is Doctor recommended and helps with itching and dry skin.</li>
            <li> She had swollen, red, itchy, crusty, stretched and wrinkled eyelids with undereye dark circles.  </li>
            <li> after a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it daily as needed the last few days and</li>
            <li> My atopic dermatitis has improved somewhat in the last few months, but I can&#x27;t attribute it to just the cream; my condition is also related to stress and allergies.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical about this type of Aveeno lotion, since I couldn’t see a difference in the ingredients that would help treat Eczema until I noticed most of the Aveeno lotions list dimethicone as the active ingredient and not colloidal oatmeal (which is the active ingredient in their Eczema treatment formula).</li>
            <li> I have used them over the years and they only helped me temporarily and the itch would come back flair up again after a few days.  </li>
            <li> You will see the difference even after a single application.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from eczema all my life...from my face down to my legs and have used all kinds of lotions and potions that claim to help with my &#x27;extra dry skin.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Within a couple days of applying at least once per day (supplemented with a very small amount of prescribed medicated ointment), I noticed a huge difference-</li>
            <li> I am 24 years old and have had eczema for the past 23 years of my life.</li>
            <li> Her skin is soft and not flaky like it usually is after the steroid clears the eczema.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting that and was afraid it was going to make it worse, but it continually looked better, not worse.  </li>
            <li> Some of the people who left negative reviews seemed to have an allergic reaction to it, so i first tried it on a small patch of skin to see if he&#x27;d react.</li>
            <li> It was really hot though and that supposed to make it worse.  </li>
            <li> once before bed and some of the spots stayed consistent instead of getting worse.  </li>
            <li> This was too greasy feeling, yet also not very absorbant and then didn&#x27;t stay long once it did.</li>
            <li> A few other products have little or no effect for me, but most actually make it worse, including other products said to be for Eczema.</li>
            <li> My red patch swelling went down, the dryness on my face disappeared overnight, and the redness itself was gone in 3 days.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m down to applying it only in the morning.</li>
            <li> I only need a pea-sized amount for each arm and a 1-inch squeeze for each leg, so a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I will definitely keep purchasing this because my skin gets dry especially due to different seasons.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t pay much attention to it and after a few months it become worse and the parch become bigger, red and inflamed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It began getting red, irritated, scaly, angry and very very itchy.</li>
            <li> When used that frequently other creams left a residue and most of them still had a bad sting.  </li>
            <li> Before I found this lotion my hands were so red and dry that when I bent my fingers my skin cracked and bled, not to mention the burning and itching!!!!</li>
            <li> For the past 6 years, I have been suffering from Eczema or Dermatitis particularly on my forehead, and it was getting worse and worse over time, the areas come larger, itchier and more noticeable due to dark patches.  </li>
            <li> It is SO DRY here!</li>
            <li> I will continue using this for the rest of my life as a weapon against dry skin and eczema!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for 6 years, and I&#x27;ve had absolutely no eczema flare-ups since then, except if the air is exceptionally dry</li>
            <li> I still have to occasionally use OTC steroid cream, but much less often now</li>
            <li> I would wear foundation because my skin had red blotches and dry patches all over it, but after an hour the foundation would just look uneven and flaky wherever the dry patches were.  </li>
            <li> The only other thing I would use while dealing with a flare up other than medicine would be petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> She seldom gets outbreaks and when she does it&#x27;s only on her hands usually between or around her fingers (probably from not drying hands properly after washing them).</li>
            <li> Recently the hot, humid weather of summer has hit us and my skin weirdly reacted to it with a vengeance.</li>
            <li> First, I bought a small tube of regular Aveeno daily moisturiser and would apply it to the worst parts of my face on top of the Cerave.</li>
            <li> I squeeze out maybe an inch to an inch and a half of product and rub it into my entire face.</li>
            <li> but it definitely makes my eyes itch less</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY thing that even slightly works on my toddler&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li> So I was estatic to find it online and around the same price, though I wish it cost less.</li>
            <li> I STRONGLY recommend this to anyone who suffers from eczema.</li>
            <li> She said it did absolutely nothing to slow down her ecZema outbreaks on the bottom of her feet.</li>
            <li> I get heat rash and eczema in summer and very dry skin in winter.</li>
            <li> I suffer with very dry skin...</li>
            <li> So I recommend this product to others with very dry skin.</li>
            <li> A must if you have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried hydrocortisone 2.5%, eucerin lotion for very dry skin,</li>
            <li> sooths very dry and scaling skin immediately...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have eczema, but the skin on my hands is very dry and can get ashy.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and daughter have very dry skin</li>
            <li> If your baby have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I had very dry patches on my hands for a while.  </li>
            <li> My three year old son has pretty bad eczema on his left leg.  </li>
            <li> So far, it has only been a few days, but I am seeing results with this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on my arm, and didn&#x27;t check it for hours, but when I Did, a small patch had smoothed out a lot and the redness was leaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this cream because my baby gets red and irritated in the little folds of his neck.  </li>
            <li> The eczema is still there and has actually increased a little.</li>
            <li> When taking my little one a bath I use a lot of different products plus this!</li>
            <li> Every lotion to this point has moisturized a little bit but also irritate it at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I tried some hydrocortizone cream and it worked a little, but somehow I happened across this stuff on Amazon and all of a sudden slapped myself on the forehead when I saw the word \\&quot;Eczema\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I went to a dermatologist and paid big bucks for prescriptions that were of little help.  </li>
            <li> It actually made it a little itchy.</li>
            <li> During the dry winter months I experience extreme cracking, scaling on my finders and finger tips.</li>
            <li> I know it did for me, until I finally realized I am sensitive to Parabens, a very common preservative in the cosmetics industry.</li>
            <li> It works OK in the summer when my skin isn&#x27;t as bad, but in the winter is when I get flare-ups</li>
            <li> Too bad this is the largest size, but this is already one of the most expensive products from the line, so I can only imagine how much that would cost.</li>

            <li> It is even helping to clear up the Dyshidrosis on my palm which I have been suffering from for at least 3 months now.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s 52 empty containers.  </li>
            <li> I only had few on the knees before I applied Aveeno.</li>
            <li> , it is expensive for a bottle of lotion (we bought it for $12 at CVS), but worth it.  </li>
            <li> I also had rough scaly patches and skin</li>
            <li> I never get the rough patches on my skin anymore.</li>
            <li> After 1 1/2 years in the hospital from a severe MRSA infection of the spine (coma, surgeries)</li>
            <li> After a few days of daily use it was all gone, - no itch, sores, nada.</li>
            <li> I rub it onto my skin after I shower and my skin is still wet.</li>
            <li> I continued to put it on a few times throughout the day the next day, and it made a noticeable difference in just a day!</li>
            <li> I really do not like using lotion, if I do, I have to wash my hands cause of the greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> and I was diagnosed with eczema a few months back.</li>
            <li> The third dermatologist prescribed a heavy duty antibiotic, Doxycycline, which made me so nauseous</li>
            <li> Noticed an improvement in a few days, and almost entirely eliminated it in a month.</li>
            <li> Use it after a shower or bath when your skin is still somewhat wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent YEARS trying to heal my eczema.  </li>
            <li> and it works well without leaving a greasy feeling or wet feeling which they absolutey</li>
            <li> And I have spent A LOT of money trying to find it.</li>
            <li> I expected that though.  </li>
            <li> It is not oily and the smell is minimal.  </li>
            <li> It becomes rough and flaky at the slightest provocation.</li>
            <li> , however, the product I ordered had a broken seal and when I called Aveeno about it they were very concerned and said not to use it with no seal.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend who was having unknown skin peeling issue on her hand.</li>
            <li> , you might need to try a few different creams to see what works...</li>
            <li> We have spent hundreds and hundreds on doctors visits, steroids, and tried every lotion on the market.  </li>
            <li> Cleared Eczema in only a few days.</li>
            <li> But by then my poor skin was so irritated that just a gentle touch would send me into itching</li>
            <li> but actually makes it worse for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Unlike Aveeno which has alcohol in it that dries out your skin worse, This booklet contains natural remedies that will not only \\&quot;cover\\&quot; up your eczema, but also help to heal it!</li>
            <li> After nearly two months of struggling with it, I got a hydrocortisone cream only to end up worse.</li>
            <li> I have miserable stasis eczema and this really does help......not a cure, but it feels much better when I use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not normally an eczema sufferer, but I recently developed a bad (itchy, flaky, red, peeling) rash as a reaction to a particular sunscreen I had used.  </li>
            <li> We tried aquaphor, Vaseline, pure Argan oil (really expensive!), chinese herbal capsules, unrefined shea butter, organic extra virgin coconut oil----nothing worked!  </li>
            <li> I had a bad skin rash on my right hand for 6 months and went to several dermatologists who all said different things.</li>
            <li> Just be patient and believe me its well worth the $12 I paid for it (already spent hundreds buying other useless stuff).</li>
            <li> It also left the skin looking very white and thin / flat.</li>
            <li> The stuff works, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> and it was embarrassing and uncomfortable to me since it was on my right hand.  </li>
            <li> The side-effect these drugs caused my forehead skin thinny, dry and dark patches.  </li>
            <li> This is an off white half cream, half gel.</li>
            <li> Less itchy feeling and less red and patchy.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this new product to anyone who suffers with similar conditions as I have.  </li>
            <li> After just one use there was a noticeable improvement with less itchiness and dry skin.</li>
            <li> After daily application for a week dramatic improvement, the rough dark areas receded and within three week they were nearly gone.</li>
            <li> For 20 years I had recurring eczema on my forehead and cheeks that I would keep only slightly under control with Psoriasin, it would help a little, but I was fighting a losing battle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little lotion goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long  way and we&#x27;ve found that 2 bottles every 3 months is what we use.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I apply every day, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> AND a little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> I felt very very worried and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> If I only put it on in the mornings, my skin gets dry and itchy by the late afternoon.</li>
            <li> I was using a steroid cream, but stopped due to concerns about thinning skin.  </li>
            <li> In other words, I have no doubts that it&#x27;s the cream that&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I don&#x27;t know of a cream that works any other way, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s the oats because the other Aveeno cream I had didn&#x27;t help</li>
            <li> I get what I think is eczema on a couple fingers and a small spot on the back of my hand and wrist.</li>
            <li> smell (other than a hint of oatmeal).</li>
            <li> After reading the horrible side effects, especially when applied on the eyelid, we definitely sought to find a better solution.  </li>
            <li> Not a pretty sight.  </li>
            <li> The red bumps have almost dissapeared and no more itch.  </li>
            <li> I have chronic eczema on my face as well as other areas.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of other options including Gold Bond</li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;ll get it mildly in other places like my face or arms.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s giving me more pimples :(</li>
            <li> I bought other types cream of Aveeno which all had the sealed tin.  </li>
            <li> This has been the only thing (and we&#x27;ve tried a few!)</li>
            <li> No pimples or any other issues.</li>
            <li> The cream is smoother and moister than other Aveeno creams and lotion.</li>
            <li> After using cream, it last longer than usual one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, but I admit that I suffocate my eczema with layers of this just in case!</li>
            <li> I swim a mile every other day in a chlorinated pool which dries and irritates my skin.  </li>
            <li> Itchiness goes away, but other brands helped with itchiness too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: I also use other products along with the Aveeno to help relieve the rash.</li>
            <li> It is extremely soothing and absorbs well ~ not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Other lotions can irritate, itch, or burn my hands but not this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d use other lotions we had</li>
            <li> If Subscribe &amp; Save from Amazon with 4 other products, you can save up to 15% on each item.</li>
            <li> I have eczema on my eyelids and other eye creams seemed to bother the eczema.  </li>
            <li> It did not irritate my skin at all, but it also did not help with extreme dryness and itchiness.</li>
            <li> For the past month or so my ezcema hasn&#x27;t been itchy so much as red and flaky.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product at first because I did not believe it could help me</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it gives her some relief &amp; it doesn&#x27;t irritate or cause any other reactions.</li>
            <li> These worked to some extent but made the skin extremely oily (</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to stop using it and stick to other lotions and vaseline</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m treating it with other products</li>
            <li> Nothing else ever worked for me even other Aveeno products.</li>
            <li> Putting coconut oil onto your Little ones skin before bath will reduce the chance of making their skin dry.</li>
            <li> but seriously, I would probably pay ten times the asking price as long as it keeps the eczema away.</li>
            <li> Immediately cools down your skin from a rough eczema day.</li>
            <li> Only a few little spots were visible.  </li>
            <li> My skin is crazy sensitive (I&#x27;m an adult - not a baby)</li>
            <li> Active ingredient 1% oatmeal?  </li>
            <li> but I am actively looking for another product.  </li>
            <li> It lasts long but not greasy, and there&#x27;s no strong smell.</li>
            <li> we probably should cut back or eliminate irritating soaps and detergents as much as possible ....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m less dry and less itchy</li>
            <li> Anyway, if you decide to buy this and it slightly (only slightly!) irritates your skin, just stick with it anyway for a few days to see if it continues.</li>
            <li> The very first time I used it though, I didn&#x27;t like it because it made my hands burn like crazy because of my cracked skin from the eczema..</li>
            <li> My daughter was born (Oct 2013) with little rough patches on her arms and legs.</li>
            <li> Also, because it is a little oily it actually sinks into your skin.</li>
            <li> I found it for 4-5 dollars less on other sites and stores.</li>
            <li> Aveeno&#x27;s other moisturizing lotions are not adequate substitutes for this.</li>
            <li> As for the woman who didn&#x27;t take her Dr.&#x27;s advice on the possible oats allergy and applied it yet again to her baby, hard to believe.</li>
            <li> I have almost used it up within two weeks, and it would be expensive to order so much of it.</li>
            <li> I use the Hydro on my hands at least once, daily, just to keep outbreaks in check.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s winter here and the temperature has been below average).  </li>
            <li> I finally went to another dermatologist and was prescribed Ketaconazole and Hydrocortizone (at least this time I was told not to keep using the steroid cream).  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s worth it, not having to deal with agonizing itching and looking like a diseased person.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the Aveeno is expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:</li>
            <li> I apply this on my baby&#x27;s face and on any part of his body that has eczema flare-ups at least 3 times daily.</li>
            <li> Useless cream, does absolutely nothing for eczema.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but really helps protect and heal cracked skin.  </li>
            <li> Certainly recommend for anyone living in a dry and cold climate.</li>
            <li> The eczema has calmed down.  </li>
            <li> My mother came down to visit and said that this cream had helped her eczema and that we might want to give it a whirl.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t put down the product as some did, some things just don&#x27;t work for some people.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s just learned to say &amp;#34;itch&amp;#34; and she will crawl over to the changing station and pull this down when the patches on her hips flare up.</li>
            <li> It has a smell of oat and calms the rash/Eczema down.</li>
            <li> (I recognize the ingredients in this lotion from other products I use and know that I&#x27;m not allergic to any of them!)  </li>
            <li> so I was a little reluctant to try this, thinking it would be like all the other things we have tried.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a little greasier than the other Aveeno lotions</li>
            <li> It started to spread on my eyelid and then to my other eye!</li>
            <li> By evening I notice this cheeks turned red and became more bumpy, and when I applied the product again, he screamed so hard it shocked me because he never cry so hard.</li>
            <li> The treatment left my hands and arms looking terrible, with deep red, rough, itchy splotches and after the initial treatment I used, as prescribed,  cortisone 3 x daily for a proscribed period.</li>
            <li> I have a small persistent spot of dry skin on my neck that is bothersome throughout the summer months.</li>
            <li> For my face, Pond&#x27;s dry skin cream works (the blue one) but for the front of my neck, the dry skin can get really bad &amp; start to feel really dry and rough within a matter of minutes after stepping out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Feels *slightly* greasy, but it might just be the moisturizing effect taking place.</li>
            <li> After reading previous reviews on this product I decided I had to try it out.</li>
            <li> I suffered from eczema for years and typically had to go to the doctor twice a year for a shot and prescription.  </li>
            <li> I typically get eczema on the backs of one or both hands in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I find this one to be ever so slightly thicker.</li>
            <li> After reading that it has a black label from the FDA for causing cancer, I never even picked it up.  </li>
            <li> One thing I do want to mention is sometimes after I put it on and it soaks in, it stings slightly.  </li>
            <li> It was cleared up almost 100% in less than a day.</li>
            <li> The dryness continued but it kept on reducing, so did the redness and the slight swelling.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Target and it has literally changed my skin in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> I typically use a cheaper lotion after washing my hands (unscented Vaseline) but mix this in every now and then or when my hands are feeling a bit itchy and it does the trick.</li>
            <li> No more dry skin in the winter months!</li>
            <li> I was having a slight case of eczema...</li>
            <li> (I was just that itchy) and soon felt less need to apply it.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars even if I saw a slight change but</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I have been using it on my arms and legs to help with typical wintery dryness.</li>
            <li> Previously he&#x27;d spend 5 or 10 minutes just looking intently at where he&#x27;s scratching almost studying the event.</li>
            <li> within 2-3 days my skin started to itch less, and began showing signs of recovery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more dry, flakey, or itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Aveeno!</li>
            <li> Been using it for 2 and a half days</li>
            <li> , hope my son will recover to his previous condition soon.</li>
            <li> So when eczema broke out again recently, I tried an over-the-counter cream with steroid, which caused angry red welts on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Our baby has a slight degree of eczema on the tummy and legs.</li>
            <li> After 1 night the redness and bumps were cut in half and each day they fade even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff does about a half job for me...</li>
            <li> I use a toner, then use half a dime size amount of Aveeno Eczema Cream, and then my BB cream.</li>
            <li> It has an odd texture and consistency but it seems to help.</li>
            <li> but since we started using this cream, we had to use the medicated stuff a lot less.</li>
            <li> When I first moved to El Paso, I had dry skin, but it wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> Later it spread to her arms, shoulders, thighs, back of legs and really bad on her back.</li>
            <li> Goes on thick but doesn&#x27;t stay greasy for long.  </li>
            <li> PLEASE TRY THIS IF OTHER CREAMS/OINTMENTS/LOTIONS ONLY SEEM TO MAKE YOUR CONDITION WORSE.</li>
            <li> We have aloe used Vaseline on the little one before bed and that helped with his eczema too, this lotion is just less greasy.</li>
            <li> so whenever I eat chocolate dairy and gluten my arms get this huge disgusting patch of eczema and even worse I get it right between my eye brows</li>
            <li> I had severe dark rough areas on both my knuckles for the past three winters, tried a lot of different creams and moisturizers, nothing worked, some products even made it worse.</li>
            <li> last few weeks, my right hand was turning red and miserable.</li>
            <li> When I did finally have a breakout, it wasnt nearly as bad as it normally is.  </li>
            <li> But gradually her skin was back to normal, and she hasn&#x27;t scratched badly like before.</li>
            <li> I have been using a steroid cream for my eyelids because the doc said it&#x27;s too bad that I need to get it in control quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried expensive medical creams that reduced the itching but didn&#x27;t solve the problem long term.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother our son at all, and I&#x27;m a little relieved that it doesn&#x27;t have any of those obnoxious scents.  </li>
            <li> My skin flares up with little itchy bumps.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my little on 4 times a day to notice a difference in my little ones skin</li>
            <li> I use coconut oil before I put my little one to take a bath.</li>
            <li> It helped a little, but never made it go away.  </li>
            <li> Every time I get a little eczema</li>
            <li> BUT A LITTLE PRICEY..</li>
            <li> Try to miss it up with a little aquaphor and apply on your baby&#x27;s affected areas or all over the body.</li>
            <li> I have face eczema one or twice a year for the past 3 years due to allergy, and it always disappear after a steroid shot and a week of prescription pills.</li>
            <li> It is a little sticky for about 10 minutes after application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather be a little oily than how I was before, anyway.  </li>
            <li> My son has eczema on his little hands.  </li>
            <li> On my little guy I apply this lotion once in the morning and once in the evening.</li>
            <li> He will get some little bumps on his body.</li>
            <li> I cannot put five stars because I found it a little bit pricey.</li>
            <li> It can get a little caked on.</li>
            <li> and I should have just put a little bit on her face and body to test it out before putting it all over her.</li>
            <li> If I have a little bit of itching start up</li>
            <li> I had been applying expensive body butter 3-4 times daily, then added baby oil twice a day as well and was still constantly dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li> I mean that there are some dry patches here</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t just mean slightly dry either.</li>
            <li> It broke my heart to see them scratching their little spots till they cracked and bled even though I was applying Vaseline heavily to the areas.</li>
            <li> I had burning eyes that were very painful, lines and wrinkles, and tight dried and dark patches around my eyes which looked pretty gross.</li>
            <li> On rare occasions for really bad flare ups</li>
            <li> I am still giving this product four stars because it did clear up my eczema, but it just seems expensive for the quantity (about 7 oz).</li>
            <li> It also left my cheeks looking weird, pink and like a layer of skin had been removed.  </li>
            <li> When your skin is irritated, the last thing you should do is put an unnecessary fragrance on it</li>
            <li> Aveeno is the only product I can use and not have any flare ups to make it worse.  </li>
            <li> I thought I had just wasted money.</li>
            <li> This winter being as harsh as it has proved to need additional solutions to help my skin.  </li>
            <li> After I apply it, I wait a few minutes and then add my hydrocortisone cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> My son has skin conditions so he needs to use moisturizing cream everyday.</li>
            <li> I started putting it on his face and body after his bath to help seal in the moisture and within a few days his skin improved dramatically.</li>
            <li> I now use it almost everyday on my 2 daughters after bath.</li>
            <li> I bought one Aveeno Moisturizing cream (Eczema Therapy) a few days ago.</li>
            <li> i gave it a try a few time , but</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a noticeable difference everyday.</li>
            <li> know how frustrating it can be to deal with eczema especially if it&#x27;s on your face.</li>
            <li> It is soft on the skin, but unfortunately didnt help with his eczema at all.</li>
            <li> After a few days of this it went away.</li>
            <li> Dead sea mud mask</li>
            <li> After 4 weeks of this, I went for a followup (and after nearly $100 in copays), I decided to give this a shot instead of continuing with a treatment that made me feel uncomfortable (</li>
            <li> After a few weeks the rash had disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;Flash</li>
            <li> so I can save a few cents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Im almost tempted to use it as an everyday cream.</li>
            <li> I have not been formally diagnosed with eczema, but a few years ago we moved to a desert climate.</li>
            <li> It disappears for two days and reappear for 2 days for about a month, and suddenly it got worse that I could not stand it anymore.</li>
            <li> I cancelled my dermatologist appointment and switched to using the cream once every few days just as a preventative measure.</li>
            <li> helped my niece a lot during her skin problem when her skin dried up and got scratches.</li>
            <li> I did not want to use anything with steroids on my eye, especially since that can thin your skin.</li>
            <li> And it took a few days to work.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle cream, so don&#x27;t expect it will fix your skin problem after a few applies.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost gone within a few days of using it morning and night.</li>
            <li> My hands were so dried out and chapped, but within a couple of days of using Aveeno, they started softening up.  </li>
            <li> I do have to still apply it nightly, and when I forget to put in on for a few days the bumps reappear.</li>
            <li> Alas, even using daily, it did nothing for the 50-cent-piece sized eczema patch on my wrist that flares up from time to time.  </li>
            <li> They helped for few months.</li>
            <li> face was getting worse and red when i take shower.</li>
            <li> Buy this, use it everyday and see the difference.</li>
            <li> but this definitely made my eczema worse.</li>
            <li> rash was a contact dermatitis caused by one harsh laundry detergent Surf.</li>
            <li> the weird things I would do (blending all natural oatmeal everyday and throwing it in a bath) just to make the eczema go away.</li>
            <li> Nothing seemed to really improve it, and this winter it got much worse and the creams I used even made it even worse.</li>
            <li> this is the first thing that works on my stupid dry face.</li>
            <li> Smells a bit like plain oatmeal, but not an obtrusive smell, it wears off after a few hours.</li>
            <li> but I found out that the steroid cream is addictive and has other scary side effects</li>
            <li> Plus it doesn&#x27;t have steroids and other dangerous stuff, which make me nervous - especially on a really sensitive area like my eyes.  </li>
            <li> several other OTC &amp;#34;psoriasis/eeczema lotions failed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d stop using it for a day (because my skin was raw and thin) and the rash would come back.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother fragrance allergies either which is a common problem with other lotions or creams.</li>
            <li> even plain coconut oil-</li>
            <li> Not easy to find the 7.3 oz tubes.</li>
            <li> It has cleared up in spots and is tame in others.</li>
            <li> There are less expensive moistures that I have used with the same results.</li>
            <li> worst spots are his legs (particularly knees) and his arms (particularly wrists).</li>
            <li> My daughter has eczema pretty bad</li>
            <li> After a small application, my daughter started crying and saying \\&quot;It hurts me!\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I get a few small flare ups,  but this keeps it in check and has saved my hundreds in doctor visits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past few months</li>
            <li> dried up and flacky, no more.  </li>
            <li> At least now they&#x27;ve narrowed it down.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and was skeptic, but still bought it since my skin looked like raw meat from all the clawing I did.</li>
            <li> Unrefined Raw Shea Butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lanolin caused such a bad reaction that I had eczema all over my legs, torso, back, and the inside of my arms.  </li>
            <li> My friend suffers from winter time cold weather eczema on his hands, this worked for him in one day, a few days later he had no further problems when used daily.</li>
            <li> made the dry skin worse</li>
            <li> Reduced the severity of my eczema at least by half.</li>
            <li> It leaves a thick, weird residue that isn&#x27;t helpful when you&#x27;re skin is already sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have a little bit of eczema on my arms and after using this product twice, it was gone!</li>
            <li> It may just be me and my skin is particularly bad because there are a lot of positive reviews</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with eczema on my hands, and having a sensitive skin and working with bare hands, cold and hot temperatures made it worst.</li>
            <li> I then moved on to moisturizers, which did very little.</li>
            <li> This has never happened to me in the summer before, but it was just so painful and the Cerave stung so much while having no effect that I knew I would have to change products.  </li>
            <li> Soaks in and makes my awful eczema effected hands feel SO much better.  </li>
            <li> and I usually need to apply lotion after.  </li>
            <li> tried cocoa butter, coconut oil, Aquafor, and various (and sometimes expensive) hand creams...</li>
            <li> /&gt;After two days of using the Aveeno my small strip of eczema is almost gone.  </li>
            <li> It actually made my eczema WORSE!  </li>
            <li> I think it is a small price to pay.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I can give all the credit to Aveeno as I started off on a steroid creme to remove the flareup</li>
            <li> I have a small patch of recurring eczema on my chin.</li>
            <li> I tried different types of creams - expensive ones - and none worked.  </li>
            <li> My 2 year old suffers from eczema</li>
            <li> My 2 year old suffers</li>
            <li> It is really unbelievable to me how well this has worked.  </li>
            <li> I have had eczema since I was a small child</li>
            <li> I am not sure if there is any difference between this and the Aveeno Baby Eczema cream.  </li>
            <li> A small miracle.</li>
            <li> Within a few hours I saw a difference with this cream -- no joke!</li>
            <li> or if I find myself washing my hands excessively.</li>
            <li> Now the tingling is gone and while the welts are still there, they are not red and angry anymore.  </li>
            <li> he even has a small travel sized one he carries around with him.</li>
            <li> After trying some expensive steroid creams and such, a friend suggested I try eczema lotion.</li>
            <li> After a while small blisters started to form and the skin became unbearably itchy.</li>
            <li> Works as described but not sure it truly works for those with Eczema.</li>
            <li> I went to the hospital as usual and got a shot and a week of pills.</li>
            <li> After trying every product recommended to me for the past year with no changes I heard about this from the cashier at the store.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was eczema.</li>
            <li> I took before and after pics but not sure how to post</li>
            <li> Im not sure how it works for excema</li>
            <li> Small bumps started forming.  </li>
            <li> If anything, this seemed to make my skin extra angry, though I fruitlessly continued, hoping it was just taking its time to react.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll become an oil slick immediately.</li>
            <li> I use Aveeno every day and no more rash, no more itch.</li>
            <li> and it has helped with my skin, although it is not a magical cure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every expensive cream and treatment that you can imagine but keep going back to this.</li>
            <li> I have had weird red, non-itchy patches on my face for 6 months now</li>
            <li> All day it left this weird, greasy film on my skin.</li>
            <li> Eventually it stopped I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to avoid the nasty cracking in the skin on my fingers.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure how well it will go.</li>
            <li> It have small rosacea problem on my face.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> Within a few days of applying this stuff, they all vanished!</li>
            <li> No more flaky skin on face and no more breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what is going on</li>
            <li> Other lotions made it worse, hydrocortizone ointment did nothing (usually it&#x27;d at least help), and hourly applications of coconut oil helped a little bit.  </li>
            <li> Then for some reason, after I went home for the holidays and came back, the dry skin was really bad.</li>
            <li> Before starting my review about this product in particular, I want to share a few observations about this nasty skin condition:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, lets just say that it did burn a bit initially (duh, what you&#x27;d expect if my skin was irritated and raw??)</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was wary of how much this lotion would work.</li>
            <li> expensive prescriptions drugs [3] side-effect of steroid products which cause skin thinny, dry and patchy.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend has been using it for 3 weeks - he had some random dry itchy spots on his skin; but now they are gone.</li>
            <li> Lately I have been waking up in the middle of the night with painfully itchy legs from the knees down.</li>
            <li> The skin in the affected area wasn&#x27;t as hard, scaly or flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was so itchy it was hard to sit still at work and not scratch my legs and arms.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used this lotion for about 3 weeks and we can hardly tell it&#x27;s been depleted at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you could hardly see a thing.  </li>
            <li> And we hardly every apply the lotion.  </li>
            <li> now we hardly ever use that stuff.</li>
            <li> We have hard water and my skin was taking a beating until I found this.</li>
            <li> So with that being said i do  know how hard eczema is and trying to find the solution.</li>
            <li> Its hard to find a non prescription quality eczema cream.</li>
            <li> It was a little thin, but it seemed to keep everything at bay.  </li>
            <li> Since that isn&#x27;t avoidable my hands were in constant distress and all my doctors thought to do was prescribe stariod creams that did little if applied daily and the side effects are awful.</li>
            <li> It was bad enough that I regularly got questions about what was wrong with my hands.</li>
            <li> My two year old has bad eczema since she was 2month .she</li>
            <li> I just apply it two times a day at least and it keeps my babies</li>
            <li> Some of the reviewers have complained about the price but to end his suffering</li>
            <li> in all, a definite buy if you find yourself itching like crazy.</li>
            <li> A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH ECZEMA ARE ALLERGIC TO COMMON INGREDIDENTS LIKE OATMEAL.</li>
            <li> But because of those tests, I could not take any allergy pills for at least 5 days and steroid shot/pills for 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a common story amongst eczema sufferers, you&#x27;ve tried all the ointments, creams and lotions out there</li>
            <li> Not really a fan of steroids and finding out that it was a really expensive co-pay</li>
            <li> At least then my family might stop breaking the lid.</li>
            <li> and I just had to put moisturizer on to alleviate it, moving to a cold place with low humidity</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my daughter for at least a year now</li>
            <li> duh</li>
            <li> and I always buy at least three bottles at a time.</li>
            <li> With Triple Cream, Eucerin and Aquaphor they will be greasy for at least an hour.</li>
            <li> They continued to worsen and spread to some spots on his back and tummy, and I was desperate to get them under control before they worsened to weeping eczmea.  </li>
            <li> consistency isn&#x27;t too thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thick and sticky that I can&#x27;t absorb into your skin.</li>
            <li> If I would stop using it for a few days it would become worse.</li>
            <li> It is thick, lasts, and improves the dryness of my skin.</li>
            <li> It is not the thick formula.</li>
            <li> and it seems to be helping about as much as the hydrocortisone, except without all the steroid crap</li>
            <li> However, it made the rash worse on my arm, and I had trouble sleeping because my skin got stick to the sheets.</li>
            <li> Expensive compare to the other Aveeno moisturizing creams.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the Aveeno brand, however this item was delivered without the usual seal and had residue on the cap and opening as if it had been used!</li>
            <li> Just because you can eat oatmeal doesn&#x27;t mean you can put it on your skin.</li>
            <li> its not a magic cure!</li>
            <li> But in the mean time, he is using this product and has seen improvement.  </li>
            <li> I mean</li>
            <li> and just because it worked for me doesn&#x27;t mean it will work for everyone.</li>
            <li> I mean it gets to the point where it&#x27;ll crack and bleed.</li>
            <li> Poor little guy!</li>
            <li> Poor little thing!</li>
            <li> I mean it seriously works.</li>
            <li> Normally I keep her covered neck to toe because if I didn&#x27;t, she would scratch herself bloody in that area.</li>
            <li> It made my eczema break out even worse than usual.</li>
            <li> that ridiculous price..</li>
            <li> but today, Sunday May 22nd - only 3 days after initial application, my nasty rash DISAPPEARED, as if nothing was there.</li>
            <li> Subscribe and Save option is drastically less expensive than buying  at the stores here.  </li>
            <li> Seriously?  </li>
            <li> And now, I buy on Amazon... much less expensive here.  </li>
            <li> but seriously, hang in there.</li>
            <li> It DOES NOT have a \\&quot;medicine\\&quot; or \\&quot;serious lotion\\</li>
            <li> My son suffers from eczema and hasn&#x27;t had a single break out since I started using this after every shower.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it severe eczema, but it&#x27;s extremely itchy and uncomfortable, and I wind up scratching it and making it worse.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I squeezed a little on my finger</li>
            <li> It was really bad and this seriously seemed to start working instantly.</li>
            <li> Hot showers were so painful as were really cold days.</li>
            <li> I have such bad eczema on my fingers in winter months.</li>
            <li> When my son&#x27;s eczema was really bad we would do two short baths a day and apply this immediately after.</li>
            <li> I put this all over her body and face and the next morning it got so bad</li>
            <li> And once it&#x27;s absorbed, it helps the relieve pain from the worst areas that have cracked.</li>
            <li> , I used to use steroid creams,which was not good for me.</li>
            <li> and this is the only cream I can use on my face that treats the sometimes painful rash/flaking I get with when I have a flare-up.</li>
            <li> I have annoying adult onset eczema that I inherited from my mom.</li>
            <li> I do have horrible dry skin in the winter and wanted a deep moisturizer.</li>
            <li> but the smell is not pleasant.</li>
            <li> While the Vaseline works, it&#x27;s not pleasant to be covered in the stuff all the time.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you that this is the FIRST time I&#x27;ve had to deal with eczema, BUT had a horrible flare up on my neck/upper chest since St. Patty&#x27;s Day - OVER 2 MONTHS!</li>
            <li> It usually lasts for weeks and is all itchy and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> We use this lotion once a day before bed or after a bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having struggled with them suffering with eczema for so long and buying heaps of products that don&#x27;t work and feeling frustrated I was relieved to find something</li>
            <li> My daughter had a bad flare up while visiting family is Colorado where it&#x27;s really dry</li>
            <li> They get to the point where they&#x27;re painful, and some would even turn into dry clumps/balls/clusters that looked like pimples, but weren&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Each winter, I&#x27;ve noticed my hands have become itchy, dry, flaky and painful.</li>
            <li> No more bleeding, no more patches, no more annoying eczema.</li>
            <li> This product is very thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not sure how this cream would work in a severe eczema flare up, but since using it, I haven&#x27;t had the chance to get one!!</li>
            <li> Awaome lotion no more eczema!!</li>
            <li> and while I personally don&#x27;t have eczema, as a mother, it&#x27;s the worst feeling to see your baby crying about itchy rashes</li>
            <li> but it got worse</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s even worse.  </li>
            <li> my eczemagot even worse.</li>
            <li> My condition gets worse during the Fall/Winter season.</li>
            <li> The reason it made your eczema worse is because this ointment is oatmeal: food for teh fungus.</li>
            <li> , it stings and caused my eczema to get worse around my eyes.</li>
            <li> this product still doesn&#x27;t help me out but makes it worse.  </li>
            <li> Every time I used the Ketaconazole, the rash became even worse.  </li>
            <li> after the week - it got worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months and his skin is worse than it was when we started.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t clog your pores and I haven&#x27;t broken out from it at all.  </li>
            <li> made it worse</li>
            <li> I felt like I could not win.</li>
            <li> Medicated balms tend to make it worse.</li>
            <li> and then worse again.</li>
            <li> Well, this product made my condition worse.</li>
            <li> but none of it seems to help or even makes it worse.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has eczema on his hands which are worse and he will see the dermatologist soon.  </li>
            <li> I was having an annoying rash under my eye for several months.</li>
            <li> My face is worse than it has ever been before.</li>
            <li> Really helps keep those nasty finger splits at bay...</li>
            <li> Sorry, but this is not effective.</li>
            <li> I had purchased two tubes and both had the seal broken.</li>
            <li> I hate paying $7-10 for a lotion, but when it actually works I&#x27;ll pay it.</li>
            <li> was very annoyed after reading the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Just taking a shower was torture for my hands, and my doctor-prescribed steroid cream was drying my skin out so badly that none of the other recommended lotions could keep up.</li>
            <li> Like a lot of other reviewers, I bought this lotion in desperation during a bad bout of puffy, itchy, wrinkly eczema on my EYELIDS (where you cannot put prescription cream).</li>
            <li> Seriously this is a miracle product!</li>
            <li> I used to have horrible problems with the skin on my hands, particularly during the winter.</li>
            <li> I have had the worst, most painful eczema and was so sick and tired of trying lotions that just didn&#x27;t work - or would work for a few days and then stop (AmLactin - ugh!</li>
            <li> I was so frustrated dealing with it and was starting to get to the point where I was desperate and nothing my doc was giving me helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Last summer was particularly brutal.</li>
            <li> Once I reached my 20s, it came back and it was brutal.</li>
            <li> this small 100ml tube is almost gone already, after a mere 3 days!</li>
            <li> I had it bad on both hands for months, but the prescription ointment cleared it up in a few days.</li>
            <li> I have horrible eyelid eczema and recently developed eczema around my neck too.</li>
            <li> I tried to call the pediatrician&#x27;s office to make an appointment on Friday but the office was closed, so i decided to look for a temporary solution over the weekend to put my LO out of the annoying itchiness.</li>
            <li> this past winter i had a really bad flare up</li>
            <li> He has had a bad case of eczema for the past 8 months.</li>
            <li> sometimes Ill use it all over my face, and sometimes I just apply the lotion to my t-zone and spread it outwards onto my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was wrong about this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I was left with a skin condition that that made life miserable, - itching,sores and even bleeding.</li>
            <li> She recently had a horrible flair up</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical when I purchased this.</li>
            <li> Im just sad</li>
            <li> Yes, the expensive prescription creams worked, but my insurance doesn&#x27;t cover them because eczema is a \\&quot;cosmetic\\&quot; condition.  </li>
            <li> It does not smell weird, and my daughter loves it too.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I don&#x27;t need fragrance to add to my skin irritation woes.</li>
            <li> unfortunately it worsened my itching.</li>
            <li> but I was getting a lot of heat rashes this summer and this cream worked while the others failed.</li>
            <li> Oils, expensive lotions, toxic smelling ointments - all to no avail.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird, I don&#x27;t understand it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have had to downgrade this review from 5 to 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for almost 8 months now, and sadly I am still battling eczema.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect wonders if you have really troubled skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> i agree it&#x27;s a bit of the expensive side, i buy it at target and while yea it&#x27;s pricey...</li>
            <li> Ill keep an eye out and see how it goes.</li>
            <li> I tried prescriptions, and expensive doctor recommended lotions and nothing helped.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so sorry.</li>
            <li> but it just didnt work and actually made it worst.</li>
            <li> I tried all emollient that I can find, and all failed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;ve had this problem since I was a child</li>
            <li> What a disappointment, and a rip-off!</li>
            <li> stopped using Momate cream immediately and after a few days the skin flared up very bad.</li>
            <li> In the past 3 years or so it has gotten much worse, spreading to my hands which is very painful and ugly to look at.  </li>
            <li> It was so bad that random people questioned what was wrong with my hands.</li>
            <li> I get bad eczema, especially in the summer time and living in the worst humidity (Texas)...</li>
            <li> I also found out that when I use this product, it leaves my skin with a weird greasy like texture which is very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> But after the worst of my eczema got away, it started to sting slightly -</li>
            <li> I have eczema on the bottom of my feet, little blisters that itch terribly, they drive me crazy.</li>
            <li> Esp at night when I wake up scratching like crazy.</li>
            <li> my baby has crazy Eczema, it doesn&#x27;t seem work...</li>
            <li> and this rash was driving me crazy.  </li>
            <li> and I was desperate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried Aveeno products but wanted to give it a try because I was so desperate.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend it to anyone that suffers from skin itchiness, eczema or dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I am afraid that it seems doesn&#x27;t work for my baby.</li>
            <li> Our youngest has horrible eczema and this lotion clears it up in just a few days.</li>
            <li> I got tired of having Eczema because it was an annoying rash for my hands.</li>
            <li> I work at a hospital and our gloves make my eczema flare up like mad</li>
            <li> Was I ever wrong!</li>
            <li> but after just one use I noticed that my little one was not scratching his legs - his eczema is so bad that it keeps him up at night - he cries because it burns - it is horrible.  </li>
            <li> and I HATE putting it on, it smells weird.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical that this would help my Eczema at all.  </li>
            <li> but it is very expensive.</li>
            <li> For me, this was a very uncomfortable product.</li>
            <li> so so bad.  </li>
            <li> It was so bad and no lotion or moisturizer would work.</li>
            <li> I use this all over and then neosporin over bad spots and using bandaids for one night/day.</li>
            <li> I had really bad eczema</li>
            <li> /&gt;However it works wonders for when I have those bad eczema days...</li>
            <li> It was so bad I was scratching up my legs every night.  </li>
            <li> I was recommended to use this by my pediatrician because my daughter had really bad excema on her face.</li>
            <li> My daughter has bad eczema between her toes.  </li>
            <li> my daughter had bad eczema in 1st 2 years of her life.</li>
            <li> My face was so bad during this period that I decided to go online and do some research.</li>
            <li> My son has bad eczema.</li>
            <li> Since I wash my hands a lot and do dishes my hands were really bad.</li>
            <li> Bad Idea.</li>
            <li> I have really bad eczema in the winter</li>
            <li> I waited until my eczema was really bad before applying the cream</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer&#x27;s daughter, I have had really bad eyelid eczema that comes and goes with seasonal allergies.</li>
            <li> What i learn is that there isn&#x27;t a cream that will work for everyone and if your baby has bad eczema</li>
            <li> I had a really bad case of eczema and did not want to use steroid cream and prednisone pills that the doctor gave me.  </li>
            <li> I had a painful attack from the lanolin in the Aquaphor, so I ordered this to use after my prescription steroid cream calmed my skin a bit.</li>
            <li> Out of desperation I purchased this and was shocked when her skin cleared within 48 hours.  </li>
            <li> I get eczema on my knuckles - it&#x27;s both painful, itchy, and unattractive.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from painful eczema on my hands that causes the skin to blister, peel, and crack when I come in contact with soap and water.</li>
            <li> Terribly painful eczema on my hands during the winter.</li>
            <li> and frankly I was shocked.</li>
            <li> It helps to sooth my skin, and allows it to heal between painful flare-ups of eczema on my hands.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly shocked.</li>
            <li> I am 16 and have food allergy induced eczema :(</li>
            <li> From where I am standing there is no cure. :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not just annoying, it&#x27;s painful.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who suffers from a terrible case of eczema on his face.  </li>
            <li> hate.  </li>
            <li> Holy crap I wish I had this years and years ago.</li>
            <li> Hate that.</li>
            <li> but I prefer this to the skin-thinning steroid cream which I hate using.</li>
            <li> it scared the crap out of me.</li>
            <li> My itching ankles were annoying my ability to get to sleep and this cream worked...</li>
            <li> I must have not applied the cream for 4 days and my daughter had a bad flare up !</li>
            <li> I hated covering myself in a steroid cream</li>
            <li> My son had very bad eczema.  </li>
            <li> Very painful when coming in contact with water or anything else since the cracking also occurs where the skin meets the nail.  </li>
            <li> Use this product if you have eczema, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I never could stand their stuff though because it smells awful, but hey, maybe it will work for you.</li>
            <li> Got this today for nasty eczema that has been on my hand for like 5 years that started when I worked in a restaurant.</li>
            <li> The cleaning chemicals ate my hand up and gave me nasty eczema.</li>
            <li> the outrageous claims companies have these days.</li>
            <li> It looked horrible.</li>
            <li> The price here is outrageous!</li>
            <li> and my hands looks horrible.   </li>
            <li> Even applying Cetaphil was making it sting horribly.</li>
            <li> The irritation is gone and I don&#x27;t have to use the nasty steroid cream anymore!!</li>
            <li> I have terrible eczema</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was miserable.</li>
            <li> They would crack, bleed, looked disgusting, and there was just no way I could walk around in the winter without a jacket.</li>
            <li> but it provides no relief and makes your skin all oily and terrible.</li>
            <li> how annoying!</li>
            <li> Aveeno products are awful for eczema.</li>
            <li> I had an awful patch of embarrassing rashes across my chest and arms.</li>
            <li> , it was AWFUL.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> We love this product and it is so soothing and works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for 6 years, and I&#x27;ve had absolutely no eczema flare-ups since then, except if the air is exceptionally dry and I miss a spot on my skin. My dermatologist recommended this lotion to me, and I&#x27;ve been using it every day ever since. I put it on my arms and legs after I get out of the shower. I only need a pea-sized amount for each arm and a 1-inch squeeze for each leg, so a little bit goes a long way. I mostly get eczema on my knees and elbows, so this regimen works well for me. Also, I don&#x27;t use body wash directly on my arms and legs to keep from scrubbing away my natural moisturizers. This is a must-have if you also suffer from eczema!</li>
            <li> this works great for eczema</li>
            <li> This lotion is helping.  I&#x27;ve tried Cera-ve with some success. Ordinary lotions seem to help very little.&lt;br /&gt;I started using it last night.  The eczema has calmed down.  What a relief.  I&#x27;ll continue to use this as I do not like medicated lotions.</li>
            <li> My eczema got better. This stuff did the trick when nothing else would.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help my eczema</li>
            <li> Does the trick keeps eczema in check and out of sight!!</li>
            <li> I use this on my 2 year olds eczema and it definitely improves it when it flares up</li>
            <li> i use it for my daughters eczema and it works wonders for her skin, its a bit sticky and if it gets in your mouth it tastes aweful, but it works</li>
            <li> Dry skin with eczema is a real problem.  This does help a lot.  I have to apply it several times a day.</li>
            <li> Adding this to the list of other-the-counter eczema lotions that just don&#x27;t work for me. Eczema on my hand, ankles, and really dry legs. This is probably better than normal lotions (does make the skin on my hand ofter), but doesn&#x27;t relieve the itching.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST product! My daughter was born (Oct 2013) with little rough patches on her arms and legs. When I mentioned it to her pediatrician, the doctor said that it was eczema and prescribed hydrocortisone gel. I didn&#x27;t like having to use it on my daughter because it was medicated, but I noticed that it worked after a while. I also noticed that because I could only use the gel on the affected areas, I was worried about the rest of her skin not getting moisturized and it was a challenge putting on moisturizer around the spots where I had applied the hydrocortisone. I needed something that was safe to use all over... the affected and unaffected areas. I decided to do some internet research to find a better solution and came across the National Eczema Associate site regarding Infants and Toddlers. They had a section about suggested moisturizers and the Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream was on the list. I purchased it, used it on my baby, and couldn&#x27;t believe the how well is worked almost immediately! My baby&#x27;s skin cleared up within a couple of days. My baby is now 13 months and there isn&#x27;t a trace of the eczema and I still use the Aveeno one-to-two times daily of my baby. I am upset that the pediatrician did not even consider over-the-counter options, but I am grateful to have found Aveeno!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product, it did help eczema with the itching and the dryness.</li>
            <li> I wish they came in larger oz containers.  I go through one of these a week.  That&#x27;s 52 empty containers.  We do recycle, but come on Aveeno.  Sell a 30 oz tub.  I don&#x27;t mind paying per oz.</li>
            <li> Have been having eczema on my legs. I&#x27;ve tried expensive medical creams that reduced the itching but didn&#x27;t solve the problem long term. My dad recommended this cream (now I sound like a commercial) and there is no visible eczema at all on my legs! They still itch sometimes but if I apply this every day the problem is mostly gone.</li>
            <li> Excellent cream.  Will always buy.</li>
            <li> No scent, doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.  Keeps your skin feeling moist, and almost damp feeling all day.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> it improves my eczema conditions, my hands feel moisturised &amp; supple! it&#x27;s probably the best product for my eczema thus far!</li>
            <li> And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.&lt;br /&gt;  [bbe]  And God said, Let there be a solid arch stretching over the waters, parting the waters from the waters.</li>
            <li> Our son was getting dry skin and we couldn&#x27;t get it stopped. This stuff did the trick. We followed other recommendations and they were right!</li>
            <li> I have had a consistent butterfly rash for the last 8 years.  In addition, I have extremely sensitive skin.  I was using a steroid cream, but stopped due to concerns about thinning skin.  I have done a lot research and tried so many products, and none of them worked until Aveeno Eczema cream.  I could see the results almost instantly.  I went a month without a rash.  When I did finally have a breakout, it wasnt nearly as bad as it normally is.  The skin in the affected area wasn&#x27;t as hard, scaly or flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally apply this lotion once a day.  If I have a rash, I apply it to the affected area to moisturize and provide relief for itchiness and burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is very moisturizing and non-greasy.  I try to be light handed because its rich.  I have oily skin, so sometimes Ill use it all over my face, and sometimes I just apply the lotion to my t-zone and spread it outwards onto my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pair my lotion with a sunblock.  For those with sun sensitivity (which is common for anyone with a butterfly / malar rash) you may want to give La Roche-Posay Anthelios 60 Ultra Light Sunscreen a try.  Its light, theres very little cast, and it doesnt cause me to breakout. Its a little pricey, but its so worth it. [[ASIN:B002CML1XE La Roche-Posay Anthelios 60 Ultra Light Sunscreen Fluid for Face, 1.7-Ounce Bottle]]</li>
            <li> Pretty picey product but works. It basically moisturizes so I blended it with the anti-itch lotion for one application for itch and moisturization.  Worked well for me.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist gave me a coupon for this so I tried it and LOVE it.  Goes on thick but doesn&#x27;t stay greasy for long.  Soaks in and makes my awful eczema effected hands feel SO much better.  I have a lot of cracks that are open.  It didn&#x27;t sting like other products have and it made the stiff skin pliable and more flexible and it stayed that way. A huge relief! It&#x27;s hard to find right now so wish I&#x27;d bought two when I got this one.</li>
            <li> Recommended to eczema sufferer. My son&#x27;s eczema since he was 6 months&#x27; old relief by this product.</li>
            <li> Great for mild ecezma.  What I love about this product is not only does it stop the itch fast but it also heals and provides great moisture.  The relief is instant and last all day.  The lotion is light and does not smell.  It left my skin feeling soft. I have pretty sensitive skin and there were no problems.  I was orginially using a medicated product that only stopped the itch and I usually need to apply lotion after.  I will be using Aveeno from now on :)</li>
            <li> When I applied this product for the first time my eczema became so red, swollen,itchy and it multiplied all over my left leg. I only had few on the knees before I applied Aveeno. I applied Aveeno for two days hoping it would help the problem based from the reviews here but it got worse that&#x27;s why I decided to stop using it. I treated my skin problem with hot water compress three times a day for 30 mins. After a day of applying very hot compresses, the eczema shrink in size, the redness became pink and it relieved the itchiness. A week after the skin problem cleared up. Aveeno didn&#x27;t work for me. The added moisture in it aggravated the eczema. If you&#x27;ll experience redness and swelling, you stop using it.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream because my baby gets red and irritated in the little folds of his neck.  It is fine as a regular moisturizer, but it didn&#x27;t do anything to help his neck - in fact, I think putting any kind of baby moisturizer on it, including this one, just irritates it.  So it&#x27;s fine for a regular after-bath cream, but I wouldn&#x27;t count on it to work miracles on those little fat rolls.</li>
            <li> This has been so great for my twin boys.  One had baby acne and dry skin so so bad.  My doctor said to use water and it would go away eventually but I read someones post on net to try this for it.  I gave it a try and it has worked so good, baby acne not all gone but its getting there.  I saw a huge difference within minutes of using it.  You must keep applying it I forgot it when we took a day trip and it started to flare up again.  It was really hot though and that supposed to make it worse.  I just apply it two times a day at least and it keeps my babies face looking so much better!!</li>
            <li> The effect is very good&lt;br /&gt;Good for my baby&lt;br /&gt;but  is not enough moisture in the winter</li>
            <li> Helps with any dry skin care needs.  I use subscribe and save so I save money and never run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for two days and can already see a marked difference.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it morning and night and the redness and scaliness of the area has mostly disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> I finally found a product that moisturizes my skin without leaving it greasy. I suffer from eczema and my doctor gave me a sample of this cream, which surprisingly works (I&#x27;ve been using Eucerin for a long time, but for about the last 8 months suffered from breakouts).  No other product worked besides Eucerin, until I discovered this Aveeno.</li>
            <li> This lotion is a MIRACLE!!!  Before I found this lotion my hands were so red and dry that when I bent my fingers my skin cracked and bled, not to mention the burning and itching!!!! I have tried numerous remedies including the moisturizing lotion/gloves from bath and body, steroid creams from doctors, lotion after lotion (which always burned to the point I had tears in my eyes!!), and nothing worked... I had truly given up when I was walking through Walmart with a friend and happened upon this lotion, and thank the LORD I did!! The very first time I put it on my hands my burning and itching stopped immediately!! It was cooling and such a relief I couldn&#x27;t stop smiling!!! I work at a hospital and our gloves make my eczema flare up like mad and until I found this lotion I had NO way to stop it. I would absolutely recommend this lotion to anyone with eczema especially on their hands (mine effects only the top of my hands wrists to finger tips, not the bottom).  IT IS AMAZING!!!! I would definitely try it out because if you were like me you have nothing to lose!!!</li>
            <li> I always have really dry itchy skin in the winter and this winter it&#x27;s even worse.  I had been applying expensive body butter 3-4 times daily, then added baby oil twice a day as well and was still constantly dry and itchy.  I was so itchy it was hard to sit still at work and not scratch my legs and arms.  My mom suggested using this and after one application, I was better.  I cannot believe it.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am finding this an effective emollient and one more of Aveeno&#x27;s products that are useful. The ones carefully formulated without fragrance are especially important to those of us who are allergic to fragrances, estimated to be a quarter of the population. (Many people haven&#x27;t yet realized what it is that causes their discomfort, coughing, sneezing, watery eyes, headache, mental confusion and worse - like asthma which if severe enough is life-threatening.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Often when skin problems are treated by medical doctors, topical preparations containing steroids are prescribed. Not everyone wishes to use steroids on a long-term basis. Perhaps, then, this cream may be useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because a potential online customer may need to know ingredients, I will list what is printed on my tube of this Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;water, glycerin, distearyldimonium chloride, panthenol, petrolatum, isopropyl palmitate, cetyl alcohol, dimethicone, Avena Sativa (oat) kernel oil, steareth020, Avena Sativa (oat) kernel extract, benzalkonium chloride, ceramide NP, sodium chloride&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Questions? Call the manufacturer at 1-866-429-3366 or visit the website.</li>
            <li> Last spring, on my 2-year-old girl&#x27;s skin her limbs and face suddenly had a lot of rashes, and she felt itchy. She had that issue since born, but was ok the winter before last spring. I didn&#x27;t want to give her much medicine, and started to try this cream. Well, it worked! Not dramatically, of course. But gradually her skin was back to normal, and she hasn&#x27;t scratched badly like before. We have been applying this cream since then.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the \\&quot;subscribe and save\\&quot; way, indeed convenient and save some.</li>
            <li> This worked in a short amount of time. I had a moderate breakout of eczema on my face and this (with the combination of .5% hydrocortizone cream and an oatmeal bath) worked in 24 hours to soothe and moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li> Great foe my 2 yr old with bad skin issues. This calms his itches down quickly. It goes thru quickly though. Maybe 2 bottles a month used 1 a night after bath.</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy, does not work wonders for my eczema. I had atopic eczema for years and this cream did nothing to help. Sure, it is really gentle and non irritating, but the moisturizing effected not that long lasting. It was alright for by hands but very unsuitable for my face! When I had flare ups, I applied this, and it did not soothe my skin and it felt sticky and my face don&#x27;t seem to absorb this well! When I leave it on my red, rough eczema patches on my face, it seem to stay on my face and I notice white flakes of the oil forming.. In conclusion, this lotion is not as good as it claims, neither did it heal or soothe the redness and it certainly did not help prevent flare ups for my eczema. I don&#x27;t recommend this for atopic eczema sufferers, but if you have mild eczema it may work.</li>
            <li> After using several different eczema creams on my son&#x27;s severe eczema, we finally found one that worked. It cleared it up within a couple of days and did not return. Also did not leave a greasy feel as so many others do. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Best eczema remedy when applied under aquaphor</li>
            <li> The person who used it claims good results in easing down the eczema effects</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, but definitely not a substitute for prescriptions for eczema. A nice aid to what ever your using for your eczema.</li>
            <li> Works for me! I was using Eucerin Body Creme Eczema Relief without any relief and then I saw phenoxyethanol listed in the ingredients. It&#x27;s a known skin irritant and a lot of &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; brands contain it. In Japan they won&#x27;t even let manufacturers put it in cosmetics. So thankful for this Aveeno - actually I haven&#x27;t found phenoxyethanol in any of their products.</li>
            <li> One might due better with just plain old vaseline! It is advertised as something to help with excema, but truly it hasn&#x27;t helped me.  I rarely get excemea anymore, but developed it recently with a new hand soap.  This just went on and left a coating feeling on my hands, but didn&#x27;t stop or even lower the excemea response. In fact it starteted to sting so I quit using it. It might work as some kind of lotion if you haven&#x27;t rubbed or scratched your skin in any way.  I am surprised Aveeno tends to be nicer quality.  I never could stand their stuff though because it smells awful, but hey, maybe it will work for you. Good luck.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t helped me much. I received Cetaphil Restoraderm today and hope it will be better than this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect, I will buy again</li>
            <li> The ONLY medicine that would help my infant with dry eczema and the price is better than most stores!</li>
            <li> My three year old son has pretty bad eczema on his left leg.  It&#x27;s scaly, itchy, and we can&#x27;t get him to stop scratching.  My mother came down to visit and said that this cream had helped her eczema and that we might want to give it a whirl.  Immediately, Kent stopped scratching.  It doesn&#x27;t have a scent, and it&#x27;s mildly oily.  It&#x27;s not quite as smooth as regular lotion, but it doesn&#x27;t feel harsh.  I thought there&#x27;s no way this stuff could really be doing anything.  A day later, I didn&#x27;t really anything different on Kent&#x27;s leg.  But we kept applying it, anyway.  About a week later the eczema was essentially gone.  Only a few little spots were visible.  Woo hoo!  Once he was \\&quot;cured,\\&quot; we got out of the habit of applying the lotion, and his eczema returned.  We just started using the lotion again, and it&#x27;s beginning to vanish.  In other words, I have no doubts that it&#x27;s the cream that&#x27;s working.  The bottle says it&#x27;s safe enough for a baby, and I believe it.  It doesn&#x27;t bother our son at all, and I&#x27;m a little relieved that it doesn&#x27;t have any of those obnoxious scents.  A little lotion goes a long way.  We&#x27;ve used this lotion for about 3 weeks and we can hardly tell it&#x27;s been depleted at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is expensive for a bottle of lotion (we bought it for $12 at CVS), but worth it.  If you give it a try, be sure to reserve judgement at least a week.  The change is slight the first few days, but noticeable given some time.  Also, you can save some cash if you decide to subscribe to it, and I can&#x27;t brag enough about Amazon subscriptions.  My wife and I use subscriptions for toilet paper, paper towels and diapers and save more than even Sam&#x27;s Club bulk prices on many things (diapers are much cheaper, but Zip Locs are cheaper at Sam&#x27;s...do your homework to make sure a subscription pays for you).  For this lotion, the subscription price makes sense.  Unless you&#x27;ve got more than one eczema sufferer, I can&#x27;t imagine going through one bottle in less than three months, and at $9, the cost of this lotion is negligible.  Three bucks a month to wave goodbye to eczema?  That&#x27;s a no-brainer.$9, the cost of this lotion is negligible.  Three bucks a month to wave goodbye to eczema?  That&#x27;s a no-brainer.</li>
            <li> So I checked the ingredients on the back of the label, and nothing spectacular.  Pretty much a recombination of typical Aveeno ingredients.      BUT IT WORKS.  I have had eczema for 30 years and tried EVERYTHING - steroid creams (OTC and prescription), immunosuppressant creams, bleach baths, you name it.  This works.  One week later - red rashes on my hands, neck and face significantly reduced or gone.      One caveat - you have to reapply pretty often during the day (at least I did).  That being said, I don&#x27;t know of a cream that works any other way, so I don&#x27;t consider this a major drawback. I still have to occasionally use OTC steroid cream, but much less often now (1x/wk v. nearly every day).  For people with mild to moderate eczema - 1x after you shower, 1x before bed - should be sufficient.</li>
            <li> I do recommend Aveeno they are great!!!</li>
            <li> Actually worked! But after the worst of my eczema got away, it started to sting slightly - I replaced it with regular creams and everything was good after a couple days :D</li>
            <li> By far the best cream against eczema!  It helped my baby&#x27; skin a lot and still does. It is very easy to apply, the texture is nice and a little sweet so my baby loves it, which is a very important point as it makes her much more cooperative when I apply the cream. It turned out to be very effective if you apply it twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening just after bath. I have tested it on my sensitive skin face and I had no reaction, so I am confident that ingredients must not be too harmful. Also this cream was recommended to us by a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> This lotion has changed my life. I used to have horrible problems with the skin on my hands, particularly during the winter. It almost looked as if I wore red gloves because there was an actually line on my wrist where the red skin stopped and my regular skin color had stayed intact. It was bad enough that I regularly got questions about what was wrong with my hands. I also had rough scaly patches and skin so dry it cracked open. Putting lotion on often burned and caused an instant rash. This lotion works immediately to heal my skin. It only takes a few applications for my skin to return to its normal color. I never get the rough patches on my skin anymore. My skin will still get dry and crack but only when I neglect to use this lotion like I should. The lotion does burn my skin when it is REALLY dry, but, again, this only happens if I neglect to use it every day or two. I usually only need to use it once or twice every day or two, and my skin is fine.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. I had eczema on one of my eyelids. It was so bad and no lotion or moisturizer would work. Since using this (at night before bed and in the morning before I put on makeup), it has completely gone away!! My eyelid has not been red or itchy since I bought this (about 8 months ago). I only put it on my eyelid and am still on my first bottle. It is WONDERFUL!!!! Love it and definitely recommend a try!!!</li>
            <li> Works excellent against Eczema related issues.</li>
            <li> I have moderate eczema.  I had a painful attack from the lanolin in the Aquaphor, so I ordered this to use after my prescription steroid cream calmed my skin a bit. The lanolin caused such a bad reaction that I had eczema all over my legs, torso, back, and the inside of my arms.  I don&#x27;t like to use the steroids long-term  because it thins the skin.  Yet when using this Aveeno product alone, my eczema was kept nearly all away.  I have to apply it twice a day, though, so it is quickly disappearing.  If I only put it on in the mornings, my skin gets dry and itchy by the late afternoon. I have almost used it up within two weeks, and it would be expensive to order so much of it. This product is good, but I am going to try Cetaphil upon my doctors recommendation, because one bottle has more than twice as much lotion, and I can get a two-pack at Costco for only a few more dollars than one tube of this.  I just started using it today and it seems to feel about the same on my skin, where it doesn&#x27;t instantly absorb and I feel totally dry and itchy after an hour. I am still giving this product four stars because it did clear up my eczema, but it just seems expensive for the quantity (about 7 oz).</li>
            <li> I ordered this and it doesn&#x27;t work as good as the aveeno baby eczema , im not sure why but it seems very light compared to the one I always get. if u looked closely on the back this one has black bar strip on top meaning its all chemicals , and the baby eczema has blue bar which means that it has some natural in it , I wish I knew that earlier , I thought they were both the same cuz they have same ingredient list.</li>
            <li> I just bought this product a few days ago and WOW, am I glad! I have a skin allergy to sulfates (lathering agent in soaps), and I was suffering on a daily basis every time I washed my hands. I had gone to the doctor before only to be prescribed steroidal lotions that burned and/or were ineffective (while \\&quot;effectively\\&quot; wasting hundreds of dollars)... So I started a hunt for an OTC lotion that could help me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried cocoa butter, coconut oil, Aquafor, and various (and sometimes expensive) hand creams... NOTHING helped... and then I stumbled across this fragrance-free, steroid-free wonder lotion that has literally reduced my scaley alligator hands to baby soft smootheness in a few days time. This is the real deal if you have eczema- buy it and be amazed.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  I was wrong about this lotion.  It is a very nice thick lotion, but I didn&#x27;t realize it was an oral medication my doctor had me on that took care of the eczema and not this lotion.  However it is a nice lotion that does soothe, but it will not get rid of eczema (at least in my case).&lt;br /&gt;----------------------&lt;br /&gt;I have had eczema for most of my life and except for a bad case as a child, it has been mild, but constant for 30 years.  My most recent case was a strip on the back of my knee that was about an inch long and half inch wide that felt and looked like tough old red leather.  I have had it for months and using another product, it would not go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two days of using the Aveeno my small strip of eczema is almost gone.  Within 12 hours of use it had softened and even began to peel.  I love this cream and wish I had discovered it years ago.  It is a little pricey, but well worth it.  It is far cheaper for me to buy one bottle of the Aveeno than the four or five bottles of another kind that really wasn&#x27;t working well.</li>
            <li> Does NOT cure my eczema. It&#x27;s a good moisturizer and makes my eczema look faded, until it wears off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews (and this product is very well reviewed), but this lotion is worth another nod as it has found a solution for a major problem.  After 1 1/2 years in the hospital from a severe MRSA infection of the spine (coma, surgeries) I was left with a skin condition that that made life miserable, - itching,sores and even bleeding. My doctor had told me it was from my hepatitis C (had most of my life) and the damage to my liver I had sustained while ill. I was using every cortisone cream and spray on the market. Short relief...  After a visit with my liver specialist 3 weeks ago, he looked at my skin and said \\&quot;Oh, you&#x27;ve got Eczema.\\&quot; I got on-line to look for eczema treatments, and as I knew Aveeno products were good, I ordered the Aveeno Eczema Cream.  It changed my life!. After a few days of daily use it was all gone, - no itch, sores, nada. I needed a treatment, not a temporary relief.  Thank you Aveeno,  Jon Cheetwood</li>
            <li> absorbs quickly, heals skin, pleasant feel and fragrance free. I&#x27;ve tried many remedies for the eczema on my hands and this has worked the best.</li>
            <li> Helps with my son&#x27;s eczema problem. We use aquaphor in the winter and this one for the summer.</li>
            <li> I have a small persistent spot of dry skin on my neck that is bothersome throughout the summer months. I saw this in Ulta and decided to give it a try for treatment and prevention. I used the cream twice a day on the affected area. While the lotion is a nice one in that (1) there is no offending smell, (2) it is quite moisturizing without being overly greasy (2) and I think it is quite reasonably priced, I did not find that it did anything for the dry skin on my neck. I am glad (based on other reviews here) that so many other users have found relief using this product; perhaps my spot needs something stronger than OTC lotion. However, I would gladly recommend this cream for anyone with dry hands, feet and elbows - it would be a great preventative lotion for those areas in the wintertime.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my brother who has Enczema and this is the first over the counter cream that has actually worked for him.  Try it if you have Enczema.</li>
            <li> Every winter for many years I get eczema on the shins of both my legs.  I wouldn&#x27;t call it severe eczema, but it&#x27;s extremely itchy and uncomfortable, and I wind up scratching it and making it worse.  I have used hydro-cortisone in the past, but saw this more natural product and figured I&#x27;d give it a shot this winter.  It worked exceptionally well within just a couple days.  The itchiness is completely gone and at this point I find I just need to use it a few times a week to maintain.  It&#x27;s great.  I am not sure how well it would work for severe eczema, but it&#x27;s been great for me and I would recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as my son&#x27;s skin was getting very dry and had red spots on the knees and doc said that it was eczema. He gave a steroid cream which I did not want to try as the first remedy. I tried this as after a couple days he had dry skin all over and after reading the reviews gave it a try. My sons skin got better in 3 days. The more I used it the more softer it got. Also realised that my son was not itching as much as he was scratching his face so much before I used this product.    Pros  1. It works.   2. Easy to use and does not feel sticky.    Cons  1. Expensive compare to the other Aveeno moisturizing creams.  2. Available in 5oz and 7.3oz tubes only.  3. Comes in similar packaging like other Aveeno soothing moisturizing cream.  4. Not easy to find the 7.3 oz tubes.</li>
            <li> My six year old has eczema on his legs and I have struggled to find something that will relieve the itching - for years I have gone back and forth with everything from Aquaphor to baby oil to coconut oil to homeopathic remedies and nothing has done the job like Aveeno Eczema Therapy - I was skeptical when I squeezed a little on my finger (it is expensive :) ) and it wasn&#x27;t very creamy or oily - but after just one use I noticed that my little one was not scratching his legs - his eczema is so bad that it keeps him up at night - he cries because it burns - it is horrible.  I have a vat of vitamin E cream, St. Ives Oatmeal and Shea Butter - and Johnsons Baby Oil in every bathroom so I can get to it quickly (and frequently) so this one little tube (costs as much as all the other things combined)does the job and does it quickly!!  I only wish I had found it earlier!!</li>
            <li> Very helpful in stopping dry, itching skin.  No problems.</li>
            <li> Got this today for nasty eczema that has been on my hand for like 5 years that started when I worked in a restaurant. The cleaning chemicals ate my hand up and gave me nasty eczema. I have tried so many lotions and potions and attempts to get it so it doesn&#x27;t itch. Which it does constantly. Esp at night when I wake up scratching like crazy. This stuff. Wow. As soon as I put it on my skin was like &amp;#34;aaaahhh THANK YOU!&amp;#34; Guarantee you this stuff will be around my purse and room for quite some time.</li>
            <li> I have had mild eczema for about 15 years on my upper arm/shoulders.  I have used the same lotion for awhile and I HATE putting it on, it smells weird.  It worked alright but I don&#x27;t want to smell like a hospital.  I love this cream, it works and it is odorless.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old daughter has severe eczema.  She sees a dermatologist almost monthly for prednisone injections, Rx creams, foams, shampoos.  We have tried every soothing cream on the market from Aveeno to $50 Estee Lauder Comfort On Call.  This cream is the only one so far to soothe her skin.  She applies it to her face daily &amp; it seems to have done away with the itchiness &amp; redness.  I have it on automatic monthly shipment so she will never run out. It&#x27;s also 15% less &amp; the shipping is free!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just been treated for actinic keratoses on my hands and arms, a pre-courser to melanomas. The treatment left my hands and arms looking terrible, with deep red, rough, itchy splotches and after the initial treatment I used, as prescribed,  cortisone 3 x daily for a proscribed period. I then moved on to moisturizers, which did very little. Until I tried the Aveeno eczema cream as a last resort. I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s the oats because the other Aveeno cream I had didn&#x27;t help, it has another primary product in it and is much less effective. The itching abated quickly and now the redness is rapidly lightening. So while some people may be allergic to the oats, apparently many find it helpful. It&#x27;s a known anti-inflammatory agent. I wouldn&#x27;t put down the product as some did, some things just don&#x27;t work for some people. Also it&#x27;s very emollient. As for the woman who didn&#x27;t take her Dr.&#x27;s advice on the possible oats allergy and applied it yet again to her baby, hard to believe. Cera-Ve is a good cream, although not for my problem.</li>
            <li> This stuff did not do what it said it would do. I have eczema on my hands. I even tried rubbing it all over my hand and guess what... my eczemagot even worse. Thanks for nothing aveeno and lower that ridiculous price.. the outrageous claims companies have these days.</li>
            <li> My one year old son has eczema, which tends to flare up regularly. I tried several unscented lotions and even plain coconut oil- they were okay and they kept him moisturized, which was helpful, but I never noticed a significant improvement on his skin. This lotion is absolutely perfect. Within a couple days of applying at least once per day (supplemented with a very small amount of prescribed medicated ointment), I noticed a huge difference- his eczema virtually disappeared. I could tell how much better he felt as soon as I rubbed it on to his back and hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have very bad dry, cracked skin on my hands in the winter, and this lotion has been great for that too!</li>
            <li> My skin is crazy sensitive (I&#x27;m an adult - not a baby) and I use this cream as a facial moisturizer. It&#x27;s the only lotion/cream that doesn&#x27;t sting even when my skin is inflamed.  If you have sensitive skin, give this cream a try!</li>
            <li> I love Aveeno for skin problems.  My kids seem to end up with everything from eczema to poison ivy on a daily basis.  Aveeno is the best.</li>
            <li> I love it...works great on eczema and dry skin...</li>
            <li> I am 24 years old and have had eczema for the past 23 years of my life. It has been a constant struggle to find an over the counter cream that REALLY helps my eczema. THIS is that cream. I put it on immediately after getting out of the shower and put Cetaphil moisturizing lotion on top of it. After the very first application of the Aveeno cream, I woke up the next morning with peaches and cream skin. I thought maybe it was a fluke but it has been a month now and my arms, chest, and back are perfectly clear. I stopped all steroid creams on my body and my skin looks gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure how this cream would work in a severe eczema flare up, but since using it, I haven&#x27;t had the chance to get one!! I am buying Aveeno Eczema Therapy for everyone I know with eczema. It has changed my life!</li>
            <li> Great product, delivered on time</li>
            <li> I have annoying adult onset eczema that I inherited from my mom. My skin flares up with little itchy bumps. I have been weary of using steroid crèmes because of the potential side effects. I had been using Benadryl and cortisone crème. Although those work somewhat, this stuff works much much better. This crème contains oatmeal. You may wonder why on earth you would want to rub oatmeal onto your skin. Turns out that scientific studies have shown that that oatmeal has compounds known as avenanthramides that have antihistamine, anti-inflammatory and protective properties for the skin. All I know is that for me it has been a miracle cure. I rub it onto my skin after I shower and my skin is still wet. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you that this is the FIRST time I&#x27;ve had to deal with eczema, BUT had a horrible flare up on my neck/upper chest since St. Patty&#x27;s Day - OVER 2 MONTHS! Nothing worked &amp; everything burned - even water! I tried Eucerin, Aquafor you name it..NADA. I read all the reviews and was skeptic, but still bought it since my skin looked like raw meat from all the clawing I did. I even slept with cotton gloves on at night to deter myself from scratching. It looked horrible. Well, lets just say that it did burn a bit initially (duh, what you&#x27;d expect if my skin was irritated and raw??) but today, Sunday May 22nd - only 3 days after initial application, my nasty rash DISAPPEARED, as if nothing was there. I did truly think I was scarred for life. I will definately continue to use this cream well after the fact, as I never want to endure that burning/itching/scratchy feeling EVER AGAIN! Just be patient and believe me its well worth the $12 I paid for it (already spent hundreds buying other useless stuff).</li>
            <li> I use this on my 3 yo for a moderate (some times severe) case of eczema. It does a nice job of covering and staying on her hot spots without feeling greasy. It also doesn&#x27;t sting on her sores as some products do. My only wish is that it was more naturally based but for her it seems that some sort of petroleum is needed to seal in moisture the best!</li>
            <li> I have been using a similar product from Aveeno for years as my emergency hand cream. I have some kind of eczema reaction from using dish soaps on the back of my hands. I have never been diagnosed because mine is very mild. It&#x27;s just extremely dry, scaly, and rarely cracks and bleeds. They used to offer this same thing but in their Baby Care line. I used that entire bottle and then I found this, which is the exact same thing with oatmeal extract. It&#x27;s the only cream that has ever really soothed my skin and made it feel soft and comfortable again.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency isn&#x27;t too thick. And once it&#x27;s absorbed, it helps the relieve pain from the worst areas that have cracked. Basically makes the obvious signs of scaling or drying vanish the same day.&lt;br /&gt;The next best thing would be straight neosporin, but that stuff is so greasy and unpleasant, and you really dont want to rub it everywhere because then it will not absorb and just transfer to everything else. So to really cure my hands I use this all over and then neosporin over bad spots and using bandaids for one night/day. Then it&#x27;s all better by the next day.&lt;br /&gt;Just have to switch to a milder hand soap, or wear disposable gloves more often.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this stuff smells like anything special but that&#x27;s a good thing. When your skin is irritated, the last thing you should do is put an unnecessary fragrance on it, that&#x27;s only going to make it worse.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this for anyone who really struggles with dry skin or eczema.</li>
            <li> This item is good when you first start using it. I think over time the effects are a bit diminished. I find that I have to switch back and forth between cetaphil, aveeno and an item I get through Mojo Spa for Eczema.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Excellent company</li>
            <li> I have had eczema my whole life and no prescribed lotions have ever worked on me.  Aveeno is the only product I can use and not have any flare ups to make it worse.  This eczema treatment has made my eczema even better.  For everyone out there with eczema, I highly recommend using this and any other Aveeno product, including their shower and oatmeal bath.  You will not come out smelling like oatmeal.  :o)  Also, as to previous comments saying that Aveeno&#x27;s products \\&quot;smell horrible,\\&quot; they don&#x27;t have a \\&quot;scent\\&quot; because people with eczema are highly sensitive to scented stuff, so there isn&#x27;t a distinct smell.  I do not find it to be \\&quot;stinky\\&quot; at all.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter has suffered from eczema since birth.  She recently had a horrible flair up and we ran out of the prescription steroid that her pediatrician prescribed.  Out of desperation I purchased this and was shocked when her skin cleared within 48 hours.  Her skin is soft and not flaky like it usually is after the steroid clears the eczema.  Love this lotion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had eczema on my hands for the last nine years or so, with it spreading further up my arms in the last couple of years. For some reason, my eczema tends to flare up in the summer months rather than the winter months, which has baffled every dermatologist I&#x27;ve seen. Last summer was particularly brutal. Just taking a shower was torture for my hands, and my doctor-prescribed steroid cream was drying my skin out so badly that none of the other recommended lotions could keep up. I ordered this off of Amazon, and was in love from the very first application! I had previously been using a hydrocortisone lotion that claimed to be \\&quot;intensively healing\\&quot; to eczematous skin, but my hands would continue to burn for up to 20 minutes after applying it, and it really didn&#x27;t seem to keep my hands moisturized like it claimed it would. This Aveeno cream calmed and soothed my skin on contact, and keeps my skin moisturized throughout the day. Within a couple of days, I noticed my skin was starting to heal and my months-long flare up was starting to diminish. I would even recommend this to people without eczema who may just have extremely dry skin. Because it&#x27;s a cream and not a lotion, it doesn&#x27;t evaporate from the skin as quickly and actually has a chance to do its job. Because eczema can&#x27;t be cured, I hope this is a product that remains for years to come. I don&#x27;t know where I would be without it! Probably contemplating the amputation of my own hands...haha.</li>
            <li> Best hand cream I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from severe and painful eczema and have tried every lotion and potion there is, you will love this stuff! I have had the worst, most painful eczema and was so sick and tired of trying lotions that just didn&#x27;t work - or would work for a few days and then stop (AmLactin - ugh! Sarna...nice try!). Hot showers were so painful as were really cold days. But then I bought this and, I kid you not, it started to work within two days. Two days! I&#x27;ve used it for only a week now and have been eczema free for 5 days. That&#x27;s a long time for me. And I&#x27;ve already bought another tube of this stuff. I&#x27;m not a big comment leaver but I feel like I need to let those of you who have been suffering like I had know that this stuff actually works! You really should try it to see for yourself.</li>
            <li> I found it worked better than RX cortisone cream, and it&#x27;s safer to use through the winter.</li>
            <li> We have been using the cream for the last 1.5 years and it really helps with the severe eczema problems caused by food allergies. We tested about 5 different creams, and this has helped most (we apply twice a day) - but you should also try different products as they all have different components.</li>
            <li> Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use the 10 days hasn&#x27;t been so itchy, and continue to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can very good moisten the skin</li>
            <li> M doctor recommended this for my baby as she had very dry skin during the winter months when she was born ,it cleared out all the dry patches and slight redness on her skin ,Amazing product !</li>
            <li> My daughter has eczema pretty bad she started with it at about 3 months we tried many different creams and lotions nothing helped like this Aveeno Eczema cream she is now 19 months and her eczema is completely under control because of this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great and the moisturizing lasts throughout the day. I have tried many creams and this one is by far the best. Certainly recommend for anyone living in a dry and cold climate.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical when I purchased this. I honestly thought it was just another type of lotion that just had eczema on the product. My eczema consists all over my body (front and back) and would feel rough to the touch. My condition gets worse during the Fall/Winter season. I didn&#x27;t want to go to a dermatologist because I was always able to hide it. Until recently, I&#x27;ve had enough of the itching and scratching. It&#x27;s gotten to the point where I scratched till I BLEED. I looked up this product on Amazon and I can honestly tell you that this product SAVED ME SKIN AND MY LIFE. Upon 1-2 days on using this product, I immediately notice that my eczema was starting to disappear. Most importantly, no longer did it itch like HELL. I highly recommend this product to ANYONE out there. It does not matter how old you are, whether your a male or female, or what color skin you have. If you have ECZEMA, then you need to BUY THIS PRODUCT. 5 out of 5 STARS. THANK YOU AVEENO!</li>
            <li> This product DOES NOT work in RELIEVING Eczema...It actually made my eczema WORSE!  What a disappointment, and a rip-off! I read that this product was superior to another product I ordered by mail. So I went to the pharmacy and purchased it immediately. I was surprised so many tubes were available on the shelf..that should have been the give-away, plus, it was on sale..save your money...DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT...I believe endorsers are employees of Aveeno.</li>
            <li> I had eczema on my back. I went to the doctor and had tried different treatments. Nothing worked. This cream worked great and my skin is no longer itchy.</li>
            <li> Great product for soothing eczema.</li>
            <li> I have same experience as others who experienced a burning sensation upon application, but I endured it the first day, thinking my skin had to adjust. But this should have been a clue - there are simply too many chemicals in this lotion irritating my skin, and isn&#x27;t this the opposite of what we&#x27;re supposed to do with eczema, which is expose it to even more irritants. Not only did it make my existing eczema worse, but cause more of it to pop up, in the surrounding area that applied the cream. Back to coconut oil for me - 10 minutes after which, my skin began to immediately calm down from aveeno experience.</li>
            <li> My son has suffered from eczema from the time he was a baby.  He is usuallly covered in sores. After searching and searching for something besides steriod cream that will not burn his skin I have finally found a cure. I have to be consistent about putting the lotion on or it comes right back.  Some of the reviewers have complained about the price but to end his suffering I think it is a small price to pay.  Thank you Aveeno.</li>
            <li> For many years, I have struggled with eczema.  Dermatologists have prescribed creams and ointments to improve my symptoms.  Nothing has helped.  About a month ago, I saw Aveeno eczema therapy moisturizing cream and thought I would give it a try. To my amazement, the improvement to my skin was immediate!  My eczema has not only disappeared, my skin feels healthy for the first time in years.  In my opinion, Aveeno has created a miracle product.   I&#x27;ll tell my dermatologist that he needs to recommend Aveeno eczema therapy cream to his patients.  I have used lots of Aveeno products in the past, and have been satisfied, but this one goes above and beyond anything I have tried.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion that works for my eczema.  I&#x27;ve had eczema for years and have been prescribed several creams and steroids from my dermatologist that didn&#x27;t work.  I use this product on entire body after I shower.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I had really bad eczema and after i tried this product everything went much better. I suffered with eczema whole my life, I used to use steroid creams,which was not good for me. so I am very happy that i found this cream especially now during my pregnancy. This cream you can use as many times. I love this cream, my skin gets back to normal again without steroids.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but I had to review this one. I have suffered with dry red flakey skin around my nose, chin and forehead for over 10 years. I wish I found this sooner. Truley the best moisturizer that i have ever tried!!! Love it!!! Nothing has ever worked for me. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I have suffered from eczema on my left knee and sides of my feet for years.  I&#x27;m not sure if I can give all the credit to Aveeno as I started off on a steroid creme to remove the flareup but ever since then I have used the Aveeno to prevent reoccurence.  I have this on subscription because I plan on using it indefinitely!</li>
            <li> I have a small patch of recurring eczema on my chin. It usually lasts for weeks and is all itchy and uncomfortable. I have been using this cream for four days now. The eczema is almost gone! While I have been using the cream, I have noticed far less itching and discomfort. I will be recommending this to my family members that suffer from eczema.</li>
            <li> We tried this product to help my son with his eczema and it helped tremendously!  I love it most because in comparison to what we were using on our daughter for her itching, this product is cheap and works just as well.  We use it twice a day and the itching for both children has decreased tremendously.</li>
            <li> I tried this based on the good reviews on here.  After a small application, my daughter started crying and saying \\&quot;It hurts me!\\&quot;.  I believe it felt like it was burning her skin.  So far, Baby Eczema Cream is the only cream I can use on her that doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! The very first time I used it though, I didn&#x27;t like it because it made my hands burn like crazy because of my cracked skin from the eczema.. I thought I had just wasted money. But I decided to put it on again a couple hours later and it didn&#x27;t burn the second time around! I continued to put it on a few times throughout the day the next day, and it made a noticeable difference in just a day! After just a few days of using it, my hands cleared up completely. Amazing stuff! It&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my 2 year old but I learned that coconut oil works.  I tried it and I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  And you can find organic coconut oil at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I have such bad eczema on my fingers in winter months. I purchased this based on the good reviews but I&#x27;m going to have to side with the minority here. After using the product liberally for a week I&#x27;ve found that this lotion irritates my skin more than anything else. This product might work well for others but for my eczema it didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li> Only 2 words for this product: instant gratification. Immediately cools down your skin from a rough eczema day. Im just sad that I couldnt find this in a 55 gallon drum so i can just hop in after work and cool off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a definite buy if you find yourself itching like crazy.</li>
            <li> This works like magic.</li>
            <li> This really helped my daughter&#x27;s eczema.  It works fast too.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have a couple of eczema patches on my hands, and thought I&#x27;d try something other than my tried and true Hydrocortisone 1% plus Aloe. I use the Hydro on my hands at least once, daily, just to keep outbreaks in check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Aveeno a few days in a row instead, and found that it was fine as moisturizer, but my eczema flared right back up. I do like the oatmeal in it, it does help to sooth, but just won&#x27;t stop the eczema the way the Hydro 1% will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. Two stars, because it doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> I get what I think is eczema on a couple fingers and a small spot on the back of my hand and wrist. Previously I used a bit of my young nephew&#x27;s prescription cream, which worked. But after running out, I decided to give this a try (all dermatologists in my area are booked 2-3 months out). When used just twice a day it works amazingly! I don&#x27;t even use it after washing my hands (which I do constantly) but it would be even better to. This is by far the best lotion I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m not big on the oatmeal kinda smell, but it&#x27;s almost scentless and after a couple uses I was ok with it.</li>
            <li> my baby has crazy Eczema, it doesn&#x27;t seem work...</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this cream in Canada, but I heard good reviews about it. I used it as soon as I received it and it&#x27;s great. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I have used Amazon several times and am usually pleased with the products and service.  I expected no less from my order, but when I received it, the seal from all four tubes of Aveeno cream were missing, and in its place, there was scotch tape over the cap to \\&quot;indicate\\&quot; that it had not been open.  It makes me extremely concerned that the products have been tampered with and I refuse to use them, as they are for my two young children, and I do not want to take any chances.  If you are considering purchasing this lotion from Amazon, be aware that the product may have been tampered with!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my boyfriend, and it actually has not made any difference. The eczema is still there and has actually increased a little.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very suit my baby~</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thick and sticky that I can&#x27;t absorb into your skin. It leaves a thick, weird residue that isn&#x27;t helpful when you&#x27;re skin is already sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have had eczema since I was 13 and I am going on 30.  In the past 3 years or so it has gotten much worse, spreading to my hands which is very painful and ugly to look at.  My PCP and Dermatologist both tried different prescriptions and only one worked in taking away the itch but did not heal the eczema.  When I saw Aveeno came out with this, the price was a deterrent but I was willing to try anything... I am so glad I did!  For $11 I found a product that has almost completely faded all of the spots of eczema and taken away the itch/pain completely.  HIGHLY recommended!!!</li>
            <li> *Did not actually consume product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it works wonders for when I have those bad eczema days... this product won&#x27;t cure it but definitely help to ease the symptoms and accelerate healing. Also works as normal moisturizing cream for more sensitive dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No smell (other than a hint of oatmeal). Feels *slightly* greasy, but it might just be the moisturizing effect taking place.</li>
            <li> Helps my husbands very dry skin on legs and arms that can cause him intense itching.</li>
            <li> My daughter had been suffering from eyelid eczema for weeks.  She is 17 years old and hasn&#x27;t had an eczema flare since she was about 10 years old.  We went to a doctor and to a dermatologist, and they both just readily prescribed steroid-based creams.  After reading the horrible side effects, especially when applied on the eyelid, we definitely sought to find a better solution.  We tried aquaphor, Vaseline, pure Argan oil (really expensive!), chinese herbal capsules, unrefined shea butter, organic extra virgin coconut oil----nothing worked!  Then we found our perfect combination.  I knew that her eczema flare was related to her having seasonal allergies, so she started taking Allegra 180 mg. daily and using Aveeno Eczema Therapy moisturizing cream.  I read the reviews for this cream and was really impressed.  We were so desperate for a healthy solution, that I decided to give it a try.  I am sooooo happy that I did. Within 24 hours, I knew that we had stumbled across a winner!  Boy, oh boy, what a major difference in her skin.  Can you imagine the turmoil in being a 17 year old high school senior with eyelid eczema?  She had swollen, red, itchy, crusty, stretched and wrinkled eyelids with undereye dark circles.  Not a pretty sight.  Within 24 hours-- her red, swollen, wrinkled eyelids returned to normal.  She applies the moisturizing cream about 4 times a day and sleeps with a cool mist humidifier at night to keep the air moist.  I sure hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> This is an off white half cream, half gel. Works really well on eczema, dry patches and I even use it as hand cream- Can&#x27;t recommend it more. The 7.3oz is also a big tube so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion after reading reviews of several eczema lotions - this one seemed effective and affordable. I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times so far, but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised. The red patches on my legs are fading and there&#x27;s no itching. It is a tad bit oily, but I put on leggings right after applying and I didn&#x27;t feel like I was swimming around in skin lotion. Also, because it is a little oily it actually sinks into your skin. I applied the lotion to my legs two nights ago and I can STILL feel it working this morning. No dry skin, just moisturized skin. Hooray!</li>
            <li> I really do not like using lotion, if I do, I have to wash my hands cause of the greasy feeling.  This lotion is GREAT, no yucky smell and no greasy feeling.  Everyone who has used some likes it too, I have one at work and just ordered one for home too.</li>
            <li> best cream for my daughter!  I love that this helps soothe and calm my daughters skin before bed!</li>
            <li> I love this cream and so does my baby. I found that it works very well for eczema. I use it on my baby every night immediately after bath.   The price here is outrageous! I found it for 4-5 dollars less on other sites and stores.</li>
            <li> I bought this product when I saw it on my most recent shopping trip and immediately bought it.  During the winter time, my skin gets very dy and my hands looks horrible.   I get eczema on my knuckles - it&#x27;s both painful, itchy, and unattractive.  I would always hide my hands in gloves.  I tried different types of creams - expensive ones - and none worked.  I can say that Aveeno Eczema Therapy cream is working on my second day of using the product. The red bumps have almost dissapeared and no more itch.  My skin also doesn&#x27;t get as dry.  There is no scent, which I like and the cream doesn&#x27;t leave a lasting, oily residue.  I hightly recommend this product.  I&#x27;ve always heard Aveeno did great things for people with dry skin, but this really does seem like a miracle cream.  If you&#x27;re suffering from itchy dry skin, give this a try - $10 isn&#x27;t that much when it comes to feeling (and looking) better!</li>
            <li> I use the product daily. I think you could&#x27;ve gotten more of the cream into that large dispenser. It seems to work for me.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion! After reading previous reviews on this product I decided I had to try it out. With the harsh weather lately and hard water my skin has been completely damaged, dry, and I started breaking out in a more severe form of eczema that I never had before! I even had eczema on my face (usually it happens on my legs and hands), which was really embarrassing because there were red dry scaly patches all over my face, no amount of foundation could hide it. I mildly exfoliated my skin, put this lotion on, and I kid you not after the FIRST application my dry patches were gone! The itching stopped, and my skin is now smooth just as before. Seriously this is a miracle product! Bravo Aveeno.</li>
            <li> I have eczema in my hands and this product made the itchiness and the dryness fade. Also its not bad for you as cortisone products ...double thumbs up</li>
            <li> I have hand eczema which causes the skin on my hands to split and crack open along with dry itchy patches.  I have tried all kinds of over the counter creams and lotions as well as prescription medications.  This lotion is the best treatment I&#x27;ve ever used.  It is even more effective then the prescription.  This is a great price, too.  I&#x27;ve only found it at one local store and it cost $14.00 plus tax.  I use this now every time I wash my hands and it has made a tremendous difference.</li>
            <li> We tried a lot of things for our toddler&#x27;s eczema and nothing worked until we found this product.  It only takes a tiny bit to do a whole baby.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the Aveeno brand, however this item was delivered without the usual seal and had residue on the cap and opening as if it had been used! Can&#x27;t believe this was shipped out this way...</li>
            <li> After hearing all the horror stories of eczema and how hard it is to treat I was thrilled when this worked for my four year old daughter. I bought this items at a local drug store for $13 and it was worth every penny (luckily my daughter only has one spot that keeps &amp;#34;breaking out&amp;#34;). We do have to apply it to the area every day and all over the body after a bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very annoyed after reading the negative reviews. I have only known my daughter has eczema for 3 month and I already seem to know more about it then these people leaving reviews. THIS ITEM CONTAINS OATMEAL A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH ECZEMA ARE ALLERGIC TO COMMON INGREDIDENTS LIKE OATMEAL. Just because you can eat oatmeal doesn&#x27;t mean you can put it on your skin. Sure fire way to figure it out take an oatmeal bath and see what happens (ok maybe don&#x27;t go to that extreme but it is always good to know what you are allergic to) because as some people have tried to make very clear in these reviews everyone is different and all products don&#x27;t work for all people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this product will work for you too.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great! Very thick and creamy, great for coating your skin. It calmed my itchy skin and soothed the aggravated bumps.</li>
            <li> This has not provided the miracle cure I was hoping for, but it&#x27;s a soothing lotion. I will use it, but will have to look elsewhere for the amazing results that other reviewers describe.</li>
            <li> This has really helped our baby&#x27;s eczema.  He was suffering with red rashy patches and our dr. told us to use this twice a day.  We did that, plus a humidifier and it&#x27;s a world of difference.  we slather him down religiously in this and it has just helped so much.</li>
            <li> This lotion absolutely SAVED my skin. I grew up with eczema on and off through out my life. Once I reached my 20s, it came back and it was brutal. The breaking point was when it started to spread onto my face. I tried so many different lotions and creams, nothing worked. This lotion was recommended by a friend so I gave it a try. My skin immediately felt better. It felt soothed and refreshed, quickly fading away after a couple of weeks. I would definitely recommend this lotion, I still use it every day and have been eczema free for three years now.</li>
            <li> Good stuff for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> The reason it made your eczema worse is because this ointment is oatmeal: food for teh fungus. This is really smart of this manufacturer, why don&#x27;t they add some sugar on top for the fungus to have a feast, too?</li>
            <li> I have chronic eczema on my face as well as other areas.  I have tried so many creams, including expensive prescription creams.  Yes, the expensive prescription creams worked, but my insurance doesn&#x27;t cover them because eczema is a \\&quot;cosmetic\\&quot; condition.  Steroid cream made the skin on my face red and sensitive, so I am reluctant to use it.    I&#x27;ve used different Aveeno lotions for years with decent results on my eczema, but after discovering this cream... wow.  I am amazed.  The eczema on my face began to heal almost immediately.  After a week of use, the eczema is beginning to clear up.    Granted, it isn&#x27;t as effective on the eczema on my back, which is much worse and has been there a lot longer.  It does relieve the itch and makes the skin softer to the touch, so that makes me happy.  Once I started applying the steroid cream at night and the Aveeno lotion in the morning, the results have been much more pronounced.    In short, this stuff is amazing on mild to moderate eczema.  As for more severe, I would recommend using it in conjunction with a steroid cream.</li>
            <li> Great product and really helps with dry skin. It starts working as soon as you put it on and has a very nice smell.</li>
            <li> I have eczema that is naturally more irritable in the winter.  This winter being as harsh as it has proved to need additional solutions to help my skin.  I have used other products that are reliable, but very costly.  When I came upon this product I found it priced much lower than my traditional solution.  I have used this reliably and find it a good alternative to other vendors/ solutions.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 32 years old and been struggling with eczema on my hands for all my life.  It&#x27;s been debilitating and a constant source of stress and irritation in my life.  But I tried this cream and it&#x27;s almost completely cleared up my hands completely.  Granted, I now have to have the cream with me at all times, but it&#x27;s certainly better than having dry, hands, cracked skin and cuts all over my hands at all times.  I love this cream, It&#x27;s changed my life for the better.</li>
            <li> Having to wash my hands all the time as I am taking care of my baby all day, the eczema on my fingers never has a chance to heal.  I am weary of always using cortizone prescription cream and my doctor recommended that I put on non-perfumed hand cream many times a day. Aveeno make great non-perfumed products and I found that this cream helps relieve the itch and prevent the cracking of the skin, where other non-perfumed hand creams did not provide the same relief. I highly recommend this cream for eczema&#x27;d hands.  As for the price tag, being able to decrease the use of prescription steroid cream is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The product solved my itching skin immediately and was able to reduce the redness. Great for all over body lotion as well.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I will recommend to other moms.</li>
            <li> Our son was born on 9/26/11 and had eczema from the get go.  A few patches on his face were the most notable.  We gave it some  time to see if it might clear up on its own and then I ordered this  based on the positive reviews.  I took it with me to his 1 month  well check and the pediatrician gave us the okay to use it.  Sure  enough, within about 3 days the spots were noticeably better. Two  weeks in and you could hardly see a thing.  We apply this every day  because I have noticed that if we go several days without it, then  the eczema will flair up again, especially with it being winter time.  This cream is steroid free and fragrance free.  It has a very creamy,  smooth, non greasy texture that absorbs quickly.  We have used   this cream on our newborn and ourselves with incredible results.  Subscribe and Save option is drastically less expensive than buying  at the stores here.  S&amp;S is about $7.75 per 7.3 ounce bottle and in  the stores here is is $7.99 for a 5 ounce bottle.  A little goes a long  way and we&#x27;ve found that 2 bottles every 3 months is what we use.</li>
            <li> When Eczema shows up on my skin I find this lotion to be very soothing and it stops any itching too.  Also, I like that this cream is steroid free; would purchase again.</li>
            <li> it feels much better when my wife use it.she like it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not normally an eczema sufferer, but I recently developed a bad (itchy, flaky, red, peeling) rash as a reaction to a particular sunscreen I had used.  I treated it in part with a 1% hydrocortisone cream, but the skin was pretty dry, too (it&#x27;s winter here and the temperature has been below average).  I wanted to use a moisturizing lotion on the affected areas to promote skin healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the ingredients list is short (it&#x27;s available on the product page) and that this lotion is free of parabens.  (I recognize the ingredients in this lotion from other products I use and know that I&#x27;m not allergic to any of them!)  I love that there are no dyes or artificial fragrances, since I have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for three or four days now, and I think it is really helping.  I apply it to the affected areas twice a day.  It goes on smoothly and is not greasy or oily.  It does an excellent job of keeping my skin moisturized, and even after only a few days of use, the peeling has stopped.  After I apply it, I wait a few minutes and then add my hydrocortisone cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once my rash has cleared up, I&#x27;m going to keep this around and use it as a general moisturizing body lotion.  I can&#x27;t say how it works for people with chronic eczema, but if you have a temporary dermatitis rash, this lotion would be great as a part of your treatment strategy.</li>
            <li> I like the 24 hour aveeno lotion better than this lotion.  This lotion burns more in deeper cracked skin.  I need to reapply so much, the very small amounts of this isn&#x27;t worth the money compared to other products.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful, very like</li>
            <li> This cream seems to be doing magic!</li>
            <li> This stuff did not help my eczema person but as a regular lotion, it&#x27;s GREAT!</li>
            <li> My eczema is always present but at certain times it just seems to aggrevate me more than others (hot and itchiness).  This product is the best I&#x27;ve found over the counter to combat both of those feelings almost immediately and I feel like it reduces the redness immediately too while feeling moisturizing.  I&#x27;ve tried a number of other options including Gold Bond but this is my preference by far!</li>
            <li> I suffer from painful eczema on my hands that causes the skin to blister, peel, and crack when I come in contact with soap and water. Since that isn&#x27;t avoidable my hands were in constant distress and all my doctors thought to do was prescribe stariod creams that did little if applied daily and the side effects are awful. Three days after trying this hand cream and my skin is completely healed and almost normal looking. In a day or two I expect it will look completely normal and for once my hands aren&#x27;t in pain, and let me tell you, it&#x27;s a godsend especially since I&#x27;m a Chef and a sales clerk. I&#x27;m no longer embarrassed about my hands and they don&#x27;t hurt anymore!</li>
            <li> I suffered from eczema for years and typically had to go to the doctor twice a year for a shot and prescription.  Ever since my wife found the Aveeno lotion, I haven&#x27;t been back.  I get a few small flare ups,  but this keeps it in check and has saved my hundreds in doctor visits.</li>
            <li> I had excellent results with this cream.</li>
            <li> I typically get eczema on the backs of one or both hands in the winter.  Sometimes I&#x27;ll get it mildly in other places like my face or arms.  This year I got it extensively on both legs and on my hands.  It was so bad I was scratching up my legs every night.  Other lotions made it worse, hydrocortizone ointment did nothing (usually it&#x27;d at least help), and hourly applications of coconut oil helped a little bit.  My friend recommended this stuff and it did the trick.  After just two applications the itching stopped.  After a week twice daily, the eczema disappeared completely from one hand and you can barely see it on the other.  After about two weeks my legs are completely clear.  I will continue using this the rest of the winter and all following winters!  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion for my 4.5 yrs old toddler recommended by her doctor. She has allergy to some foods, and in the inner elbow and the upper chest and neck she has developed a little rash.. atopic dermatitis. With it, she keeps her skin hydrated, and clear. I love it, simply love it. Ordered two and will order two more, since I&#x27;m almost finishing the first one. I use it 5-10 minutes after the bath. It does not smell weird, and my daughter loves it too. All Aveeno products are excellent!</li>
            <li> I have no doubts that this works great for the non-pregnant.  In my case, I developed eczema when I became pregnant with my 3rd (never had this problem with my previous pregnancies)--I was getting unbearable itchy rashes everywhere on my body.  Obviously not wanting to take any drugs or use any creams that could endanger the baby, I was hesitant in using anything other than a mild topical steroid cream, to no avail.  My midwife recommended some sort of lotion, can&#x27;t remember what it was called, but while looking for that cream I came upon this cream from Aveeno.  I&#x27;ve always been a huge fan of Aveeno, ever since my first was born because their products are so gentle and natural... within days of using this cream, the itchiness and rash disappeared!  I&#x27;ve been using this for the past few months and it&#x27;s done wonders for my skin, not only in the itchiness department, but also keeping my skin extremely soft and smooth (and I&#x27;ve always had a problem with dry skin).      Use this product if you have eczema, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Works as well as the over the counter steroid creams and with this being steroid free cream I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> This Aveen eczema cream is a life saver for me. I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> My kids (3 yrs and 10 mos, respectively) have keratosis pilaris, which is a condition that creates a rough, red rash on the face and arms.  You can&#x27;t get rid of it completely.  I&#x27;ve tried Aquafor, Eucerin, hydrocortizone cream....nothing worked to improve their condition.  But the Aveeno Eczema cream has made my kids&#x27; skin SO smooth!  They still have the keratosis but it is greatly diminished and their skin is the smoothest it has ever been.</li>
            <li> Excellent relief for eczema sufferer.  Apply immediately after showering.  This cream is quite similar to Neutrogena Norwegian Formula, Intense Moisture Wrap, which is also excellent.  I find this one to be ever so slightly thicker.</li>
            <li> This seems to work really well on my elbows.  Sometimes, they are so red and tender that I can&#x27;t put any pressure on them.  The Aveeno cream dispenses easily from the tube and it&#x27;s simple to control the amount you want.  I&#x27;ve had doctor prescribed creams, but I think the Aveeno works better for me.</li>
            <li> I saw the reviews and tried it. I had a severe allergic reaction requiring a visit to the doctor and meds. Im not sure what exactly in this product caused it. Read the ingredients and maybe the colloidal oats. My advice for any new product-test it first in a small way.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old suffers from eczema she has super dry skin, redness and dry patches. My 2 year old suffers doctor recommend this product and the Eczema therapy bath wash as well. This product is very thick and creamy. It will leave your little ones skin super hydrated and smooth. I use this product on my little on 4 times a day to notice a difference in my little ones skin and I have. But I don&#x27;t only use this. When taking my little one a bath I use a lot of different products plus this! I use coconut oil before I put my little one to take a bath. Remember letting your little one play in the bath will dry out their skin causing more dryness, redness and even itchiness to the skin. Putting coconut oil onto your Little ones skin before bath will reduce the chance of making their skin dry. I also use homemade bath bombs fragrance feel. Bath bombs have baking soda which is good for the skin. Baking soda will leave your kids skin hydrated and fresh. I also use homemade bath melts. It&#x27;s very simply and easy to make and this will help your little ones skin stay free of dryness, redness and itchiness.</li>
            <li> This product works well. My son has skin conditions so he needs to use moisturizing cream everyday. Some other creams either hurt his skin or do not have much effect. This one does not irritate him much and also heals his skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to have a bigger package though as we use it every day for his lags and arms.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to getting this product since the reviews were very good.  When I got it, I used it every day, twice a day and saw no results.  It did not work for me.  Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical that this would help my Eczema at all.  Active ingredient 1% oatmeal?  Seriously?  And i paid money for that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t matter, 1 week later and my skin is clear.  What a pleasant surprise &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I am 26 and I was diagnosed with eczema a few months back. I have tried 3 OTC brands till now: Jergens, CeraVe and Aveeno. For me, this works the best. I apply it once a day (after bath). I re-ordered it.</li>
            <li> A seemingly good product, but it shouldn&#x27;t be used even around your eyes (even though the warning just prohibits in eyes), it stings and caused my eczema to get worse around my eyes. My eyelids actually got puffy because of it. It works fine on other areas of the body though.</li>
            <li> I used this on my son when he was  2 months old because he had really dry peeling skin.  He broke out in head to toe eczema.  I thought it was from my diet (breastfeeding). The doctor thought it could be the oat in the cream. I didn&#x27;t agree but stopped the cream and went on an elimination diet.  His skin cleared up instantly although still dry.  I used CeraVe instead and liked it much better. Now my son is 6 months. I was out and his back and shoulders were dry and I had the Aveeno cream in my diaper bag so I used that.  A few hours later, his shoulders and back were flared red, dry and peeling. I can&#x27;t blame the cream if it is in fact an allergic reaction however I do eat oats in my diet (almost daily)  and his skin has been great until today.</li>
            <li> So I have to say, I have OCD, and I wash my hands  A LOT! I got eczema on the back of hands, skin discoloration, itchy, and cracked skin. It was so bad that random people questioned what was wrong with my hands. It has been 3 days, since I started using this product and WOW! My hands are smooth, don&#x27;t hurt or itch and the discoloration is finally starting to disappear. My hands feel so smoothe and my friends/family have started to notice the difference! I am so glad I finally gave this product a try! Totally worth the $$$!</li>
            <li> Only cream that soothed my baby&#x27;s severe eczema.  My daughter&#x27;s eczema started when she was 3 months old, and covered most of her body.  I used this cream at every diaper change until her breakout was under control. That&#x27;s 8-10 times a day! When used that frequently other creams left a residue and most of them still had a bad sting.  Aveeno never stung and felt light after it was absorbed. My daughter is three years old now, and with this lotion and good habits we&#x27;ve kept her eczema under control ever since!</li>
            <li> Works so well on super dry and itchy skin (not officially eczema).  I tried many different creams and this one really does soothe all day. Helps relieve with the moisture.  It&#x27;s a thicker cream, but not too messy/thick.  I will absolutely continue to purchase for my dry winter skin!!</li>
            <li> My friend suffers from winter time cold weather eczema on his hands, this worked for him in one day, a few days later he had no further problems when used daily.</li>
            <li> My son has mild eczema on his cheeks, chin, arms and legs. When I say mild I mean that there are some dry patches here and there but nothing too obvious unless you feel his skin. The most problematic area are his cheeks because the dryness causes him to itch his face to the point of drawing blood. I constantly have to push his hands away from his face or put mittens on him which doesn&#x27;t always stay on. I would use aquaphor to help heal and soothe his wounds but never thought there was anything I could do to prevent him from itching in the first place. That was until I discovered this product. I started putting it on his face and body after his bath to help seal in the moisture and within a few days his skin improved dramatically. It was soft, silky and smooth. His need to itch his face stopped completely. I highly recommend this product since it worked for my son&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> I tried this for about a week and it didn&#x27;t help but actually makes it worse for my sensitive skin.  It does have a protective barrier to it but it leaves this very light sticky residue and it&#x27;s giving me more pimples :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 10/04/12.  this product still doesn&#x27;t help me out but makes it worse.  instead another product from Aveeno called Ultra Calming with spf 15 does help me.  My wife has been experimenting with all her facial products on my face haha!  I&#x27;m glad the first she used was the Ultra Calming cream because it&#x27;s helping me out a lot.</li>
            <li> This really helped with my infant&#x27;s very dry, itchy skin. I now use it almost everyday on my 2 daughters after bath.</li>
            <li> Works great for people with eczema. The lotion is also non greasy and feels good on skin. Would bug again.</li>
            <li> I have had a rash on my cheeks for over 2 years now.  I have been to the dermatologist 3 times and was told it was 3 different things including sebborheic dermatitis, rosacea and eczema.  I have been prescribed Desonide which I slathered on my face for a year not knowing it is harmful and thins your skin.  It helped a little, but never made it go away.  It also left my cheeks looking weird, pink and like a layer of skin had been removed.  I finally went to another dermatologist and was prescribed Ketaconazole and Hydrocortizone (at least this time I was told not to keep using the steroid cream).  Every time I used the Ketaconazole, the rash became even worse.  The Hydrocortizone helped, but only if I continually used it.  As soon as I stopped, it would come right back.  This did not help as you&#x27;re not supposed to keep using it!  The third dermatologist prescribed a heavy duty antibiotic, Doxycycline, which made me so nauseous I had to quit taking it.  He also prescribed Sulfacetamide which made my cheeks super dry.  When I consulted him again, he called in a prescription for Protopic.  After reading that it has a black label from the FDA for causing cancer, I never even picked it up.  I&#x27;m glad I found out BEFORE I wasted my money on it!  I have also tried other remedies on my own, which include Derm Essentials, Cetophil cream, Organic Virgin Coconut Oil (which really inflamed my skin), Dandruff shampoo, and Aquaphor.  I used to have really nice skin and this rash was driving me crazy.  I came across this cream and thought, what the heck.  I have now been using it for 5 days and my face looks better than it has in years.  It is really unbelievable to me how well this has worked.  As I am writing this, my cheeks are still slightly pink, but the rash is gone and they feel moisturized, not dry.  Also, instead of looking like a layer of skin has been removed, it looks like my skin is almost completely healed.  I am extremely hopeful that in a couple of weeks, my cheeks will look completely normal again.  One thing I do want to mention is sometimes after I put it on and it soaks in, it stings slightly.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting that and was afraid it was going to make it worse, but it continually looked better, not worse.  This stuff has been a miracle for me!</li>
            <li> Hello:   I bought one Aveeno Moisturizing cream (Eczema Therapy) a few days ago. This morning I receive my express from Amazon.   When I open the Aveeno cream,I find mouth of the bottle which had opened WITHOUT sealed tin.  I felt very very worried and uncomfortable.Without sealed tin,how dare I use this to my baby just 13 months?  Why  WITHOUT sealed tin ? I bought other types cream of Aveeno which all had the sealed tin.  Please tell me the reason.</li>
            <li> I have had eczema since I was a small child and my skin is super sensitive, dry, scaly, patchy, itchy (you get the idea). I have tried almost every over-the-counter product out there to no avail and the prescription creams and ointments stop the itching but do little to clear up the demarcation left by the rash. I purchased this product with the attitude of \\&quot;it can&#x27;t hurt\\&quot;, and honestly, I didn&#x27;t expect much from it. Well surprise, surprise - 72 hours after using it for the first time, my skin felt great, the scales were gone and the marks on the back of my hands started to clear up.  I love the fact that this product is not at all greasy and that it&#x27;s unscented. Needless to say, I don&#x27;t need fragrance to add to my skin irritation woes. If you have eczema or even just really dry skin I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If there was a way to get a bigger bottle of it, the current size is nice but it just doesn&#x27;t last long enough, otherwise good semi greasy lotion for eczema.</li>
            <li> This has been the only thing (and we&#x27;ve tried a few!) that has worked for my 10 month old and her eczema. It was cleared up almost 100% in less than a day. It also worked incredibly well on my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s hands that were a little chapped. It doesn&#x27;t bother fragrance allergies either which is a common problem with other lotions or creams. We won&#x27;t ever buy anything else!</li>
            <li> Works well on our son&#x27;s super sensitive skin.  Eczema isn&#x27;t gone, but it helps.</li>
            <li> Like a lot of other reviewers, I bought this lotion in desperation during a bad bout of puffy, itchy, wrinkly eczema on my EYELIDS (where you cannot put prescription cream). I am NOT exaggerating when I say this cleared up a month-long problem almost OVERNIGHT. I put it on before bed and in the morning the wrinkled puffiness was totally gone. By the next day (using twice more), the flaky skin and itching was also gone. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I seriously consider this one of the best buys I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> The only lotion that works on my kids ezema</li>
            <li> I am not sure if there is any difference between this and the Aveeno Baby Eczema cream.  We use the baby formula on our 4-year old for 3 years and it works great, now we are using the regular Aveeno eczema cream and we don&#x27;t see any difference.  They both work great.  Our son has pretty bad eczema, I put this cream on all over his body right after his bath when the skin is still damp to seal in moisture.  His pediatrician also recommends applying vasaline over the cream in areas more prone to flare ups such as back of the knees &amp; elbows; this really helps.  My son has also been prescribed medicated cream for his skin, but most of the time we don&#x27;t need to use it because the Aveeno cream alone is sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first year was full of trials and errors, but we have finally found a combination of skin care products that work best for my son&#x27;s delicate skin that we now cannot live without:  California Baby Shampoo &amp; Body Wash for super sensitive skin, the Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream and good old Vasaline.</li>
            <li> i have eczema, and it acutely burns my skin i gave it a try a few time , but no!</li>
            <li> After I gave birth to my son, I started suffering from eczema like skin rashes. I have horrible eyelid eczema and recently developed eczema around my neck too. I have been trying a bunch of things, and saw a couple of dermatologists too. I have been using a steroid cream for my eyelids because the doc said it&#x27;s too bad that I need to get it in control quickly. For my neck too she suggested the same steroid cream, but the first time I applied it sting pretty bad. So, I decided to try this oatmeal product instead. And what a miracle it was! In 3 days, I see a 70% recovery. My neck is not itchy.. the redness has reduced very much and it seems like I am healing. I have decided to try the same product on my eyes too now. The steroid cream has done good to my eyelids but I dont want to use it for too long. So, I will try this on my eyes too now.</li>
            <li> So far, it has only been a few days, but I am seeing results with this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on my arm, and didn&#x27;t check it for hours, but when I Did, a small patch had smoothed out a lot and the redness was leaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next morning: Redness was totally gone, it didn&#x27;t itch anymore and my skin was smoothing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next morning: same thing, smoother skin and the bumps were disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have what I would called mild eczema, with certain areas affect. Elbows, and hands, get itchy, red and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this stuff was totally worth it, and is a tremendous help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using it to see if it keeps getting better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any skin issues ever. No pimples or any other issues. But February of last year I spotted a small light pink patch on my the left side of my face. Didn&#x27;t pay much attention to it and after a few months it become worse and the parch become bigger, red and inflamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visited a dermatologist who prescribed Momate cream and a moisturizing lotion. I used it for several months (every other day). It helped reduce the redness a lot but the light pink patch always existed and it would cause breakouts. If I would stop using it for a few days it would become worse. It also left the skin looking very white and thin / flat. At the time I had no idea about steroid creams and how harmful they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using Momate cream immediately and after a few days the skin flared up very bad. All of the left side of my face (cheek) had become very red. It didn&#x27;t itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After searching the net, I found Aveeno Eczema therapy moisturizing cream was the most effective. I&#x27;ve been using it for 20 days and the redness has reduced about 80%. There&#x27;s a noticeable difference everyday. It was dark red and now It is light pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few days it made my skin very dry / flaky, tight and more red (when the cream was washed off). Maybe that is it&#x27;s way to get rid of the irritated skin. The dryness continued but it kept on reducing, so did the redness and the slight swelling. The tightness has totally gone now and there&#x27;s very mild dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know how frustrating it can be to deal with eczema especially if it&#x27;s on your face. Please give this cream a try. It won&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> The cream is smoother and moister than other Aveeno creams and lotion. Others are very good, but this one is better.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the eczema body wash, used both for a week, and my sons skin started to clear up....after the week - it got worse. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months and his skin is worse than it was when we started. It is soft on the skin, but unfortunately didnt help with his eczema at all.</li>
            <li> This has a slightly &#x27;medicinal&#x27; smell but really does the job. I use this in combination with Neutrogena&#x27;s Swedish hand cream on really stubborn eczema spots and the two together work like a miracle cure.</li>
            <li> My son suffered from eczema when he was first born.  I tried a number of creams but nothing worked until the doctor gave me a sample of this.  I&#x27;ve always loved the Aveeno Baby lotion for my kids but I had never heard of this before.  It was a God send!  He saw relief from the first time he used it.  With regular use this keeps his eczema at bay and we never have any flare ups.  I can&#x27;t sing it&#x27;s praises enough!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, works well.</li>
            <li> I was recommended to use this by my pediatrician because my daughter had really bad excema on her face. After a few days of this it went away. This rehydrates her skin so well and is gentle on her sensitive skin. It has a pleasant smell and works wonders!! I use it whenever she gets dry skin or flare ups of the excema. And it clears it right up.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very good for my kid&#x27;s skin. After using cream, it last longer than usual one.&lt;br /&gt;If you using this cream in winter, it will provide perfect protection. :-)</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion for my dry skin. Of course it doesn&#x27;t clear it up completely like a medicated ointment would, it does a great job.</li>
            <li> this product is pretty good. had no problem using it at all. the cream last long for a long time plus fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My daughter has bad eczema between her toes.  It gets so dry the skin cracks open and bleeds.  Every lotion to this point has moisturized a little bit but also irritate it at the same time.  This is the only lotion that soothes her skin and has made such a noticeable improvement in weeks that it is almost gone.  A small miracle.</li>
            <li> I get heat rash and eczema in summer and very dry skin in winter. I could not stand the itchiness. Now I use this and Dove sensitive soap bar year round. I don&#x27;t use fragrances either. This does have a very light tinge of oatmeal scent that dissipates. Apply that once a day, wait until it&#x27;s absorbed into the skin and then put clothes on. Not greasy or sticky. Doesn&#x27;t leave stains on my clothes. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on how soft my skin is. Considering how pricey it is, it&#x27;s worth every penny. My husband even steals it from me and uses it on himself. He got caught red handed and I never would&#x27;ve known because I never smelt it on him.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not seeing much healing but Aveeno seems to stay on the skin longer and I guess offers a bit more protection. I assume more healing could take place if I applied it more often during the day.</li>
            <li> This works great! I haven&#x27;t even been using it for 2 weeks and it already is clearing it up. This by far is this best productive used for my eczema, and it is bad year round. Until I used this. Will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> Finally something that works!</li>
            <li> Terribly painful eczema on my hands during the winter. Within a few hours I saw a difference with this cream -- no joke! After a few days of use, my hands are almost completely clear.</li>
            <li> After years of torment with &#x27;winter eczema, while trying to use steroid creams as sparingly as possible, I tried Aveeno Eczema Therapy Cream.&lt;br /&gt;After a few days of use, the rash and itching were gone, and with daily use, it has not come back.  The stuff works, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> Best product for my son eczema. This size isn&#x27;t normally found in stores,  especially at this price.</li>
            <li> The first lotion specifically for eczema that I&#x27;ve used that actually made my eczema hurt even worse and didn&#x27;t help at all. I&#x27;ll stick to Gold Bond Eczema lotion and Eucerin Body Creme for eczema. Those two products work pretty well for my resistant eczema. I just wanted to try something new, but I guess like the saying goes &amp;#34;if it aint broke, dont fix it...&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> We use this on our boys and it works great. Have been using it since they were born and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I could cry I&#x27;m so happy with this moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve never been diagnosed with eczema, but have suffered through dry patches on my face and arms for years.  They get to the point where they&#x27;re painful, and some would even turn into dry clumps/balls/clusters that looked like pimples, but weren&#x27;t.  I would wear foundation because my skin had red blotches and dry patches all over it, but after an hour the foundation would just look uneven and flaky wherever the dry patches were.  I bought this at Target and it has literally changed my skin in less than a week.  I&#x27;ve used hydrocortisone cream, night creams, etc. on my face and my skin would suck up the moisture within minutes.  With Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream when I wake up in the morning my face still has a dewy feeling to it - I didn&#x27;t know my skin could feel like this!  If you suffer from severly dry skin, dry skin patches, etc. I highly recommend this product.  It&#x27;s awesome for your face - doesn&#x27;t clog your pores and I haven&#x27;t broken out from it at all.  Stop searching and using steroid creams on your face and buy this!</li>
            <li> I have mild eczema on my hands that tends to pop up when it&#x27;s dry out or if I find myself washing my hands excessively. I tried this out while visiting my sister--she uses it on her 2-year-old daughter--and was rather pleased with it. It&#x27;s unscented and is just the right level of moisturizing . . . not too oily but also leaves my skin rather smooth. I typically use a cheaper lotion after washing my hands (unscented Vaseline) but mix this in every now and then or when my hands are feeling a bit itchy and it does the trick.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this at rite aid , same exact stuff. I have eczema on the bottom of my feet, little blisters that itch terribly, they drive me crazy. So doctor gave me a steroid cream and didnt work, made it worse i think. So my son told me about this lotion, so they other day , my foot flared up, and i rubbed this lotion on it until it was completely absorbed, and within 2 minutes, it stopped itching been using for a week, i was amazed couldnt believe it wotked so fast also my feet r clearing up, not all dried up and flacky, no more.  Would deffantly recommend. And deffantly buying some more.</li>
            <li> Best hand cream I have ever found. Works great for dry hands. Recommend highly. Use ever night.</li>
            <li> Ive had to deal with eczema since my first flare up when i was 10. I am currently 20. this past winter i had a really bad flare up and my doctor wasn&#x27;t available to see me right away. So i got this while I waited to see him and get my topical steroid prescription. This really helps calm my skin and keep it moisturized. The only other thing I would use while dealing with a flare up other than medicine would be petroleum jelly. 9.9/10 would recommend.</li>
            <li> This cream is absolutely AMAZING for eczema. Every time I get a little eczema or I feel an area is about to flare up, I just cover the area up and after about 2-3 days, the area is completely healed. I&#x27;ve suffered from severe eczema for many years, all over my body including most of my face, and this cream has changed everything. A little goes a long way, but I admit that I suffocate my eczema with layers of this just in case!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and just had a severe eczema breakout where every moisturizer burned (area turned red and inflamed like a chemical burn), including shea butter-based creams. The only moisturizer that worked was Aveeno eczema therapy. It had to be applied every hour for the first couple of days or the skin started flaking off. What a lifesaver this was!</li>
            <li> Using the &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34; program, you will actually saves some dollars. Used it when my kids was little as he has a very sensitive skin. Non-greasy, no perfume or dye, very mild oatmeal scent, leaves the skin very soft and calms irritations. Could not do better.</li>
            <li> Very good cream! It really works and keep skin soft for hours. Wil most definetely recommand it to people with eczema.</li>
            <li> I finally found a lotion that treats my daughter’s eczema. My daughter developed eczema when she was 2 years old for 10 years we have struggled with so many products. We’ve been to countless visits to the dermatologist. They’ve prescribed prescription topical creams and even oral medications to help her stop with the itching. I read of the effects on prolong use of steroid creams so decided to look up a more natural route; we’ve tried coconut oil, olive oil, Aquaphor, Eucerin, Cetaphil, Vanicream, other Aveeno products and more. But I have to say this is the only lotion that we saw results the next day. It’s been a good 4 months that we are using this and my daughter says that she doesn’t feel like itching using this lotion and that her skin is a lot smoother. I found that applying this lotion first and African shea butter over really helps moisturize her skin.</li>
            <li> this cream is great, stops itching dry skin and gets rid of red spots. I saw a tube at a local pharmacy for almost twice the price, amazon does it again, thank you!!!</li>
            <li> No more dry skin in the winter months! The reviews are real, it truly works. You will see the difference even after a single application.</li>
            <li> Quick background of my eczema and what I&#x27;ve tried to do in order to help with relief. I have minor eczema on each size of my nose, right on my inner cheek. Lately I also developed a very very small amount right at the top of my nose between my eyebrows. Over the last 2-3 years I&#x27;ve tried the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Hydrocortisone 1% cream&lt;br /&gt;- Moisturising creams, all sorts of brands&lt;br /&gt;- Dead sea mud mask&lt;br /&gt;- Moisturising mask left overnight&lt;br /&gt;- Steam facial done by professional aesthetician&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything I&#x27;ve tried from the above has either helped only a little if not none whatsoever. Figured let&#x27;s Google some of the best eczema creams out there with natural ingredients and give it a shot. Most lists I came across mentioned the Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturising Cream as the best out there, especially with its natural ingredients such as oatmeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only 2 days of using it, all I can say is WOW WOW WOW!!!! No more itching, no more redness, plus an amazing smooth patch of skin in the areas where its usually been a tad bit rough or peeling, and sometimes itchy as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really love this cream and hope it continues to do what its been doing for me. Can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;ll do the same for every single person that tries it, but as far as my experience goes, its a lifesaver and this is why I call it my &amp;#34;Magic Cream.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This works super well! I have a little bit of eczema on my arms and after using this product twice, it was gone! My arms are smooth again and I&#x27;m not embarrassed when people see them anymore! Hello short sleeves good bye long sleeves! (:</li>
            <li> This cream cleared up my Grandson&#x27;s eczema quickly.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this product while continuing to look for something to give me some relief from the tingles and the flare ups.  I had been using the steroid cream more lately.  For about a month now, I have been using this cream - about a one inch strip in my hands - and then applied to my sides (my main prone area) after showering each day.  Before, I was experiencing a near constant &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; sensation.  It was begging me to scratch it, but I resisted most of the time.  Now the tingling is gone and while the welts are still there, they are not red and angry anymore.  I will be using this stuff from now on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever posted a review of a product but had to share our great experience with this one. Our daughter has had eczema on her back, hips and arms since she was 4 months old (she&#x27;s 14 months now). The pediatrician recommended Aquaphor (esp after bath to lock in water) or CeraVe. I didn&#x27;t see any improvement from the Aquaphor and the CeraVe seemed to keep things from getting worse but didn&#x27;t really make them better. My mom bought this when I was away and when I returned 3 days later our daughter&#x27;s back was soft, smooth and clear. She&#x27;s just learned to say &amp;#34;itch&amp;#34; and she will crawl over to the changing station and pull this down when the patches on her hips flare up. It&#x27;s amazing. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I saw my Dr who recommended this for my eczema and it works great for me. Consult your doctor before taking any medication even if it an OTC I am not a medical professional and this is a recommendation based solely on my experience and should not be consider advice on to purchase.</li>
            <li> This lotion is perfect for those who suffer from super dry skin.  It&#x27;s non-greasy and long-lasting.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I do not have eczema but I do have dry skin and this helps a lot! The smell is very &amp;#34;oatmeal like&amp;#34; so just be warned.</li>
            <li> Put this on after the shower and it holds the moisture in all day.  Great for very dry skin. I like it.</li>
            <li> Love it, really helps my 11m old&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li> GREAT STUFF,,,,&amp;#34;AVEENO&amp;#34; MAKES GREAT STUFF BUT A LITTLE PRICEY..BUT GREAT STUFF I WOULD RECOMMEND IT ITS NOT GREASY.VERY NICE STUFF</li>
            <li> I really wished this product worked for me, but it didn&#x27;t. I suffer from eczema and thought this product would be great (it has really good reviews after all) unfortunately it worsened my itching. I also found out that when I use this product, it leaves my skin with a weird greasy like texture which is very uncomfortable. Well, I guess every person is different, unlucky me.</li>
            <li> Life changing I have had eczema all my life doctors have prescribed medical cremes nothing help until i tried this Aveeno that was recommended to me online!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have Eczema but I was getting a lot of heat rashes this summer and this cream worked while the others failed. I&#x27;ve always liked Aveeno products.</li>
            <li> I have tried many many creams, lotions over the counter and prescription ones. I felt like I could not win. Then I tried this product. This one works great!!</li>
            <li> Two years ago, I got a red, itchy dime-sized patch on my finger and went to the dermatologist who prescribed a cortisone cream which worked. This year, the rash reappeared and spread across my right hand. It was incredibly itchy, painful in warm water and I was desperate. My dermatologist told me it was &amp;#34;dermatitis,&amp;#34; wasn&#x27;t sure of the cause and gave me a strong steroid cream. The steroid cream would work for a day, but then all my skin would flake off. I&#x27;d stop using it for a day (because my skin was raw and thin) and the rash would come back. After 4 weeks of this, I went for a followup (and after nearly $100 in copays), I decided to give this a shot instead of continuing with a treatment that made me feel uncomfortable (when I&#x27;m told to be super careful not to let the steroid cream touch my face or armpits, I couldn&#x27;t imagine it was that safe for long term use). After day one, I saw improvement. Within a week, the rash is completely gone. I can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough. I only wish I&#x27;d tried this first.</li>
            <li> I use this on my eczema where I need to itch, and it amazingly sooth it.&lt;br /&gt;The countainer is big too.</li>
            <li> so i got him this cream because whenever he stays over he cant take a shower because he didnt have his cream and would end up shriveling to death of dry skin. its the only one he uses and it works the best. he even has a small travel sized one he carries around with him. its very soothing and smells good. i never find traces of his shredded skin around the house, or on him for that matter</li>
            <li> Amazingg! I am 16 and have food allergy induced eczema :( so whenever I eat chocolate dairy and gluten my arms get this huge disgusting patch of eczema and even worse I get it right between my eye brows so everyone can see my face flaking apart. Agh. I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING. No joke everything. This works so well though! You need to use a lot!! So much that it feels gross on you and it burns. The burns means it working guys! Also try using it with metaderms eczema cream. My eczema is gone! No scars or anything and Iv had this eczema for years even when I wasn&#x27;t eating gluten it would stay for months!! It would only get slightly smaller but after using this it completely gone my skin is back to normal as if I never had eczema! SO GLAD ITS GONE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many creams in the past, before I purchased this for my son. It worked very well for him. He also gets skin infections from scratching the surface of his skin off (yikes, I know) and this cream really helped minimize those as well. Now I buy in bulk and he even asks to use it every day.</li>
            <li> It was ok not what I wanted it</li>
            <li> Caused a mild rash, stopped using</li>
            <li> This is the best for any skin problems.</li>
            <li> Very effective for my baby&#x27;s eczema</li>
            <li> This hand cream works well.  It soothes itchy dry skin right away and even heals cracks in the skin quickly.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son who has suffered with very mild patches of eczema on his torso, I just put it on after his bath and it keeps it smooth and gets rid of the dry patches.</li>
            <li> What can I say? I had a bad skin rash on my right hand for 6 months and went to several dermatologists who all said different things. After trying some expensive steroid creams and such, a friend suggested I try eczema lotion. After a few weeks the rash had disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;Flash forward 3 years later and the rash has never reappeared. I use this cream every night on my hands and arms before bed and before I leave for work in the morning.  I signed up for the automatic program where I get a new cream every 3 months so I can save a few cents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cream rubs in smoothly, has no odor, and absorbs in about 3-5 min.</li>
            <li> This cream was recommended by a friend.  It is wonderful to have such good friends.  Retains moisture, keeps skin smooth and no itching.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer and eczema cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with eczema on my hands, and having a sensitive skin and working with bare hands, cold and hot temperatures made it worst. I tried every single hand cream available, from cheap to fancy, and this aveeno product is the only one that really helped! Plus its not oily or grease at all, but it still very effective! Will always buy!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well!&lt;br /&gt;Have used with decent success for SEVERE eczema on my hands. It is mild lotion, and I found that I needed hydrocortisone cream as well.&lt;br /&gt;I was recently thrilled however, to find a different use- when my lips are chapped, if I am away from any source of lip balm I tend to lick them. If you have experienced the extreme redness and irritation that can come from this, you know how painful it can be.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is the ONLY THING that I have found that can soothe chapped and swollen lips in this condition. Medicated balms tend to make it worse.</li>
            <li> Amazing for my eczema</li>
            <li> I swim a mile every other day in a chlorinated pool which dries and irritates my skin.  Moisturizing helps, but only the Aveeno Eczema seems to actually calm the skin.  I don&#x27;t know why it does a better job, but it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> my daughter had bad eczema in 1st 2 years of her life. i wanted to avoid steroids as much as i could. this product is amazing. this worked and we never had to use steroid cream on her. i still use it on her in winter months.</li>
            <li> I have eczema on my hands and was being driven nuts with itching. This cream has really helped...more so than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  Although I still have eczema, this cream seems to lessen the irritation.</li>
            <li> i got this product and it wasn&#x27;t sealed which I think it should have been, Anyway I&#x27;m keeping it because I don&#x27;t want to start repacking it to send it back, I just hope it&#x27;s not a fake or something</li>
            <li> I have eczema on my face and have been using a prescription steroid  but I found out that the steroid cream is addictive and has other scary side effects so I stopped using it. My skin was craving moisture, was cracked, itchy and peeling. Even applying Cetaphil was making it sting horribly. I gave this cream a try based on the good reviews and I am so glad I did! This cream is the answer for me. The irritation is gone and I don&#x27;t have to use the nasty steroid cream anymore!!</li>
            <li> good for moisturizing eczema dry skin, but did not eleviate symptoms.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this is the only cream I can use on my face that treats the sometimes painful rash/flaking I get with when I have a flare-up.</li>
            <li> I totally recommend this to anyone with children who have eczema. It has worked for our son since he was 3 months old and we are still going strong 3 years later! This lotion is the least expensive kind of all of the specialty eczema lotions!</li>
            <li> My 11 month old recently developed a rash that the doctor diagnosed as eczema.  We used the prescription cream but I was looking for something for daily use.  This cream is perfect.  It provides relief to my boy and keeps the eczema at bay.  Well worth it.</li>
            <li> I tried several different brands and this one feels most smooth, and doesn´t get cakey after long massaging. And it smells good also. Itchiness goes away, but other brands helped with itchiness too.</li>
            <li> I got tired of having Eczema because it was an annoying rash for my hands. After a week or two, it was completely gone.</li>
            <li> I love how thick the lotion is. Really feels like its a deep moisturiser. Its also very gentle as I use it on my face too</li>
            <li> My daughter age 2 has mild form of eczema since birth. I used to use aquaphor but the consistency was something i wasn&#x27;t happy with! around one year i switched to aveeno, and love it since then! it absorbs well to the skin! And her skin is absolutely smooth and great ! the important thing any one  should realize is that with one application eczema won&#x27;t disappear . its not a magic cure! it takes several applications a day till eczema subsides and then applying atleast 1 to 2 times a day! recently we went on a trip and i forgot the cream. I must have not applied the cream for 4 days and my daughter had a bad flare up ! And thats when I realized how much aveeno is helping my daughter&#x27;s skin on a daily basis!</li>
            <li> Reduced my daughter&#x27;s eczema drastically. Noticed an improvement in a few days, and almost entirely eliminated it in a month.</li>
            <li> Sticky residue but works as reported to soothe itchy eczematous skin</li>
            <li> This is the only cream we&#x27;ve tried so far that heals up our toddler&#x27;s eczema. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This cream is helping my itch.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand that the shops aren&#x27;t filled with this ointment in the Netherlands! It really soothes dry skin with a trace of eczema.</li>
            <li> No icky greasy film left on your skin, absorbs fast and the smell is very light. It doesn&#x27;t over power you and leaves my skin soft. My Eczema is clearing up and I barely scratch anymore. Use it after a shower or bath when your skin is still somewhat wet. I hope it helps you!</li>
            <li> Who gets Eczema on their foot?? Apparently, it happens. Very uncool. Itch can be relentless at times. I wash my foot in cool water with a gentle cleanser like CeraVe, then slather Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream all over, and then seal with a cotton sock. This gives me instant relief. Price online is much better than store prices.</li>
            <li> Only need a small amount &amp; works great.</li>
            <li> Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream is my absolute favorite product for my hands and feet to treat my Eczema. It is non-greasy and quickly is absorbed, so it does not interfere with my being able to use my hands typing at work. Nice product, easy on the hands, and works well.</li>
            <li> By far the best moisturizer on the market. All three of my kids suffer with eczema and this cream really does penetrate the dry skin and alleviate their itching. Totally worth the price, plus having it on subscription with Amazon makes it even more affordable.</li>
            <li> Amazing! This product is clearing up my sons eczema! He has had a bad case of eczema for the past 8 months. Nothing was curing it, but this has done wonders for his skin. He doesnt itch anymore and rarely has outbreaks! Im very impressed. He even like to show me just how good his legs look in the mornings. Im pretty impressed! I use this daily, all over his body and it has really helped his outbreaks with eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I also use other products along with the Aveeno to help relieve the rash. I use a sensitive laundry soap, California baby eczema wash in the bath and then I use the Aveeno cream. All of these things are helping him not have the break outs of eczema. His skin looks amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lefty so my right hand is generally exposed to less than my left, however for the past year or so I had noticed the skin on the inside of two fingers on my right hand had become red and very dry. After a while small blisters started to form and the skin became unbearably itchy. I had no idea what was going on. I tried some hydrocortizone cream and it worked a little, but somehow I happened across this stuff on Amazon and all of a sudden slapped myself on the forehead when I saw the word \\&quot;Eczema\\&quot;. Of course that is what I&#x27;ve been suffering with. Leave it to a 30 year old guy to never go to the doctor and just let things figure themselves out. So anyway, I tried this stuff and almost immediately it stops the itching...gave it 24 hours and the red dry skin was almost gone. I&#x27;ve used it on a daily basis and I NEVER have the itching anymore. The red dry skin is still just barely visible on the inside of one of my fingers, but I&#x27;m willing to take that over itchy, blistering dry skin. I&#x27;m finally going to a dermatologist on Monday about a completely unrelated bump on my shoulder (wish me luck), I guess I will ask him if I really do have eczema.</li>
            <li> I recommend this stuff to everyone it is amazing.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband&#x27;s very persistent itch due to a certain condition.  It has helped, and I find that nothing else has done the job as well.</li>
            <li> I have terrible eczema so thought I would give this a try since I do like Aveeno products. It does not heal my eczema in any way, but I find it to be slightly soothing and very moisturizing. I would recommend it to sooth but nothing cures eczema. There are less expensive moistures that I have used with the same results.</li>
            <li> Exactly as ordered. This is a nice lotion for sensitive skin. I use it on my sons face every night. I ran out awhile back and tried using some of my regular lotion and he cried when I put it on. This lotion has more moisture to it so when you put it on, it&#x27;s cool and silky, like you&#x27;re just putting water on your face.</li>
            <li> Tried a lot of anti-eczema moisturizing creams before this one, but this one has really done a lot to help clear it up. Works better than those with hydrocortisone in my opinion too.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle worker!  I was having a slight case of eczema... and this cleared it up 99%.  I happened upon it one day, in Target, and decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;m so glad I did!  And now, I buy on Amazon... much less expensive here.  LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get rid of it, but took care of redness and itching.</li>
            <li> Both of my children have had mild eczema.  I use this daily more as a preventative than a cure.  I usually use an over the counter hydrocortisone for flare ups but with consistent use of the Aveeno, we go weeks to months without skin issues.</li>
            <li> I have had dry face for over 10 years. no moisturizing cream worked for me until now. i was so fed up with having to put up the cream every time i washed my face. But this aveeno product has solved my problem. It provides very long lasting moisture and has actually repaired the skin. i can go on for days without applying it. and the face still stays smooth. highly recommended for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Best over the counter lotion I have found for Eczema! Great price on amazon!</li>
            <li> If your baby is suffering with exema or really sensitive skin this IS the answer!</li>
            <li> Works as described but not sure it truly works for those with Eczema.</li>
            <li> A gentle lotion for baby who&#x27;s suffering for eczema.</li>
            <li> Best Moisturizing cream</li>
            <li> Good product. Very useful for skin</li>
            <li> Cleared up my 3 month old daughters dry, scaly, cracked skin in less than 1 day. We use it now twice a day and I won&#x27;t put anything else on her. I love it!</li>
            <li> My 2 yr old daughter has eczema pretty badly, especially in the summer months. Nothing we have tried before has really helped with the break outs so I was a little reluctant to try this, thinking it would be like all the other things we have tried. Was I ever wrong! This product is great. It has helped clear up her eczema and has also prevented any break outs since we started using it almost 4 months ago. Even with the hot weather we&#x27;ve recently had, her skin is still clear. We will definitely continue using this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who suffers from a terrible case of eczema on his face.  For years, he was seeing a doctor to get prescriptions but then we found out the cream they were giving him was loaded with steroids.  He asked me to find an alternative so I bought this.  Immediately he saw results and saw the redness and itchiness vanish.  He said it even worked quicker than the doctor&#x27;s med.  I wasnt going to bother leaving a review but my husband insisted.  His face went from red, peeling and itchy to perfectly normal, seemingly overnight!</li>
            <li> this product is a must have for all homes. its gentle on the skin and true to what it says it reduces itching. Im almost tempted to use it as an everyday cream. wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Does not work as advertized as my face started burning shortly after I put it on. I have had eczema my whole life and some products work, and some do not. This product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> My baby girl has mild seborrheic dermatitis around her neck.  This stuff cleared it up after one application.</li>
            <li> This is quite impressive because it works almost as well as the steroid creams on the market.  I will definitely keep purchasing this because my skin gets dry especially due to different seasons.</li>
            <li> I love this product and can buy it cheaper hear than anywhere else. I do not have eczema, but this product is great for anyone who either washes their hands a lot (i.e.l food industry) or lives in a climate with dry air. I absolutely love this product and it makes my hands soft and heals dry skin after one use.</li>
            <li> I have not been formally diagnosed with eczema, but a few years ago we moved to a desert climate. It is SO DRY here! I sleep with a humidifier and use a lot of lotion. Lately I have been waking up in the middle of the night with painfully itchy legs from the knees down. This cream stops the itching IMMEDIATELY. I took one star off because it does leave a film on my legs and I have to wait for it to dry somewhat before I get back in bed, but that is so worth the relief I get. Don&#x27;t hesitate to try it. I do wish it came in a large pump bottle.</li>
            <li> Recommended for eczema. Please use if your baby have eczema. Try to miss it up with a little aquaphor and apply on your baby&#x27;s affected areas or all over the body.</li>
            <li> This works like a miracle. I have face eczema one or twice a year for the past 3 years due to allergy, and it always disappear after a steroid shot and a week of prescription pills. This summer it came back again. I went to the hospital as usual and got a shot and a week of pills. But after that week, it came back again. It disappears for two days and reappear for 2 days for about a month, and suddenly it got worse that I could not stand it anymore. I went to the allergy clinic and got a blood test for allergy. They also scheduled an appointment for me to get skin tests to find out exactly what i am allergic too. But because of those tests, I could not take any allergy pills for at least 5 days and steroid shot/pills for 6 weeks. My face was so bad during this period that I decided to go online and do some research. I found this cream and the white vinegar and decided to give a try. After 12 hours of using them, my face was much better, and after 3 days I could not even see the eczema on my face. I will still get my skin tests for allergy, but I will continue using them until I feel safe to stop. A bonus is that my acne even gets better.</li>
            <li> Both my daughters have eczema, and one also has sensitive skin. I use this one for her when her skin becomes irritated or rashy. She loves this lotion, and it really helps with redness/roughness/itching. It is not as thick as some of the other lotions we use, but it soothes irritated skin very effectively.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from dry skin especially on my face which can be very embarrassing when you&#x27;re in public. After trying every product recommended to me for the past year with no changes I heard about this from the cashier at the store. I gave it a try and it&#x27;s only been a week but my skin has stopped peeling and I am no longer embarrassed to go out in public. I love this cream so much and will definitely keep using aveeno products.</li>
            <li> I have mild eczema and dermatographism, this lotion is amazing !!</li>
            <li> worked wonders on my son&#x27;s skin. He has very sensitive skin and this is the only cream that helps clear it up.</li>
            <li> Worked great on a small patch of redness under my eye that was worsening over the past 4-5 weeks. Not sure if it was eczema. Rarely itched but is almost completely gone after 3 days of keeping it moisturized with this stuff! I took before and after pics but not sure how to post or I would.</li>
            <li> Had been plagued by a red scaly patch on my leg for months.Tried various creams and lotions. It would get a little better and then worse again. Finally decided I&#x27;d have to see a dermatologist,but before I did, ran across tho product and thought I&#x27;d make one last try. Within days it was better and within three weeks entirely disappeared. Try it!</li>
            <li> I have battled eczema for years.  During the winter, I would get it on my arms and legs.  I hated covering myself in a steroid cream but that was the only way to control it.  Now, I use this product every day, during the winter, and my eczema has not come back at all.  In fact, when I started using it last winter, my legs had a lot of eczema rashes.  The cream made them go away and kept them away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried another brand but it did not work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is a college swimmer.  She does not have eczema but the chlorine really dries out her skin, especially in the winter.  She began using this cream a few months ago and has noticed a huge difference.  Nothing else she has tried has worked this well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent YEARS trying to heal my eczema.  Oils, expensive lotions, toxic smelling ointments - all to no avail.  Yes, this is a little more expensive than some other regular lotions, but once I finally broke down and gave it a try, I realized I would spend double what they charge!  Within a week the cracking and peeling stopped!  My hands finally look normal again!  Thank you Aveeno!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different products and I always end up throwing them away then going back to Aveeno&#x27;s Eczema therapy. It is the only thing that really seems to work on my hands. Within a couple of days my hands look almost like that of a normal person&#x27;s, which is a major thing for me. A few other products have little or no effect for me, but most actually make it worse, including other products said to be for Eczema.</li>
            <li> We got a free sample of this at dr office.  I dont have babies and my kids dont have exzema although i used to as a child.  We used it in winter when my kids have really dry skin and it works well without leaving a greasy feeling or wet feeling which they absolutey hate.  Ive used it too and it helps clear up dry skin and chapped skin and some very mild rash like skin.  Im not sure how it works for excema but it works nicely without excema .  We have since bought a couple bottles of this.</li>
            <li> My son had very bad eczema.  It was embarrassing to take him to the doctor.  We started doing luke warm baths daily and applying this lotion.  On areas were he drools, I apply Burt Bee&#x27;s Ointment or Aquaphor to seal it in.  This lotion doesn&#x27;t help major flare-ups, only prescription or  anti-itch cream work for us, but it does do a great job of preventing flare-ups. Also, no smells and isn&#x27;t greasy.  I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle product for me. Every winter I get an eczema flare up. It used to pop up in small patches on my arms but in recent years it has progressed to large, ashy, cracking, incredibly itchy patches on my elbows and between my fingers. Doctors I&#x27;ve seen believe it is caused by wearing long sleeved jackets, sweaters, gloves etc. in the winter and thought it was caused by irritation from fabric. Here&#x27;s what I have tried with limited success: hydro-cortisone cream, aloe vera, prescription steroid creams, oral anti-histamine, topical anti-histamine, oatmeal baths, bandages to limit skin contact with fabric, tons of OTC moisturizers, oils, petroleum gel as a barrier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was miserable. I&#x27;d spend all day feeling like my elbows were on fire, sometimes with itchiness and sometimes with pain. They would crack, bleed, looked disgusting, and there was just no way I could walk around in the winter without a jacket. I was waiting on a dermatologist referral when I decided to try this product. As soon as I applied it, I felt relief and actually said &amp;#34;Ahhh&amp;#34; out loud. I applied it many times a day for the first couple of days (I was just that itchy) and soon felt less need to apply it. After 2 weeks or so my elbows and hands looked completely normal and were no longer itchy at all. I cancelled my dermatologist appointment and switched to using the cream once every few days just as a preventative measure. My eczema stayed away for the rest of the winter, I couldn&#x27;t believe it! Off all the things I&#x27;ve tried, this cream was the first one to bring relief and help my skin return to normal. Now I can&#x27;t live without it and still use it once in awhile even in the summer if I notice a dry or itchy spot anywhere on my body.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews very carefully because as many other reviewers mentioned, I was looking for something to sooth my itchy skin.  The lotion coats your hands with almost an oil so I thought for sure this would be a product that worked.  I at first used the product three times a day, once in the morning, once after work, and once before bed and some of the spots stayed consistent instead of getting worse.  I was hopeful, but all it did was maintain it did not improve.  Also, applying the lotion 3x a day isn&#x27;t feasible because your hands are so greasy that anything you touch becomes grimy.  I am still using it every night before bed just because it does adhere well to your hands, so I have a lotion on my hands before bed but I am actively looking for another product.  So far straight neosporin has actually worked really well so I&#x27;m looking for a cream that has this as an ingredient (to anyone else who has experienced the same problems as I have).  It may just be me and my skin is particularly bad because there are a lot of positive reviews but I just didn&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li> This product works GRREAAT! It&#x27;s clearing up a trouble area on my leg so quick :&#x27;)...</li>
            <li> My newborn son developed eczema recently around his neck, folds of his arms and legs.  It was so red and nothing seemed to work.  We had tried Cetaphil, Burt&#x27;s Bees Ointment and regular Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s baby cream.  I decided to try Aveeno based on the reviews I read and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  The change in his skin was amazing.  The redness went away almost completely.  I use it right after giving him a bath with the Aveeno eczema soothing bath treatment.  I think the combination works like a charm!  I do notice that anytime I miss putting this lotion on him his redness comes right back.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from eczema since I was born. I have been to countless dermatologists  over the years and have had more prescriptions than you can fathom. Needless to say, I was wary of how much this lotion would work. Holy crap I wish I had this years and years ago. It didn&#x27;t just get rid of redness, it didn&#x27;t just soothe the itch...it GOT RID of the eczema!  Yeah, it&#x27;s pricey but seriously, I would probably pay ten times the asking price as long as it keeps the eczema away. I use it liberally after my morning shower and have used it for about a month. It took a couple of days for it to work but seriously, hang in there. Thankfully I haven&#x27;t had to use it on my face (yet) but I know that aveeno is gentle enough on my sensitive skin. I hope that if you suffer from eczema, this will work for you as well as it does for me.</li>
            <li> My son has always had mild eczema, since birth. We&#x27;ve tried numerous creams, including prescription creams, and nothing has made a noticeable long-term improvement. I thought I&#x27;d try this, what the heck. I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. Within 3 days, there was a very noticeable improvement and he stopped scratching his legs and arms on about day 2. No more bleeding, no more patches, no more annoying eczema. I&#x27;m honestly amazed. I apply every day, and a little goes a long way. It is a little sticky for about 10 minutes after application. Worth every penny I paid; I just wish this cream was around 3 years ago. My son actually asks for it, now, and his daycare provider is thrilled since she no longer has to monitor him for constant scratching.</li>
            <li> I occasionally suffer from eczema on my hands and feet. After just one use there was a noticeable improvement with less itchiness and dry skin.</li>
            <li> We tried multiple products before finally finding this one. When my son&#x27;s eczema was really bad we would do two short baths a day and apply this immediately after. It seals in the moisture well and we live in a very dry climate.</li>
            <li> The only product we&#x27;ve found that relieves my husband&#x27;s eczema. He&#x27;s been using this product now for about two years and it&#x27;s still the one he prefers.</li>
            <li> helped my niece a lot during her skin problem when her skin dried up and got scratches. it is very soothing and helped improve her condition!</li>
            <li> My daughter has eczema and used to use steroid creams to control it.  This has kept her skin under control and she doesn&#x27;t need medications anymore.  It isn&#x27;t greasy and absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> I bought this cream to treat a skin rash I had.  I have tried the usual go-to creams (steroid creams, allergy creams), but only with minimal success.  Then, I came across this cream and decided to give it a try, and my rash looked significantly better within a day!  After my rash was completely gone, I kept using this cream on my skin, which tends to be very dry.  It has helped soften up my skin and I love it.  I would definitely recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li> Stopped itching immediately, flaking is getting better, worse section of psoriasis is getting better quickly also. Redness is still present but it has only been 3 days. Try it, it is at least good in the short term, hoping things get better and better.</li>
            <li> This really worked for my daughter(8month old) eczema.  She just had it around her joints since she was born.  After 1 week of using this lotion, I saw a decrease in irritation.  Now, 2 months later--she has no sign of it at all.  And we hardly every apply the lotion.  Hopefully, she doesn&#x27;t have a recurrence, but if she does we know what works.  This is a great price at Amazon especially with Subscribe and save and amazon mom..I first bought it at target for 12.99 to try it out and really glad I checked on Amazon before I bought the second bottle.  Highly Recommend!!</li>
            <li> This is the only product that works for me! It doesn&#x27;t hurt or burn when applied. I stock pile this stuff!! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> great product. excellent handle</li>
            <li> Good for moisturizing eczema dry skin, but did not elevate symptoms. Works well for all ages. I applied it on my 2 year old son and it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have extremely sensitive skin, you may consider the following&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003BJZ1P6/ref&#x3D;as_li_tl?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;1789&amp;creative&#x3D;390957&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B003BJZ1P6&amp;linkCode&#x3D;as2&amp;tag&#x3D;derdigki-20&amp;linkId&#x3D;XBYGMHFLPTW2ONDB</li>
            <li> It‘s nice， next time also to buy.</li>
            <li> As much as I&#x27;ve tried other natural products to treat my eczema this is the only one that works, time and time again.  It&#x27;s a great eczema cream.</li>
            <li> This cream works really well. However, I find that it&#x27;ll help sooth my eczema for a day or two and then the flare ups come back. If I stop using for a day or so the cream starts helping my eczema again. It&#x27;s weird, I don&#x27;t understand it.</li>
            <li> My husband recently developed eczema and has tried several different creams.  He liked this one the best, however, it doesn&#x27;t come in a big enough size, so we get the Curel Itch Defense instead.</li>
            <li> I have just tried this product for my eyelid eczema. I made this purchase after reading all the amazing reviews on how this product cured eyelid eczema like magic. Well, this product made my condition worse. When i tried it the first time, my eyelid skin get extremely irritated, inflamed, and swollen. I went to the clinic and the doctor put me on an extensive course of steroids and it got better. Then the eczema returned after stopping the medication. I thought i should give aveeno another try. Right after using it for the second time, my eyelids became severely inflamed and irritated. ;-)  i will never recommend it for this type of eczema.</li>
            <li> Both my kids have suffered from eczema and therefore we are always on the market for ointments that would relieve their complaints. Before starting my review about this product in particular, I want to share a few observations about this nasty skin condition:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the best cure for eczema is time... My older child has almost completely grown out of it by the age of three. Now my younger has a big deal of eczema especially prominent in her right hand fourth finger area. I am pretty optimistic no matter how bad it looks at the moment she will be okay within a year or so. This is what pediatricians agree too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second best treatment is unfortunately steroids. They are good at suppressing local inflammation which is the cause of eczema. However they have huge adverse effects ranging from the decline in general immunity to total growth suppression and psychiatric problems. Many experts claim that topical administration is innocent but I never feel comfortable so those are out of consideration for me. I can&#x27;t live with the suspicion of doing a general harm to my child while trying to cure a relatively limited problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best you can do is to avoid over washing the area, moisturize as much as possible and be patient...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we come to this particular item... I have had it over a month now and bought it mostly due to the good reviews in amazon. Another source I checked before clicking the purchase button was EWG (environmental working group), an agency that classifies skin products based on the ingredients and tell you how harmful it is. According to their evaluation this item gets 2/10 ( lower the better) and is considered to be pretty safe for human use. Therefore, despite not believing the magical therapeutic potential, I still decided to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month of regular use, I have observed ABSOLUTELY NO improvement in my daughter&#x27;s eczema. I would give it 5 stars even if I saw a slight change but nothing whatsoever. It may be a good general moisturizer and may prevent eczema or other skin conditions if applied routinely but over an existing eczema it has no healing potential. I don&#x27;t want to generalize and say it won&#x27;t work for you since that would not be a scientific claim, but based on my experience and  other reviewers complaining about the same inadequacy, I can not recommend the cream as a treatment for moderate to severe eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a better shoot for your money, I suggest trying any of the diaper rash creams that has zinc oxide in it as the active ingredient. I have got some success with those despite not having achieved a full recovery yet...ng whatsoever.

            <li> Best thing my skin has experienced in many years. Great for problem skin, rashes, etc. It is extremely soothing and absorbs well ~ not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Works for dry skin and eczema. It&#x27;s a bit pricey though, so if you don&#x27;t have a flare up I guess you could switch back to your regular lotion (I like Lubriderm and St Ives which are much more affordable and work great).</li>
            <li> After many failed attempts with different kinds of prescription medication I tried this. Started working as soon as I used it. I also used the bath soak, together in 3 days all reddness and itching has almost completly stopped and gone away. I have been suffering with this outbreak for a solid 3 months.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have eczema but this is really good moisturizer anyway. It lasts long but not greasy, and there&#x27;s no strong smell. My favorite.</li>
            <li> This lotion works wonders for my husbands sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> So so. But didn&#x27;t help my kids eczema at all</li>
            <li> The effect is very good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a common story amongst eczema sufferers, you&#x27;ve tried all the ointments, creams and lotions out there but none of it seems to help or even makes it worse. I know it did for me, until I finally realized I am sensitive to Parabens, a very common preservative in the cosmetics industry. I discovered this when I used Cetraben, a brand that solely contains Paraffin and Parabens. I know for a fact I don&#x27;t react to Paraffin, using Vaseline every day on my hyper sensitive face, so what else could it be? After having had continuous eczema that wouldn&#x27;t clear up for 6 months, I started to look at my collection of moisturisers more critically. And what did I find? Every single one of them contained Parabens, except for my trusty old Vaseline. I went to the GP and they prescribed me a huge tub of Hydromol. It wasn&#x27;t exactely what I was looking for because I already knew that Vaseline helped my skin from getting worse (although not healing it either), Hydromol has become a useful (SLS free) soap substitute in the shower so I can avoid the numerous bottles of body wash my and my parner have collected over the years.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, what I was -really- looking for was a Paraben free cream (not an greasy ointment like Vaseline OR Hydromol. I had to wash my clothes practically every day!), so with that in mind I looked around and found Aveeno&#x27;s paraben free products. Because this particular product (Eczema Therapy) is not available in the UK, I bought their regular moisturiser which also claimed to be good for eczema. I am a sceptical person and don&#x27;t easily believe the whole &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; fad (even though I am inclined to believe Oatmeal DOES help), I was simply trying to get away from any -possible- irritants my skin could overreact to. And behold... it&#x27;s been my 3rd day of using the cream, I applied it maybe 3-4 times a day and it&#x27;s clearing up -amazingly-. I never expected this and was more than ready for another disappointment, but this... I can safely say Aveeno has wonme over. The only problem is... this small 100ml tube is almost gone already, after a mere 3 days! Being 7 pound per tube, I am not looking forward to shelling out huge amounts of money for this cream. I&#x27;m not a particularly big earner and at this rate I would have to spend 70 quid a month to keep my skin smooth and healthy. Maybe it&#x27;s worth it, not having to deal with agonizing itching and looking like a diseased person. I&#x27;ll have to consider this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is: RECOMMENDED. PLEASE TRY THIS IF OTHER CREAMS/OINTMENTS/LOTIONS ONLY SEEM TO MAKE YOUR CONDITION WORSE. IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE OF PARABENS. :)</li>
            <li> For the last 2 years, I noticed that I started itching a lot by my right wrist and my left shin.  Small bumps started forming.  So I went to the dermatologist and found out that I had a mild case of eczema.  I would try to avoid scratching by running the areas under hot water, but sometimes the itching was unbearable.  The dermatologist gave me a prescription for a corticosteroid.  Not really a fan of steroids and finding out that it was a really expensive co-pay, I saw this in skin care isle at my local pharmacy and decided to try it.  It worked like a charm!  Yes, it&#x27;s a little greasier than the other Aveeno lotions but, I&#x27;d rather deal with that than eczema.  My boyfriend has eczema on his hands which are worse and he will see the dermatologist soon.  But in the mean time, he is using this product and has seen improvement.  I will always recommend this product to people that are dealing with eczema.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that I think this HELPS my excema but it doesnt WORSEN IT. MOst lotions burns my skin or is TOO HEAVY for all over the body, but this is creamy yet light enough for a body lotion and doesn&#x27;t burn my skin (excema is several places all over my body). It DOES NOT have a \\&quot;medicine\\&quot; or \\&quot;serious lotion\\&quot; smell either, which is fabulous.</li>
            <li> I have EXTREME eczema problems and this was the BEST BY FAR cream I ever used.  I was very upset that they decided to discontinue making this and I have not found its equal with any of the other products on the market. NONE! And I have spent A LOT of money trying to find it.</li>
            <li> This worked on my hands with my eczema when nothing else would.  It has your hands feeling so soft and within a week&#x27;s time, my symptoms were cleared.  It is not greasy and you will feel relief immediately.</li>
            <li> I get bad eczema, especially in the summer time and living in the worst humidity (Texas)... This cream is amazing and a total life saver for me! It really keeps my skin moisturized and soothes itching! I definitely recommend purchasing!!!</li>
            <li> I am ready to rave about this product! I was having an annoying rash under my eye for several months. I tried everything over the counter I could think of and home remedies. It started to spread on my eyelid and then to my other eye! I finally figured out that it was eyelid eczema and after reading the great reviews on this product, I decided it was worth a shot. I did not want to use anything with steroids on my eye, especially since that can thin your skin. I tried this Aveeno and by the next day, there was improvement. I was still holding my breath though, hoping it would continue since sometimes it can get better then worse again. I am happy to report, it continued to improve and after 2 weeks of use, I feel fairly confident that it is quite healed. I will keep putting it on once every night at least to make sure the eczema stays away. When I first used it, I was putting it on 4-5 times a day. I was also quite pleased with the size of the product, much bigger than I expected. AND a little goes a LONG way. Yay for Aveeno!!!</li>
            <li> I have mild eczema on my hands and this cream is great for treating it.  It would work well as a daily cream also.</li>
            <li> the only lotion that actually helps clear my excema.  nothing else works as well as this.</li>
            <li> very good to help with eczema and to prevent new outbreak</li>
            <li> We have been buying this cream for years now for my daughter who has eczema. Works great. She seldom gets outbreaks and when she does it&#x27;s only on her hands usually between or around her fingers (probably from not drying hands properly after washing them). We started buying this along with California Baby Eczema shampoo and body wash so to be honest i&#x27;m not sure which one helped more but this combination worked great for her so we kept it. Before, she would get outbreaks all over and we kept having to use triamcinolone now we hardly ever use that stuff.</li>
            <li> Awaome lotion no more eczema!!</li>
            <li> I have suffered from dry, itchy, weeping (clear fluid) skin patches on the sides of my nose and my chin on and off for a few years of my life. I moved to the US last November and temperatures where I live have reached -20C (-4F) which made my face more upset with me. I went out and bought Cerave moisturiser and at first it was... okay. It was a little thin, but it seemed to keep everything at bay.  Recently the hot, humid weather of summer has hit us and my skin weirdly reacted to it with a vengeance. This has never happened to me in the summer before, but it was just so painful and the Cerave stung so much while having no effect that I knew I would have to change products.  First, I bought a small tube of regular Aveeno daily moisturiser and would apply it to the worst parts of my face on top of the Cerave. If anything, this seemed to make my skin extra angry, though I fruitlessly continued, hoping it was just taking its time to react. After a month, I conceded defeat.  I researched my condition properly and realised I most likely had something called perioral eczema. I googled pictures of it and it was like looking at my own face. Armed with this self-diagnosis (don&#x27;t judge), I started researching over the counter cures because I don&#x27;t want to use steroids. What I saw mentioned a lot was Cerave (-_-) but then I came across a blog posting of a woman who used the Aveeno eczema therapy cream and the Aveeno baby bath wash/shampoo. I ran out to Walmart and bought them both despite the $11 price tag on the cream. Seeing that it&#x27;s $17ish here, I would recommend buying it from Walmart if at all possible.  As soon as I got home, I washed and moisturised my face with these products. The results were immediate. I mean yeah, the red skin was still there, but it felt so much calmer. The stinging and itching all but vanished. I did get some itchiness a couple of hours later, but applying a little more cream helped immensely.  I have continued to wash and moisturise my face twice a day and my eczema is now gone! I didn&#x27;t even know my facial skin had the ability to be so smooth. Even my husband has been impressed with the dramatic improvements since he has been so used to seeing me look like I partake in rubbing sandpaper on my chin.  One word of caution: The moisturiser goes a long way. I squeeze out maybe an inch to an inch and a half of product and rub it into my entire face. Anymore than that and you&#x27;ll become an oil slick immediately. Your face will become oily as the day goes on, but if you just wash it off and apply another coat after, it&#x27;ll help. I&#x27;d rather be a little oily than how I was before, anyway.  I would recommend this to anyone with facial eczema who has not tried this yet. It won&#x27;t work for everyone, just like Cerave doesn&#x27;t work for me but works with many others.  Edit: Unfortunately I have had to downgrade this review from 5 to 4 stars. While it does a good job moisturising the normal parts of my face, as the summer went on and the cold snap of autumn has arrived, my eczema has come back with a vengeance and now this cream and the baby wash do nothing for me. My face is worse than it has ever been before. I don&#x27;t blame the Aveeno products, I think maybe it&#x27;s something in my diet. I just wanted to come back and warn that this isn&#x27;t a miracle product, you will need to find out what is actually causing your eczema; this will just relieve the feeling of itching and pain.</li>
            <li> I started using Aveeno  Eczema cream when everything else, even what the dermatologist had given me, didn&#x27;t stop the rash I would get on my legs. I use Aveeno every day and no more rash, no more itch. It&#x27;s a great product. Don&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
            <li> We love this lotion to help control my 3.5 year old&#x27;s mild eczema.</li>
            <li> I suffer with very dry skin...even though I don&#x27;t have Eczema this works perfectly as a face moisturizer.  Love this product</li>
            <li> This creme has helped to clear my eczema and treat dry skin problems. It relieves the itching and calms the inflammation. I highly recommend this for any allergy/eczema sufferers.</li>
            <li> feels great. Moist feeling last a while.  It works well all over body, sometimes I even use it on my face in the winter months.</li>
            <li> Excellent Cream.I have been using various creams for many years for bothersome itch,cracking caused by eczema.&lt;br /&gt;I put this cream on the day I received it and noticed diminished eczema symptoms,itching,burning etc. after a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it daily as needed the last few days and the improvement in my skin is remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;So far it is the best cream I have used ,including a cream that was prescribed for me by a physician.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend,excellent price.</li>
            <li> Nice one.. works well and pretty effective..</li>
            <li> Dry skin - have some Therapy</li>
            <li> The Aveeno eczema therapy works wonders. My LO&#x27;s eczema got worse last week and it appeared itchy because he&#x27;s easily irritated and always scraching his face. I tried to call the pediatrician&#x27;s office to make an appointment on Friday but the office was closed, so i decided to look for a temporary solution over the weekend to put my LO out of the annoying itchiness. And then I found this. Got it on Saturday with same-day shipping. Applied twice on his face and the redness was almost gone the next day. On Monday his face had gotten a lot smoother. Thank you Aveeno!</li>
            <li> This works wonders for my 1 year old who has eczema. It clears it right up and keeps it away.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful for this product but it provides no relief and makes your skin all oily and terrible.</li>
            <li> My son has bad eczema. ..ive been using this daily for 2 weeks. ..0 new spots and his skin in actually smooth!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Does help alleviate some of the pain and dryness associated with eczema.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but this product helped my son&#x27;s eczema! We went to two different doctor&#x27;s including an allergist...they just prescribed MORE steroid and antibiotic creams and allergy medicine..how annoying! I&#x27;ve tried almost all the creams and washes at the store and none of them helped. Anyway, so I came across this and read the reviews..so I said what the heck, might as well try it out. So I bought it and the wash. I wouldn&#x27;t say it healed the eczema but it totally made his face look way better than it did when he was using all those other creams. I highly recommend this to anyone with eczema. What&#x27;s another couple of bucks to spend on another cream? It might just work for you.</li>
            <li> Very good, my baby eczema because often itch, use have significantly improved after 3 day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dry skin on the back of my hands and this is the only thing that gets rid of it! I just put it on at night time before bed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing and helps stop the itch mildly, and the &amp;#34;non scent&amp;#34; it has is clearly made to not &amp;#34;have a smell&amp;#34; and in turn, has an empty bland smell to it - so much that I just can&#x27;t stand smelling for a few minutes after putting it on - but that could just be me!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t help my baby&#x27;s eczema</li>
            <li> Did not work for my baby&#x27;s eczema. I ended up trying many other baby products. Finally, I used baby aquaphor which works wonder. My baby has eczema free skin.</li>
            <li> Aveeno products are awful for eczema. I have tried many different types of their products and they all make it worse. Drying the skin, making it itchy, and raised &amp;#34;alligator skin&amp;#34; appears. Yuck! Avoid Aveeno, check out Vanicream!</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing! I have terribly dry skin that can crack and bleed at times, especially on my hands. Other lotions can irritate, itch, or burn my hands but not this. It goes on smoothly and absorbs well. Worth the money, and Amazon has one of the cheapest prices I can find online.</li>
            <li> I have ecxema breakouts anywhere where there is hair on my face (eyebrows, gotee).  This cleared it up very quicky.  In a day or two, if memory serves.&lt;br /&gt;Why grow any kind of beard if it causes excema rashes, you ask?  Because, I have no chin.  Happy now?  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this cream is that it leaves an oily feel on my skin for hours after applying, but it serves its purpose well, so I can live with that.</li>
            <li> The best Eczema therapy treatment if have tried so far.</li>
            <li> I just started using it and so far, it seems to work well with no irritation noted.&lt;br /&gt;So far, I am most happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the only thing that will keep my son&#x27;s eczema from flaring up so we use it EVERY day.  The subscribe and save makes it a great deal on a large bottle</li>
            <li> I usually do not write any reviews but for this I have to share my story. I always had to use steroid ointment but it run out and could not use that anymore so I had to look for something that works. I was using regular lotion (cocoa butter, shea butter, over-the-counter ointment) but no luck for last 7 years. Since I wash my hands a lot and do dishes my hands were really bad. last few weeks, my right hand was turning red and miserable. I was so embarrassed and hide my hands wherever I go. I&#x27;ve never tried Aveeno products but wanted to give it a try because I was so desperate. First day of use, I noticed that it moisturized very well. Second day, my hands were getting less red and inflamed. I made sure I put this after I washed my hands and noticed my moisture levels we getting higher. Now it has not even a week now but redness is almost gone. I am so happy and glad that I gave it a try. I STRONGLY recommend this to anyone who suffers from eczema. Thanks so much Aveeno!</li>
            <li> First found this on a trip to Phoenix, AZ, the driest climate I have been in. I&#x27;ve had atopic dermatitis and various treatments all my life and my arms, back, and legs had deep wrinkles and dry patches. The eczema therapy cream decreased the depth of wrinkles, most visible on my arms. At home in Hawaii, I was using another cream, but the wrinkles were pronounced. I&#x27;ve continued using the Aveeno eczema therapy cream and it moisturizes my skin better than previous cream. There are still hills and valleys on my skin, but not as pronounced, and I&#x27;m not getting any younger either. My atopic dermatitis has improved somewhat in the last few months, but I can&#x27;t attribute it to just the cream; my condition is also related to stress and allergies. So I recommend this product to others with very dry skin. I bought six tubes from Amazon because the product is not always on the shelves at Walmart or CVS when I need it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had eczema since I was a child and nothing has worked as well as this product has for me. My eczema began flaring up about a month ago when I moved away for college. I had an awful patch of embarrassing rashes across my chest and arms. I tried a variety of creams I already owned and nothing was helping to relieve the itch or pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this on Amazon, read the reviews and immediately ordered while praying for a miracle. Thankfully, I got it. This cream reduced the redness and itching almost immediately. It keeps my skin moisturized throughout the day and is free of the medicinal smell most other creams have. It is even helping to clear up the Dyshidrosis on my palm which I have been suffering from for at least 3 months now. The patches are nearly gone and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It is well worth the $11 and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I put this on my 23 month old last night because his skin was really dry due to eczema. Bad Idea. He woke up this morning covered in a rash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good cream for eczema on my hands and nothing worked well until I tried this -- definitely better for my eczema than Burt&#x27;s Bees, Vaseline and YuBe.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I want to try this as I know Aveeno is suppose to be very good but it didnt for me</li>
            <li> I had severe dark rough areas on both my knuckles for the past three winters, tried a lot of different creams and moisturizers, nothing worked, some products even made it worse. After daily application for a week dramatic improvement, the rough dark areas receded and within three week they were nearly gone. I would say close to 95%. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have eczema on the backs of my hands, but only in winter.  I&#x27;ve tried Cortizone 10 and was put off by its greasy texture.  And it took a few days to work.  I&#x27;ve also tried using prescription cortisone cream covered with regular hand lotion, which actually dried out my hands even more.  SO I tried this Aveeno product, figuring I didn&#x27;t have much to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to find this lotion smells decent, works rather quickly (two days), and isn&#x27;t quite as greasy as Cortizone 10.  Yeah, it&#x27;s still somewhat greasy... But it goes away much more quickly than other products, especially if you wipe your hands on other patches of dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;S if you&#x27;re looking for a product to try, this one might work for you.  Give it a shot.</li>
            <li> When you have eczema, you search high and low for a good lotion to provide relief for your skin. I think that Aveeno has the best that I&#x27;ve come across. Whenever I feel a flare up, I just put some on and it doesn&#x27;t itch or irritate anymore! Definitely worth trying if nothing else is working for you.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see that it did anything at all. I finally wound up making my own and that finally did the trick. This was too greasy feeling, yet also not very absorbant and then didn&#x27;t stay long once it did.</li>
            <li> This is a good cream, but i think the revitol eczema dermatitis cream is good as well. Check it out here: www.dermatitiseczemacream.net</li>
            <li> Great product!  My elbows get very dry and scaly in the winter and this is the perfect remedy.</li>
            <li> This cream is absolutely wonderful. Since I have been using it on a regular basis, I do not have to use my prescription cream at all....which is good.</li>
            <li> This product really helped smooth out my dry, irritated skin after an unfortunate tangle with toxic plants. I had healed the initial problem with other products but the skin didn&#x27;t heal until I started using this product (recommended by a nurse), its fantastic! soothing and healing my skin very quickly.</li>
            <li> Good product and good price.  A must if you have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is one of the only lotions that works for the eczema on my face. I mean it seriously works. If I have a breakout, i use a little extra the night before I work, and the next morning, when I am looking/reapplying, its much, much calmer and less irritated. This is a total win, y&#x27;all.</li>
            <li> Been having on and off issues with the skin on my face this winter, so I bought this thinking no matter what was going on with my skin this sounded like a very soothing type of product. Well, very much to the contrary this cream really aggravated the hell out of my skin and frankly I was shocked. However, since using it I went to the dermatologist and found out that I have Rosacea ... so if you have Rosacea, this may also aggravate your condition. Otherwise, I have been using it on my arms and legs to help with typical wintery dryness. When it&#x27;s gone, I highly doubt I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I initially used this lotion based upon a friends suggestion and was really impressed then decided to buy it for myself. I have to say totally worth the money. It is the best lotion I have found to date (if you are interested in moisturizing). It does not have much of a scent which means you add whatever you want. How convenient.</li>
            <li> I prefer this product. It is thick, lasts, and improves the dryness of my skin. I do NOT like the PRICE. My whole family uses this which means that we spend a small fortune every month. I would like to see this in a larger pump bottle. At least then my family might stop breaking the lid. No lid on this tube has lasted from beginning to end of the product.</li>
            <li> Important points:&lt;br /&gt;-good moisture retainment&lt;br /&gt;-somewhat effective for reducing eczema lesions&lt;br /&gt;-pricy</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for my 2 year old. She gets eczema and this helps on her body for it. It is creamy and thinner. It is not the thick formula. It really works and is better than most brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> Received item. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream to use for dry shin. It&#x27;s very lightweight but it does the job! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> We have tried many products for my son&#x27;s (age 2) full-body mild eczema. This Aveeno product works very well to stop the scratching and makes his skin feel moisturized, soft and smooth, and much more so than any other lotion we tried. Highly recommended to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our dermatologist mentioned ceramides as a useful ingredient but for another product that didn&#x27;t work that well for him. So now we use the Aveeno Baby Cleansing Wash and follow with this moisturizing cream and Aquaphor (to give a thicker top coat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His worst spots are his legs (particularly knees) and his arms (particularly wrists). Sometimes when playing he&#x27;ll stop what he&#x27;s doing and start scratching lightly seemingly out of curiosity. Previously he&#x27;d spend 5 or 10 minutes just looking intently at where he&#x27;s scratching almost studying the event. I&#x27;d use other lotions we had but they didn&#x27;t always stop the scratching. This cream usually stops those itching sessions after a minute or so and also helps him sleep better at night.</li>
            <li> Not too greasy but really hydrate my skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle cream, so don&#x27;t expect it will fix your skin problem after a few applies. In my case, I have a minor dry skin on my hand, I try to apply it as many time as needed when my hand feel dry. After a weeks or two, my skin problem really got improved. Great product!</li>
            <li> This stuff works way better than most other hand creams. It lasts a long time and really works well as a barrier cream. It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; eczema, but it did stop my hands from cracking.</li>
            <li> Love this cream, it leaves skin so soft and not greasy.  My son has very sensitive skin and this works great.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old was suffering a lot with her eczema. I started using this product and in days her skin was so much better.</li>
            <li> I moved to be with my husband 6k miles and his area this season is pretty much freezing. My skin started to dry and flake up. I regularly take showers in the morning and let&#x27;s just say that just exacerbated my skin condition. It began getting red, irritated, scaly, angry and very very itchy. So of course, I scratched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This went on for 2 weeks, since I didn&#x27;t know where to go nor did my husband, my awesome in-law took me to Target and got me this tube. Worked awesome...within 2-3 days my skin started to itch less, and began showing signs of recovery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had dry skin all my life but it wasnt much of a problem cause I lived in high temp/high humidity area and I just had to put moisturizer on to alleviate it, moving to a cold place with low humidity made the dry skin worse and that&#x27;s where Aveeno comes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this starts sounding like a paid commercial, let&#x27;s just say Aveeno has always worked for me while others haven&#x27;t and just because it worked for me doesn&#x27;t mean it will work for everyone. I highly recommend it, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It worked great and is affordable.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I do not like the smell, it is very light and...kinda smells like..:)</li>
            <li> Holy jesus, i was freaking out. I was trying everything to stop my eczema on my face that just came about this winter, 27 years into my life. The only thing that worked was hydrocortisone, but i heard long term use would cause more problems than it solved. Then i read the customer reviews for Aveeno eczema and gave it a shot. Eczema gone. Its amazing and my skin looks 10x healthier than it did before the eczema popped out. Maybe a blessing in disguise. If you are freaking out, take a breath and try this miracle juice. First time writing a review, but i felt the need to help out my fellow eczema friends because i know how big the burden can be. Your problems end now.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent and will buy more.  I love the quality of the product and it is exactly what I wanted.  Everyone should buy this it is worth the money Love it</li>
            <li> I love how moisturizing this lotion is and I feel great using it on my baby boy every night after bath. However, I question some of the ingredients and chemicals in the product so we have since switched to a more natural lotion that is very moisturizing as well. However, if chemicals are not of concern to you, then I highly recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of eczema creams which have been ineffective. This one is the first one which has actually helped me remove my itch. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My two year old has bad eczema since she was 2month .she was scratching until she bleeds but since this product it makes her smooth and no itching I am baying the second&lt;br /&gt; one...</li>
            <li> Is a very usful cream for baby&#x27;s skin. Keeps de softness nacessary for the baby. Lasts much used little by little</li>
            <li> This cream has really helped our family through the winter.  Though the eczema isn&#x27;t completely gone, it is a great moisturizer and prevents itchy rashes!</li>
            <li> Aveeno Eczema Therapy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical about this type of Aveeno lotion, since I couldn’t see a difference in the ingredients that would help treat Eczema until I noticed most of the Aveeno lotions list dimethicone as the active ingredient and not colloidal oatmeal (which is the active ingredient in their Eczema treatment formula). I’ve been using this for about a week and it has helped with my skin, although it is not a magical cure. It tends to sooth the afflicted skin upon contact. I used it in conjunction with MG271 and found the Aveeno to smell better and was easier to use, not to mention doesn’t stain clothes. The only complaint I have is the Aveeno is expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 5/5 stars, one of the better treatments I’ve used for eczema but it is very expensive.</li>
            <li> This product certainly does leave a moist feeling; however, it leaves my skin a bit sticky.  I think there are better options for an adult.</li>
            <li> After trying other products, including regular Aveeno skin creams, I am really happy to find the Eczema Therapy cream. It helps to sooth my skin, and allows it to heal between painful flare-ups of eczema on my hands.</li>
            <li> I have a very dry skin and there is no moisturizer that give me this great result, it makes my skin like the baby skin and keep the skin moisturized 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;Just love it!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Was as good as advertised.  Works well, not too thick, goes on nicely.  Must use it consistently for desired results.</li>
            <li> Wanted to see if this will work, being that it was Steroid-free.  I heard that Hydrocortisone, if you over-use, can cause &amp;#34;burns&amp;#34; resulting in scarring.  Much to my surprise, it worked well, and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about frequency as I use it as needed and as often as I want.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion I&#x27;ve found that takes away my kids&#x27; eczema.  It&#x27;s almost gone within a few days of using it morning and night.</li>
            <li> Safe the trip to the dermatologist. This cream worked wonders on me and within one day dry itchy patches on my arms disappeared.</li>
            <li> My daughter has allergies and her hands have a tendency to break out.  She really likes the Aveeno products and find they help her better than most others.</li>
            <li> Hi everyone! i have had eczema all of my life, and I have found something that is a complete life changer!  Copy this link into your search bar to get a book that will heal your eczema in 14 DAYS! After years of suffering, it can all be over! [...] Unlike Aveeno which has alcohol in it that dries out your skin worse, This booklet contains natural remedies that will not only \\&quot;cover\\&quot; up your eczema, but also help to heal it!</li>
            <li> My husband uses this for an itchy dry scalp and it is one of the only things that work well and all day long too, ever since he started taking it I don&#x27;t notice his dry scalp anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for almost 8 months now, and sadly I am still battling eczema.  I use it whenever my skin gets dry.  It&#x27;s on my neck, and I&#x27;ve used many things to help heal it while going to multiple doctors&#x27; offices.  I think I have had these eczema patches on my neck for almost four years now.  It&#x27;s getting better, but it&#x27;s a constant struggle.  I just make sure to rinse the skin with water when it gets too itchy and reapply.</li>
            <li> I have tried the following moisturizers (Johnson &amp; Johnson Baby oil, Olive oil, SebaMed Baby Lotion, SebaMed Baby Cream, Cetaphil Skin Moisturizer (Formulated for Eczema),  Eucerin Professional Repair Lotion, Eucerin Calming Cr&amp;egrave;me, Eucerin Original Healing Repair Cr&amp;egrave;me, Eucerin Intensive Repair Extra-Enriched Hand Cr&amp;egrave;me, Medela Tender Care Lanolin, Aquaphor Healing Ointment (Dry, Cracked, and Irritated Skin Protectant), Laroche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5, Organic Coconut oil, Eucerin Baby Eczema Cr&amp;egrave;me, Aveeno Eczema Cream, Lucas Papaw Ointment, Raw Apothecary Unrefined Raw Shea Butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream is one of the best that I like and also helps my daughter&#x27;s Eczema. It&#x27;s cream but easy to absorb from skin. It keeps the skin moisturized better than lotions. It has a smell of oat and calms the rash/Eczema down. It&#x27;s at a reason price range. If Subscribe &amp; Save from Amazon with 4 other products, you can save up to 15% on each item. It&#x27;s a pretty good deal. This works as well as the Aveeno Baby Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream. They have exactly the same ingredients. Buy either one that has the lowest price by oz is the best way to save money.</li>
            <li> I use this for psoriasis on my torso. It doesnt cure it, but it sure does help to take the red out and tone down flare-ups. The absolute best thing Ive found so far.</li>
            <li> Really helps keep skin moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other OTC products (including the neosporin eczema moisturizing cream) and this is the best. I saw noticeable positive results within 3 days</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my daughter for at least a year now (she&#x27;s 2) because she has a mild case of eczema on her back, tummy, legs and arms.  She even likes to put it on herself too. It goes on easy, it keeps skin soft, and it keeps itchy red eczema patches at bay. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> I have this on auto-ship as my whole family loves this moisturizing cream. Amazon has a great price on it also. ...better than our local WalMart. This cream is very soothing and healing.  Really helps keep those nasty finger splits at bay...and if they do occur, helps to heal them. It&#x27;s also great relief for itchy, dry skin. We use it daily in the winter and in the warmer months as needed. Try it...I think you will agree that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Helps my son&#x27;s eczema. Only thing I have found yet that works.</li>
            <li> I have eczema on my eyelids and other eye creams seemed to bother the eczema.  I also tried petroleum jelly as suggested by a doctor, which was way too greasy. This cream is just right and I can put it on before applying eye makeup without any issues.  I also put it on my entire face at night to moisturize.  It doesn&#x27;t cure eczema, which my doctor said it an allergy side effect....but it definitely makes my eyes itch less and they aren&#x27;t as scaly.  Plus it doesn&#x27;t have steroids and other dangerous stuff, which make me nervous - especially on a really sensitive area like my eyes.  Good luck to you!</li>
            <li> I apply this on my baby&#x27;s face and on any part of his body that has eczema flare-ups at least 3 times daily. It really does wonders for his skin. It moisturizes and controls drying and flare-ups. I recommended this product to my sisters-in-law who both have children with eczema. Be sure to use it after bathing your child and 1 or 2 more times throughout the day for maximum benefit.</li>
            <li> Soothes dried heated itchy skin better than any cream I&#x27;ve tried in 10 years</li>
            <li> A lot of people like this cream, so maybe it will work for you. I found it to be very slimy and as far as I could tell it didn&#x27;t help my baby&#x27;s eczema much. I recommend the California Baby Calendula Cream. It really worked for me and is totally natural and safe.</li>
            <li> I love it!  It has really improved the looks and feel of my skin all over.  No more dry, flakey, or itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Aveeno!</li>
            <li> I developed eczema on my eyelids and couldn&#x27;t find anything that really worked. I read the reviews here about this Aveeno cream and gave it a try. So glad I did. Saw positive results within 12hrs. Been using it for 2 and a half days and my eyelids are 80% back to normal!  Give it a try. Hope this review helps someone else.</li>
            <li> Actually received a sample from my dermatologist&#x27;s office which made me buy on Amazon. This cream worked on my dry winter skin. Mainly used on elbows and feet but guess it&#x27;s good for whole body use.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of lotions, anti-itch creams, etc to give relief to my hand eczema, but this is the only lotion that helps.  My hands were so dried out and chapped, but within a couple of days of using Aveeno, they started softening up.  They completely healed a couple of weeks later and I continue to use this to keep outbreaks in check.  Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY thing that even slightly works on my toddler&#x27;s eczema. I&#x27;ve tried every expensive cream and treatment that you can imagine but keep going back to this.</li>
            <li> Buy this every winter for my husband. It makes a world of a difference for him. Highly recommend to those with eczema!</li>
            <li> My son suffers from eczema and hasn&#x27;t had a single break out since I started using this after every shower.</li>
            <li> Super sticky. Hate that.</li>
            <li> Love this....use for psoriasis on feet.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom who has had chronic eczema all her life.  She loves it and it has really helped her discomfort.  A great purchase.</li>
            <li> nice on sensitive skin...good product</li>
            <li> This lotion does wonders for my skin. Since I switched to it, I haven&#x27;t had any contact dermatitis outbreaks. It also smells better than its competition eczema lotion.</li>
            <li> the item shipped fast and works well for my skin. i am very satisfied with my purchase. i definitely reccomend this for anyone one with eczema</li>
            <li> My daughter has severe eczema and I have tried so many things from Aquaphor, Vaseline, aloe vera gel, coconut oil, cetaphil and many more. However, this cream from Aveeno is the only one that could help. I apply it on her whole body twice every day and I coudl really feel the difference. This summer she could wear shorts and dresses for the first time in 3 years. Normally I keep her covered neck to toe because if I didn&#x27;t, she would scratch herself bloody in that area. But this year after her skin healed by using this cream, she could wear those sun dresses and shorts that are weather appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much Aveeno for this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This mosturizing cream suprised me.&lt;br /&gt;it helps my psoriasis like no other. I recomended for dry skin, irritated skin, and skin conditions like mine, because it nurses the skin.</li>
            <li> My 7 week old had eczema patches all over his face and neck. I saw this and decided to try it. Some of the people who left negative reviews seemed to have an allergic reaction to it, so i first tried it on a small patch of skin to see if he&#x27;d react. After seeing no reaction, i decided to put it on the affected areas. My son already looked slightly better the next day. I started to apply it twice a day, and after a few days, his skin was completely clear! Product exceeded my expectations. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great way to buy in bulk.  Best lotion I&#x27;ve found for my dry skin, and my sons.  Not too thick, soaks in fast.  Wonderful protector of dry skin.</li>
            <li> A miracle worker! I have had weird red, non-itchy patches on my face for 6 months now, they came out of nowhere. Also, my lips have been so dry and my ear lobes have been dry and cracking.... My dermatologist thought it might be mild eczema, and gave me a steroid cream. The cream worked fine for a while, but I didn&#x27;t like to use it too much because of the side effects it could have. The other day my patches got out of control and one patch almost seemed to have some kind of crazy allergic reaction, it was AWFUL. I have been searching and searching online for months, and over the weekend came across this cream. I bought it and used it. My ears were smooth about 5 minutes after applying it. My red patch swelling went down, the dryness on my face disappeared overnight, and the redness itself was gone in 3 days. Thank you aveeno!!!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect wonders if you have really troubled skin. My skin is very very dry and this lotion simply did not cut it for me. It did not irritate my skin at all, but it also did not help with extreme dryness and itchiness.</li>
            <li> This product is incredible. I had been experiencing red rashes, very dry and itchy skin on my arms. I thought it was some kind of allergic reaction or sensitiveness so I just hoped it would go away on its own. After nearly two months of struggling with it, I got a hydrocortisone cream only to end up worse. I read the reviews for this product and got it along Eucerin skin calming body wash. I&#x27;ve been using this 3 times a day for 4 days now and my skin is almost healed. Itching and redness are practically gone. It was the first time in many days that I was actually able to forget about the rashes and had no discomfort. My skin looks and feels hydrated.</li>
            <li> Light and not too greasy...I like the way it makes my skin feel.  However, I still need to use steroid based creams to clear up my eczema.</li>
            <li> Three of us in the family have eczema and this stuff works.  It doesn&#x27;t sting when you put it on.  It is the only lotion my littlest one will let me put on her.  Have been using the cream for 2 1/2 years.  Very happy when I found this product and have used it every since.</li>
            <li> it burns when you have open wounds caused by scratching&lt;br /&gt;If you want to heal your atopic dermatitis read the book: One Cause, Many Ailments: Leaky Gut Syndrome&lt;br /&gt;It will give you a fresh start at life, its all about what you eat that brings forth healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God bless</li>
            <li> It did not irritate the skin, and it was somewhat better at moisturizing than other creams.  However, if you want a really good cream for severe eczema, I found that I had to just make it myself.  This is a good cream for when you are on the go.</li>
            <li> the product was useful and did serve our expectations.</li>
            <li> Aveeno Eczema is GREAT for rashes as well as dry skin.  My friend told me about it and now I&#x27;m recommending it to the review readers.  Review given by the Mrs.</li>
            <li> Came on time. The lotion is fine, but the cover was broken when it arrived, half of it leaked out.</li>
            <li> It did not help at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it all, from high-end department store products to prescription creams... I didnt want to believe it. I had tried other Aveeno products in the past (bath soak, oatmeal lotion) and found them slimy, irritating and not effective, however, this is the best thing out there for eczema or extremely dry skin. It takes a little work to rub it in, but it shows results within the first use! Plus no funky smell!! Love this cream! Plus I subscribed to delivery and got another 20% discount, awesome.</li>
            <li> Works very well and even great on face during the winter season.</li>
            <li> Seems to work better than any other eczema creams we have triws.</li>
            <li> After taking my son to the doctor, she diagnosed a mild case of baby eczema. She gave me a prescription for a steroid cream. My husband and I didn&#x27;t see it necessary to give him something steroid based at such a young age. I decided to give the Aveeno a try and within a week the bumps on his legs and arms disappeared. I do have to still apply it nightly, and when I forget to put in on for a few days the bumps reappear.</li>
            <li> I like it.  It seems to help with winter dry skin.  The oatmeal in it sooths your skin.  I would purchase product again.</li>
            <li> This is surprisingly effective, better than any other such product I&#x27;ve tried (non-prescription).  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> After trying hemp oil and steroid cream, I turned to Aveeno&#x27;s eczema solution after reading the reviews on Amazon. Firstly; there was no sting whatsoever when applying the cream. Secondly; one tube has lasted for months. I began by applying it in the morning and the evening. Now I&#x27;m down to applying it only in the morning. If I stop using it - the eczema comes back within a day, so I know it&#x27;s not an actual cure - but I prefer this to the skin-thinning steroid cream which I hate using. Thanks Aveeno!</li>
            <li> We have hard water and my skin was taking a beating until I found this. I tried prescription cremes, over the counter creams and various moisturizing creams.  Nothing worked like this.</li>
            <li> Recommend buying this, I feel pretty good, although the baby face still have eczema, but much better than before the</li>
            <li> Helped my eczema. Tried prescription creams given by doctor and some all natural one from whole foods. Those didnt work, this did.</li>
            <li> My 3mo old&#x27;s eczema was under control by his regular baby cream; however I was hoping to clear out by using this product. This morning the product arrived, right away I applied the cream to his face after cleansing. I continued to apply throughout the day. By evening I notice this cheeks turned red and became more bumpy, and when I applied the product again, he screamed so hard it shocked me because he never cry so hard. I immediately noticed he was hurting while I touch his face with the cream. I was heartbroken seeing him cry like that. Immediately I cleaned his face and went back to apply his regular cream which he cried the entire process because his face was hurting so much. This definitely isn&#x27;t the product for us and I wish I never tried it, hope my son will recover to his previous condition soon.</li>
            <li> For the past 6 years, I have been suffering from Eczema or Dermatitis particularly on my forehead, and it was getting worse and worse over time, the areas come larger, itchier and more noticeable due to dark patches.  I have been visited my doctor and two other dermatology doctors, and often time they ended up recommended me prescription medicines that contained \\&quot;steroid\\&quot; such as Hydrocortisone Cream or other drugs such as: Protopic or Elidel.  I have used them over the years and they only helped me temporarily and the itch would come back flair up again after a few days.  The side-effect these drugs caused my forehead skin thinny, dry and dark patches.  Finally one day I got fed up and  did some research online and came across this \\&quot;new\\&quot; product called Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream.  After using this product continuously for two weeks (morning and night) - make sure you wash your face with Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser - before you apply the Aveeno .  And I swear this product worked on my face and forehead after two weeks of use. Don&#x27;t give up after 3 days of used and called it quit, you have to be patient and give it two weeks to work into your skin. This product is SAFE and it is accepted by National Eczema Association.  I will continue to use this every day to keep my face soft and moisturize.  I would definitely recommend this new product to anyone who suffers with similar conditions as I have.  It only cost $11.00 so you don&#x27;t have anything to lose BUT you have A LOT to gain: [1] the cost saving from doctor&#x27;s visits,[2]  expensive prescriptions drugs [3] side-effect of steroid products which cause skin thinny, dry and patchy.  Good luck</li>
            <li> My son has eczema on his little hands.  His hands were red, itchy, cracked and peeling.  He didn&#x27;t complain of pain though.  We applied the Aveeno Eczema Cream and it burned where the skin was cracked. We had to dab the excess away with a tissue.  However, his hands were noticeably better by the morning.</li>
            <li> This cream is great for my daugher&#x27;s eczema, especially during the dry winter months. Now that we&#x27;ve hit the warmer spring months, I&#x27;ve switched to Aveeno Skin Relief 24 Hour Moisturizing Lotion, and it works great. I might switch back to this product next winter if needed.</li>
            <li> The last time I had an eczema outbreak I went to a dermatologist and paid big bucks for prescriptions that were of little help.  So when eczema broke out again recently, I tried an over-the-counter cream with steroid, which caused angry red welts on my skin.  I then went out and bought this Aveeno product which not only had to soothe the welts but the eczema too.  The relief was gradual but continual.  The eczema is gone now, and because my skin looks better than ever, I&#x27;m continuing to use this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is a very effective cream that has really helped my hands a lot. It is not greasy and stays on a long time. I think that it is a good product and I recommend.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a heavier cream and it is really light. It does nothing for our daughter&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li> Works like miracle. Highly recommend. My boyfriend has been using it for 3 weeks - he had some random dry itchy spots on his skin; but now they are gone.</li>
            <li> My 5 month old has eczema and this is the only lotion I have found that completely helps. It&#x27;s like a miracle cream. I slather it on twice a day and if I forget her eczema starts to come back.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t appear to be any different than any other OTC lotion, had to get prescription Ammonium Lactate lotion before I found relief after this and several other OTC &amp;#34;psoriasis/eeczema lotions failed.</li>
            <li> Very good for eczema in terms of moisturizing not treating a flare up.</li>
            <li> I am a college student and I live in a dry and elevated area. I have really bad eczema in the winter and I tried multiple products; then I found Aveeno Eczema Cream.This product DOES NOT get rid of my eczema however, it does lessen the itching and it visibly lessens my eczema. I waited until my eczema was really bad before applying the cream so maybe if you used it as soon as the eczema started appearing maybe it would help more. I also applied the eczema cream whenever my eczema started itching. I feel as though this cream is one of the best products I have found to help my eczema. The only reason I gave it three stars is because it does not actually get rid of my eczema; however, I do think it is helpful.</li>
            <li> Hadn&#x27;t tried this before but it&#x27;s exactly as described, very soothing for irritated skin which is always an issue for me in the winters and year round due to my allergy to soap.</li>
            <li> This is the only moisturizing that effectively solves the problem of my extremely dry skin. Aveeno has many different products but none of the others works well for me. I have been using Aveeno Eczema more than 4 years. Amazon has many times better offers for this product than local stores in my area.</li>
            <li> I recieved two that had a fish odor to it</li>
            <li> when I received ,it was open,cannot sure been used by someone</li>
            <li> nothing special. Another miss labeled Eczema lotion.</li>
            <li> While I have not been diagnosed with eczema, I&#x27;ve used this and it&#x27;s worked wonders! Each winter, I&#x27;ve noticed my hands have become itchy, dry, flaky and painful. I believe this is from washing my hands so much and irritation from warm water along with the cold weather. I was at wit&#x27;s end trying to find a non greasy and nonirritating solution. As soon as I rubbed a pea sized amount onto my hands - bam! No irritation and the itching immediately stopped! With regular use, the dryness has also reduced. This is great! I also love that it&#x27;s fragrance free. I like lotions that smell good, but the lack of smell is great for everyday use. I would definitely recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li> Ok so my ezcema problem just appeared back in Feb. 2013. Fast forward to Sept. 2013 and I&#x27;ve tried hydrocortisone 2.5%, eucerin lotion for very dry skin, blah blah blah. While the hydrocortisone worked for a bit my body did build up a tolerance. The eucerin worked ok for a while but was too greasy and made my skin redder. For the past month or so my ezcema hasn&#x27;t been itchy so much as red and flaky. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it itches now and then, but not like in the beginning. Anyway I wanted to try something natural so I tried this stuff... At first it actually irritated my skin a bit. It actually made it a little itchy. It was itchy for about 10-15 minutes. It did feel better afterward, though. I continued using it because I know I&#x27;m not allergic to oatmeal and I believe my body must&#x27;ve just been adjusting to this new treatment. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week now and the redness is going away and it seems to be helping about as much as the hydrocortisone, except without all the steroid crap... Anyway, if you decide to buy this and it slightly (only slightly!) irritates your skin, just stick with it anyway for a few days to see if it continues. If it still irritates your skin after 3 or 4 days I&#x27;d probably quit using it...duh</li>
            <li> great for us exzema afflicted people</li>
            <li> Awsome price, great product!</li>
            <li> Nice smell.  Works good when I don&#x27;t want the smell or the grease from my regular psoriasis salve.</li>
            <li> I have used this on our 18 months old since he was around 8 months old. My oldest and youngest have a form of eczema. On my little guy I apply this lotion once in the morning and once in the evening. I notice a difference within a 2 days if I stop using this lotion. He will get some little bumps on his body. I never thought to have my oldest use this lotion. He rubs Vaseline on his irritated spots before bed and that works for him. My oldest was on a prescribed lotion for his eczema. He said it made his skin feel on fire and Vaseline seemed to work better so we stuck with it. We have aloe used Vaseline on the little one before bed and that helped with his eczema too, this lotion is just less greasy. I don&#x27;t notice a difference between this lotion and the baby one.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work any wonders for my eczema on my hands and seemed comparable to using regular moisturizer. I&#x27;ve had better results with O&#x27;Keefes. It&#x27;s not thick, didn&#x27;t last as long as thicker creams, and left my hands a bit slippery. May be better for other parts of the body.</li>
            <li> My husband, baby, and toddler all get very dry skin/eczema especially in the winter.  This works great for them all.  Completely clears it up after a week of once a day use.  For the kids, i put it on at bedtime before i put them in their footed pajamas and in the morning their skin is still moist from the lotion.  Very moisture intensive!</li>
            <li> I have beens earching for years for a lotion to help my dry hands.  Within 6 hours of using this my hands are completely healed and feel great.  My skin would get so dry in the winter time they were constantly cracking and bleeding but this worked perfect and my problem is gone.</li>
            <li> I have mild eczema with itchy, dry, flaky skin on my hands.  Of the dozen creams/ointments I have tried, this cream helps the most with itch relief and healing.</li>
            <li> I liked this.........great for my skin.</li>
            <li> A very good product for drying skin, keeps skin moist.</li>
            <li> For the first time to use this product feels good, as for the effect need to continue to observe......</li>
            <li> First time using. Awesome! Less itchy feeling and less red and patchy. Don&#x27;t know what I have...looks like hives but so I really love this lotion!</li>
            <li> This lotion worked immediately on the eczema that covers my neck. I literally applied it two times over two days and my neck is clear from any red scaly patches of skin. Haven&#x27;t had to use the lotion again yet but I love it!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  Aveeno for many things is terrific.  Have a lot of Aveeno products and tell all my friends (also let them try it) to buy Aveeno products.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, even if you don&#x27;t have eczema it&#x27;s a great product. It give a great feeling throughout the day without feeling greasy. Have purchased before and will agan!</li>
            <li> worked great. Our baby has a slight degree of eczema on the tummy and legs. Second application with the cream and almost gone. It does take about 2-3 hand washes to get it somewhat of your hands.</li>
            <li> My sister, who also does not have eczema, raved about this. I do have horrible dry skin in the winter and wanted a deep moisturizer. For me, this was a very uncomfortable product. All day it left this weird, greasy film on my skin. When I went to bed at night my skin was &amp;#34;sticking&amp;#34; to my sheets. Bought some cheap Suave lotion in the grocery store last night and already my skin feels a lot better, my cloths aren&#x27;t sticking to my body, and I don&#x27;t feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might be perfect for folks with eczema though, so temper my review with that in mind.</li>
            <li> cER VA WORKS BETTER THAN ALL THE ECZEMA CREAMS PUT TOGETHER!!!  TRY CERA VA</li>
            <li> I love this product for my eczema.  It keeps my skin hydrated and looking smooth.  I&#x27;ve tried so many other products that claim to help with dry skin, but this one actually works. It won&#x27;t solve all of the symptoms associated with eczema, but it sure keeps my skin moisturized for at least 12 hours</li>
            <li> I developed eczema on my chin this winter.  I tried everything to get rid of it.  I changed all of my facial products, threw out all of my makeup brushes, and even received an rx steroid cream.  It kept coming back.  I finally decided to give this cream a try.  After 1 night the redness and bumps were cut in half and each day they fade even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to whether or not they will come back after I stop using this cream, but I am not worried now that I have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have not noticed any breakouts from the lotion on my chin yet.</li>
            <li> I read the customer reviews and they seemed pretty convincing but turns out it didn&#x27;t work for me and I&#x27;m almost done with the bottle. I gotta try the new Gold bond eczema cream I heard that&#x27;ll work if this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I put the cream immediately after I received this. Just after a few days, the dry skin on my face is cured, soft and smooth. However, it made the rash worse on my arm, and I had trouble sleeping because my skin got stick to the sheets.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from eczema all my life...from my face down to my legs and have used all kinds of lotions and potions that claim to help with my &#x27;extra dry skin.&#x27; This is the first lotion I have used that actually shows improvement within a day or two and isn&#x27;t geeasy or sting my open eczema patches. I am truly grateful for this product and hope that other eczema products (face wash, soap, etc) become readily available too.</li>
            <li> This is gentle, easy to apply, and doesn&#x27;t have an overbearing scent. It is very moisturizing but I bought it for my eczema and it doesn&#x27;t do anything to help my eczema. In fact, applying this made my eczema worse because it was a lot more itchy. However, this works great as a regular body lotion.</li>
            <li> Gone are the days of constantly itching while I&#x27;m asleep or awake and having to deal with unsightly red marks on my arms and neck area.  This lotion is great for keeping eczema very manageable and I no longer have to explain to people what was wrong with my skin.  This lotion feels very good my skin and is the best skin repair lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I currently use [[ASIN:B00314GCJU CORTIZONE-10 INTNSV HLNG ECZM Size: 3.5 OZ]]  daily for eczema on my hands and it works great though I worry about the daily cortisone exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve started trying out some non-steroidal creams/lotions.  The Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream didn&#x27;t work for me.  It made the eczema areas on my hands flare up and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 3/16/2013:  I found a non-steroidal lotion that doesn&#x27;t aggravate my eczema [[ASIN:B000YJ2SLG CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion (12 oz)]].  I still use the Cortizone-10 specifically for the eczema but the CeraVe, or the generic version available at a drug store, has been helpful for daily treatment of dry hands.</li>
            <li> First of all, it absolutley breaks my heart to read the reviews where this product did not help.  From the first time I used it I saw a huge difference.  I have been plagued by two extremely dry, incredibly itchy, red and peeling patches of skin for over two years.  I did use Cetaphil Restoraderm and thought it was very good.  When I got down to the bottom of the bottle I decided to look around for another product since even though it helped more than other products I had used, I still had the problem.  After reading the reviews on Amazon (everybody please take time to write reviews because believe me they are read and relied upon in making product purchases!) I was very impressed even though there were a number of negative reviews, as well.  Again, the first time I used it there was a noticeable difference in the amount of dryness even though the area was still pretty red.  I expected that though.  I used it both morning after a shower and at night.  I have used it even a couple of times during the day when I had time.  It has only been a couple of weeks and the dryness is considerably better and the skin softer and definitely smoother.  Since my skin stays soft the itching has diminished greatly. I cannot recommend this product enough simply because it works.  I notice the redness is much less and what is to me the most compelling reason to try it, is that my skin is getting better and better each and every day to the point where it is FINALLY clearing up after suffering with that horrible itch day in and day out for so long.  As many of you know, who can sleep when you are so uncomfortable! Now saying all that I really do not like to use any chemicals - especially petroleum - however, I was considering using a cortisone cream and thought this was the lesser of the two &#x27;evils&#x27;.  I am glad I did since it really is clearing up and I will not have to use it ongoing.  I intend to switch at some point to a much more natural alternative, but for now it is doing the jobbeautifully!  Blessings to all!!  P.S. changing the diet and eliminating sugar, white flour, dairy and drinking pure water will do wonders, too!</li>
            <li> Moisturizes, relieves itch, no burn, amazing. Smells a bit like plain oatmeal, but not an obtrusive smell, it wears off after a few hours. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product at first because I did not believe it could help me but this is the only lotion I use for my eczema and it has worked wonders for me so far. Every time I get out of the shower or shave I use this and it prevents me from flaring up, but there are times where there can be severe flare ups and I have to use cortisone but this keeps that from happening a lot of time. It is the best lotion for eczema I have used so far. If you are burning, flaking, and seeing red rashes definitely give this a try.</li>
            <li> my daughter uses this product allready for some months  to control her eczema,&lt;br /&gt;it is really excellent staff, it helps a lot to control the skin dryness and itching</li>
            <li> I had some issues with contact dermatitis, tried so many different ointments, and this by far is the best, great improvement just after a few applications, high recommend, it is a great over all lotion for aged skin, the best.</li>
            <li> Works incredibly well for me with the Cetaphil Skin Restoring Body Wash. Feels great, very soothing feel and a mild scent that is actually reminiscent of oatmeal (least to me it is). I use this constantly and have found myself with very few flare ups, and truly feel like it delves into my skin and keeps it fresh and feeling healthy/moisturized throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve come to truly enjoy Aveeno products and was happy to find this and come to the conclusion that it really does what I&#x27;d need it to - moisturize and help with eczema.</li>
            <li> Let me just say that when my daughter was born 5 yrs ago I had never even heard of eczema so when she started breaking out in rashes everywhere it scared the crap out of me. I did eventually learn all about eczema but i struggled to find anything to help the flare ups. She got it mostly on her chin, neck, upper back and her armpits. She would scratch until it would bleed. I tried everything until one and nothing seemed to work. I was not a big fan of steroid creams so i really only used that in real extreme cases but in 5 years i&#x27;ve probably only used  cortizone twice. I finally found this miracle cream that made it all go away! yay! i agree it&#x27;s a bit of the expensive side, i buy it at target and while yea it&#x27;s pricey...to me there is no price when it comes to my baby&#x27;s comfort. &amp; plus it does seem to last me a while. I am so glad this came along cause i&#x27;ve really tried just about every lotion and cream out there. For anyone suffering from eczema it&#x27;s worth a try and while I personally don&#x27;t have eczema, as a mother, it&#x27;s the worst feeling to see your baby crying about itchy rashes and there&#x27;s nothing you can do to help. So with that being said i do  know how hard eczema is and trying to find the solution. I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how much money i&#x27;ve spent and the weird things I would do (blending all natural oatmeal everyday and throwing it in a bath) just to make the eczema go away. I love this lotion!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from eczema for several years, affecting my elbows, waist, the back of my knees and ankles.  I&#x27;ve been prescribed cortisone by various doctors which has always worked but I prefer not to take medications and worry about the cortisone thinning my skin.  Now that summer has arrived in Toronto, I had my first breakout of 2014.  I applied a generous amount of this cream overnight.  I felt a cool sensation after applying it, the itch began to go away, and the next morning the amount of rashes was reduced and the itch was gone.  I applied it 2 more times the next day, and the rashes were dried up or had completely disappeared.  I have to admit that I&#x27;m surprised at the results and would highly recommend it to anyone suffering from eczema.  Amazon.com&#x27;s price is the best I&#x27;ve found anywhere and shipping was quick to Canada.</li>
            <li> this is the first thing that works on my stupid dry face. i have some sort of horrible autoimmune thing that makes my hair fall off of my face and scalp. cortico steroids helps. this helps too. fml.</li>
            <li> this was recommended by our doctor &amp; seems to do the trick for my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it gives her some relief &amp; it doesn&#x27;t irritate or cause any other reactions.</li>
            <li> i wish i had found this years ago ... have had dyshydrotic eczema since i was about 10 ... this is the only product that has helped heal dry, cracked fingers .... best to put it on when skin is damp ... and make sure to put it on at night before bed .... also using the soap-free wash for showers ... we probably should cut back or eliminate irritating soaps and detergents as much as possible .... anyway, this is a great product !!</li>
            <li> I just purchased this lotion my skin felt nice and soft upon application. 2 min later my skin felt like it was burning and tingly. Eventually it stopped I&#x27;m not sure if that just means it was working... Ill keep an eye out and see how it goes.</li>
            <li> My baby nephew is a year old and has eczema. When I first saw him the skin around his ankles was flared up with scaling, red blotches and lots of dryness. Poor little guy! My sister had been putting eczema cream on him too but clearly it was not working. After searching online I found this product and got it for my nephew. In a matter of days his skin has improved greatly. The redness is all gone, his skin is not flaking and looks to have more moisture too it. It still feels dry to the touch but I don&#x27;t doubt that a few more applications of the cream will heal him. My sister loves this stuff and so do I for helping him feel better :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who care about chemicals/toxins know that this reads on the back \\&quot;safe for baby\\&quot; AND it is rated a low level 2 hazard by the Enviornmental Working Group.</li>
            <li> This is a cure for my Eczema! Great product! I will be using all winter. Highly recommeded for all those struggling with eczema.</li>
            <li> I love Aveeno products. This one is especially great. My husband and I both use it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> People constantly compliment me on my smooth skin! I have convinced several people to buy this product and I always buy at least three bottles at a time.</li>
            <li> If you have skin problems, go to a dermatologist and get the good stuff. This cream didn&#x27;t do a thing for my Eczema. I had it bad on both hands for months, but the prescription ointment cleared it up in a few days. This cream works as a lotion would, nothing more from what I can tell.</li>
            <li> I tried this product partially due to the positive feedbacks on this site and partially out of desperation as I&#x27;ve been suffering from eczema for decades.  I don&#x27;t like to depend on my cortisone cream and have been looking for an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the cortisone cream for about 2 weeks now after applying this cream daily on my back, elbows and ankles.  I&#x27;m just hoping this effect will last, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Perfect for Eczema or people with skin allergy or other conditions.  It is also nice in the winter for dry skin.  Non-scented so it will not make you smell.  Works on all parts of the body.  A little greasy, but not bad.</li>
            <li> not greasy., nice and light and creamy. no smell. goes in to skin quickly. has a very silky feel. very nice on face.</li>
            <li> My sweet 2 year old daughter has eczema and the only medicne that treats it well is what I get from my doctors office. I decided to try this for her and I absolutely notice a difference in the softness of her skin. It heals the dry, itchy patches.</li>
            <li> I have facial  alargy  sins I can remember and I use to just coupe with it when it&#x27;s  eritated, wait it out, but this cream even if it&#x27;s not a cure but sure it Mack&#x27;s me feel I have skin again and when I use it it dose not tingil or a bit of burn then starts suthung, it works from the instant I put it on, truly a life saver for me,,, love this product .</li>
            <li> skin friendly product.i strongly recommend this product for dry skin treatment.no side effect.no burning after application.light smell with moisture.like it</li>
            <li> I love Aveeno products, and based on the reviews here, had high hopes for the Eczema Therapy cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a nice, light moisturizer. I will continue to use this tube for my hands as a general moisturizer. Alas, even using daily, it did nothing for the 50-cent-piece sized eczema patch on my wrist that flares up from time to time.  Notably, during a flare up, this cream did not provide any relief, the itching was unbearable. I had to switch back to fluocinonide for relief in those instances.</li>
            <li> This has totally helped my eczema. It has cleared up in spots and is tame in others. The irritation and itchiness goes away when I put it on. Pleasant oatmeal scent. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  During the summer after my first year of college, I noticed that I had a habit of washing my hands too often during the day.  I noticed that because I lived in the dorm for my first year of college, I&#x27;ve developed a germ issue (not the extent of OCD or germophobia, but I washed my hands all the time), which really made my hands dry and irritated.  I woke up one morning and there was a distinct, different kind of rash I had on my pinky finger.  At first I thought it was just a rash and because I&#x27;m someone who had rashes due to dry skin since I was a kid, I thought it was the same type of rash.  However, it never went away.  After dealing with it for two years, it was still there and it developed into a rash with blisters that would crust and sometimes bleed.  It also spread, which is something that never happened to me before.  My esteem has never been so low and it was embarrassing and uncomfortable to me since it was on my right hand.  I went to the doctor and she told me I had some type of dermatitis, specifically contact dermatitis which is an inflammation on the skin to some allergy that I might have.  She said to find out what is causing my skin flare and to stop touching it.  She gave me a mild ointment to use to ease the itch.  She also told me to use a good lotion of my hands since she noticed that they were a bit dry.  I went home and tried to figure out everything that might be causing this, from subway poles to the knives handles, but nothing.  As time went on, it also got worst.  I was in Rite Aid one day and spotted this lotion and I said to myself, what if it&#x27;s eczema after all it presented all the symptoms and I bought it on a whim despite the price tag.  I decided that if it doesn&#x27;t work, I can always use this as hand/body lotion.  I applied it every night and after a couple of months, whatever that was on my hand is 80%-85% gone.  I wish I remembered when I started using this to track my progress, but it was definitely not overnight for me, which shows you what kind of dermatitis I was dealing with.  I&#x27;m so happy that I found this product and that I decided to make the gamble.  It was really one of the best impulse buys of my life.  If you have a rash problem, I really recommend this product to try.  You&#x27;ve seen how many great reviews this one has so you never know.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> This is OK but seems less effective than Wild Naturals Eczema and Psoriasis Cream with Manuka, etc.</li>
            <li> My son has had eczema since he was a newborn. His doctor gave him some cream for it and suggested that we add Aveeno eczema to it. I have been using this for almost 4 years on him now and it clears up his eczema so quick. I tried using just the cream that the doctor gave and it works but this lotion speeds up the healing process. Whenever he starts itching he goes right to the Aveeno and ask me to put it on. This is a must have product for anyone with eczema.</li>
            <li> During the dry winter months I experience extreme cracking, scaling on my finders and finger tips. Very painful when coming in contact with water or anything else since the cracking also occurs where the skin meets the nail.  The only thing that has worked until now was wrapping my finger tips in band aids and applying lotion a doctor prescribed some time ago.  This does not work well for someone who uses a computer daily and flips through mass amounts of paper during this time of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other remedies I&#x27;ve tried - RX ointment, O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Working Hands, Emily soother lotion.  These worked to some extent but made the skin extremely oily (which I know is the point to re moisturize).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a couple days, this Aveeno brand of lotion has worked wonders in healing my skin, cracks, and scaling.  Very happy that companies are finally tailoring lotion to be more eczema specific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try.  What do you really have to lose at this point, since we wouldn&#x27;t be on here if nothing else has worked :-)</li>
            <li> If you suffer from eczema, this is a great product to give a try. I&#x27;ve had great results to maintain my skin and control inflammations.</li>
            <li> Baby skin is really sensitive. It is normal they have rushes in his arms, legs or back. We have tried several creams and the is by far the best one. Keeps skin smooth and hydrated.  All rushes are gone in a couple of days. We apply daily after bath and he does not show rushes anymore. I cannot put five stars because I found it a little bit pricey.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had severe eczema since I was a kid and while it&#x27;s subsided in my adult years I still get itchiness and dryness on my hands a lot and sometimes on my stomach and thighs. This stuff does about a half job for me... I&#x27;m less dry and less itchy but it&#x27;s not like it goes away. It works OK in the summer when my skin isn&#x27;t as bad, but in the winter is when I get flare-ups and it really doesn&#x27;t help very much. I&#x27;d say if you have moderate or mild eczema this will help you, but if your eczema is severe or you&#x27;ve had it a very long time, either try another product or go ask a doctor for something prescription. On the plus side, this stuff applies easily and doesn&#x27;t make me feel sticky or gross like some other lotions do.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff. After only three days of use my hand has gone from cracked, red and bleeding to almost normal. Another couple of days and it will be fully healed. This lotion isn&#x27;t greasy, absorbs nicely and has no scent at all. Highly recommend to anyone suffering with Eczema.</li>
            <li> I was searching high and low for an OTC products to help with my sore dry hands. This is the very best I&#x27;ve tried so far. I&#x27;ve been able to avoid the nasty cracking in the skin on my fingers. What a pleasure!</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my daughter&#x27;s dry skin for a few months and it has really helped!  Within 2 days I really noticed a decrease in the dry, scaly patches.  It is not oily and the smell is minimal.  If your child has eczema then I would recommend using this during the day and then Aquaphor at night!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have eczema but I use this when my skin is red and sensitive after using Retin A - it&#x27;s super soothing. It goes on really thick, but it absorbs into the skin nicely and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li> So far it works a little. Looking to see if the changes increase in the next two weeks. So far the eczema is on and off.</li>
            <li> It made my eczema break out even worse than usual. I applied it to my arm before going to sleep, and the next morning my arm was inflamed and itchier  than its ever been.</li>
            <li> Bought for my boyfriend, he works outside and washes his hands a lot!  He had a few spots that resembled eczema and it cleared up very quickly.</li>
            <li> Useless cream, does absolutely nothing for eczema. I would not recommend it to anyone that suffers from skin itchiness, eczema or dermatitis. Sorry, but this is not effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had psoriasis for over 25 years and recently developed eczema, too. So I&#x27;ve tried ALOT of different products to control itch and redness. This is by far the best. The itching stops nearly right away and the redness and rough skin are smoother and look better after just one application. I keep a tube at home and one at work. I have eczema on my hands so I find it best to reapply after washing your hands.</li>
            <li> This is a great product from Aveeno.  At the time of my purchase, I couldn&#x27;t find the product at my local stores.  It really helps with dry skin.  Can&#x27;t go without it!</li>
            <li> I had a problem with my eczema for over 5 years. I&#x27;ve beed t the dermatologist and he gave me some steroid creams. They helped for few months. Then I&#x27;ve used cortizone from drug store. But then I&#x27;ve found this cream and decided to buy it. It&#x27;s great for my ezcema. My hands don&#x27;t have any allergic reactions when I use it. It&#x27;s soothing and calming. I like it. The only con is that it could have a dispenser with a pump instead of the tube. But still great buy.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer&#x27;s daughter, I have had really bad eyelid eczema that comes and goes with seasonal allergies. Nothing worked, until this cream. This is now my facial moisturizer. I use a toner, then use half a dime size amount of Aveeno Eczema Cream, and then my BB cream. I have found nothing else better that works to calm my eczema flare-ups.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright. I have some seriously dry skin on my hand that has migrated around over 7 years from finger tip to the rest of the finger pads to the palm and back of hand. It becomes rough and flaky at the slightest provocation. Touching fabric used to be a nightmare, my skin would catch on everything, and I lost my finger prints for a while. They&#x27;ve come back as my finger tips improve luckily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is decent as a stop-gap. It would be better for people who have only moderately dry skin, not eczema. Its main ingredient is water so it absorbs quickly. The problem for me is that even lotions marketed as being for &amp;#34;severely dry and cracked skin&amp;#34; don&#x27;t help. This stuff is about on that level. It has oats, which are great, and help, but it just doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well as Triple Cream. On the upside, your hands won&#x27;t be greasy when you use Aveeno. With Triple Cream, Eucerin and Aquaphor they will be greasy for at least an hour. But that&#x27;s the only thing that helps my skin :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try the Neosporin Eczema Essentials eventually as well, but I&#x27;m not sure how well it will go. Looks like it&#x27;s about the same as Aveeno.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice that some people apparently have their eczema cured by this stuff. From where I am standing there is no cure. :(</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It was recommended by my new dermatologist. I have a variety of skin issues (eczema, pityriasis alba AND hypo/hyper pigmentation. Let me tell you, this is possibly the best lotion I have ever used, even better than some of the prescribed lotions I have used. Not only is my eczema better, my skin color is evening out. It is extremely moisturizing but isn&#x27;t greasy like some of the other &amp;#34;eczema&amp;#34; products full of mineral oil. I&#x27;ve tried to stop using it and stick to other lotions and vaseline but my skin clearly tells me that it is a NO GO and to stop being cheap. There are Aveeno coupons for $1 off circulating dermatologist offices and they offer a larger bottle now. I would definitely recommend this lotion. Even though I am cheap, my skin is the largest organ I have and it deserves the best.</li>
            <li> sooths very dry and scaling skin immediately...much relief</li>
            <li> Best thing ever for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have miserable stasis eczema and this really does help......not a cure, but it feels much better when I use it. The colloidal oatmeal is very soothing and it is not at all greasy...........just don&#x27;t over-do. It can get a little caked on. Stops the itch almost immediately. Use it on damp, cool skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion has cured my eczema problem!! For 20 years I had recurring eczema on my forehead and cheeks that I would keep only slightly under control with Psoriasin, it would help a little, but I was fighting a losing battle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to give this Aveeno lotion a try. The way I did it, is first BEFORE I tried the Aveeno, I applied a prescription triamcinolone acetonide cream for several days to clear the eczema up (I had never tried the cream before, it was prescribed to me for something else, and I can&#x27;t remember what made me think to try it). And then after my skin got mostly cleared up, I started applying the Aveeno lotion at least once a day, sometimes twice, and I haven&#x27;t had any eczema breakouts since! The Aveeno keeps them from happening. And it&#x27;s a good gentle moisturizer for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Aveeno for about 2 years now, and have not had the slightest bit of eczema in that time. I don&#x27;t use or need any other eczema products, only this lotion. I am always amazed when a skin product does what it says it will do, but this one delivers. So glad I found it. :-D</li>
            <li> We bought it at a local CVS because our poor baby just diagnosed with mild eczema. His skin was only slightly red before we applied this on him. His skin became inflamed about 2 minutes after the application, and I was almost in tears to see that! I am sure it works on many babies, but please make sure save your receipt just in case.</li>
            <li> This product works GREAT for eczema and I love and highly recommend it, however, the product I ordered had a broken seal and when I called Aveeno about it they were very concerned and said not to use it with no seal. They said they are following up with Amazon themselves. Buyer Beware. I had purchased two tubes and both had the seal broken.</li>
            <li> By the time my baby turned 2 weeks old, he had red patches on his cheeks.  They continued to worsen and spread to some spots on his back and tummy, and I was desperate to get them under control before they worsened to weeping eczmea.  I started using this product every couple of hours and the eczema got much better over the course of about a week.  On rare occasions for really bad flare ups I still have to use a tiny amount of hydrocortisone, but 99% of the time this doe the job.  Now that my baby is older, I only have to use it 1-2 times a day to keep the eczema at bay.</li>
            <li> Thought we would have to live with eczema and was very excited that after a few uses I saw tremendous improvement! Very happy with thi product and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I have a 5 month old son that needed an eczema cream, as do I. So, I have used three eczema creams now. I tried this cream first and liked it. It was a cream that I purchased before he was born and I am so glad that I did. His pediatrician said that eczema can run in families. So if this condition runs in your family and you&#x27;re expecting a baby, you might consider getting some of this cream to have on hand. I also tried CeraVe but ti did not feel as silky as the Aveeno cream. I also tried Gold Bond Ultimate eczema relief cream. While Gold Bond is usually my favorite brand over perfumed products due to having sensitive skin, I thought this particular cream felt &amp;#34;thinner&amp;#34; than the Aveeno. And, that is why I choose Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream.</li>
            <li> My son , 1 year old, gets mild eczema flare ups every now and then, and using this lotion twice a day gets rid of it within a couple days.</li>
            <li> i am using before going bed. It have small rosacea problem on my face.&lt;br /&gt;my face was getting worse and red when i take shower. this cream looks that it helped me.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with this moisturizer is the lack of any type of seal on the tube.  The expiration date is in 13 months, which is plenty, the tube is convenient to use, the moisturizer is helping my dry skin and it does not leave a residue.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend who was having unknown skin peeling issue on her hand. This really seemed to help. She shared it with a coworker who has eczema on her hands, and said coworker snuck back to keep using it until we got her her own tube! She said it is one of the most effective over the counter creams for her eczema she has ever had.</li>
            <li> This did not work on my friend who I bought it for. She said it did absolutely nothing to slow down her ecZema outbreaks on the bottom of her feet.</li>
            <li> The only best moisturizer out in market that controls my 2 year old son&#x27;s eczema since his birth till now. I recommend this to any mom!</li>
            <li> When I first moved to El Paso, I had dry skin, but it wasn&#x27;t too bad. Then for some reason, after I went home for the holidays and came back, the dry skin was really bad. I tried different types of lotions and finally what worked was a humidifier along with this lotion. For my face, Pond&#x27;s dry skin cream works (the blue one) but for the front of my neck, the dry skin can get really bad &amp; start to feel really dry and rough within a matter of minutes after stepping out of the shower. My other lotions don&#x27;t work for my neck, but this lotion does &amp; I&#x27;m glad I bought it. Sometimes I have to apply it 3-4x before the dryness goes away, but it eventually does. Sometimes I forget to apply it before going out &amp; then by the time I get home, my skin&#x27;s already started flaking off. This lotion&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found so far for this random patch of dry skin.</li>
            <li> my job require frequent hand wash. This cream has saved my hands.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly on my eczema! I didn&#x27;t know this was out there and bought about a dozen different kinds of lotions for my hands. This, hands down, is the best lotion for eczema! Calms the itchy and pain immediately. I use it a couple times a day. Works wonders. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Love this for my daughter who had eczema as a newborn</li>
            <li> We are on week 3.  2 year old daughters exema is almost gone!  Have not tried another product, or have nothing to compare it with, or know if another product works better.  But can say.. that this product does produce a result.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Loveeee this stuff. I had some eczema that came outta nowhere on my chest area. Within a few days of applying this stuff, they all vanished! It even worked better than my prescribed cream.</li>
            <li> My child has had eczema from bout a month old. Ww tried pretty much every type of lotion before Aveeno, because I&#x27;ve broken out in hives from some of their adult products. I am glad we finally did. This works better than more expensive creams or lotions...but the smell is not pleasant. But realistically, I would rather my child have relief than &amp;#34;smell like baby&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Not what I thought it was.</li>
            <li> My regular purchase. Great value &amp; good for the winter. We&#x27;ve tried diff brands and this works the best. For best result, apply it right after bath to keep the body moisturized.</li>
            <li> Great to use between times I can use the script for eczema.  Nice for dry skin too.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is great for people with dry and sensitive skin.  I get a mild case of eczema flare-up every now and then and this is the only moisturizer that helps keep my skin moist and calm.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband to use on his face.  Works very well keeps the redness off his face. He is pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Very nice cream for babies with eczema</li>
            <li> Greate Product! The best thing for Eczema. I hope they don&#x27;t change quality in time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this on your face if you get acne naturally. I get acne and I&#x27;m treating it with other products and I needed something to moisturize my face, but I made a big mistake. This product caused more pimples, nasty ones!&lt;br /&gt;The cream is a little too greasy, you can feel the grease even after many hours of applying! I feel like this grease caused the pimples to grow!</li>
            <li> My 2-year old daughter has atopic dermatitis (chronic dry skin). This lotion works great for her. Smothering her up 3 times a day with this prevents any kind of flares. The lotion is a bit too sticky for people with normal skin, but may be good for once-in-a-while application, particularly in winter.</li>
            <li> This cream is actually a lot cheaper to purchase on Amazon than a lot of local places I searched. I bought two creams at Walgreens ($13.64ish) only because they had a deal on two and I had a coupon for two, so it worked out for me. But when I run out, I will most likely purchase from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto the product. This is really great! I am currently 23 years old, and I have had skin issues for (what it seems) all my life. When I was younger the doctors described it as rashes, so on that went. Then in my teenage years I was told it was Eczema. Now in my 20s I&#x27;m told by my doctor and a dermatologist that I have both Eczema and Psoriasis. Fabulous. At least now they&#x27;ve narrowed it down. I started getting signs of Eczema in new areas and it worried me, so along with recommendations from my dermatologist, I researched and found this as a solution that worked for many online. I wasn&#x27;t extremely comfortable applying steroid cream to my eyelids and face, so I tried this out, and it has truly helped me out. Now the issues haven&#x27;t disappeared, and since I am African American discoloration will apparently stay with me for years to come, but the roughness and apparent obviousness of the issues I had on my forehead, cheek and eyelids have diminished at a great capacity. So this cream is one that I apply to both my face and on my hands. I get dry hands easily and therefore have several places on my hands that are issues for me (which is why I always carried lotion in each bag and in my pockets if I could), and although I haven&#x27;t seen the same result on my hands that i have of my face, I will not give up. I just love that after I apply this to my hands, they look and feel moisturized. I find that with some lotions after I apply them to my hands, they still look dry. It would get on my nerves! But I don&#x27;t have that issue with this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is amazing, and although I have used Aveeno previously for years at different times, I never knew of this version. Too bad this is the largest size, but this is already one of the most expensive products from the line, so I can only imagine how much that would cost. But I highly recommend this to anyone with skin issues such as Eczema or Psoriasis.Too bad this is the largest size, but this is already one of the most expensive products from the line, so I can only imagine how much that would cost.

            <li> I have an almost 2 year old, that has sporadic flare ups of eczema.  This is one of the few products that consistently works and usually you can see a marked difference in less than 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;Our winter routine is putting a layer of this cream all over him, then following that with a layer of aquaphor to seal it in. We usually do this before bedtime and make sure he wears cotton pajamas. This has been very effective and I love being able to buy this through the subscribe and save option to save money and time!</li>
            <li> I have two little boys that have battled eczema pretty much since they were born. We have tried everything from oils, prescriptions, changes in diet, changes in detergent,gentle soaps, oatmeal soaks and everything in between. I came upon this product in the 5 oz size at a local Walgreens while looking for anything that seemed like it would ease their discomfort from their itchy, scaly eczema on their hands, tummy, legs, feet and bottoms. I paid nearly $10 for it there, but it was worth it! After 3 days of use the texture of their skin changed from rough to soft and supple and their eczema cleared up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They still have breakouts that are triggered mostly by heat or stress, but this lotion helps keep the breakouts to a minimum so I don&#x27;t have to apply their prescription medicated ointment very often. We also keep baths super short and wash with aquaphor baby. We use this lotion once a day before bed or after a bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having struggled with them suffering with eczema for so long and buying heaps of products that don&#x27;t work and feeling frustrated I was relieved to find something semi-cheap and non-prescription that finally really worked. It broke my heart to see them scratching their little spots till they cracked and bled even though I was applying Vaseline heavily to the areas. Buy this, use it everyday and see the difference. It&#x27;s well worth every cent.</li>
            <li> I have tried 100 different creams for the flaky skin on my face. If it worked, I would breakout, else they never worked, till I found this one. I apply this after shower on my face and before going to bed at night, after washing my face. No more flaky skin on face and no more breakouts. I highly recommend this to anyone having flaky skin on face.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but I have to say that I have been suffering for a good couple of months with eye eczema due to the humidity and my low immune system and this really was like a miracle!! I had burning eyes that were very painful, lines and wrinkles, and tight dried and dark patches around my eyes which looked pretty gross. I tried a bunch a things, but this actually healed it in 2 days flat!!! All the dry skin exfoliated off after applying it 3 times a day for 2 days. I carefully removed the skin with a warm wash cloth and....WHALA!!! Those lines and wrinkles for the most part were non existent!! Yes, I still have those annoying Dennie-Morgan folds which I am hoping will fade with time( or perhaps hyaurolonic acid if I will need it), but they did lighten a great deal which gives me hope. I will continue using this for the rest of my life as a weapon against dry skin and eczema! If you are upset, going crazy, and feel you are never going to get through this eczema nightmare, BUY THIS RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It has an odd texture and consistency but it seems to help.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have tried everything to get rid of my toddlers eczema.  I tried prescriptions, and expensive doctor recommended lotions and nothing helped.  I bought this after reading the reviews.  It has helped, but hasn&#x27;t made it go away.  I use this in conjunction with the Aveeno baby eczema bath therapy.  Her skin has improved in the two weeks we&#x27;ve been using it and she doesn&#x27;t scratch as much.  I&#x27;m glad I purchased both of these products, and they&#x27;re much cheaper than what I had been using!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have eczema, but the skin on my hands is very dry and can get ashy. After washing my hands (something I do VERY often) my skins immediately become dry, white and tight. Awful. If I follow up with this lotion immediately, my hands stay soft and moisturized until the next time I wash them. There is no greasy feeling and it seems like my skin just drinks this cream up in a matter of minutes. Love it! Would recommend to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my daughter who has sensitive skin and mild eczema. I found it ONE TIME in the grocery store and have not been able to find it ANYWHERE since. So I was estatic to find it online and around the same price, though I wish it cost less. Very pleased with the product and the service.</li>
            <li> After months of using just coconut oil, this stuff is a God-send.  Reduced the severity of my eczema at least by half.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve began to have issues with cracking on my hands &amp; this lotions is perfect because it applies greasy which really soothes my dry skin, and it drys within minutes and creates a great barrier for further irritation. I do apply normally about 3 to 4 times daily.</li>
            <li> I am on some medication that gives me some incredibly dry skin and on top of that I have eczema in places. I was so frustrated dealing with it and was starting to get to the point where I was desperate and nothing my doc was giving me helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this in a lark just hoping for a wee bit of relief and in two treatments my life was so much better. WOW!! I actually kept saying &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; after those two days. Nothing else ever worked for me even other Aveeno products. I would pay triple for this stuff and not complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are suffering give it a shot because if it works for you, you will be so much happier.</li>
            <li> good cream but don&#x27;t expect miracles!</li>
            <li> Pretty pleasant overall. Goes on kind of thick, but doesn&#x27;t feel cloggy, stifling, or oily. I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend using this on palms or soles, but it&#x27;s been good elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from eczema for many years. My hands would get so dry I could sandpaper a wall. Tired of having to resort to steroid ointments, I started looking for a better alternative. I&#x27;ve tried many brands and types of lotions: Vaseline, Curel, St. Ives, Goldbond, Burt&#x27;s Bees, the list goes on. I saw the reviews claiming the Aveeno Eczema Therapy was nothing short of a miracle. I was skeptical, but gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you, this lotion really is like a miracle. After about a day of applying it twice, I could already notice the sandpaper feeling was gone. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now, and my eczema is under control. There&#x27;s still a spot of severely stubborn inflammation, but for mild to moderate cases, I couldn&#x27;t imagine recommending any other brand or lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it. It works.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders on my kids. It Only take a few days before the eczema spots clear up. I always keep and extra in stock.</li>
            <li> This product has made a huge impact in my life. I have eczema. Before using this product I was using vaseline, which has drawbacks. The baby version is overkill, even for me.</li>
            <li> My husband is an electrician and his hands get really dry- this is the only cream that doesn&#x27;t need constant reapplying.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter has had eczema since she was born. It mostly flares up in the winter and we&#x27;ve tried many different things: cortisone cream, steroid cream, neospotine for eczema, cetaphil lotions/soap, acquaphor, Vaseline and the only thing that helps is the steroid cream, which you can&#x27;t use all the time. My daughter had a bad flare up while visiting family is Colorado where it&#x27;s really dry and I decided to give the Aveeno eczema cream a try (since I forgot her steroid cream at home) and after only one use I saw a huge difference! I was very pleasantly shocked. I think after a week or so of use it will be cleared up, something the steroid cream never could achieve.</li>
            <li> I was suffering from eczema on my face and hands and this was highly recommended to me. I thought it would work like a charm however it created even more problems and it turns out I am allergic to this product which is why I only gave it 1/5. Also, afterwards I became allergic to other normal aveeno products which is just odd. I&#x27;m not sure what is going on but this definitely made my eczema worse.</li>
            <li> I am afraid that it seems doesn&#x27;t work for my baby. It can&#x27;t relieve anything. I am so sorry.</li>
            <li> After 2 years of trying on my child&#x27;s feet every cream I had been suggested,its the first time within 2 weeks use that we have smooth skin!My daughter is amazed!!!Thanks!</li>
            <li> My itching ankles were annoying my ability to get to sleep and this cream worked...I rub it on before I go to bed at night</li>
            <li> Just found out my toddler son has eczema. I used this as well as Avenno %1 hydrocortisone anti itch cream on his face that was super chapped and irritated. It was really bad and this seriously seemed to start working instantly. He seemed practically fully recovered within 4 hours / 4 applications. This is the first day I&#x27;ve used it on him but so far I am very very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Around 6 1/2-7m old my baby started developing patches of dry skin near her fingers and on her cheeks and nose. Later it spread to her arms, shoulders, thighs, back of legs and really bad on her back. Her skin felt dry and scaly and some areas red. I started getting worried because nothing was helping. First I tried natural remedies. I tried coconut oil which I applied many times a day, a homemade shea butter recipe, a homemade aloe vera/shea butter lotion (which cause her skin to become super red where I applied it), lanolin and tried blending up some oatmeal for her bath. Those didn&#x27;t work so gave into trying vaseline and Aquaphor which her doctor had recommended. None of this even touched it really. I found this cream while cleaning my older daughter&#x27;s room (she had mild eczema as a toddler) and decided it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try it. I put it on that night and when baby woke up her dry patches were 80% gone. Day 2 and they&#x27;re completely gone. I honestly can&#x27;t believe it. She&#x27;s so much happier too! Poor little thing! I hate paying $7-10 for a lotion, but when it actually works I&#x27;ll pay it.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and daughter have very dry skin and this is the only moisturizer that seems to work in the New England winter for them. I highly recommend this product. The auto-ship feature makes it very convenient. I don&#x27;t have to remember to reorder every month.</li>
            <li> not as good as California baby, but cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from eczema on my arms and legs for two years and this product definitely helps.  Having it available from Amazon is a plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Aveeno for 7 days in order to get ride of an eczema and after this time is exactly the same or even a little worse.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought coconut oil, after some internet researches and is a lot better than this fake advertise. Do not make the same mistake like me to trust the hundreds of reviews which are paid reviews by AVEENO.</li>
            <li> If your baby have very dry skin this is a must have, I even use it on myself during the winter months!</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer for my (very) dry skin. I&#x27;ve tried a good number at all different prices, staying with this one going forward.</li>
            <li> this works better than any other over the counter eczema lotion I have found</li>
            <li> Its hard to find a non prescription quality eczema cream. My husband gets \\&quot;winter eczema\\&quot; its horrible to the point where he bleeds through his socks, gloves and is in quite some pain. After a few days of using this the results are fantastic, within a week in a half the rash became non-existent. He uses this regularly and the eczema has not returned, very satisfied, HIGHLY recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream is very effective on eczema as well as on  psoriasis.I sent it to my relative who is suffering from psorsiasis on the soles &amp; the results have been miracluous.</li>
            <li> I got it for my daughter as she was scratching her dry skin to the point that her skin was bleeding. Tried several moisturizers, but only this worked so far. I highly recommend. We will keep using it during winter months.</li>
            <li> We got this to try out for our 3 months old since she has Eczema. It had such great reviews online but it just didnt work and actually made it worst. I put this all over her body and face and the next morning it got so bad and it actually made her skin very dry. What i learn is that there isn&#x27;t a cream that will work for everyone and if your baby has bad eczema, you might need to try a few different creams to see what works... and I should have just put a little bit on her face and body to test it out before putting it all over her. We use Cerave now and it works better.</li>
            <li> I only bought it to relieve the dryness of my eczema, but it&#x27;s gone above and beyond! And now my eczema is actually healing. I&#x27;ve had eczema on my hands since high school (6 years ago) and nothing really worked, not even the corticosteroid creams from the dermatologists. I tried vaseline and honey for a while, but even those didn&#x27;t help. I kinda gave up and just accepted eczema as a part of my life and was looking for some lotion to relieve the intense dryness and pain I was having. Once I put it on, my hands felt so much better almost instantly. The actual healing process took a few days to start, but the results have been amazing nonetheless. Now I just want to jump for joy and tell everyone about it. It really gave me hope when I had none left.</li>
            <li> We use this on our infant and toddler and it really helps prevents their eczema outbreaks. Best lotion I have found for this.</li>
            <li> I love the product!  I have it on automatic delivery.  This was the first winter I did not have dry skin issues.  In fact, my husband commented on how sleek and smooth my legs felt.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without this product!  I tell everyone about it.  I even carry it in my gym bag so when I shower there after a workout, I can apply it in the dressing room.</li>
            <li> The only thing that actually clears up my eczema.</li>
            <li> Our 2yr old has eczema bumps on her arms and chest. This product (in addition to Cetaphil &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34;) really helps to mitigate those affected areas.</li>
            <li> Aveeno eczema, its a fantastic product, I love it, and my baby skin is so much better,,  thanks aveeno</li>
            <li> After years of eczema discomfort and itching, finally found this stuff that keeps it under control. One might even say &amp;#34;cures,&amp;#34; but I find I have to use this continually to have the relief.  Even so, this has none of the side effects of steroids, and works much better!  The itch relief is very fast and lasts at least 6 to 8 hours.  With regular use, my eczema stays away, and my skin returned to normal.  This is not greasy and has only a very mild and pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t describe the relieve that I felt when I found that this product works like a charm on my daughter&#x27;s eczema. She has eczema since 2 weeks after birth, and she &#x27;s 6 months old now. I tried all emollient that I can find, and all failed. And then I found Aveeno. Thanks God this product is available for international shipping. The cost is not cheap, i have to pay thrice the price for shipping only, but it&#x27;s worth every penny. Hopefully aveeno will also do mass production in Indonesia soon.&lt;br /&gt;Love this.</li>
            <li> For 6 years my daughter has battled eczema!!! We have spent hundreds and hundreds on doctors visits, steroids, and tried every lotion on the market.  This is truly a miracle cream!!! It healed her skin in 2 uses!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing results. Cleared Eczema in only a few days. Love the Aveeno line of products</li>
            <li> I like this product so much, I subscribed to it. I definitely need it and will continue using it until all evidence of my Eczema is gone! This has been an awful year of skin problems for me and something I do not want to experience again!</li>
            <li> My three month old son had developed mild Eczema. I was putting on a ton of other products religiously - Honest Company lotion, Honest Co. organic healing balm, Aquafor. Nothing worked. We used this for just a few days twice per day and his skin cleared right up! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very good price,half than Rite Aid!!</li>
            <li> Love this; it&#x27;s great for my eczema!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream.  I had a really bad case of eczema and did not want to use steroid cream and prednisone pills that the doctor gave me.  I decided to go to drugstore and get  this cream and try it.  I was so  happy after a couple of days the rash and inflammation was on its way out.  The stinging and burning sensation was gone almost immediately.  If I have a little bit of itching start up I go get the cream and  put it on and I am in the comfort zone once again.  I also bought the body wash and that really helps in the shower.  I love this product.  I hope this review will help someone else.</li>
            <li> Cleared up my hands within a week.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for dry winter skin, especially hands.  The colloidal oatmeal does not leave you feeling greasy.  It&#x27;s expensive but really helps protect and heal cracked skin.  Feels very soothing.</li>
            <li> I use this on my infant daughter since she has sensitive and eczema. I love how it makes her skin feels and it stops the itching.</li>
            <li> Really good for dry skin and eczema.  Nice to find in large size and cheaper than grocery store.</li>
            <li> I have horribly dry, itchy skin. I don&#x27;t just mean slightly dry either. I mean it gets to the point where it&#x27;ll crack and bleed. It&#x27;s not just annoying, it&#x27;s painful. Unfortunately I&#x27;ve had this problem since I was a child and I&#x27;ve tried just about everything from prescription lotions to just globbing on Vaseline. While the Vaseline works, it&#x27;s not pleasant to be covered in the stuff all the time. This is the only lotion I&#x27;ve found that works. After a few applications I found that my skin is no longer cracking and is actually smooth. I&#x27;ve even had the complement that it&#x27;s soft and considering all I&#x27;ve ever heard is how rough my skin is, I consider this a miracle product.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product, but it is very sticky.</li>
            <li> I turned thirty and started having Eczema outbreaks on my face. It was awful and out of nowhere. I normally have pretty nice skin. I bought this on a whim after using Dove Intensive Moisturizing Cream for weeks to no avail. It&#x27;s amazing. My eyebrows and the skin around my mouth looks great! I saw results within 24 hours. Must buy.</li>
            <li> This cream had kept my child&#x27;s eczema in check since we started using it. It works great. I have tried many different and more expensive creams, and this has been the best in not only relieving but treating the breakouts. They actually start to disappear. Occasionally, we need to use the medicated stuff but since we started using this cream, we had to use the medicated stuff a lot less.</li>
            <li> It works on our 2 year old wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I do not usually write reviews. But this product compelled me to write a review. I have suffered from Eczema on my legs and hands for over 20 years. Especially during winter or when I travel to dry environment it starts to flare up. This product is a first product where I can say that I will be comfortable leaving my house without prescription cream. Once you put the cream on, your skin will feel sort of rubbery and feels funny for awhile. I recommend you washing your palm side of your hands after applying because it creates barrier and your hands will starts to sweat. You can also put this cream on even if the Eczema has already progressed. Amazingly it will calm the symptoms in couple of days and make your skin soft. GIve it a try.</li>
            <li> stop reading reviews and get this stuff----huge difference in just 24 hours----i tried all kinds of lotions that were for dry skin including petroleum jelly but nothing worked----my wrists were dry and red from what i dont know----but all i know is this stuff works and it works fast----buy it and you will be happy too</li>
            <li> I tried many creams for dry skin and eczema on my arms. Nothing seemed to really improve it, and this winter it got much worse and the creams I used even made it even worse. I started using Aveeno last week and within 2 days I felt a real relief and my skin got less rough, it is the first time that my skin reacts so good to a cream. The cream absorbs really well and smells a bit like oatmeal but the smell disappears very quickly. I really felt a big relief not only for my skin but I really didn&#x27;t know what to do anymore so it was such a peace of mind to know I have found the right cream. The only thing is that I cannot get it here in the UK which makes it more expensive and the waiting time was long.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing I have found which works for my eczema. I&#x27;ve tried lotions, creams and steriods -- this keeps it at bay.</li>
            <li> This is perhaps the best and least irritating lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. Absorbs pretty quickly and doesn&#x27;t make you feel greasy for an extended period of time. I am so glad I found this product, as I must have tried almost every lotion commonly available at supermarkets and drugstores (in the US). Great for someone with Atopic Dermatitis. Aveeno&#x27;s other moisturizing lotions are not adequate substitutes for this.</li>
            <li> Our youngest has horrible eczema and this lotion clears it up in just a few days.</li>
            <li> Firstly, packaging was great and shipping was quick.  Being a eczema patient from birth its hard finding the right product that helps moisturizing part, but this really works...love it!</li>
            <li> I developed a blistery rash, which turned into a blotchy reddened and itchy skin. I suffered for 3 weeks before finding this product. The relief was immediate. It gave my dried and hot skin a cooling effect and moistened it enough to stop itching. I felt reborn.&lt;br /&gt;My rash was a contact dermatitis caused by one harsh laundry detergent Surf. It took 3 weeks of suffering to make a connection. Then I rewashed all my clothes and sheets in a new gentle detergent. But by then my poor skin was so irritated that just a gentle touch would send me into itching frenzy.&lt;br /&gt;Thank God for finding Aveeno. It was my savior.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product for skin rashes. It is Doctor recommended and helps with itching and dry skin.</li>
            <li> My son (2 yrs.) and twin girls (8 months) all have sensitive and eczematic skin and this is the only (gentle) product that clears it up.  We use it all over the body, including the face.  Great for the whole family!</li>
            <li> My husband has HORRIBLE eczema on his hands. In combination with prescription creams and cotton gloves, this lotion keeps his hands moisturized and his outbreaks to a minimum. It&#x27;s the only lotion that&#x27;s helped, and he&#x27;s tried everything!</li>
            <li> Works great - Good deal</li>
            <li> I had very dry patches on my hands for a while.  They weren&#x27;t itchy or anything.  Other lotions only provided temporary relief.  I used this cream once a day at night before bed and it cleared up in a couple of days!</li>
            <li> This is the only thing I&#x27;ve ever found that made the eczema on my arms heal and stay away. With regular use my skin was completely healed within a week.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that works well without steroids. As soon as I began applying this product (twice a day), the eczema affected regions have never flaked again!</li>
            <li> I see more improvement with this product in 12 hours than others in 12 days... will buy again if necessary.</li>
            <li> I wish it work, as good as I had read. It keep my hands moisturiz. It is o.k.</li>
            <li> I use it for my child who has eczema, it was referred to me by someone whose child also had eczema, and I often times use it myself too. Pretty good, and no smell.</li>
