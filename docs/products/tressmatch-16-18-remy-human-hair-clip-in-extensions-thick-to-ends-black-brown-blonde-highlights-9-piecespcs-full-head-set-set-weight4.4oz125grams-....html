            <li>I say get these they really are the best priced ones out there.</li>
            <li>so I am super happy with them.</li>
            <li>These were a perfect match to my natural hair color.</li>
            <li>These are by far the BEST quality extensions I have ever purchased for this price.</li>
            <li>The colors are great at first but tend to fade after a bit.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that is not long and these blended in perfectly.</li>
            <li>Oh its so fabulous, i put it on my pony and it makes him look so cute, even after the mishap with the propane heater!</li>
            <li>I love love love the extensions.</li>
            <li>LOVE them....</li>
            <li>I felt like people would be able to see them because I could feel them coming thru my hair</li>
            <li>When they arrived I was pleased with the quality of the hair.</li>
            <li>but I would shop a bit more.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I changed my mind.</li>
            <li>They just unraviled at the top and all the hair came out.</li>
            <li>They are great it looks and feels like my real hair</li>
            <li>I have compared them to my friends who paid a lot more for hers and</li>
            <li>I plan to order again and see if these are better.  </li>
            <li>but I just dyed them with a darker natural henna dye and they came out beautiful.</li>
            <li>I am excited to try them out!</li>
            <li>They need a good trim to even out the ends, but the hair was silky, untangled, and overall looked good.</li>
            <li>The color was a great match, and they are light and pretty comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>These are just so incredible and so natural (not super shiny - Caucasian hair blends perfectly).</li>
            <li>Nice golden chocolate brown color and no shedding or anything.</li>
            <li>They look the best when I pull them up in a high pony tail and wrap several around my own hair.  </li>
            <li>Never had extensions before but they were so easy to use</li>
            <li>I also got them very quickly.</li>
            <li>The clips are lightweight and strong.</li>
            <li>Too much money for this kind of thing....</li>
            <li>He also promised me that my satisfaction was important to them and if I wanted to give them another try</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly and in great shape, super smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Color was spot on to my original</li>
            <li>I have to say I chose these mostly based on price for 100% real hair.</li>
            <li>I would buy these again, not a bad deal over all.</li>
            <li>The elite set are super thick-amazing extensions.</li>
            <li>Used gold well products and was very gentle!</li>
            <li>I opened the package immediately and to my surprise the extentions felt very natural and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more in the near feature!</li>
            <li>The clips hold great and the extensions aren&#x27;t heavy like ones I&#x27;ve worn before.</li>
            <li>My natural hair is about to the top of my boobs and with the 16&#x27;-18&#x27; extensions it took its just below my boobs...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>I get many compliments that my hair is shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>This is right out of the package and clipped</li>
            <li>but i had to return because it wasn&#x27;t the right color for me</li>
            <li>They match my hair well enough and are super easy and quick to put in.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that they tangle more easily than other brands.</li>
            <li>I think they are cheap enough, but not too cheap.</li>
            <li>be aware that inside the package they say customer re-dyeing not recommended.</li>
            <li>Everything was exactly what I as looking for.</li>
            <li>But this one is really well made!</li>
            <li>I am a first time buyer of clip in extensions (or any extensions for that matter).</li>
            <li>My fiance couldn&#x27;t even tell I had them in when he saw me with them for the first time.</li>
            <li>Fell apart after first attempt to wash.</li>
            <li>I just wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect especially buying online.</li>
            <li>I will use what I bought for a while and buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve bought a lot of extensions ranging from cheap to very expensive and these are up there with the very best for a just a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first time getting extensions.</li>
            <li>My money was refunded and they offered a discount in the future if I wanted to order more.  </li>
            <li>These would be fine if you have about the same length hair you are ordering, and just want to add fullness.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really know that clip on ones existed until running across a you tube video.</li>
            <li>You really get a lot of hair for the money.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really think</li>
            <li>Fast shipment got my package with in a week of ordering.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>They feel so much like real hair.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had this much hair since I was a kid</li>
            <li>I really like these extensions.</li>
            <li>Four stars because the color has a bit more red that I wanted (still blended well and look natural).</li>
            <li>Not a good fit for most Caucasian hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not thick and the length is so much shorter</li>
            <li>hair was very soft felt like real hair</li>
            <li>The hair was so soft and silky and really matched my hair color.</li>
            <li>I watched a few videos on how to put them in and what was helpful was to tease my hair where they are going to clip in to give them more to grip to.</li>
            <li>I normally use two packs of 1b and 1 pack of chestnut.</li>
            <li>Most hair extensions I used before are super thin at the bottom, and I had to trim 2-3 inches to get decent thickness.</li>
            <li>originally ordered the 20\\&quot; chestnut brown-150g-elite set of extensions and about a month later I ordered the 16-18\\&quot; ones additionally because I absolutely loved the longer ones but wanted some a little shorter to add layers and less thickness.  </li>
            <li>The wefts are pretty thick, (I still had to double up to match my own hair</li>
            <li>I will come up with some update after I will use a new color.</li>
            <li>They were thicker at the ends than most other extensions I had looked at, but the set was not thick enough for my hair.</li>
            <li>product came the next day after i ordered very fast</li>
            <li>If your hair&#x27;s density is on the light side these would be fine to add length, medium density would benefit from using close to the same length as your natural hair to add fullness, and high density thick hair will probably find they can&#x27;t use these.</li>
            <li>The color is spot on and it&#x27;s just the right amount of weight in a single set to look completely natural when they&#x27;re in.</li>
            <li>My expectations were far surpassed.</li>
            <li>Does not look natural.</li>
            <li>I had my hair professionally styled.</li>
            <li>But if you have thick hair, I advise getting on TressMatch.com and getting more grams than 120.</li>
            <li>I think if you&#x27;re looking for great, semi-cheap extensions, you can&#x27;t goo wrong with these!</li>
            <li>Overall, they are a decent buy for the price</li>
            <li>The one with the 4 clips I don&#x27;t think I will use because to put it high enough on my head  </li>
            <li>First, let me start by saying that I&#x27;ve purchased this hair in the past and gave it a positive review.</li>
            <li>Very minimal shedding as well and the clips are small and grip nicely to the hair.</li>
            <li>so I feel like I&#x27;ve got a broad idea of the quality out there on the market.</li>
            <li>Also, they not as long as the picture, (again no big deal) nor are they curly like in the photo ( not a deal breaker as my hair is poker straight anyhow).</li>
            <li>I was not a happy customer at all because I expected them to be great quality just like the previous ones I ordered.  </li>
            <li>You actually get a decent amount of hair, like im shocked people need more hair the this!</li>
            <li>so if you have super thick then maybe.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something very natural looking and after feeling other types of extensions</li>

            <li> hair was very soft felt like real hair</li>
            <li> The hair was so soft and silky and really matched my hair color.</li>
            <li> I watched a few videos on how to put them in and what was helpful was to tease my hair where they are going to clip in to give them more to grip to.</li>
            <li> I normally use two packs of 1b and 1 pack of chestnut.</li>
            <li> Most hair extensions I used before are super thin at the bottom, and I had to trim 2-3 inches to get decent thickness.</li>
            <li> originally ordered the 20\\&quot; chestnut brown-150g-elite set of extensions and about a month later I ordered the 16-18\\&quot; ones additionally because I absolutely loved the longer ones but wanted some a little shorter to add layers and less thickness.  </li>
            <li> The wefts are pretty thick, (I still had to double up to match my own hair</li>
            <li> I will come up with some update after I will use a new color.</li>
            <li> They were thicker at the ends than most other extensions I had looked at, but the set was not thick enough for my hair.</li>
            <li> product came the next day after i ordered very fast</li>
            <li> If your hair&#x27;s density is on the light side these would be fine to add length, medium density would benefit from using close to the same length as your natural hair to add fullness, and high density thick hair will probably find they can&#x27;t use these.</li>
            <li> The color is spot on and it&#x27;s just the right amount of weight in a single set to look completely natural when they&#x27;re in.</li>
            <li> My expectations were far surpassed.</li>
            <li> Does not look natural.</li>
            <li> I had my hair professionally styled.</li>
            <li> But if you have thick hair, I advise getting on TressMatch.com and getting more grams than 120.</li>
            <li> I think if you&#x27;re looking for great, semi-cheap extensions, you can&#x27;t goo wrong with these!</li>
            <li> Overall, they are a decent buy for the price</li>
            <li> The one with the 4 clips I don&#x27;t think I will use because to put it high enough on my head  </li>
            <li> First, let me start by saying that I&#x27;ve purchased this hair in the past and gave it a positive review.</li>
            <li> Very minimal shedding as well and the clips are small and grip nicely to the hair.</li>
            <li> so I feel like I&#x27;ve got a broad idea of the quality out there on the market.</li>
            <li> Also, they not as long as the picture, (again no big deal) nor are they curly like in the photo ( not a deal breaker as my hair is poker straight anyhow).</li>
            <li> I was not a happy customer at all because I expected them to be great quality just like the previous ones I ordered.  </li>
            <li> You actually get a decent amount of hair, like im shocked people need more hair the this!</li>
            <li> so if you have super thick then maybe.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something very natural looking and after feeling other types of extensions</li>
            <li> She said the expensive extensions are usually too soft to hold teasing, but these were able to be teased and hold the volume!</li>
            <li> I contacted their stylist that does tutorials on youtube and asked if this was really going to be thick enough for my hair.</li>
            <li> so they are really long</li>
            <li> 16\\&quot; would be so long</li>
            <li> Strange looking.</li>
            <li> Light blonde human hair extensions also usually have lots of darker hair inside as well (it sucks), this set has few darker hair found, or is nearly not noticeable.</li>
            <li> They just seem to be really dry.</li>
            <li> So with just using the ones with 3 clips I put them on in the back and low on my head and just used a few of the 1 clip ones on the side.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty medium to thin though</li>
            <li> My hair comes down to about 3\\&quot; above my breasts.</li>
            <li> in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side</li>
            <li> I know they say they&#x27;re 100% real human hair, but after curling or straightening a couple times, there&#x27;s literally burned black stuff on the tips.</li>
            <li> I would advise washing them, there were some threads hanging from the clips that I had to snip and a few loose hairs on the end of the clip that came out during washing but didn&#x27;t affect the overall quality of the extension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was a little worried it wouldn&#x27;t be enough.</li>
            <li> And they are MUCH lighter than pictured and have some strange (fake looking) copper strands throughout the hair.</li>
            <li> Although the particular set I received was really poor quality</li>
            <li> I can wear these daily, at first they were uncomfortable but after a little while i got use to them!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write a lot of reviews but felt this would help other people</li>
            <li> one other set</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve treated them like I&#x27;ve treated all my other extensions that I&#x27;ve had for seven months, and they&#x27;re already getting on my nerves,</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed as I have purchased several times from this seller who I must say had been very polite and kept open communication.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not worth the money</li>
            <li> Because now I have to throw the amazon hair extensions down the drain</li>
            <li> I think if a company is going to go above and beyond for their customers that has to mean something in todays hectic bottom line world.  </li>
            <li> I spent $100 at Sally&#x27;s for clip in extensions that were too thin and didn&#x27;t have enough hair on them.</li>
            <li> Curling my hair and the extensions together helped a little bit.</li>
            <li> And from the manufacturer&#x27;s site they recommended this specific set for very thick hair, but the amazon site recommends 2 sets.</li>
            <li> Pretty ugly.</li>
            <li> (remember I said my head was small)</li>
            <li> With the extensions in they came past my breast</li>
            <li> Upon receiving the 16\\&quot; ones I was really disappointed and furious because the quality was awfully subpar and in comparison to the longer ones they looked like total junk to be honest.</li>
            <li> really bad stuff don&#x27;t waste your money,I just return it back</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, it just has a lot of artificially colored different hair colors in it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re thick too.</li>
            <li> if not better!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think they even looked like they were from the same company they were so bad.</li>
            <li> not a good color match for me.  </li>
            <li> I had to remove the hair after only having it installed for about a week :(</li>
            <li> I was overall disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> (I also said my hair was thin).  </li>
            <li> bought them for my wedding because I have extremely thin hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s so thin compare to my Luxy hair extensions&lt;</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give them a 5 if the product was poor</li>
            <li> I should also say that I have a very small head and very thin hair.</li>
            <li> Whatever the reason it should not in any way have tangled and shed the way it did,,,,, maybe just a bad batch.. paid a lot of money which went down the drain.</li>
            <li> Having bought a competitors on line and been disappointed I was a little reluctant to get these.</li>
            <li> I bought these extensions feeling worried they would be the wrong color.</li>
            <li> No good extensions!!!</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical and almost bought some cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> However, my last experience was a horrible one.</li>
            <li> I guessed the wrong length</li>
            <li> Luxy hair is so expensive</li>
            <li> so maybe I just got a lousy batch this time around with the shorter ones.  </li>
            <li> The hair tangled in the worst way - It may have been due to using two packs of this color and 1 pack of the 1b.</li>
            <li> It is expensive!</li>
            <li> sooooo tinny ....and clips soooo bad ,,,</li>
            <li> I might&#x27;ve just got bad ones, but I&#x27;d prefer to get them off of the website</li>
            <li> Unable to contact seller!!</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED !!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product - matched my hair perfectly.  I used these for my wedding and my hairstylist, who is used to working on scores of celebrities in Nashville, couldn&#x27;t believe I had purchased these online - she was super impressed.</li>
            <li> not a good color match for me.  But the return process was GREAT!</li>
            <li> I love love love the extensions.</li>
            <li> Never had extensions before but they were so easy to use and they look amazing. They feel great and look great</li>
            <li> be aware that inside the package they say customer re-dyeing not recommended. Here is the question. If it is human hair why is not recommended. I will come up with some update after I will use a new color.</li>
            <li> I bought these extensions feeling worried they would be the wrong color. Too my surprise they were spot on. They give you a lot of extensions for a great price. I spent $100 at Sally&#x27;s for clip in extensions that were too thin and didn&#x27;t have enough hair on them. These came in the mail and were twice the thickness of the Sally&#x27;s extensions plus it is human hair. I saved a lot of money, and they blend in great.</li>
            <li> Everything was exactly what I as looking for. The color was a prefect match. I wanted extensions to add length not volume so one pack worked perfect for me. My natural hair is about to the top of my boobs and with the 16&#x27;-18&#x27; extensions it took its just below my boobs... LOVE them.... I get tons of complements on my hair, they blend flawlessly... Very good quality and the best price!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write a lot of reviews but felt this would help other people so I am writing one. I want to start off by saying that I have never worn extensions didn&#x27;t really know that clip on ones existed until running across a you tube video. I did a lot of research on extensions before buying. I have to say I chose these mostly based on price for 100% real hair. It is expensive! so that being said. I love these! I have not worn them out since I just got them in the mail last night. I should also say that I have a very small head and very thin hair. My hair comes down to about 3\\&quot; above my breasts. I watched a few videos on how to put them in and what was helpful was to tease my hair where they are going to clip in to give them more to grip to. I did that in the back of my head but on the sides where I was just putting the one with 1 clip I did not. The one with the 4 clips I don&#x27;t think I will use because to put it high enough on my head  (remember I said my head was small) I felt like people would be able to see them because I could feel them coming thru my hair (I also said my hair was thin).  So with just using the ones with 3 clips I put them on in the back and low on my head and just used a few of the 1 clip ones on the side. That was all I think my tiny head could handle. I will continue to play with placement and update this later.  The hair was so soft and silky and really matched my hair color. If you have ever wanted to try them I say get these they really are the best priced ones out there. You really get a lot of hair for the money. With the extensions in they came past my breast so they are really long I didn&#x27;t really think 16\\&quot; would be so long but that&#x27;s a bonus in my book you can always cut the hair. If I can figure out how to post a picture I will.</li>
            <li> For the price, these are great. Looks wonderful. I felt like a princess Follow use instructions and you&#x27;ll be good!</li>
            <li> Fast shipment got my package with in a week of ordering. The color was a lot lighter that chestnut brown but I just dyed them with a darker natural henna dye and they came out beautiful. These are the thickest extention I have ever purchased I&#x27;m very happy with them. Very minimal shedding as well and the clips are small and grip nicely to the hair. Great product</li>
            <li> I ordered these with the expectation of them being low quality. My expectations were far surpassed. I have very fine hair that is not long and these blended in perfectly. The quality is great! The clips hold great and the extensions aren&#x27;t heavy like ones I&#x27;ve worn before. I shared a before and after photo after trying them on. This is not &amp;#34;fixed&amp;#34; or trimmed any. This is right out of the package and clipped in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side I can think of is the smell from a preservative used.</li>
            <li> No good extensions!!! Too much money for this kind of thing....sooooo tinny ....and clips soooo bad ,,,really bad stuff don&#x27;t waste your money,I just return it back</li>
            <li> I purchased these extensions specifically because they were listed as being for thicker hair. I have very thick hair and I was a little worried it wouldn&#x27;t be enough. I contacted their stylist that does tutorials on youtube and asked if this was really going to be thick enough for my hair. She assured me they would be. When they arrived I was pleased with the quality of the hair. They need a good trim to even out the ends, but the hair was silky, untangled, and overall looked good. They were thicker at the ends than most other extensions I had looked at, but the set was not thick enough for my hair. These would be fine if you have about the same length hair you are ordering, and just want to add fullness. I wanted to add some length, but because there was such a difference in the thickness of my hair and the extensions it was obvious I had extensions in. Curling my hair and the extensions together helped a little bit. They look the best when I pull them up in a high pony tail and wrap several around my own hair.  The color was a great match, and they are light and pretty comfortable to wear. If your hair&#x27;s density is on the light side these would be fine to add length, medium density would benefit from using close to the same length as your natural hair to add fullness, and high density thick hair will probably find they can&#x27;t use these.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on these both on and off Amazon. And from the manufacturer&#x27;s site they recommended this specific set for very thick hair, but the amazon site recommends 2 sets. Definitely believe the Amazon site. And they are MUCH lighter than pictured and have some strange (fake looking) copper strands throughout the hair. I&#x27;m going to dye them and hope that they come out as well as another reviewer on here.</li>
            <li> I wear clip-in extensions on a daily basis and have tried several different brands. I have tried this specific brand 2 times. I have noticed that they tangle more easily than other brands. They tangle especially a lot after a wash and condition. I tried leave in conditioner and no luck. They just seem to be really dry. The colors are great at first but tend to fade after a bit. They have lasted me about 4-6 months whereas others have lasted for 1-1 1/2 years. Overall, they are a decent buy for the price but I would shop a bit more.</li>
            <li> I have had extensions placed in for six months at salons, I&#x27;ve bought cheaper ones for nights out that haven&#x27;t lasted... so I feel like I&#x27;ve got a broad idea of the quality out there on the market. These are wonderful for the price! I have thicker hair, so I did buy these and one other set so I could cut some layers in and have different lengths. I love them. They match my hair well enough and are super easy and quick to put in. I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas.  She loves the clips.  Perfect color match, and you cannot tell they are extensions.  They do not tangle, and can be curled.</li>
            <li> Most hair extensions I used before are super thin at the bottom, and I had to trim 2-3 inches to get decent thickness. But this one is really well made! Light blonde human hair extensions also usually have lots of darker hair inside as well (it sucks), this set has few darker hair found, or is nearly not noticeable. Recommended!!!</li>
            <li> product came the next day after i ordered very fast shipping!!.&lt;br /&gt;the hair was very soft felt like real hair but i had to return because it wasn&#x27;t the right color for me</li>
            <li> I am a first time buyer of clip in extensions (or any extensions for that matter). I was really skeptical and almost bought some cheaper ones. These were a perfect match to my natural hair color. They feel so much like real hair. My fiance couldn&#x27;t even tell I had them in when he saw me with them for the first time. I would advise washing them, there were some threads hanging from the clips that I had to snip and a few loose hairs on the end of the clip that came out during washing but didn&#x27;t affect the overall quality of the extension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought them for my wedding because I have extremely thin hair. These double the amount of my hair, no exaggeration. I haven&#x27;t had this much hair since I was a kid so I am super happy with them. The price was great too. No Complaints.</li>
            <li> First, let me start by saying that I&#x27;ve purchased this hair in the past and gave it a positive review. However, my last experience was a horrible one. I had to remove the hair after only having it installed for about a week :( I was extremely disappointed as I have purchased several times from this seller who I must say had been very polite and kept open communication. The hair tangled in the worst way - It may have been due to using two packs of this color and 1 pack of the 1b. I normally use two packs of 1b and 1 pack of chestnut. Whatever the reason it should not in any way have tangled and shed the way it did,,,,, maybe just a bad batch.. paid a lot of money which went down the drain. I was going to give it another try but decided not to...Please judge for yourself, you may have a completely different experience than the one I had.  Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I am no stranger to extentions, I have worn them off and one for a while. Having bought a competitors on line and been disappointed I was a little reluctant to get these. I am glad that I changed my mind. They arrived quickly and in great shape, super smooth and soft. Four stars because the color has a bit more red that I wanted (still blended well and look natural). Also, they not as long as the picture, (again no big deal) nor are they curly like in the photo ( not a deal breaker as my hair is poker straight anyhow). I would buy these again, not a bad deal over all.</li>
            <li> Pretty ugly. I don&#x27;t know, it just has a lot of artificially colored different hair colors in it. Strange looking. Does not look natural. Not a good fit for most Caucasian hair.</li>
            <li> I really like these extensions. But if you have thick hair, I advise getting on TressMatch.com and getting more grams than 120. I know they say they&#x27;re 100% real human hair, but after curling or straightening a couple times, there&#x27;s literally burned black stuff on the tips. I might&#x27;ve just got bad ones, but I&#x27;d prefer to get them off of the website</li>
            <li> Oh its so fabulous, i put it on my pony and it makes him look so cute, even after the mishap with the propane heater!</li>
            <li> Fell apart after first attempt to wash. Used gold well products and was very gentle! They just unraviled at the top and all the hair came out. Unable to contact seller!! VERY DISAPPOINTED !! DO NOT BUY!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something very natural looking and after feeling other types of extensions I just wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect especially buying online. I opened the package immediately and to my surprise the extentions felt very natural and healthy looking. I guessed the wrong length but that was my mistake. I will use what I bought for a while and buy more in the future. This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought this product almost two months ago, and the clips are the best I&#x27;ve ever had, but the hair itself honestly doesn&#x27;t do it for me. I&#x27;ve treated them like I&#x27;ve treated all my other extensions that I&#x27;ve had for seven months, and they&#x27;re already getting on my nerves, no matter what I do with them, they are constantly tangling  up. I was overall disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought these extensions to wear for my sister&#x27;s wedding. I had my hair professionally styled. The stylist said they were the best extensions she&#x27;s ever worked with and styled! I think they are cheap enough, but not too cheap. She said the expensive extensions are usually too soft to hold teasing, but these were able to be teased and hold the volume! They also held curl and they looked great all night! I think if you&#x27;re looking for great, semi-cheap extensions, you can&#x27;t goo wrong with these!</li>
            <li> These are just so incredible and so natural (not super shiny - Caucasian hair blends perfectly). They&#x27;re thick too. The color is spot on and it&#x27;s just the right amount of weight in a single set to look completely natural when they&#x27;re in. I layered mine so they blended well with my shoulder length hair. I&#x27;ve never been happier with a set of extensions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought a lot of extensions ranging from cheap to very expensive and these are up there with the very best for a just a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will DEFINITELY be a long-term customer.</li>
            <li> Me encantaron es sedoso el cabello y tal cual el color que deseaba me gusto muchísimo por lo que la recomiendo</li>
            <li> I never bought hair extensions on amazon before&lt;br /&gt;But my opinion is that it&#x27;s not that great&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so thin compare to my Luxy hair extensions&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not thick and the length is so much shorter&lt;br /&gt;Because Luxy hair is so expensive so I thought trying something new&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s worth it getting Luxy hair extension. Because now I have to throw the amazon hair extensions down the drain so it&#x27;s not worth the money</li>
            <li> These are by far the BEST quality extensions I have ever purchased for this price. The wefts are pretty thick, (I still had to double up to match my own hair though) The clips are lightweight and strong. All around they feel amazing and once I had them cut to blend I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Buy these you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> They are great it looks and feels like my real hair I get many compliments that my hair is shiny and soft. I will be ordering more in the near feature!</li>
            <li> These are very nice hair extensions. Color was spot on to my original so I did not have to dye them.  These look great in!</li>
            <li> This is my first time getting extensions. I have compared them to my friends who paid a lot more for hers and these look just as good! if not better! I bought them for volume, so just put an order in for another set but the 20-22 inch! I am excited to try them out! I can wear these daily, at first they were uncomfortable but after a little while i got use to them! Great buy!</li>
            <li> Although the particular set I received was really poor quality I am editing my review because of the exceptional customer service I have since received. I think the company is 5 star all the way but the product I got this time was a 1 star-so for that I give them a 3.  I can&#x27;t give them a 5 if the product was poor so this seems fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally ordered the 20\\&quot; chestnut brown-150g-elite set of extensions and about a month later I ordered the 16-18\\&quot; ones additionally because I absolutely loved the longer ones but wanted some a little shorter to add layers and less thickness.  The elite set are super thick-amazing extensions. Upon receiving the 16\\&quot; ones I was really disappointed and furious because the quality was awfully subpar and in comparison to the longer ones they looked like total junk to be honest. I didn&#x27;t think they even looked like they were from the same company they were so bad. I was not a happy customer at all because I expected them to be great quality just like the previous ones I ordered.  I ended up having numerous communications with one of the owners and he apologized for my issue and told me that they were going to recall all of the chestnut brown 16\\&quot;extensions for inspection.  He also promised me that my satisfaction was important to them and if I wanted to give them another try he would inspect them personally before sending them to me even. My money was refunded and they offered a discount in the future if I wanted to order more.  Based off of the communications I had with them I am still going to recommend them and their products.  I think if a company is going to go above and beyond for their customers that has to mean something in todays hectic bottom line world.  I still say the 20\\&quot; elite set I got are amazing-they are gorgeous so maybe I just got a lousy batch this time around with the shorter ones.  I plan to order again and see if these are better.  So, if you are hesitant to try these-DONT BE....I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them ifI thought they would take advantage of their customers.</li>
            <li> The hair extensions are beautiful. I just love them! they were  just as described. I also got them very quickly.</li>
            <li> For this price, these are amazing. Nice golden chocolate brown color and no shedding or anything. You actually get a decent amount of hair, like im shocked people need more hair the this! My hair is pretty medium to thin though so if you have super thick then maybe. I got 16&amp;#34; ones in the package. They curl and straighten perfectly and dont tangle too easy either. Pleasantly suprised on how great these are.</li>
