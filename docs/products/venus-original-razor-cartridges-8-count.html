            <li>so I don&#x27;t have much to compare them to at this point.</li>
            <li>These work really well.  </li>

            <li> They seemed like they were old razors and definitely not new quality.</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as ones I&#x27;d bought in local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> Does not make legs dry and flakey.</li>
            <li> First cartridge was broken.</li>
            <li> the return window has just closed.  </li>
            <li> Razors as expected and a little cheaper than grocery store.</li>
            <li> These get dull way to quickly for the expensive price tag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure how this happens, but it works.  </li>
            <li> Razors seem a bit small, I&#x27;m used to the 4 blades.</li>
            <li> FYI - if you have any of the post-shower spray to eliminate hard water stains, shoot a stream of that on your disposable razor and store it upright.  </li>
            <li> ive used venus razors for years and this is not a good experience.</li>
            <li> Not a happy customer with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why razor blades are so expensive.  </li>
            <li> really bad shave.</li>

            <li> I only use this brand for years! A blade lasts me a month, no razor rash or nicks. Great product.</li>
            <li> Been using Venus for years and I will NEVER stop</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as ones I&#x27;d bought in local pharmacy. Were these &#x27;seconds&#x27;?</li>
            <li> I use these without exception</li>
            <li> My wife says her legs never felt so soft and I agree.</li>
            <li> These work great and I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> They seemed like they were old razors and definitely not new quality.</li>
            <li> These get dull way to quickly for the expensive price tag.&lt;br /&gt;They do a good job when sharp, but run out too quickly.</li>

            <li> Razors as expected and a little cheaper than grocery store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Venus razors for 14 years so I don&#x27;t have much to compare them to at this point. Always have served the purpose for me. Rarely have cuts or razor burn.</li>
            <li> wonder if these were defective and resold? really bad shave. ive used venus razors for years and this is not a good experience.</li>
            <li> This product is over-priced but my daughter likes it...so I buy them!</li>
            <li> Easy to purchase and not have to fight the long lines at retail stores. Great Price as Well</li>
            <li> Item as described. shipped quickly. Would purchase again. A+</li>
            <li> These work really well.  No nicks!</li>
            <li> Spend the extra $ for the higher quality with more blades. I feel I have to shave so much since it doesn&#x27;t get a nice clean shave. You go through them fast.</li>
            <li> Great price for the same product you can get in any store.</li>
            <li> Came in a timely manner and met expectations.</li>
            <li> Great price for these razors, everything exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> First cartridge was broken. Hoping the rest are not.</li>
            <li> My wife tried both the regular Venus blades, and the Olay version, and prefers the regular Venus.  No nicks, and a smooth shave every time.  FYI - if you have any of the post-shower spray to eliminate hard water stains, shoot a stream of that on your disposable razor and store it upright.  Although she shaves her legs twice a week, we&#x27;ve been getting about 3-4 months out of each razor by using this method.  Not sure how this happens, but it works.  The blades keep shaving like new.</li>
            <li> Great buy, would buy from again</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Just as described.</li>
            <li> I received these quickly. It is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Really great deal.  Razors seem a bit small, I&#x27;m used to the 4 blades. But still a great deal for the price.</li>

            <li> Stocking stuffer for my daughters, they love them.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t cut myself when shaving since middle school... until I bought these razor cartridges.  Three knicks and counting.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite razors.  And this is the best price I could find.</li>
            <li> What can I say.  They work!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and price.</li>
            <li> Great item and would recommend to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Love Amazon Prime and the fast shipping on everything.</li>
            <li> Just as described. What else can you say about razors.</li>
            <li> good blades.  not the greatest, but very good.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why razor blades are so expensive.  But these were a good price.</li>
            <li> These razors are simply the best, simplest and softest blades around and to find them online for less than $20 is a nice find.  I hope it continues.</li>
            <li> Best razor blade out there.  Does not make legs dry and flakey. They remain moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hint: Don&#x27;t keep it in the shower and it will last longer, it will not rust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The wife just loves them.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t work well.  Seems like a knock off and the return window has just closed.  Not a happy customer with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great for shaving legs</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re razors and they work</li>
            <li> The razors came as expected a day early. Very happy.</li>
            <li> Perfectly priced if you can&#x27;t make it to the store.</li>
            <li> Best disposable razor out there!&lt;br /&gt;I get a great close shave.  The razors are flexible and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I love my Venus razors</li>
