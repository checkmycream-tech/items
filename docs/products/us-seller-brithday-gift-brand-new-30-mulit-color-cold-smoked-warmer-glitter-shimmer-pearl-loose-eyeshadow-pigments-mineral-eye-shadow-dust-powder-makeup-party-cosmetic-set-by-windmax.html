            <li> a little goes a long way i just wish each container had the same amount of product</li>
            <li> Some of the glitter was a little open when I recieved it</li>
            <li> When I received these I was partially excited/upset.</li>
            <li> You can even get your brushes wet and make them into eye liner.</li>
            <li> The colors are not vibrant in the least, even using a wet brush I have to apply 5 layers for the color to even show.</li>
            <li> You get a little bit of every color and have a palette like a pro to use for any occasion.</li>
            <li> Glitter is always a little messy</li>
            <li> received only 15 and 2 of them are broken.</li>
            <li> But a little goes along way!</li>

            <li> The shipping was better than I expected. The colors are so pigmented, and worth more than what your actually paying for. Im definitely going to purchase more in the near future because these pigments are a steal.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected! Perfect for my cosmetology needs!</li>
            <li> I was excited to get them because I can Never find a shimmer powder in stores anymore. When I received these I was partially excited/upset. The shimmer ones are amazing, they work great, I love them. BUT, maybe 6-10 out of the 30 are shimmer eyeshadow. The rest are all that body glitter type where if you put it on your eye glitter goes all over your face and if it gets in your eye it stings like hell. More of a &amp;#34;nightclub&amp;#34; type eyeshadow package. But the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> I love it very nice. I love all the colors. And I got me some more for me. I gave it five stars</li>
            <li> Love this, stays on all day</li>
            <li> Was excited until i opened the package and noticed that they all have different amounts in them. The product is good a little goes a long way i just wish each container had the same amount of product vey disappointed</li>
            <li> Loved the colors. Got like four of the same color but other than that good.</li>
            <li> Please  don&#x27;t buy it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I received only 15 and 2 of them are broken.</li>
            <li> You get a little bit of every color and have a palette like a pro to use for any occasion. Fun.</li>
            <li> I think I love them, but I&#x27;m not sure how to open them.</li>
            <li> Great but I did receive 2 of the same kind so four of them were doubled but anyway I just bought this and I like it the price is great for the quality of the product. Some of the glitter was a little open when I recieved it but it came in bags so it wasn&#x27;t a problem</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t like it at all</li>
            <li> the loose shadow are very good but the glittery is like glitter used in coloring or accessories not in makeup</li>
            <li> The colors are so beautiful.and who ever says they don&#x27;t last are crazy! Mine last a really long time. You can even get your brushes wet and make them into eye liner.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors. Buying a second set for my friend.</li>
            <li> In this case, I paid nothing and got nothing in return. The colors are not vibrant in the least, even using a wet brush I have to apply 5 layers for the color to even show. I gave this three stars because I didn&#x27;t expect much, but got even less than that.</li>
            <li> Loved the color  i have on the red and gold...&lt;br /&gt;add eye shadow primer first. use a brush dab on</li>
            <li> Love the colors. Good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, cheap material you have too put so many times for you can see the lines. I have to put a start for it can let me write a review bit it doesn&#x27;t deserve none.</li>
            <li> not what I was excepting</li>
            <li> Color does not less long</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product! Its a amazing product for a cheap price. The colors are gorgeous! I do recommend using an eyeshadow primer though. Because it helps make the colors pop.</li>
            <li> I loved these. Glitter is always a little messy so I do my eyes before my foundation. Only on special occasions though, very pigment especially when used with glitter glue and mac fix+</li>
            <li> I love the shimmer and glitter eyeshadows. Very pigmented and good amount for the price. Will purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> Love the colors and they stay on great! Did not know that it came with actually glitter along with the powder. But a little goes along way!</li>
