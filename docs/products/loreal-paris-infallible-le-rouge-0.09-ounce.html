            <li>This is a great lipstick.  </li>
            <li>INFALLIBLE LE ROUGE LIPCOLOUR HAS great color but will not get again as it dries out her lips.</li>
            <li>Great color, item was on schedule.</li>
            <li>This is a good color to wear to work.</li>
            <li>, this is a good substitute.</li>
            <li>I was excited that I may have found the perfect lipstick!  </li>
            <li>I love this lipstick - it&#x27;s got beautiful dimension to it.  </li>
            <li>I am blond, fair and have the Eternal Rose color.  </li>
            <li>Both rich and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will buy more colors.  </li>
            <li>I love this lipstick.</li>
            <li>And the lasting power is awesome.</li>
            <li>Good quality, great color, especially as a gift for girlfriend, wife.</li>
            <li>I do love the quality, shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not matte, but it is a perfect red, so I&#x27;ll overlook it.</li>
            <li>Overall and for the price, it is a very good lipstick.</li>
            <li>as I would have  liked  and more of an orange-red that real red but still a good color and the lipstick stays on.</li>
            <li>Great color BUT package came already open...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a beautiful bold, red with gold flecks in it.</li>
            <li>In love with Loreal lipstics, color is bright, long lasting, has a good smell, what else to wish??</li>
            <li>These lipsticks are moisturizing and have good pigmentation; however, their lasting power is not as advertised!</li>
            <li>True to color.</li>
            <li>but you can&#x27;t really blame l&#x27;oreal if they don&#x27;t fit your interpretation of the color&#x27;s name.  </li>
            <li>Better of old its the price.</li>
            <li>threw it right in the garbage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it stains just right.</li>
            <li>The price was right</li>
            <li>It is creamy when first applied, and then gets a bit sticky as it is setting.  </li>
            <li>will absolutely buy again!</li>
            <li>It feels a little drying on your lips, but it does not appear anything less than perfect.  </li>
            <li>However, after about an hour this lipstick is ready for the day: I can drink coffee with no smudge on my mug and eat without it coming off.  </li>
            <li>It dried out lips quickly but if you use lip balm then it looks fab!</li>
            <li>This is the only lipstick I have found that really lasts.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re interested, please take a look at my long explanation at [...]</li>
            <li>I use this for everyday and save my Mac for special occasions.</li>

            <li> My more expensive brands do not stay on this long.</li>
            <li> My lips instantly became like rubber.&lt;br /&gt;Extremely shinny and dry and has no creamy texture at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The Maybelline one feels like a lip balm and never feels dry and has spf.  </li>
            <li> I usually use Maybelline Moisture Extreme which is discontinued but can still find on various websites.  </li>
            <li> I sometime wear a little gloss over it so it doesn&#x27;t feel so dry.  </li>
            <li> still it was complete but was a little weird.</li>
            <li> The upper part was broken as it was used before</li>
            <li> This is round #4 wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the lipstick only lasts for an hour, that is if you don&#x27;t touch or lick it for any reason.  </li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> However when I tried the lipstick it was broken. :(</li>

            <li> This is a great lipstick.  It stays on all day (fading slightly)including after meals and does not leave lip stains on glasses.  It feels a little drying on your lips, but it does not appear anything less than perfect.  I sometime wear a little gloss over it so it doesn&#x27;t feel so dry.  I am blond, fair and have the Eternal Rose color.  This is a good color to wear to work. Overall and for the price, it is a very good lipstick. My more expensive brands do not stay on this long.</li>
            <li> This is the only lipstick I have found that really lasts.  It is creamy when first applied, and then gets a bit sticky as it is setting.  However, after about an hour this lipstick is ready for the day: I can drink coffee with no smudge on my mug and eat without it coming off.  I love this lipstick!!!!</li>

            <li> mt wife  said THAT L&#x27;OREAL PARIS INFALLIBLE LE ROUGE LIPCOLOUR HAS great color but will not get again as it dries out her lips.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick - it&#x27;s got beautiful dimension to it.  I got &#x27;Forever Fuchsia&#x27; and &#x27;Enduring Berry&#x27;.  Both rich and beautiful.  They last through drinking beverages and hanging out.  I ate a plate of spaghetti and the lipstick was gone after that.  But that&#x27;s not a big deal.  I love it and will buy more colors.  I read the complaints about the colors - but you can&#x27;t really blame l&#x27;oreal if they don&#x27;t fit your interpretation of the color&#x27;s name.  You can never relay on any manufacturers color names - you have to actually look at the lipstick.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick. I bought Ravishing Red and it&#x27;s a beautiful bold, red with gold flecks in it. And the lasting power is awesome. It lasted all day and night. I reapplied it about once or twice.</li>
            <li> True to color. It dried out lips quickly but if you use lip balm then it looks fab!</li>
            <li> The upper part was broken as it was used before</li>
            <li> The product claims it will last for 10 hours.  I was excited that I may have found the perfect lipstick!  Unfortunately the lipstick only lasts for an hour, that is if you don&#x27;t touch or lick it for any reason.  Next!</li>
            <li> Good quality, great color, especially as a gift for girlfriend, wife. I do love the quality, shipping. Recommend this one</li>
            <li> I tried this lipstick and it was drying.  I usually use Maybelline Moisture Extreme which is discontinued but can still find on various websites.  The Maybelline one feels like a lip balm and never feels dry and has spf.  I thought this lipstick would be hydrating because of the description but turns out its drying.  I would never buy it again. Sorry but us women in the desert need moisture.</li>
            <li> Great color, item was on schedule. However when I tried the lipstick it was broken. :( I still use it but it&#x27;s such a pain.</li>
            <li> I just got this lipstick and tried it on.  My lips instantly became like rubber.&lt;br /&gt;Extremely shinny and dry and has no creamy texture at all.&lt;br /&gt;I threw it right in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT buy this</li>
            <li> In love with Loreal lipstics, color is bright, long lasting, has a good smell, what else to wish?? will absolutely buy again!</li>
            <li> This is round #4 wear it everyday. You will never be with out color it stains just right. this is a must have</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was recommended as a &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; red. It&#x27;s not matte, but it is a perfect red, so I&#x27;ll overlook it.</li>
            <li> Great color BUT package came already open... still it was complete but was a little weird. Better of old its the price.</li>
            <li> not as red as I thought</li>
            <li> I use this lipstick almost every day.  Not quite as creamy as I would have  liked  and more of an orange-red that real red but still a good color and the lipstick stays on.</li>
            <li> The price was right and I like this lipstick if you do not want to spend 20 dollars on Mac Red, this is a good substitute. I use this for everyday and save my Mac for special occasions.</li>
