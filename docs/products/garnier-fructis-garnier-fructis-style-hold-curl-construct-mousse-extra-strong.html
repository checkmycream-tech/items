    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the best mousse for curls out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>The product is perfect</li>
            <li>This product works great</li>
            <li>and I always get a great result with it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for light curls without all the work, this is perfect for you!</li>
            <li>Will never know if this is a good product or not.  </li>
            <li>Good buy just like in store</li>
            <li>I also tried the TIGI Foxy Curls and that also worked great, but felt alittle more sticky  </li>
            <li>, it really re-formed my curls and did great!  </li>
            <li>I tried to return for replacement but you can&#x27;t return it because it&#x27;s hazardous material?</li>
            <li>This product smells wonderful and works very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years now and love it.</li>
            <li>so I should be able to return it.</li>
            <li>Maybe it is more of a styling mousse -</li>
            <li>I used this product today and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I found this product listed under top 10 cheap products for curly haired Latinas.</li>
            <li>However, it is cheap.</li>
            <li>I am not sure that I find the smell of the Garnier hair products very pleasant.</li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair soft yet holds the curl in nicely.  </li>
            <li>Not as much as the one I had before, but it is okay.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product, and cannot live without it!  </li>
            <li>I am extremely picky when it comes to hair products and have tried a lot, and this product is by far the best.</li>
            <li>It really helps my ultra fine hair hold a curl.  </li>
            <li>Garnier products tend to be too heavy for my hair (fine and curly), but the price was really good</li>
            <li>I still have it as back up in an extreme emergency but will do my best not to ever need it.</li>
            <li>works well on my naturally curly, fine hair</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve ever had a problem with any Amazon orders.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t vouch for how healthy the ingredients are for the hair long term, however.</li>
            <li>This stuff is affordable, smells great, curls my lazy waves, and makes my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t put too much or it will cause the hair to feel stringy.</li>
            <li>It tends to weigh my hair down, and doesn&#x27;t work as great as some other brands I&#x27;ve tried, but overall not bad.</li>
            <li>Tried to super glue the nozzle back in place with no luck.  </li>
            <li>While the coverage was good, it totally weighed done my hair and gave me that hard crusty feeling.</li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair and am always looking for products to control the friz and help define the curls.  </li>
            <li>I would not purchase this if you want soft curls.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>But still, even though it was white, I still served it when I invited a few of my favorite employees over for drinks and dessert after the office Christmas party.  </li>
            <li>As any other mousse, it does the work, but there are so many other products out there.</li>
            <li>Well, first, I expected it to be chocolate.  </li>
            <li>Apparently this is an unreturnable item.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel coarse and stiff, not at all smooth and silky like some other products I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product and it was packaged loosely so arrived with the top completely broken off.</li>

            <li> I bought this product and it was packaged loosely so arrived with the top completely broken off.</li>
            <li> this did the job, but it didn&#x27;t last me very long.</li>
            <li> But after both dried my hair felt relatively soft and held the curl, amazed!</li>
            <li> it s not for naturally curly hair unless you don&#x27;t mind that coarse stiff feel.</li>
            <li> I got this in hopes of curling my slightly wavy hair, but it did almost absolutely nothing, except make my hair look slightly shiny.</li>
            <li> Works well and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> But will buy it for less at Walmart next time.</li>
            <li> This tames the fluff and defines the curls.</li>
            <li> However it will make your hair feel hard, so if that is not what you are interested in I suggest not using moose or at least not  a lot of it.</li>
            <li> Everyone scarfed it down with compliments, but personally, I thought it tasted a little...</li>
            <li> and it would take longer than other mousses to settle in.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a couple of years and have not found any other product that pleases me as this does.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair that can be fluffy without any product.</li>
            <li> I just put the mousse into dessert cups, and added a little curl of shaved chocolate, for effect.  </li>
            <li> It arrived to me with a broken lid cover, and the mousse dispenser was broken on its side so it would stand up straight.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair that is hard to style.  </li>
            <li> When the package came, the cover for the mousse had come off and the nozzle was broken.  </li>
            <li> But anyways, you cannot go wrong with this hair mousse.</li>
            <li> Sorry,</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is awful.  </li>

            <li> this did the job, but it didn&#x27;t last me very long. plus the mousse would also fling about (onto my floor, my sink, etc) like every time i would move my hands to crunch it into my hair. and it would take longer than other mousses to settle in. but it worked. i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll get it again though.</li>
            <li> I knew going into this purchase this could be a miss. Garnier products tend to be too heavy for my hair (fine and curly), but the price was really good so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Holy cement batman. While the coverage was good, it totally weighed done my hair and gave me that hard crusty feeling. I still have it as back up in an extreme emergency but will do my best not to ever need it.</li>
            <li> helps with curly hair. Just don&#x27;t put too much or it will cause the hair to feel stringy.</li>
            <li> * Garnier Fructis Style Curl Construct Mousse, 6.80-Ounce  * This product works great, it really re-formed my curls and did great!  * I also tried the TIGI Foxy Curls and that also worked great, but felt alittle more sticky  * But after both dried my hair felt relatively soft and held the curl, amazed!</li>
            <li> This is the best mousse for curls out there. I am extremely picky when it comes to hair products and have tried a lot, and this product is by far the best. I have been using this for years and if I am in a town that does not sell it, I try something else by it does not come close which is why i have to buy from the internet. But anyways, you cannot go wrong with this hair mousse.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, and cannot live without it!  I have thick wavy hair that is hard to style.  This stuff is affordable, smells great, curls my lazy waves, and makes my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years now and love it. Its so simple to use in the morning and I always get a great result with it. If you&#x27;re looking for light curls without all the work, this is perfect for you!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. It arrived to me with a broken lid cover, and the mousse dispenser was broken on its side so it would stand up straight.</li>
            <li> It really helps my ultra fine hair hold a curl.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.  But will buy it for less at Walmart next time.</li>

            <li> Well, first, I expected it to be chocolate.  When you think of mousse, you think chocolate mousse.  But still, even though it was white, I still served it when I invited a few of my favorite employees over for drinks and dessert after the office Christmas party.  I just put the mousse into dessert cups, and added a little curl of shaved chocolate, for effect.  Everyone scarfed it down with compliments, but personally, I thought it tasted a little... I don&#x27;t know... chemically?  Sorry, but I don&#x27;t recommend this dessert.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair soft yet holds the curl in nicely.  I have been using it for a couple of years and have not found any other product that pleases me as this does.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and it was packaged loosely so arrived with the top completely broken off. I tried to return for replacement but you can&#x27;t return it because it&#x27;s hazardous material? Whatever, they sent it to me so I should be able to return it. Take my advice and buy elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I am not sure that I find the smell of the Garnier hair products very pleasant. As any other mousse, it does the work, but there are so many other products out there. However, it is cheap.</li>
            <li> I got this in hopes of curling my slightly wavy hair, but it did almost absolutely nothing, except make my hair look slightly shiny. It is also sticky.</li>
            <li> This product smells wonderful and works very well. However it will make your hair feel hard, so if that is not what you are interested in I suggest not using moose or at least not  a lot of it.</li>
            <li> The product is perfect I think but I can&#x27;t even use it because the nozzle broke during shipping.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair and am always looking for products to control the friz and help define the curls.  This product is awful.  It makes my hair feel coarse and stiff, not at all smooth and silky like some other products I have tried.  It also tends to straighten my hair instead of making it curl.  I have tried scrunching it ove and over as it dries, but no go.  I would not purchase this if you want soft curls.  Maybe it is more of a styling mousse - it s not for naturally curly hair unless you don&#x27;t mind that coarse stiff feel.</li>
            <li> It tends to weigh my hair down, and doesn&#x27;t work as great as some other brands I&#x27;ve tried, but overall not bad.</li>
            <li> I found this product listed under top 10 cheap products for curly haired Latinas. I used this product today and I love it.  My curl lasted all day without frizz.  My hair felt soft to the touch.  I have a 3B/3C curl.  I plan to get this product in bulk.  I can&#x27;t vouch for how healthy the ingredients are for the hair long term, however.</li>
            <li> Works well and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair that can be fluffy without any product. This tames the fluff and defines the curls.</li>
            <li> Not as much as the one I had before, but it is okay.</li>
            <li> works well on my naturally curly, fine hair</li>
            <li> Good buy just like in store</li>
