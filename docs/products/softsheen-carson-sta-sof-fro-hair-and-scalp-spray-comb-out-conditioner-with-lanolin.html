            <li>I use to use Sta-Sof-Fro in the 70&#x27;s when natural hair and afros were really popular.  </li>
            <li>Good for short waxy hair too</li>
            <li>This product is a good daily conditioning spray.  </li>
            <li>but it gets dry ,,, after spraying this in his hair he is good to go..</li>

            <li>it just is plain great</li>
            <li>My hair is like a baby fro right now so as my hair grows out</li>
            <li>this product is great for hair that is to tough to handle or needs a lot of moisture to keep the growth up or smooth through out the day.</li>
            <li>liked it so much I decided to spray my entire hair.  </li>
            <li>it keeps my afro soft and easy to comb.</li>
            <li>Adds moisture to my hair and makes it soft and easy to comb.</li>
            <li>I wear a natural afro so it works fine by itself.</li>
            <li>Besides the smell I gotta say this product makes my hair so soft and smooth</li>
            <li>great for going back to natural hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li>It made it soft and tangle free.  </li>
            <li>It was moisturized, soft and remained that way for the whole day!!</li>
            <li>I wouldnt use this product for straight styles.    </li>
            <li>In fact it seemed to \\&quot;soak\\&quot; into my hair and made it really pliable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has really made me stop dreading dealing with my hair.</li>
            <li>I noticed that no matter how much moisturizers and oil</li>
            <li>I used this product because I had some damage from too much protein from another product.  </li>
            <li>It  really helped my hair alot.  </li>
            <li>If you live somewhere hot this thing could burn your hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has cut combing through my hair in half and it is great to use with other products because it helps deliver the other prodyuts to more parts of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow, I saw a difference the first day</li>
            <li>It is the main product in my hair care arsenal.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m happy to say I was wrong.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looking allover the place for it and finally realized it was right in my front yard on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I use Sta-Sof-Fro as a daily use product each morning and Pro-Line Comb-Thru Softener once a week as my leave in conditioner after I wash my hair right before I plait and roll my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair was completely fried !</li>
            <li>If you are new to natural hair care or are struggling with natural hair care woes these are the two products you have to have.</li>
            <li>Wow, just Wow, the answer to my prayers.  </li>
            <li>My aunt who is a beautician told me to get this product since I was going from permed hair to natural</li>
            <li>So I decided to try it since I tried everything else and was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked.  </li>
            <li>If you are rocking any type of natural hair style</li>
            <li>It keeps my curls soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>It was super extra dry, frizzy, and severly tangled.  </li>
            <li>So I decided to start wearing my natural hair (after doing the big chop and then wearing weaves for a while).  </li>
            <li>but if you can&#x27;t find one in your neighborhood like I can then 7 dollars is not to much to pay to help heal your dry scalp and hair, but if you can get it for a lesser price...</li>
            <li>I tried a mild texturizer and it worked for a few weeks, but because of how coarse my hair is I reverted to the same result.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair that is very dry.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I put in my hair, it would always end up very dry by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit of the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent lots of money on those curl enhancer creams and have yet to find one that moisturize my hair.  </li>
            <li> A few weeks ago, I picked up this stuff as a last resort not really expecting it to do anything it promised.</li>
            <li> This was largely due to the fact that as I picked or combed my hair, it was breaking even when wet.</li>
            <li> - I have a lot of hair and will probably use it every other day or every  day maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is just as I expected which I like, but remember little is needed</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I discovered  my only complaint -</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair, dry, and spay it in.</li>
            <li> Breakage and dry ends are a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> My only compliant is the pump on the bottle is a little hard to use.</li>
            <li> This stuff should be taken as an insult to any black person because the perfume they chose to give it scent is like a 70s Superfly throwback.</li>
            <li> , it also became a little softer too.</li>
            <li> It adds a little curl to it as well.  </li>
            <li> This spray did wonders for my dried out hair.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s tough to cover the hair in the back because the bottle gets slippey and pump is hard to push down.  </li>
            <li> Need something from the past to help improve the texture of my grandson&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I had used this product in the past</li>
            <li> It is difficult to get a grip on the pump and when you have long, bushy hair</li>
            <li> She is of mixed ethnicity with other than manageable hair at times:(</li>
            <li> Seriously</li>
            <li> the spray bottle is poorly designed.  </li>
            <li> Please do not spend your money on those expensive moisture products unless you have money to burn.  </li>
            <li> I was desperate.  </li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and now I hate</li>

            <li> this product is great for hair that is to tough to handle or needs a lot of moisture to keep the growth up or smooth through out the day.This product has no defects,other than it&#x27;s flammable!This was created in the 80&#x27;s or 90&#x27;s when the jerry curls were in style,but now this product will always be a great product and generate healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail it came earlier than expected so that&#x27;s a plus. I have an afro I sprayed some in my hair and I noticed it had a sheen, it also became a little softer too. My hair is like a baby fro right now so as my hair grows out I&#x27;ll see if it moisturizes better on longer hair opposed to my baby fro.</li>
            <li> This product is great in the summer if you have braids or a natural. I wouldnt use this product for straight styles.    This product definitely keeps my hair moisturized and the best thing is its light.    This is definitely a staple for me.</li>
            <li> Besides the smell I gotta say this product makes my hair so soft and smooth</li>
            <li> I started growing my hair out almost two years ago, but after year one, I noticed that my hair wasn&#x27;t getting any longer. This was largely due to the fact that as I picked or combed my hair, it was breaking even when wet. I tried a mild texturizer and it worked for a few weeks, but because of how coarse my hair is I reverted to the same result. Plus, the texturizer weakened my hair it seems. A few weeks ago, I picked up this stuff as a last resort not really expecting it to do anything it promised. Well, I&#x27;m happy to say I was wrong.     I noticed a change after only two days of using this stuff. My hair was noticeably softer and when I picked it out, my hair didn&#x27;t break or fall out. Now, this stuff doesn&#x27;t do anything for styling or holding hair styles in place so a separate gel may be needed. I wear a natural afro so it works fine by itself. I usually wash my hair, dry, and spay it in. After, I simply pick out my hair and go. Another really awesome part is that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or messy. I can run my hand through my hair without any leftover.     Again great product. Low cost. Does what it says.</li>
            <li> just fine - purchased before</li>
            <li> Someone gave me a 16 oz bottle of this stuff.  I had it for a while until I noticed it and decided to spray some of it on my hair. Wow, just Wow, the answer to my prayers.  The effects were immediate, my bone-dry hair suddenly became wavy with incredible shine.  I thought it was going to be drippy so I only sprayed the front portion of my hair to test it out.  It was not drippy AT ALL.  In fact it seemed to \\&quot;soak\\&quot; into my hair and made it really pliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so much I decided to spray my entire hair.  That&#x27;s when I discovered  my only complaint - the spray bottle is poorly designed.  It is difficult to get a grip on the pump and when you have long, bushy hair it&#x27;s tough to cover the hair in the back because the bottle gets slippey and pump is hard to push down.  This product should be in a bottle like Windex bottle, the ones that have hand pumps instead of index finger pumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has cut combing through my hair in half and it is great to use with other products because it helps deliver the other prodyuts to more parts of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am just thrilled at how my hair waves up, shines like a mirror, feels soft to the touch and bounces like a bungee cord. I just ordered three 16-oz bottles - I have a lot of hair and will probably use it every other day or every  day maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has really made me stop dreading dealing with my hair.</li>
            <li> I use to use Sta-Sof-Fro in the 70&#x27;s when natural hair and afros were really popular.  I&#x27;ve looking allover the place for it and finally realized it was right in my front yard on Amazon.  I love this stuff.  I have natural hair that is very dry.

            <li> This works great for natural hair! Nice moisturizer and illuminates breakage.</li>
            <li> My aunt who is a beautician told me to get this product since I was going from permed hair to natural and I needed something that would add moisture and strengthen my hair.  Wow, I saw a difference the first day and now I hate it took me a month to buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to a local Beauty supply place and got a 16oz bottle for 5 dollars but if you can&#x27;t find one in your neighborhood like I can then 7 dollars is not to much to pay to help heal your dry scalp and hair, but if you can get it for a lesser price...I say do that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When your hair has moisture it will grown faster and become healthier...I know I can&#x27;t wait!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever you choose your hair will thank you for it!</li>
            <li> This is just as I expected which I like, but remember little is needed cause it tends to be kind of oily.</li>
            <li> great for going back to natural hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li> So I decided to start wearing my natural hair (after doing the big chop and then wearing weaves for a while).  I have afro textured hair (hair type 4c).  I noticed that no matter how much moisturizers and oil I put in my hair, it would always end up very dry by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I remembered that my dad always used Sta Sof Fro on his hair which always looked moisturized and had a nice sheen.  So I decided to try it since I tried everything else and was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked.  It was moisturized, soft and remained that way for the whole day!! I also noticed that my hair wasn&#x27;t falling out anymore either (which was a huge plus).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution. You only need a little bit of the product.  I have a big afro and I only use 3 squarts a day in the morning.</li>
            <li> This stuff should be taken as an insult to any black person because the perfume they chose to give it scent is like a 70s Superfly throwback. I smelled it, tried it once, got no satisfaction in terms of conditioning, and threw it out.</li>
            <li> This product is an Afro saver. It is the main product in my hair care arsenal. it keeps my afro soft and easy to comb. Breakage and dry ends are a thing of the past. If you are rocking any type of natural hair style this is a product you don&#x27;t want to be without. I use Sta-Sof-Fro as a daily use product each morning and Pro-Line Comb-Thru Softener once a week as my leave in conditioner after I wash my hair right before I plait and roll my hair. If you are new to natural hair care or are struggling with natural hair care woes these are the two products you have to have. If you can only get your hands on one product then go with the Sta-Sof-Fro!!!! you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Need something from the past to help improve the texture of my grandson&#x27;s hair. He wanted to ware an afro hair was course to the touch. Sta-Sof-Fro has added softness. Would recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Been using it since I was a kid. Good for short waxy hair too</li>
            <li> This product has been out for decades and it is still the best for those who want to sport their natural hair.</li>
            <li> It keeps my curls soft and manageable.  There is no residue like some products.  I love Soft Sheen.</li>

            <li> Perfect spray for the afro, had not seen this since I was a kid. Not too greasy, and offers great shine.</li>
            <li> This spray did wonders for my dried out hair.  It made it soft and tangle free.  I used this product because I had some damage from too much protein from another product.  My hair was completely fried ! It was super extra dry, frizzy, and severly tangled.  I had used this product in the past so I went back to it.  I was desperate.  It  really helped my hair alot.  It soothed my scalp and  moisturized and smoothed my hair.  My only compliant is the pump on the bottle is a little hard to use. I hope they fix that. Other than that this is an awesome product!</li>

            <li> I wanted something all nature for my hair. I bought this because I have an afro. I never used it properly and never will. If you live somewhere hot this thing could burn your hair. It flammable</li>
