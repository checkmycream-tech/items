            <li>This is a great value and great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very effective and doesn&#x27;t burn or cause discomfort in any way.</li>
            <li>This is not a replacement for a good ENT.</li>
            <li>At end somebody works thinking good in the well being of all.  </li>
            <li>It does make your mouth smell good.  </li>
            <li>This product worked excellent from the first time my husband used it, and is doing great ever since.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is truly amazing.  </li>
            <li>It honestly did the trick.</li>
            <li>It is a nice kit for starters I would recommed it.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels fresher, more mint favor would be nice.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so much more confident.  </li>
            <li>In short, they are excellent products, definitively recommend.</li>
            <li>I do, however, like the Breath rx tounge scraper better, so I tend to use that</li>
            <li>I also love the throat sprayer and tongue drops for on-the-go use.</li>
            <li>use as directed it treats halitosis  much better than anything out there.  </li>
            <li>Me and my wife have been able to kiss and talk close looking into each others eyes with confidence</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re all I keep in my handbag now for when I want to make sure my breath isn&#x27;t offensive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, the price was right</li>
            <li>This particular kit comes with everything you&#x27;ll need and all for a great price.</li>
            <li>I actually own Breath Rx as well and while I did like it alot, I feel that this product takes a more natural approach and gets to the root of the problem and works better throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I do enjoy the lozenges though.</li>
            <li>Overall, it works great.</li>
            <li>good it feels to speak even whisper mouth-to-ear confidently, and not see folk step back from me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But Therabreath products by Dr. Katz are defintely the best I&#x27;ve ever tried, or rather, the only things that really have helped me with this problem.</li>
            <li>In three days I can see my best results, tongue completely clean and taking back its real color.</li>
            <li>But toothpaste makes your teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>Really clean.</li>
            <li>like I hadn&#x27;t brush my teeth are clean my mouth in days.</li>
            <li>Expected great results.</li>
            <li>Even my coworkers have complimented me on how bright and white my teeth look.</li>
            <li>I would only have good breath for minutes after brushing it or eating a mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Taste is not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>The recommendation to spit out and rinse with new is probably just a ploy to use more mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had fresh breath before...</li>
            <li>But after one application, she was fresh.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I found some at Walgreens that was on sale while waiting for my next supply of two bottles to come in :)</li>
            <li>Nothing minty or anything...just a pure clean feeling.</li>
            <li>The starter kit is the best deal because it has mints and gum and a little thingy to spray in the back of your mouth to kill the odors as well as toothpaste and mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>Really works!  </li>
            <li>the first test would be my first meal..</li>
            <li>I have only used the toothpaste and the mouthwash so far, but my mouth already tastes so much better!</li>
            <li>Believe me when I say that this product really works.  </li>
            <li>Someone in my family has halitosis and after struggling with it now for a while, it is under control thanks to Thera Breath.  </li>
            <li>Thanks and thank you so much...</li>
            <li>Thanks Dr. Katz!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw</li>
            <li>very helpful product.</li>
            <li>and thats how I really got to see how well it worked...</li>
            <li>So now the real test, we did it at night....</li>
            <li>Was very excited from previous reviews.  </li>
            <li>My breath is fresh all day long.  </li>
            <li>no matter how much I scraped it off or how much I brushed my teeth.</li>
            <li>still pink and my breath smelled fresh despite the food.</li>
            <li>The starter kit has the basic things, but I also purchased the Therabreath Plus Sinus and Nasal Spray, wich is not included in the kit and is very helpful as it kills bacteria lodged in the space between the back of the nose and throat.</li>
            <li>if you want to think ahead when ordering, just know that the mouthwash doesn&#x27;t last as long as the toothpaste does, and you really do want to use them together.  </li>
            <li>My tongue was completely pink and had this very \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;The breath mints, by the way, are different as far as breath mints go, but I like them a lot.  </li>
            <li>It was fresh all day long and stayed pink all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Between the consistent regiment of this, neti rinses and drinking water or green tea throughout the day, my breath has improved.&lt;br</li>
            <li>her breath was completely fresh for the rest of the night (Usually she would have a hint of \\&quot;that smell\\&quot; even over the mint or toothbrush...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried all kind of medicinal and natural products to fight bad breath caused by post nasal drip and the anaerobic bacteria, such as antibiotics, nasal sprays, mouth washes, etc.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> not even a little.</li>
            <li> but if you just have regular old bad breath, like I did...or a bacteria problem like we did...</li>
            <li> Don&#x60;t waste you money in it.</li>
            <li> Missing the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I was experiencing bad breath due to sinus problems and this kit took care of it completely!  </li>
            <li> Man, I&#x27;m not sure how to write this with out it sounding like I got paid to do it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it works when you have legitimate problems..</li>
            <li> I would always have that white crap on the back of my tongue</li>
            <li> I was getting over a bad sinus infection and had developed tonsil stones.</li>
            <li> If you want to use the rinse as an usually rinse, buy it, but if you want to solve a bad breath problem don&#x60;t use it, because the use publicity to envolves people, but this dosen&#x60;t job properly.</li>
            <li> It tastes terrible and the flavor doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> No more sores!!  </li>
            <li> No it didn&#x27;t meet my expectation a waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> I have never really had a problem with bad breath or worried about it until a couple months ago.</li>

            <li> Refills quite expensive.</li>
            <li> Very expensive for quality and quanity of product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t worry about bad breath anymore because I know it works.  </li>
            <li> I went to the ENT and he gave me some nasal sprays that did nothing for the bad breath problem.</li>
            <li> I havent worried about bad breath since.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Believe me when I say that this product really works.  I don&#x27;t worry about bad breath anymore because I know it works.  Someone in my family has halitosis and after struggling with it now for a while, it is under control thanks to Thera Breath.  The starter kit is the best deal because it has mints and gum and a little thingy to spray in the back of your mouth to kill the odors as well as toothpaste and mouthwash.  Also, helps control tonsil stones.</li>
            <li> I have only used the toothpaste and the mouthwash so far, but my mouth already tastes so much better! I have Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome and I will definitely keep using these products.</li>
            <li> Sick with Lupus, for over 30+ yrs, yup that&#x27;s 30+ yrs of bad breath, I won&#x27;t be refilling all the other junk that comes with the starter kit, but I will be making the lifelong investment in the special Toothpaste and special Oral Rinse. The Taste is not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;How good it feels to speak even whisper mouth-to-ear confidently, and not see folk step back from me.&lt;br /&gt;Get it! You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> This is a great value and great product. Follow the directions and your symptoms can be assuaged. This is not a replacement for a good ENT.</li>
            <li> I just bought it, so I can not say if it works. But toothpaste makes your teeth feel clean. Really clean.</li>
            <li> This has helped with my bad breath tremendously, which stems from post nasal drip. Between the consistent regiment of this, neti rinses and drinking water or green tea throughout the day, my breath has improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rinse with the same mouthwash though for both rinsing in the mouth and gargling. The recommendation to spit out and rinse with new is probably just a ploy to use more mouthwash. This stuff is way too expensive to use a lot of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knocking off a star for the gum. It tastes terrible and the flavor doesn&#x27;t last long at all. I do enjoy the lozenges though.</li>
            <li> I have never really had a problem with bad breath or worried about it until a couple months ago. I was getting over a bad sinus infection and had developed tonsil stones. It was awful. I went to the ENT and he gave me some nasal sprays that did nothing for the bad breath problem. I was at the end of my rope. I was going to be seeing my girlfriend in 3 days and was really insecure about the breath problem. I did a little searching and found Thera Breath. It honestly did the trick. I havent worried about bad breath since.</li>
            <li> Not great.  Expected great results. Was very excited from previous reviews.  Very expensive for quality and quanity of product.</li>
            <li> This product worked excellent from the first time my husband used it, and is doing great ever since.</li>
            <li> My son has struggled with bad breath.  Using the TheraBreath products has done the trick!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Really works!  In three days I can see my best results, tongue completely clean and taking back its real color. No more sores!!  At end somebody works thinking good in the well being of all.  Thanks and thank you so much...</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  Makes my breath taste like nothing.  I used to suck mints all day, especially when I was talking with people.  Now, I don&#x27;t need them at all.  My breath is fresh all day long.  It is truly amazing.  You must try this if you have any breath problems.  It&#x27;s changed my life.  I&#x27;m so much more confident.  Thanks Dr. Katz!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw, I have only used the tongue cleaner, toothpaste and mouthwash from this pack.  But that&#x27;s all I needed.  I might try the other items as well, but those three were enough to do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommend!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, the price was right and I had to try it the only thing is you have to keep it up like twice a day for life. I don&#x27;t have the time and patience to carry this box with me to work. It does make your mouth smell good.  Refills quite expensive.</li>
            <li> I suffer from chronic sinusitis and I&#x27;ve tried all kind of medicinal and natural products to fight bad breath caused by post nasal drip and the anaerobic bacteria, such as antibiotics, nasal sprays, mouth washes, etc. But Therabreath products by Dr. Katz are defintely the best I&#x27;ve ever tried, or rather, the only things that really have helped me with this problem. The starter kit has the basic things, but I also purchased the Therabreath Plus Sinus and Nasal Spray, wich is not included in the kit and is very helpful as it kills bacteria lodged in the space between the back of the nose and throat. They don&#x27;t leave your mouth with spearmint tasting and smelling, it just leaves it with no smell. In short, they are excellent products, definitively recommend.</li>
            <li> very helpful product.</li>
            <li> I love it! It&#x27;s very effective and doesn&#x27;t burn or cause discomfort in any way. This particular kit comes with everything you&#x27;ll need and all for a great price. I actually own Breath Rx as well and while I did like it alot, I feel that this product takes a more natural approach and gets to the root of the problem and works better throughout the day. I do, however, like the Breath rx tounge scraper better, so I tend to use that instead of the one included in this kit. I also love the throat sprayer and tongue drops for on-the-go use. Overall, it works great.</li>
            <li> I have tried this starter kit for about a month, and I can see a difference. Even my coworkers have complimented me on how bright and white my teeth look.</li>
            <li> use as directed it treats halitosis  much better than anything out there.  seems to be a longer term  solution than others.&lt;br /&gt;will buy again.</li>
            <li> It Doesn&#x60;t does the job. Don&#x60;t waste you money in it. If you want to use the rinse as an usually rinse, buy it, but if you want to solve a bad breath problem don&#x60;t use it, because the use publicity to envolves people, but this dosen&#x60;t job properly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months, and it hasn&#x27;t remedied my halitosis. It might work for some issues, but not for tonsil stones.</li>
            <li> Man, I&#x27;m not sure how to write this with out it sounding like I got paid to do it. I&#x27;m so impressed with this stuff. I&#x27;ve had chronic bad breath for awhile...my wife as well. I would always have that white crap on the back of my tongue no matter how much I scraped it off or how much I brushed my teeth. I would only have good breath for minutes after brushing it or eating a mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this stuff and HOLY CRAP!!!!! My tongue was completely pink and had this very \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling. Nothing minty or anything...just a pure clean feeling. I was instantly impressed, but not sold. I&#x27;ve had fresh breath before...the first test would be my first meal..after I eat, that fungus on my tongue would always come back. So I ate something, checked.....NOPE...still pink and my breath smelled fresh despite the food. It was fresh all day long and stayed pink all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife was so impressed she tried it and thats how I really got to see how well it worked...her breath was completely fresh for the rest of the night (Usually she would have a hint of \\&quot;that smell\\&quot; even over the mint or toothbrush...we both did) But after one application, she was fresh. So now the real test, we did it at night....when we woke up...I SWEAR, noooooo morning breath....not even a little. UN-FREAKING-BELIEVABLE product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve told everyone about this stuff...I&#x27;m sold for life. I&#x27;m not sure how it works when you have legitimate problems..like this tonsil stone stuff I&#x27;m reading....but if you just have regular old bad breath, like I did...or a bacteria problem like we did...man...this stuff knocks it out like its nothing. Me and my wife have been able to kiss and talk close looking into each others eyes with confidence and I&#x27;m 100% a happy customer!</li>
            <li> This stuff totally works.  I was experiencing bad breath due to sinus problems and this kit took care of it completely!  I&#x27;ve already been through one bottle of the mouthwash and still have a lot of the toothpaste left, so if you want to think ahead when ordering, just know that the mouthwash doesn&#x27;t last as long as the toothpaste does, and you really do want to use them together.  Fortunately, I found some at Walgreens that was on sale while waiting for my next supply of two bottles to come in :)&lt;br /&gt;The breath mints, by the way, are different as far as breath mints go, but I like them a lot.  They&#x27;re all I keep in my handbag now for when I want to make sure my breath isn&#x27;t offensive.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels fresher, more mint favor would be nice. You have a stronger mint which I&#x27;m going to try. It is a nice kit for starters I would recommed it.</li>
            <li> No it didn&#x27;t meet my expectation a waste of money!!! About the 7day I felt like I hadn&#x27;t brush my teeth are clean my mouth in days.</li>
            <li> Missing the toothpaste. Not worth the cost to return.</li>
            <li> Makes my throat hurt terribly and I didn&#x27;t notice anything special other then the terrible taste, it needs more minty flavor. Feels like you are gargling saliva.</li>
            <li> I still have tonsil stones!  I have used this product for over a month now.  I don&#x27;t think it works like the label says it does!</li>
