            <li>It looks more narrow than it is in the photo.</li>
            <li>A BETTER WAY TO ORGANIZE WHAT IS ON A SMALL BATHROOM COUNTER TOP.&lt;br</li>
            <li>events, as it clearly shows the construction techniques used to build the transceiver.</li>
            <li>The lid aligns completely with the box -</li>
            <li>When I opened the box I noticed a big crack on one corner, it looks like it was dropped and shattered from the inside, also has a scratch right next to it.</li>

            <li> Much smaller than I expected but very well made sturdy little box.</li>
            <li> I should be careful next time in reading measurements as well, item is tiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend that either Amazon or US Acrylic add a little more padding to the packaging because from reading through these reviews it seems as though lots of these fail to arrive in one piece.</li>
            <li> and it fits next to other storage containers well.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s way smaller than I expected!!!</li>
            <li> It had a small nick in the edge, center, back, bottom.  </li>
            <li> I needed something substantially larger for a small home business to keep the rain/weather out.</li>
            <li> This is just an average acrylic box.</li>
            <li> It is a fairly heavy box and the lid is attatched so it just lifts up.</li>
            <li> Ended up buying a few to use in bedrooms and baths.</li>
            <li> I sadly sent them back for a refund.</li>
            <li> so, this makes the lid a bit awkward to lift and open.</li>
            <li> The box arrived with one of the two hinge pieces broken off, so the lid wouldn&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
            <li> This item arrived with the lid hinge broken.</li>
            <li> Two of the boxes were broken - not useable.</li>
            <li> It was expensive.  </li>
            <li> Box came broken :(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>

            <li> I really like the quality of the product.  It is very sturdy and is perfect for what I was looking for.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone and I will be ordering more product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an amateur radio operator who builds their own equipment. Oddly, this box is perfect for &amp;#34;show-and-tell&amp;#34; events, as it clearly shows the construction techniques used to build the transceiver. For me, this was a perfect box.</li>
            <li> I purchased this box for a project I am working on. It is just what I needed. It is great because the lid is attached and it is put together beautifully. I would recommend this for anyone looking for an acrylic box with a hinged lid.</li>
            <li> Good storage box, but you are better off picking it up a Bed Bath and&lt;br /&gt;Beyond. It&#x27;s easier in person picking out the right size.</li>
            <li> The box is great. As pictured and looks really good. No problem with packaging and delivery. Perfect for storing my wife&#x27;s cosmetic accessories.</li>
            <li> Box came broken :( If not broken it would be perfect</li>
            <li> I love this acrylic multiuse box! The first one I ordered arrived broken, I contacted the seller and Amazon sent me a replacement right away! I used mine to out organic Shea butter on my bathroom sink (which I use as moisturizer) and now it&#x27;s visible, keeps it from melting and it&#x27;s just a beauty to have such a sturdy product that makes any decor look amazing!</li>
            <li> I liked these little boxes.  However they were shipped without any protection and the back outside hinge tabs on both boxes broke off making them unusable.  I sadly sent them back for a refund.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box I noticed a big crack on one corner, it looks like it was dropped and shattered from the inside, also has a scratch right next to it. Plus it&#x27;s way smaller than I expected!!! Find something else!</li>
            <li> A BETTER WAY TO ORGANIZE WHAT IS ON A SMALL BATHROOM COUNTER TOP.&lt;br /&gt;YOU CAN SEE WHAT IS INSIDE AND ON TOP.&lt;br /&gt;WELL WORTH THE MONEY.&lt;br /&gt;I SURE YOU WILL AGREE WHEN YOU PURCHASE IT!!! BUY IT!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mickeyitaly3@aol.com</li>
            <li> Great quality, just as described. Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I really like this...nice size and it fits next to other storage containers well.</li>
            <li> Wish i can return this product, plastic looks cheap and flimsy. Looks like an item from a dollar store. I should be careful next time in reading measurements as well, item is tiny.</li>
            <li> They arrived well wrapped and very quickly.  Perfect for what I used them for</li>
            <li> Great service and product was very good!</li>
            <li> The product is good and looks nice. Although, it would be better if slightly larger sizes were offered with more depth.</li>
            <li> These boxes are absolutely perfect for storing small items (e.g., jewelry, dig. camera implements, etc.), they fit almost anywhere, AND stack nicely.  They are very-well made; this is my THIRD order for more!!!</li>
            <li> Love it - compact, simple and beautiful</li>
            <li> The product was as good as described but I ordered two boxes and the hinge was borken upon arrival, hence returned it</li>
            <li> Love this for make-up and brushes and frequently worn jewelry. Keeps contents clean and the box itself is easy to keep clean. Nice to be able to organize &amp;#34;things&amp;#34; and see what&#x27;s inside. Lid opens/closes easily and securely. Ended up buying a few to use in bedrooms and baths.</li>
            <li> Great quality, the acrylic has a good solid feel to it and the lid rests tightly.  I used this to make a decortive trinket box, would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I wanted to disp&#x60;lay my &amp;#34;miniatures&amp;#34; from Bolivia.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted, nice construction, great item... thank you!</li>
            <li> If you love the real thick Acrylic assemblies like I do, this is not it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still very good quality and received without a scratch, just not *unbendable* like what I seek for my collections.&lt;br /&gt;Had to add my own clear rubber feet...</li>
            <li> This is a strong thicker nice weight very clear box that&#x27;s great for keeping the little things dust free and that you have to see.</li>
            <li> Good quality, wish the price point was a bit lower....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would love to see this in other sizes too</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected, but nice, thick acrylic that looks like it will last. The hinge works and does not get in the way.</li>
            <li> I HAVE TWO OF THESE AND REALLLLY LIKE THEM. I CAN SEE THE JEWELERY I&#x27;M LOOKING FOR AND IT DOESN&#x27;T GET DUSYT!!</li>
            <li> These are great- I actually use them for craft projects. I would be interested in seeing other shapes and potentially colors in them.</li>
            <li> Awesome acrylic case for my PCB projects! Price is OK as well. Acrylic is thick and does not scratch too easily.</li>
            <li> Great for those small items.  Nice looking box; a little pricey but i&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> These boxes are a very nice quality and good clear acrylic!  They were exactly what I wanted and look very handsome.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  It was by no means \\&quot;large\\&quot;.  It was a nice clear small box to hold a few trinkets or to use to present a special, small gift.  It was expensive.  It had a small nick in the edge, center, back, bottom.  I had to give it away.  I needed something substantially larger for a small home business to keep the rain/weather out.</li>
            <li> Absolutely what I wanted. Perfect.</li>
            <li> It looks more narrow than it is in the photo.</li>
            <li> One of the two boxes has a problem with the top not staying on.......Just received a return label, so one of them is on its way back for a refund</li>
            <li> This is a great looking, sturdy box. I put some strategically placed holes in the top and my young tarantula likes his new digs!</li>
            <li> I bought 4 of these to actually use for keeping spare change in and also alternative uses for an acrylic aquarium I have.  It works for the purpose...thanks.</li>
            <li> I love the look of this box, it is very sturdy and the plastic does not bend! It is crystal clear and very sleek but a little pricy if you are trying to organize a lot.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I expected but very well made sturdy little box.</li>
