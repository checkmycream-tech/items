            <li>$ PERFECT, THANKS</li>
            <li>My wife wasn&#x27;t thrilled at all with your brushes.</li>
            <li>I think they are for wigs not FLESH of any kind.  </li>
            <li>These are by far the best de-tangler brushes I have ever had.</li>
            <li>If you liked the 125, then this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li>it is too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>I have show dogs  so brushes are very important.</li>
            <li>When I was a kid, we used to buy dog brushes from the pet store, because they didn&#x27;t make wire pin brushes for humans, and they are the best kind of brush for long hair.</li>
            <li>You will love this three pack of brushes.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes, as does my daughter.</li>
            <li>one at home and one at  , one at grand daughter.  </li>
            <li>It is ok.</li>
            <li>then they need to make sure of what style it is before hand.</li>
            <li>The scalp master 125 was my favorite brush</li>
            <li>I love the way this brush feels on my scalp.  </li>
            <li>Look forward to many more strokes . . .</li>
            <li>The one made in France is much better</li>
            <li>I was very excited to find them again.  </li>
            <li>Not quite as good as the original scalp master but not bad.</li>
            <li>/&gt;thick hair as easily.</li>
            <li>Not as smooth running it through the hair as the Scalpmaster that was made in France.</li>
            <li>Light weight.</li>
            <li>These are cheap China knockoffs.  </li>
            <li>Good, replacing old ones.</li>
            <li>IF YOU LOVED THE OLD &amp;#34;MADE IN FRANCE&amp;#34; SCALPMASTER, order the Phillips brush instead.</li>
            <li>Since you can&#x27;t get the original</li>
            <li>Unlike the original nrush made in france&lt;br /&gt;this one is stiffer and does not go through my&lt;br</li>
            <li>The original Scalpmaster was made in France.</li>
            <li>Phillips bought the factory in France and they continue to produce the original Scalpmaster-type brush, although it is no longer called that.</li>
            <li>I just fell in love with the first one I used and have been using them and selling them in my shop.</li>
            <li>I bought these brushes thinking they were the TRUE Scalpmaster Brush #125 that is made in France.</li>
            <li>I used the Scalpmaster years ago on my other dog and it was great</li>
            <li>Perfect for long coated breeds especially shih tzu.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hard to find really good ones these days, because for some reason they aren&#x27;t as popular as they were in the 80s and 90s.</li>
            <li>They are great products I just have the wrong kind of hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to brush my hair with it.</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair feels soft after each use.  </li>
            <li>They fall apart fairly quickly but are not expensive</li>
            <li>I was looking for a wire/metal brush, and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are the best scalp massagers.&lt;br /&gt;You must be very careful not to do damage to your hair by only gently brushing.</li>
            <li>This one is pretty good, but a little stiffer than I like.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly as presented.</li>
            <li>I recommend that you make sure the product search is properly put in as, \\&quot;Scalpmaster #125 made in France.</li>
            <li>It actually seems better made.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I use to buy these at the salon at a much higher price.</li>
            <li>and I get immense pleasure from the stimulation this brush affords:-)  </li>
            <li>Pins are stiffer than most but that is what I need for long coats.</li>
            <li>The Scalpmaster 125 that I have had for the past 15+ years has thinner metal bristles which are much more comfortable on the scalp.</li>
            <li>Great Brush, A little Stiffer than the first ones we bought, but was impressed with the improvement of the wire bristles the added a base to keep them from poking through the rubber.</li>
            <li>Great for thick hair!</li>
            <li>Thanks for the service.</li>
            <li>Even if I didn&#x27;t show het I wouldn&#x27;t want that much hair being pulled out.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t lose as much hair with Scalpmaster brushes.</li>
            <li>The oval is larger than the original.</li>
            <li>They are too rough for regular brushing but when you need to loosen knots, they are hands down the best product.</li>
            <li>This may not mean much to anyone but the people that really know, but, Amazon should make it a rule if they are group searches by brand name</li>
            <li>I have had scalp master in the past and really liked them</li>
            <li>The very best one I&#x27;ve ever found was from Europe and must&#x27;ve been discontinued as it&#x27;s impossible to find anymore, even online.</li>
            <li>My previous scalp master was made in France and the quality is remarkably better.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes and recommend them to anyone with long fragile hair.  </li>
            <li>Those were worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>I have the one made in France and wanted a new one.</li>
            <li>I run a very busy shop and need the #125&#x27;s not #126&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I have used these brushes since I was very young.  </li>
            <li>I used this on my Old English Sheepdog and it pulls out too much hair.</li>
            <li>if you are looking for an old fashion brush with steel bristles</li>
            <li>The ends of the wire brush are very pokey and it actually hurts to brush you hair with it.</li>
            <li>These are NOT the soft wire bristle Scalpmaster 125s...</li>
            <li>Gives dogs a deep brushing without taking out too much hair.</li>
            <li>Unlike those set too softly on the cushion.</li>
            <li>and I had been using them since the early Seventies.</li>
            <li>Those with shorter, thinner hair might find the metal bristles to be too stiff to be used comfortably.  </li>
            <li>This version is made in China and is not of the same high quality.</li>
            <li>so I naturally went back to this but stopped using it immediately.</li>
            <li>The Phillips brushes I bought subsequent to this purchase were identical to my old Scalpmasters.</li>
            <li>It has just the right firm settings of the pins to ensure a thorough brushing from roots to tip of the coat.</li>
            <li>I am older and have very long fragile hair.  </li>
            <li>These are a great alternative to the Scalpmaster #125, in that they are similar and are less expensive.  </li>
            <li>Lasts a long time, pins are very durable with long coats.</li>

            <li> Lasts a long time, pins are very durable with long coats.</li>
            <li> I have had long hair my entire life.</li>
            <li> Instead, they are cut off flat and they scratch the skin.</li>
            <li> ends of brush are not even rounded, the are flat cut and scratch your head.</li>
            <li> My hair has become thicker again due to less breakage and is much easier to manage.  </li>
            <li> Middle of the road for a review - It&#x27;s not what I expected so will have to wait to see how they hold up.</li>
            <li> Retains its shape and lasts long.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully it will soften up a little with regular cleaning and use and last longer.</li>
            <li> this brush is not the same it is 126 very rough</li>
            <li> Shipping cost return was not worth my time, so I decided to use it as a dog brush for my German Shepherd.</li>
            <li> The mall salon that I use to get them from closed</li>
            <li> as the 125 is the rubber base seems stiffer so the pins don&#x27;t flex as nicely.</li>
            <li> When I started brushing my dog (who loves to be brushed), she got up and ran off because it was even to stiff for her.</li>
            <li> The only objection I have is that they are not as flexible, way stiff to use</li>
            <li> The wires are sharp at the ends, not having been polished off.  </li>
            <li> However they are blunt cut extremely sharp.  </li>
            <li> these are VERY rough Scalpmaster 126s.</li>
            <li> You must be very careful using this brush.</li>
            <li> They are very hard and stiff, so much so that they pulled my hair out when I tried to brush my hair.</li>
            <li> but I still like the fact that they are similar to the other one and these brushes are hard to come by.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s larger in size and the bristles are thicker and SO HARD.</li>
            <li> No static electricity and goes through my long hair with ease.  </li>
            <li> Save yourself the trouble, and get the other one offered, that is made in France, that is probably the one you are trying to replace...</li>
            <li> Three for less than the price of one...</li>
            <li> I got three for less than I pay for one.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> so it can&#x27;t poke thru the base as easily.</li>
            <li> The base is so stiff the bristles don&#x27;t give easily under the pressure of a tangle and the bristles are not rounded on the ends like my previous brush was.</li>
            <li> The ends don&#x27;t have the little balls which is</li>
            <li> Not good for long hair at all, like the 125s were.</li>
            <li> (Not wanting to waste my purchase altogether)</li>
            <li> I show my dog so obviously this is a poor choice for me.</li>
            <li> The pins are cut off harsh not rounded.</li>
            <li> Cuts grooming time in half!</li>
            <li> This brush is insanely stiff.</li>
            <li> No more.</li>
            <li> There is no better brush anywhere.  </li>
            <li> The wire bristles are very harsh.</li>
            <li> The needle bed on the ones sold here are very stiff, making this brush extremely hard.  </li>
            <li> The 2nd time I used it,the rubber came unglued and the brush is very hard to use now that the bristoles are sticking out!!</li>
            <li> It is so sharp it is uncomfortable even against your hands.</li>
            <li> Not like our old one :(</li>
            <li> The handles are too thin and just snap off in your hand.</li>
            <li> ; Scalpmaster brush (never even heard of it prior to Amazon), so I had no comparison to base my experience off of, and I didn&#x27;t have any expectations.  </li>
            <li> The old 125 would after a while, have its pins poke thru the rubber base and sink down in, this one has a flair on the pin at the base</li>
            <li> sorry that the quality has diminished.</li>
            <li> and I was afraid I&#x27;d never find it.  </li>
            <li> I just read on another review that they are no longer made in France, that too bad for the company and us consumers.</li>
            <li> It is quite painful to use.</li>
            <li> and i hate it</li>

            <li> Yes, but like everything else, it&#x27;s made in China</li>
            <li> Not quite as good as the original scalp master but not bad. Since you can&#x27;t get the original it is a nice alternative.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these brushes, and the price was nice...&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these brushes...</li>
            <li> I am older and have very long fragile hair.  I used these brushes when I was younger and haven&#x27;t seen them since.  I was very excited to find them again.  My hair has become thicker again due to less breakage and is much easier to manage.  I love these brushes and recommend them to anyone with long fragile hair.  It massages and detangles at the same time.</li>
            <li> This brush is insanely stiff. It is quite painful to use. The base is so stiff the bristles don&#x27;t give easily under the pressure of a tangle and the bristles are not rounded on the ends like my previous brush was. I would not use it any living thing.</li>
            <li> You will love this three pack of brushes. Turn-around time was great! Product was exactly as presented. Thanks for the service.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes thinking they were the TRUE Scalpmaster Brush #125 that is made in France. But when I received them they were knock offs. They are very hard and stiff, so much so that they pulled my hair out when I tried to brush my hair. I even tried to boil them to soften them up. Shipping cost return was not worth my time, so I decided to use it as a dog brush for my German Shepherd. (Not wanting to waste my purchase altogether) When I started brushing my dog (who loves to be brushed), she got up and ran off because it was even to stiff for her. I recommend that you make sure the product search is properly put in as, \\&quot;Scalpmaster #125 made in France. I wouldn&#x27;t even give these brushes that I purchased a 1 star rating! Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes, as does my daughter. I used to get them thru my beautician but the can&#x27;t get anymore. Was soooooo happy to find these. They are very good brushes and a great price.</li>
            <li> Middle of the road for a review - It&#x27;s not what I expected so will have to wait to see how they hold up.</li>
            <li> Three for less than the price of one... it is too good to be true.  The ones for sale here are made in Asia, not France, and are not the same brush as the French Scalpmaster 125.  The needle bed on the ones sold here are very stiff, making this brush extremely hard.  Save yourself the trouble, and get the other one offered, that is made in France, that is probably the one you are trying to replace...</li>
            <li> one at home and one at  , one at grand daughter.  Working well!!</li>
            <li> havent used it  yet but use on my dogs and they are the best brushes in the whole world. i noticed they had been made in france and now china so i hope they are the same.  this brush is not the same it is 126 very rough and i hate it</li>
            <li> Good, replacing old ones.</li>
            <li> if you are looking for an old fashion brush with steel bristles this is it, great value also since you are getting three</li>
            <li> Great Brush, A little Stiffer than the first ones we bought, but was impressed with the improvement of the wire bristles the added a base to keep them from poking through the rubber. Good addition!</li>
            <li> I have had long hair my entire life. When I was a kid, we used to buy dog brushes from the pet store, because they didn&#x27;t make wire pin brushes for humans, and they are the best kind of brush for long hair. This one is pretty good, but a little stiffer than I like. It&#x27;s very hard to find really good ones these days, because for some reason they aren&#x27;t as popular as they were in the 80s and 90s. The very best one I&#x27;ve ever found was from Europe and must&#x27;ve been discontinued as it&#x27;s impossible to find anymore, even online. I wish I&#x27;d never thrown any of them away! So, the search continues, and this one is acceptable.</li>
            <li> these are not made in france.  This product is made in China.  The wire bristles are very harsh.</li>
            <li> The ends of the wire brush are very pokey and it actually hurts to brush you hair with it. Not like our old one :(</li>
            <li> This is not the same Scalpmaster 125 of years gone by.I used this on my Old English Sheepdog and it pulls out too much hair.I show my dog so obviously this is a poor choice for me.Even if I didn&#x27;t show het I wouldn&#x27;t want that much hair being pulled out.I used the Scalpmaster years ago on my other dog and it was great so I naturally went back to this but stopped using it immediately.Back then it was the &amp;#34;go to brush &amp;#34; among all the OES owners.No more.</li>
            <li> It is ok. I willhave to get use to it. Unlike the original nrush made in france&lt;br /&gt;this one is stiffer and does not go through my&lt;br /&gt;thick hair as easily. I wish they would make the 125 again, but this will do&lt;br /&gt;Nice brush for quantity and pricw</li>
            <li> The ONLY brush that works for me.  No static electricity and goes through my long hair with ease.  The mall salon that I use to get them from closed and I was afraid I&#x27;d never find it.  The 3-pk. price was great. Let me have one for home, one for work, and one to spare!</li>
            <li> Not as smooth running it through the hair as the Scalpmaster that was made in France. Those were worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> These are NOT the soft wire bristle Scalpmaster 125s...these are VERY rough Scalpmaster 126s. Not good for long hair at all, like the 125s were. They dont make 125s anymore for some reason, but these dont compare at all. Just want you to know what the difference is. I am stuck with 2 of these now.</li>
            <li> Great for thick hair!</li>
            <li> Excellent products and service</li>
            <li> I started using Scalpmaster in 1989 when my stylist had one and recommended it to me. I have long thick hair and they work GREAT. The brush moves through tangles very quickly!! Love this brush!!</li>
            <li> The original Scalpmaster was made in France. This version is made in China and is not of the same high quality. The pin tips are not polished. Instead, they are cut off flat and they scratch the skin. I would worry about the pins causing hair breakage. The oval is larger than the original. IF YOU LOVED THE OLD &amp;#34;MADE IN FRANCE&amp;#34; SCALPMASTER, order the Phillips brush instead. Phillips bought the factory in France and they continue to produce the original Scalpmaster-type brush, although it is no longer called that. The Phillips brushes I bought subsequent to this purchase were identical to my old Scalpmasters.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best de-tangler brushes I have ever had. They fall apart fairly quickly but are not expensive so I keep a couple on hand. They are too rough for regular brushing but when you need to loosen knots, they are hands down the best product.</li>
            <li> 100 $ PERFECT, THANKS A LOT !!!!!!</li>
            <li> I searched for #125&#x27;s and this listing came up. I run a very busy shop and need the #125&#x27;s not #126&#x27;s. This may not mean much to anyone but the people that really know, but, Amazon should make it a rule if they are group searches by brand name then they need to make sure of what style it is before hand.</li>
            <li> The scalp master 125 was my favorite brush but I guess they quit making it. If you liked the 125, then this is the next best thing. It actually seems better made. The old 125 would after a while, have its pins poke thru the rubber base and sink down in, this one has a flair on the pin at the base so it can&#x27;t poke thru the base as easily. The only thing I don&#x27;t like as we&#x27;ll as the 125 is the rubber base seems stiffer so the pins don&#x27;t flex as nicely. Hopefully it will soften up a little with regular cleaning and use and last longer. This brush is also cheaper than the 125.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to find an inexpensive, nice brush. Scalpmaster makes a good quality brush! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> These brushes are the best scalp massagers.&lt;br /&gt;You must be very careful not to do damage to your hair by only gently brushing.</li>
            <li> Only brush I will use for grooming dogs. Retains its shape and lasts long.  Light weight. Pins are stiffer than most but that is what I need for long coats.</li>
            <li> I use to buy these at the salon at a much higher price. I got three for less than I pay for one. It is truly a great hairbrush and I don&#x27;t lose as much hair with Scalpmaster brushes. A big plus!</li>
            <li> My wife wasn&#x27;t thrilled at all with your brushes. The handles are too thin and just snap off in your hand.</li>
            <li> I have used Scaplmaster brushes for decades....sorry that the quality has diminished. I just read on another review that they are no longer made in France, that too bad for the company and us consumers. It&#x27;s larger in size and the bristles are thicker and SO HARD. Ya screwed the pooch Scaplemaster going to China. ~Y</li>
            <li> good buy.  I have used these brushes since I was very young.  There is no better brush anywhere.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> These are cheap China knockoffs.  My wife has several of the origional scalpmaster 125 wire brushes.  I thought i was ordering the rear thing....the scalpmaster made in France.  Instead we received these knockoffs.  The wires are sharp at the ends, not having been polished off.  When my wife tried to brush her hair, her scalp was actually bleeding.  The wire ends had scratched thru into her scalp.  Horrible product.  Do not buy these.</li>
            <li> These are a great alternative to the Scalpmaster #125, in that they are similar and are less expensive.  The only objection I have is that they are not as flexible, way stiff to use but I still like the fact that they are similar to the other one and these brushes are hard to come by.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time, pins are very durable with long coats.Gives dogs a deep brushing without taking out too much hair. I have show dogs  so brushes are very important.</li>
            <li> ends of brush are not even rounded, the are flat cut and scratch your head. It is so sharp it is uncomfortable even against your hands.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this brush.  I purchased 3.  I think they are for wigs not FLESH of any kind.  The ends don&#x27;t have the little balls which is what I&lt;br /&gt;was looking for.  However they are blunt cut extremely sharp.  You must be very careful using this brush.</li>
            <li> These ended up bring to big for me and don&#x27;t have the desired effect.  They are great products I just have the wrong kind of hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect for long coated breeds especially shih tzu. It has just the right firm settings of the pins to ensure a thorough brushing from roots to tip of the coat. Unlike those set too softly on the cushion. It brushes individual hair strands firmly but gentle enough not to pull hair. Cuts grooming time in half! Love it!</li>
            <li> The pins are cut off harsh not rounded. I have the one made in France and wanted a new one. Can&#x27;t use these on my show dogs. This brush would rip the coat and the pins would sctatch the skin and make sores.</li>
            <li> I bought this pack of brushes anyway.  I was looking for a wire/metal brush, and the price was right.  I&#x27;ve never used the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Scalpmaster brush (never even heard of it prior to Amazon), so I had no comparison to base my experience off of, and I didn&#x27;t have any expectations.  As a standalone this is a great item. I love the way this brush feels on my scalp.  To me it feels like my scalp is invigorated every time I use it, and I get immense pleasure from the stimulation this brush affords:-)  It&#x27;s fun to brush my hair with it. I love the way my hair feels soft after each use.  Look forward to many more strokes . . .</li>
            <li> This&lt;br /&gt;scalpmaster Brush is not the same as the one made in France. This one is made in China and does not move the same. The one made in France is much better and I had been using them since the early Seventies. I just fell in love with the first one I used and have been using them and selling them in my shop.</li>
            <li> The 2nd time I used it,the rubber came unglued and the brush is very hard to use now that the bristoles are sticking out!!</li>
            <li> I have had scalp master in the past and really liked them but no where on the description did it say made in China.  My previous scalp master was made in France and the quality is remarkably better.</li>
            <li> Best hair brush I have ever used and I have used Scalpmaster for about 20 years!</li>
            <li> The Scalpmaster 126 is a well-made and well-designed brush, especially for those with thicker hair.  Those with shorter, thinner hair might find the metal bristles to be too stiff to be used comfortably.  The Scalpmaster 125 that I have had for the past 15+ years has thinner metal bristles which are much more comfortable on the scalp.</li>
