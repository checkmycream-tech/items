            <li>containers from this seller: igate1942, because it seemed like a great deal.</li>
            <li>Great coverage</li>
            <li>This is a cheap knockoff - don&#x27;t buy ever!!!</li>
            <li>Best makeup ever created,  coverage is excellent, color is perfect, looks completely natural.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend going to a store to see what shade works best with your skin, but the end result is great!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s paler and not as good of coverage.</li>
            <li>Good product, good service</li>
            <li>This is my favorite foundation!</li>
            <li>It gives great coverage and is so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I love the finish and it lasts a good amount of time too.</li>
            <li>Covers my freckles nicely.</li>
            <li>idk what kind of product I recieves or where it came from</li>
            <li>Came in good time, wrapped well, love this product have been using for about 5 years now, like the fact that it washes off well with no residual effect.</li>
            <li>is the best makeup on the market today and I&#x27;ve been using makeup for nearly 60 years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, make sure to get a good brush for using with it.</li>
            <li>Bare Minerals is the best!</li>
            <li>Too good to be true is what it turned out to be.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li>It acts as both foundation and concealer, layering well for more coverage in problem areas.</li>
            <li>Still wish after 3 years of using that it would cover age spots better but still a quality foundation that hides most aging flaws.</li>
            <li>Love this foundation.  </li>
            <li>You are better off to buy from sephora or ulta.</li>
            <li>This is the best daily use foundation I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m over 50 and tried many foundations, liquids and powders, and found none better than this.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Most make ups</li>
            <li>I love this product and I love the way my face feels when wearing this foundation.</li>
            <li>No foundation will make you look flawless, unless you are pretty much that already.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>LOVE it as it&#x27;s easy and quick to use!</li>
            <li>Applies fine.</li>
            <li>this product provided no coverage, its just like using a pigment free finishing powder</li>
            <li>This is the same product I bought some years ago, and it covers very nicely.</li>
            <li>I swear by bareMinerals original SPF foundation in &#x27;fairly light.&#x27;</li>
            <li>I have always loved bare minerals foundation.</li>
            <li>and I was excited to see it had it and for cheaper than in stores.</li>
            <li>The color is more yellow than it should be, I find myself using way more to cover up my blemishes, and I have to reapply throughout the day, which has never been an issue with this product.</li>
            <li>This pot of powder lasts a really long time, like 5-6 months, so it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li>easy to use good coverage with out being to heavy.</li>
            <li>It evens out my very fair skin, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, looks very natural.</li>
            <li>Been using Bare Minerals for years and love all their products.  </li>
            <li>I love this powder foundation by bare escentuals just not buying it via amazon again.</li>
            <li>I could&#x27;ve spent $5 at wal mart on better powder!</li>
            <li>More &amp;#34;clumpy&amp;#34; than one bought straight from Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super light but still gives enough coverage that I do not see my flaws and my skin looks like porcelain.</li>
            <li>Goes on light enough to look good and not too heavy to show you are wearing anything.</li>
            <li>I also use over a cream foundation I love for long or sweaty days</li>
            <li>Had to wait for it a little longer than going to a Sephora, but it was also cheaper, so that was nice.</li>
            <li>and I feel like it never makes me look like I am wearing too much makeup.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>One tip for a more natural finish: when you are applying to the entire face, start from the outside of your face and work inward towards your nose, so the makeup is applied a little more lightly around your nose and mouth.</li>
            <li>Really CANNOT live without this.  </li>
            <li>Also love the new &#x27;twist&#x27; lid...much neater, less product on the counter or floor.</li>
            <li>This has a different bottom label, different inside of lid, different ink on top!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light as air, with minimal coverage</li>
            <li>I love this product, as foundation has always seemed too heavy and mask-for me.</li>
            <li>The coverage is not as good, and the number after &amp;#34;fairly light&amp;#34; on the back of the container says N10 whereas on my other container it says &amp;#34;C10.&amp;#34; So it seems they are not the same product</li>
            <li>Other mineral makeups don&#x27;t have the coverage and don&#x27;t go on as smoothly.  </li>
            <li>The quality of this makeup made it very clear to me that this is not truly bareMinerals.</li>
            <li>Long lasting with easy application of said product thank you</li>
            <li>This is supposed to be the exact same one that I get at Sephora</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive and not perfect (T-zone oil) skin and have loved using bare minerals products.</li>
            <li>I also recommend applying primer first so that the foundation will last all day, otherwise, you will need to reapply frequently.</li>
            <li>So I took my old container and compared with my container I purchased from Ulta.</li>
            <li>is light and helps cover up uneven skin color.</li>
            <li>Used it for awhile but for some reason my complexion with it on looked a bit different, more dull, older.</li>
            <li>the foundation that I recieves is NOT a product of bare minerals.</li>
            <li>This is not legit bare minerals, I could tell after one use.</li>
            <li>The stamp on the lid with the bare minerals label was smeared.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing bare minerals for 10 years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a long time fan of this foundation, it looks so natural on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used bare minerals same shade and all</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals makeup for several years now.  </li>

            <li> I have been using bare minerals fairly light for many years, and I was very disappointed when I used this product.</li>
            <li> There were times that I would try other foundation but always found myself going back to bare minerals.</li>
            <li> But when I try other options, I always find my way back to Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> live in a small town, the mall is a half hour away and nowhere close sells bare minerals.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not the legit formula... after using product for over 5 years thought I&#x27;d save money and the trip to the mall but not worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s NOT Bare Minerals!!!!!</li>
            <li> Harder to get out of the container.</li>
            <li> I use a small brush to apply under my eyes, and on any spots, and then use a kabuki brush to apply to my entire face.</li>
            <li> I usually purchase from local beauty store.</li>
            <li> Creates a nice base and hides uneven skin tone.  </li>
            <li> not a bare escentuals product, don&#x27;t waste your time trying to save a few bucks.</li>
            <li> Now, the container is about to fall in half and the foundation leaks out the bottom.</li>
            <li> Started wearing the one from the store and immediately recognized a slight difference.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the FAKE foundation!</li>
            <li> How dumb do you think I am?</li>
            <li> When I got my mineral powder in the mail I noticed that it went on poorly.</li>
            <li> Only base my wife uses, ever!</li>
            <li> I like this product, but was disappointed with the condition of the container that the foundation comes in.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my favorite foundation! I stopped using liquid foundation about 5 years ago and now only use the BareMinerals foundation. It gives great coverage and is so easy to apply. I love the finish and it lasts a good amount of time too.</li>
            <li> More &amp;#34;clumpy&amp;#34; than one bought straight from Bare Minerals. Harder to get out of the container. Applies fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love it. I never break out from it and I feel like it never makes me look like I am wearing too much makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time fan of this foundation, it looks so natural on. It acts as both foundation and concealer, layering well for more coverage in problem areas. I use a small brush to apply under my eyes, and on any spots, and then use a kabuki brush to apply to my entire face. One tip for a more natural finish: when you are applying to the entire face, start from the outside of your face and work inward towards your nose, so the makeup is applied a little more lightly around your nose and mouth.</li>
            <li> Had to wait for it a little longer than going to a Sephora, but it was also cheaper, so that was nice. No complaints!</li>
            <li> Creates a nice base and hides uneven skin tone.  Covers my freckles nicely.</li>
            <li> Product was correct color as labeled</li>
            <li> I like this product, but was disappointed with the condition of the container that the foundation comes in. Within a week of using the product, the container was cracked. Now, the container is about to fall in half and the foundation leaks out the bottom. I have never had this happen before with this foundation, and wonder why this is happening?</li>
            <li> I swear by bareMinerals original SPF foundation in &#x27;fairly light.&#x27; I bought two 8g. containers from this seller: igate1942, because it seemed like a great deal. Too good to be true is what it turned out to be. This seller sold me knock off product. The quality of this makeup made it very clear to me that this is not truly bareMinerals. The color is more yellow than it should be, I find myself using way more to cover up my blemishes, and I have to reapply throughout the day, which has never been an issue with this product. I&#x27;m concerned with what chemicals might be in the knock off makeup I applied to my face. Do not buy anything from igate1942. They are selling counterfeit product.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive, acne prone skin. Great coverage</li>
            <li> This is a cheap knockoff - don&#x27;t buy ever!!!</li>
            <li> Very unhappy. the foundation that I recieves is NOT a product of bare minerals. Compare ingredients if u will. Different consistency , different color, made me break out. I&#x27;ve always used bare minerals same shade and all idk what kind of product I recieves or where it came from but I don&#x27;t trust or use at all anymore</li>
            <li> Still wish after 3 years of using that it would cover age spots better but still a quality foundation that hides most aging flaws. I also use over a cream foundation I love for long or sweaty days and I get excellent coverage!</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be the exact same one that I get at Sephora but it&#x27;s not. There&#x27;s something different about it. It&#x27;s paler and not as good of coverage. I would send it back but don&#x27;t want to bother to pay the shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this product, as foundation has always seemed too heavy and mask-for me. However, I might try the next darker shade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and will never go back to a liquid.  Other mineral makeups don&#x27;t have the coverage and don&#x27;t go on as smoothly.  I tried several and always come back to BareMinerals.</li>

            <li> Been using Bare Minerals for years and love all their products.  Others claim to be like it but don&#x27;t even come close.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best makeup on the market today and I&#x27;ve been using makeup for nearly 60 years.</li>
            <li> Love this foundation.  Goes on light enough to look good and not too heavy to show you are wearing anything.</li>

            <li> Thanks for the FAKE foundation! The stamp on the lid with the bare minerals label was smeared. How dumb do you think I am?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years because my dermatologist  recommended it.  LOVE it as it&#x27;s easy and quick to use!</li>
            <li> Good product, good service</li>
            <li> I have been using bare minerals fairly light for many years, and I was very disappointed when I used this product. It is not the same product as I have been using, even though I thought I was ordering the same stuff. The coverage is not as good, and the number after &amp;#34;fairly light&amp;#34; on the back of the container says N10 whereas on my other container it says &amp;#34;C10.&amp;#34; So it seems they are not the same product and I can see the difference when I use it.</li>
            <li> Really CANNOT live without this.  Best makeup ever created,  coverage is excellent, color is perfect, looks completely natural.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is the best daily use foundation I&#x27;ve found. It evens out my very fair skin, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, looks very natural. It stays all day without getting shiny. This pot of powder lasts a really long time, like 5-6 months, so it&#x27;s a good value. I&#x27;m over 50 and tried many foundations, liquids and powders, and found none better than this. It&#x27;s easy to use, make sure to get a good brush for using with it.</li>
            <li> I have always loved bare minerals foundation. There were times that I would try other foundation but always found myself going back to bare minerals. I absolutely love it. It has the perfect shade for me and gives me the perfect coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in a small town, the mall is a half hour away and nowhere close sells bare minerals. I had the thought to see if Amazon had it and I was excited to see it had it and for cheaper than in stores. I only wish it was eligible for prime!</li>
            <li> This is definitely not the legit formula... after using product for over 5 years thought I&#x27;d save money and the trip to the mall but not worth it. Used it for awhile but for some reason my complexion with it on looked a bit different, more dull, older. Made a trip to the mall and bought some because I thought maybe there was a difference since buying it online. Started wearing the one from the store and immediately recognized a slight difference. I love this powder foundation by bare escentuals just not buying it via amazon again.</li>
            <li> This is the same product I bought some years ago, and it covers very nicely. I like the cleanness of it, as compared to liquid foundations. No foundation will make you look flawless, unless you are pretty much that already. But when I try other options, I always find my way back to Bare Minerals. Also love the new &#x27;twist&#x27; lid...much neater, less product on the counter or floor.</li>
            <li> Bare Minerals is the best!</li>
            <li> been using for years. no complaints</li>
            <li> This has become my go-to foundation. It&#x27;s light as air, with minimal coverage so I don&#x27;t have a makeup-y look. It just smooths my skin a bit, and keeps me from being shiny. I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals makeup for several years now.  I would highly recommend going to a store to see what shade works best with your skin, but the end result is great!  I also recommend applying primer first so that the foundation will last all day, otherwise, you will need to reapply frequently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing bare minerals for 10 years. I usually purchase from local beauty store. I decided to try online. When I got my mineral powder in the mail I noticed that it went on poorly. Like a drug store brand. So I took my old container and compared with my container I purchased from Ulta. This has a different bottom label, different inside of lid, different ink on top! No wonder it went on portly! It&#x27;s NOT Bare Minerals!!!!! Rip off! I could&#x27;ve spent $5 at wal mart on better powder!</li>
            <li> Came in good time, wrapped well, love this product have been using for about 5 years now, like the fact that it washes off well with no residual effect.</li>
            <li> Only base my wife uses, ever!</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive and not perfect (T-zone oil) skin and have loved using bare minerals products. Most make ups I try either irritate my face of cause me to break out, baremineral make up is light and helps cover up uneven skin color.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I love the way my face feels when wearing this foundation. It&#x27;s super light but still gives enough coverage that I do not see my flaws and my skin looks like porcelain. My pores do not get clogged and I my face can actually breathe while being protected</li>
