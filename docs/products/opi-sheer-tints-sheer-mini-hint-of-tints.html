    <ol>
            <li>so these are just perfect.  </li>
            <li>It is very attractive and stays shiny between nail appointments.  </li>
            <li>Each color is beautiful !!!</li>
            <li>They are a bit goopy, maybe not the best formula.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent nail polish!</li>
            <li>Awesome!</li>
            <li>These minis, which allow you to experiment, are perfect for trying out.</li>
            <li>But as a glaze, they work wonderfully.</li>
            <li>The Amber color looks awesome on butter london &amp;#34;torch&amp;#34; and the violet looks great on butter london &amp;#34;scoundrel.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>these topcoat colors are great.  </li>

            <li>Wanted a good bit of color, so I did four coats.</li>
            <li>Otherwise good addition to a collection.</li>
            <li>Great price, nice tints.  </li>
            <li>The strings of goop ruin a good mani....</li>
            <li>bought this for my daughter and loved it got myself a set</li>
            <li>Anything from a lovely pastel manicure to beautiful nail art.  </li>
            <li>These tints were fun to wear and in the perfect bottle size.  </li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>Love these colors!</li>
            <li>but once you finish your nail art they look really nice</li>
            <li>Just a nice wash of color.</li>
            <li>It kind of blends with the pink/red color.</li>
            <li>The colors of these are really nice</li>
            <li>All my friends asked to borrow them or ordered their own set.</li>
            <li>A nice concept</li>
            <li>They are transparent but have a nice glossy look.</li>
            <li>Love love love these!!</li>
            <li>love this and gave them to my nail stylist , who liked it.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li>They are ok for just a wash of color over your nail, but not so great for layering or nail art, which is why I wanted them in the first place.</li>
            <li>Cute, but very light.</li>
            <li>Love the color combinations</li>
            <li>With two coats you have a hint of the color of the top coat.  </li>
            <li>I love the colors.</li>
            <li>So glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li>Wash of color that adds flair to most manicures and nail art.  </li>
            <li>I just love how all the colors just tint your nails.  </li>
            <li>They just a hint of color , depending on how many coats you use.  </li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>Love the mini size polishes and OPI seldom disappoints.</li>
            <li>Any more than 2 coats (like for a pond or syrup manicure) and they chip almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love them.  </li>
            <li>but I wish the quality of the polish was better.</li>
            <li>I bought these in the mini size because I wanted to make sure I liked them before spending the money to purchase the full size ones.  </li>
            <li>However, once applied these colors are really cool!  </li>
            <li>I can make gradual change nail easily by using this</li>
            <li>You can apply more layers to show a more distinct color.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need to get full size; I just use as a top coat.</li>
            <li>I gave these a shot because I&#x27;ve been wanting to give the leadlight technique for nail art a try (and yes, these work fine), and I&#x27;ve been experimenting with making home-made decals for my nails.</li>
            <li>and I received a replacement 3 days later, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>These would have been so cute and useful....</li>
            <li>These polishes are very fun to use.</li>
            <li>My friends and I were so excited about it, and we tried ombre with it.</li>
            <li>These are truly unique.</li>
            <li>Fun!</li>
            <li>Colors look good over other lighter nail polishes :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE THESE SO MUCH.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re really a cool collection.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying the full size soon.</li>
            <li>Overall, glad that I have them, but definitely more of an&amp;#34;event&amp;#34; polish than something I expect longevity from.</li>
            <li>Then its so thick that it just kind of peels off on its own..</li>
            <li>So much fun to layer</li>
            <li>The idea behind these is great, but the product isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li>These are perfect little sheer pops of color that work alone for a soft splash or as a top coat to create a new look of an old favorite.</li>
            <li>they r tiny but cute and worth it</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>yeah, these let you do that in a beautiful, subtle way.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve got the formula of a top coat (super fast drying) rather than a regular lacquer, which makes sense since this is their intended purpose.  </li>
            <li>And the size is great because I am sure I will use them all up before they get too thick to spread like the larger bottles.</li>
            <li>While the colors are pretty, the quality of the product is sorely lacking.  </li>
            <li>Glad it came in smaller</li>
            <li>Will be using these tints in many ways, to color white, to add to nail art and as a pop of color over nude nails.</li>
            <li>Love these, I saw something like these in a Salon a while back.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>With a third coat the color of the top coat is very  visible.  </li>
            <li>But they responded very quickly; they answered my email the same day</li>
            <li>I think it would have been more useful to drop one of those colors and include a green instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Colors cover well with a jelly look that is sheer but filled with color.  </li>
            <li>They barely fit back in.</li>
            <li>I really want to like these</li>
            <li>Brushes don&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li>You can do so much with them.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are long and can be tricky to get back into the bottle without the bristles catching on the rim and bending funny.</li>
            <li>Love the look of these over other colors.  </li>
            <li>purple shade isn&#x27;t as vibrant as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>Only gets two stars because for two days it WAS very pretty.</li>
            <li>Love OPI but don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been having fun using these over different stamp patterns to change up the color patterns.</li>
            <li>I threw them away because it wasn&#x27;t worth shipping back.</li>
            <li>And the polish itself is kind of thick  and stringy</li>
            <li>They add a dimension to colored polishes, sheer, light hues to white polish and a deeper hue to dark/black polishes.</li>
            <li>These polishes work fine, but they can be a little tricky to work with.</li>
            <li>The polish was VERY stringy and thick and chipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>The mouth of the bottle is too small and gets gunked up very quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There was a problem with shipping--I got it quickly but the package I received had 2 purples and no blue, and one of the bottle caps was loose so the purple polish spilled out all over the place inside the package.</li>
            <li>Glad I got this small mini pack instead of the standard bottles.</li>
            <li>The brushes are ridiculously huge for how small the bottle is.</li>
            <li>My daughter wanted these, you can barely see the polish on the nail unless you put a TON of coats on!</li>
            <li>Pretty, but not worth sacrificing my sanity over.</li>
            <li>I will be trying it sometime in the near future!!</li>
            <li>The product is thick and goopy and does not apply smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I love the tints and they last several days, especially if I use the OPI top and base coat.  </li>
            <li>looks like a pretty streaky green.</li>
            <li>On the nail, especially with more coats, they have a texture of hard candy when they start to chip (weird but accurate).  </li>
            <li>Used the blue first over gold/yellow glitter for St. Paddy&#x27;s day and got green glitter.  </li>
            <li>First, they really are VERY sheer, almost a little too sheer, so you&#x27;ll probably need to use over nude or pale polishes to catch the color.</li>

            <li> Used the blue first over gold/yellow glitter for St. Paddy&#x27;s day and got green glitter.  </li>
            <li> First, they really are VERY sheer, almost a little too sheer, so you&#x27;ll probably need to use over nude or pale polishes to catch the color.</li>
            <li> My only major complaint is that the purple and pink are very close in color.</li>
            <li> The bottles are super small minis, .125 fl.oz, or the size of the little $.99 tester polishes you can get at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> One note - when put over light/white colors, they DO streak a bit as it&#x27;s not easy to get a very uniform coat with them, simply due to the sheer nature.</li>
            <li> I will not use this polish again and plan to go back to Pink Armor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the OPI minis of other colors and not had such problems.</li>
            <li> They dry quickly, but when I was using a dotting tool to dab color into a design I stamped on my nail, I kept getting these really long strings of instantly dry polish going between the tool to the nail, it was weird but still usable.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed - particularly since I&#x27;ve had good luck with OPI products in the past.</li>
            <li> Used the pink and it looks a little like a French manicure since it just brightens without a lot of color.</li>
            <li> My brush is mangled on the pink one already.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be more of an infuriating messy waste of time than this was.</li>
            <li> The mouth is too small and the brush is too big.</li>
            <li> I was not aware at the time of purchase.</li>
            <li> not worth the money for effort.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend these for leadlighting (stained glass effect) as they are a little thick, tend to get stringy and are not very well tinted.</li>
            <li> It had strings of polish hanging off of the brush as if it had sat around for a few years and thickened.  </li>
            <li> It went on thick and was hard to get on evenly, so I ended up putting on at least one extra coat just trying to get even color across the nail.</li>
            <li> Secondly, the brush is thick thick thick.  </li>
            <li> Pink and purple look the same, the texture is awkward to work with</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that one of the brushes were messed up and makes it difficult to apply.</li>

            <li> i always wanted a set of tints. they r tiny but cute and worth it</li>
            <li> I can make gradual change nail easily by using this</li>
            <li> Great product.  Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted these, you can barely see the polish on the nail unless you put a TON of coats on! Then its so thick that it just kind of peels off on its own.. She likes them, but I&#x27;m not a fan,</li>
            <li> Pink and purple look the same, the texture is awkward to work with but once you finish your nail art they look really nice</li>
            <li> OPI did it again. So much fun to layer and I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Wanted a good bit of color, so I did four coats. It was hell. Even after thinning the formula, it still did the stringy spiderweb thing all over the place. It was hard to get the brush in and out of the bottle. It went on thick and was hard to get on evenly, so I ended up putting on at least one extra coat just trying to get even color across the nail. It started chipping and peeling after three days. I&#x27;ve used the OPI minis of other colors and not had such problems. Seems to just be this polish. Pretty, but not worth sacrificing my sanity over. There are tutorials online for making your own--I&#x27;m just going to try that. Can&#x27;t be more of an infuriating messy waste of time than this was. Only gets two stars because for two days it WAS very pretty.</li>
            <li> These polishes are very fun to use.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my daughter but I use them, too! Love the color combinations and they work almsot like a shellac.  Would purchase again!</li>
            <li> I love the tints and they last several days, especially if I use the OPI top and base coat.  I don&#x27;t always want a deep color so these are just perfect.  And the size is great because I am sure I will use them all up before they get too thick to spread like the larger bottles.</li>
            <li> these topcoat colors are great.  With two coats you have a hint of the color of the top coat.  With a third coat the color of the top coat is very  visible.  It is very attractive and stays shiny between nail appointments.  Each color is beautiful !!!</li>
            <li> They are a bit goopy, maybe not the best formula. Otherwise good addition to a collection. Maybe I&#x27;ll try thinning them.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this item.  The product is thick and goopy and does not apply smoothly.  While the colors are pretty, the quality of the product is sorely lacking.  I am very disappointed - particularly since I&#x27;ve had good luck with OPI products in the past.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent nail polish! My friends and I were so excited about it, and we tried ombre with it. LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li> Love love love these!! I want them all in the big size bottles now!! These are truly unique. Yay! 😄</li>
            <li> I gave these a shot because I&#x27;ve been wanting to give the leadlight technique for nail art a try (and yes, these work fine), and I&#x27;ve been experimenting with making home-made decals for my nails. These polishes work fine, but they can be a little tricky to work with. First, they really are VERY sheer, almost a little too sheer, so you&#x27;ll probably need to use over nude or pale polishes to catch the color. The bottles are super small minis, .125 fl.oz, or the size of the little $.99 tester polishes you can get at Sally&#x27;s. The brushes are long and can be tricky to get back into the bottle without the bristles catching on the rim and bending funny. They dry quickly, but when I was using a dotting tool to dab color into a design I stamped on my nail, I kept getting these really long strings of instantly dry polish going between the tool to the nail, it was weird but still usable. My only major complaint is that the purple and pink are very close in color. I think it would have been more useful to drop one of those colors and include a green instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a problem with shipping--I got it quickly but the package I received had 2 purples and no blue, and one of the bottle caps was loose so the purple polish spilled out all over the place inside the package. But they responded very quickly; they answered my email the same day and I received a replacement 3 days later, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I like the look of this in the bottles, but I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try it yet!! I will be trying it sometime in the near future!!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product, given that it&#x27;s OPI.  The tint color is much too heavy a wash to be called a tint.  Secondly, the brush is thick thick thick.  So thick it makes controlling the application difficult.  Thirdly, the polish is too sticky.  It had strings of polish hanging off of the brush as if it had sat around for a few years and thickened.  I will not use this polish again and plan to go back to Pink Armor.</li>
            <li> Got these because sometimes I just like a sheer tint on my nails.  My granddaughters keep borrowing them so they are a hit for all ages.</li>
            <li> Love the look of these over other colors.  Used the blue first over gold/yellow glitter for St. Paddy&#x27;s day and got green glitter.  Awesome!</li>
            <li> The mini bottoles are horrible. The mouth is too small and the brush is too big. My brush is mangled on the pink one already. And the polish itself is kind of thick  and stringy</li>
            <li> Great price, nice tints.  Glad it came in smaller</li>
            <li> Cute, but very light. Colors look good over other lighter nail polishes :)</li>
            <li> I love the colors. supper product</li>
            <li> These tints were fun to wear and in the perfect bottle size.  I recommend wearing these colors alone are as base coat.</li>
            <li> So glad I purchased this. I didn&#x27;t need to get full size; I just use as a top coat. The Amber color looks awesome on butter london &amp;#34;torch&amp;#34; and the violet looks great on butter london &amp;#34;scoundrel.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love OPI but don&#x27;t waste your money on this. Goes on gooey and goes downhill from there.</li>
            <li> Wash of color that adds flair to most manicures and nail art.  Colors cover well with a jelly look that is sheer but filled with color.  Will be using these tints in many ways, to color white, to add to nail art and as a pop of color over nude nails.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE SO MUCH. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that one of the brushes were messed up and makes it difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> love this and gave them to my nail stylist , who liked it.</li>
            <li> Way too goopy, stringy and hard to manage. These would have been so cute and useful.... The strings of goop ruin a good mani....</li>
            <li> Love these, I saw something like these in a Salon a while back.  I wanted to know what they were. I just love how all the colors just tint your nails.  If you not a Big fan of nail polish, you may like these.  They just a hint of color , depending on how many coats you use.  I love them.</li>
            <li> Love these! Just a nice wash of color. Used the pink and it looks a little like a French manicure since it just brightens without a lot of color.</li>
            <li> Love the mini size polishes and OPI seldom disappoints. These are perfect little sheer pops of color that work alone for a soft splash or as a top coat to create a new look of an old favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having fun using these over different stamp patterns to change up the color patterns. It would be easier if the brushes were thinner, but they work well enough.&lt;br /&gt;The purple shade isn&#x27;t as vibrant as I had hoped. It kind of blends with the pink/red color. The blue and yellow are great.&lt;br /&gt;Fun addition to the collection.</li>
            <li> bought this for my daughter and loved it got myself a set</li>
            <li> The idea behind these is great, but the product isn&#x27;t my favorite. The formula is too thick and sticky. The brushes are ridiculously huge for how small the bottle is. They barely fit back in. I really want to like these but I just can&#x27;t seem to get used to the formula. They are ok for just a wash of color over your nail, but not so great for layering or nail art, which is why I wanted them in the first place. I&#x27;ll keep trying, any tips for me from those who use these often? Thanks!</li>
            <li> Brushes don&#x27;t work very well.  Some bristles were pointing in all different directions.  Peels off within a day.  I threw them away because it wasn&#x27;t worth shipping back.</li>
            <li> These minis, which allow you to experiment, are perfect for trying out. They add a dimension to colored polishes, sheer, light hues to white polish and a deeper hue to dark/black polishes. They also make great double combos - the blue tint with the yellow over it when applied to white base looks like a pretty streaky green. One note - when put over light/white colors, they DO streak a bit as it&#x27;s not easy to get a very uniform coat with them, simply due to the sheer nature. Oh and ombre… yeah, these let you do that in a beautiful, subtle way.</li>
            <li> The colors of these are really nice and they&#x27;re really a cool collection.  Any more than 2 coats (like for a pond or syrup manicure) and they chip almost immediately.  They&#x27;ve got the formula of a top coat (super fast drying) rather than a regular lacquer, which makes sense since this is their intended purpose.  On the nail, especially with more coats, they have a texture of hard candy when they start to chip (weird but accurate).  Overall, glad that I have them, but definitely more of an&amp;#34;event&amp;#34; polish than something I expect longevity from.</li>
            <li> Love these colors! Great for nail art designs- especially watercolor mani. All my friends asked to borrow them or ordered their own set.</li>
            <li> I bought these in the mini size because I wanted to make sure I liked them before spending the money to purchase the full size ones.  I absolutely love them.  You can do so much with them.  Anything from a lovely pastel manicure to beautiful nail art.  I will be buying the full size soon.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend these for leadlighting (stained glass effect) as they are a little thick, tend to get stringy and are not very well tinted. But as a glaze, they work wonderfully. Glad I got this small mini pack instead of the standard bottles.</li>
            <li> I know its tempting but dont buy the small bottles. The mouth of the bottle is too small and gets gunked up very quickly. The polish was VERY stringy and thick and chipped very quickly. A nice concept but I wish the quality of the polish was better.</li>
            <li> Very pale colored tints. Fun!</li>
            <li> Please note, these are mini bottles. I was not aware at the time of purchase. However, once applied these colors are really cool!  They are transparent but have a nice glossy look. You can apply more layers to show a more distinct color.</li>
            <li> Very nice tints..I like them a lot...excellent purchase</li>
            <li> gooey brush ... not worth the money for effort.</li>
            <li> Get gloopy and stringy after a very short time</li>
