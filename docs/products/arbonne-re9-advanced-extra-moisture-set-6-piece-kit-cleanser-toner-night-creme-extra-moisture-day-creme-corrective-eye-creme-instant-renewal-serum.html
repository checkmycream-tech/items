            <li>Arbonne is the very best!  </li>

            <li>Use these products and very happy with them.</li>
            <li>Best Product I have ever used</li>
            <li>Being a consultant for seven years, I started when the NutriminC RE9 line was in use and it was awesome.  </li>
            <li>I was so impressed, I joined the company.  </li>
            <li>Excellent packaging!</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Great service.  </li>
            <li>I always get great service with Amazon. com</li>
            <li>I love this product, my skin feels wonderful</li>
            <li>all good now</li>
            <li>I have used it for years and have found it to be the very best skin care product available.  </li>
            <li>This product is exceptional.  </li>
            <li>Love Arbonne and this seller and product was great.</li>
            <li>Fresh and awesome.</li>
            <li>I have the whole set, and it is wonderful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 54 &amp; most think I look 35.  </li>
            <li>Expensivebut love it.</li>
            <li>Go to Arbonne&#x27;s website and they will connect you with a reputable consultant.</li>
            <li>Love, love, LOVE this product...  </li>
            <li>I have used it for about 10 years now and still love it and will NEVER change.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product from a fantastic seller.</li>
            <li>My skin is refreshed and younger looking love these natural products great find!</li>
            <li>Bet satisfied, I love this  skin care stuff and how fast it was mailed to me</li>
            <li>Love this product and certainly appreciate it when I find someone selling authentic, fresh product.</li>
            <li>While I love the smell of it and the moisture, I definitely cannot see it working much better than the $15 anti-ageing  cream I had bought earlier.  </li>
            <li>no guarantee from the company and you are supporting a seller who does not follow policy.  </li>
            <li>Not only was it gentler, but it was also a better value.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>A very little bit goes a very long way, so you can make most of the products in this set last 6 months which makes it a better value than even most department store brands that don&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li>Daily cream is a bit thick,  so I use it as sunblock and use another more liquid lotion on top.</li>
            <li>Not only that, the non expired set would cost you less from a consultant, They are over charging for this set and its not even complete, you can get the instant lift gel free with the set plus a 50.00 free product if you sign up as a preferred client, this would only cost you 220.00 plus you would get the lift gel and free 50.00 gift if you went through a consultant</li>
            <li>will no longer be working as a consultant for Arbonne and am looking for a new product line.</li>
            <li>I have purchased directly from Arbonne and the products lasted me approx.</li>
            <li>By direct - not from this seller.</li>
            <li>You will not get Arbonne&#x27;s unconditional guarantee and you have no way of knowing how old this product is from this</li>
            <li>/&gt;For those of you that might hesitate due to the price, it is completely worth it.  </li>
            <li>the products that are sold here bare from Ex-consultants, the product packaging is from like 3 years ago and the products with the old packaging are expired, so if you have not gotten the results that you expected its because you are buying expired products, you can only buy fresh non-expired products from a consultant like me.  </li>
            <li>Years later, when I tried the new line, I broke out immediately.  </li>
            <li>I have religiously used the whole set to the last drop before writing the review.</li>
            <li>I will be 70 years old this October and my friends say I look younger.  </li>
            <li>I wrote to Arbonne and asked them to bring back the old line.  </li>
            <li>After applying the creams it felt like I had a mask on, tightened my skin but only on the surface - exactly the same feeling when your skin is extremely dry.</li>
            <li>I was about 36 when I started using this product and although have always looked younger than my age, started getting compliments on my skin (which had NEVER EVER happened in my entire life) from people that knew me as well as complete strangers.  </li>
            <li>Be weary of buying Arbonne from someone who is not an active consultant, you cannot buy fresh products from anyone other then a consultant.</li>
            <li>Living in the north I find the moisture works well for old and very dry skin.</li>

            <li> I love this product, my skin feels wonderful</li>
            <li> some minor trouble trying to get the damaged product replaced. all good now</li>
            <li> This product is exceptional.  I have tried other brands and they just don&#x27;t work like this does.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product from a fantastic seller.</li>
            <li> Arbonne is the very best!  I&#x27;m 54 &amp; most think I look 35.  Its the vitamin C that helps, so I hear. .. And staying it of sun, of course. Daily cream is a bit thick,  so I use it as sunblock and use another more liquid lotion on top.</li>
            <li> I have religiously used the whole set to the last drop before writing the review. While I love the smell of it and the moisture, I definitely cannot see it working much better than the $15 anti-ageing  cream I had bought earlier.  It&#x27;s very unlikely I will buy arbonne in the future.</li>
            <li> I have the whole set, and it is wonderful. I have now been using this for over 2 years. From the cleanser to the night cream, all of these products feel wonderful on your skin and deliver results.</li>
            <li> the products that are sold here bare from Ex-consultants, the product packaging is from like 3 years ago and the products with the old packaging are expired, so if you have not gotten the results that you expected its because you are buying expired products, you can only buy fresh non-expired products from a consultant like me.

            <li> Expensivebut love it.Living in the north I find the moisture works well for old and very dry skin. Wished they&lt;br /&gt;had sales.</li>
            <li> I was sold USED Arbonne.  I have purchased directly from Arbonne and the products lasted me approx. 9 months.  I purchased it from this seller &amp; it hasn&#x27;t even last a month. What a joke.  By direct - not from this seller.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have used it for years and have found it to be the very best skin care product available.  Great service.  I received it a few days after I placed my order.  Disappointed that the Eye Cream and Night Cream were smaller containers than I&#x27;m accustomed to purchasing locally.</li>
            <li> I got these as a gift ( never would spend this much on products ) and came to the conclusion that unfortunately for me they don&#x27;t work. The anti aging effect must happen in the head as it does nothing on the face. The only thing I noticed was that it actually made my face a lot drier. After applying the creams it felt like I had a mask on, tightened my skin but only on the surface - exactly the same feeling when your skin is extremely dry. But when you wash off the product, the tightness goes. I think it&#x27;s a big scam, definitely not worth the price unless you want parch dry skin for a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Love Arbonne and this seller and product was great.</li>
            <li> Use these products and very happy with them. This is less expensive than I get them through Arbonne. I always get great service with Amazon. com</li>
            <li> Arbonne products are not supposed to be sold on sites like this.  You will not get Arbonne&#x27;s unconditional guarantee and you have no way of knowing how old this product is from this site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Arbonne has a Preferred Client program where you can get 20% off and a consultant program where you can save 35% off every order!  So, buying from this Amazon seller gets you a 3% discount, no guarantee from the company and you are supporting a seller who does not follow policy.  Go to Arbonne&#x27;s website and they will connect you with a reputable consultant.</li>
            <li> I will be 70 years old this October and my friends say I look younger.  Arbonne RE9 has a lot to do with that.  Plus Genetics.</li>
            <li> Love, love, LOVE this product...  I have used it for about 10 years now and still love it and will NEVER change.  I was about 36 when I started using this product and although have always looked younger than my age, started getting compliments on my skin (which had NEVER EVER happened in my entire life) from people that knew me as well as complete strangers.  Flash forward 10 years, and at the age of 46, people always think I&#x27;m around 8 years younger than I am, and I still get compliments on how radiant my skin is.  I also recommend the travel set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you that might hesitate due to the price, it is completely worth it.  A very little bit goes a very long way, so you can make most of the products in this set last 6 months which makes it a better value than even most department store brands that don&#x27;t work as well.  I love the toner so usually order one of those by itself, and sometimes the face wash too, but again, a very little goes a Long, long way.</li>
            <li> Best Product I have ever used</li>
            <li> Fresh and awesome. Love this product and certainly appreciate it when I find someone selling authentic, fresh product. These are NOT the sneaky samples-squirted-into-bottles version.</li>
            <li> My skin is refreshed and younger looking love these natural products great find! Almost $200 less on Amazon!!&lt;br /&gt;Be amazed!</li>
            <li> I am terribly, terribly disappointed in the this line from Arbonne.  Being a consultant for seven years, I started when the NutriminC RE9 line was in use and it was awesome.  It was the only skin care line that was non-aging and didn&#x27;t make me break out.  I was so impressed, I joined the company.  Years later, when I tried the new line, I broke out immediately.  I wrote to Arbonne and asked them to bring back the old line.  Not only was it gentler, but it was also a better value.&lt;br /&gt;I will no longer be working as a consultant for Arbonne and am looking for a new product line.</li>
            <li> Bet satisfied, I love this  skin care stuff and how fast it was mailed to me</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting. Excellent packaging!</li>
