            <li>THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT11&lt;br</li>
            <li>These implements are very nice, they work great on my fingers and around my toes.  </li>
            <li>I love multi purpose uses for one item!!</li>

            <li>This thing is amazing !</li>
            <li>Not too great but good for ad-ons</li>
            <li>Nice set of manicure tools!</li>
            <li>Works amazingly well, l very, very pleased!</li>
            <li>/&gt;very good material</li>
            <li>I did think the tool for smoothing the nail bed worked fairly well</li>
            <li>It works really good</li>
            <li>Not a bad product but not the greatest either.</li>
            <li>Perfect fit for the Emjoi Micro-Pedi; Allows easy use on fingers or toes; great pricing and prompt shipping.</li>
            <li>I love this system it works great</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and she is very pleased with the versatility of this micro kit.  </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I love the Micro-Pedi Manicure Kit!  </li>
            <li>Easy and GREAT to use.  </li>
            <li>I had an el cheapo version of these that I really liked</li>
            <li>not as effective as I&#x27;d hoped</li>
            <li>Handy storage.  </li>
            <li>When I buff my nails or get them buffed, I expect a nice shiny, healthy finish.  </li>
            <li>This means you don&#x27;t really have a good handle on how to work them to optimum performance.</li>
            <li>Awesome attachments, that make a pedi manicure so amazingly easy with professional results!  </li>
            <li>I finish off with the buffer tool mostly to ensure that I have a very smooth, snag-free</li>
            <li>It worked well just wish some tips were more abrasive for callouses</li>
            <li>Be sure to shop around for prices.</li>
            <li>Works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>They are just ok for the purpose they serve.</li>
            <li>An interesting addition to the Micro-Pedi, but I think most people will find a separate manicure set preferable.  </li>
            <li>It OK, however, I wish I had something else like a battery operated item</li>
            <li>I use these with the electric machine &amp; I love it.</li>
            <li>Make sure you get these to go with it</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Most of them are buffers and not grinders at all.</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed it and am so glad I got it.</li>
            <li>They love them.  </li>
            <li>Love these for toe nails and finger nails</li>
            <li>glad</li>
            <li>think they work best for the cut end of your nails and not the flat surface.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to store.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Attaches easily to my emjoi.  </li>
            <li>It fits easily into my Emjoi power micro-pedi</li>
            <li>I found this very useful and works great on my old feet.  </li>
            <li>When I do, I like my nails to be well shaped and smooth without jagged areas.</li>
            <li>Overall though, I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li>but it seems to do a nice job buffing the nails and trims the cuticles rather effectively without pain or other issues.</li>
            <li>I take vitamins, but don&#x27;t do anything else special.</li>
            <li>Does what it&#x27;s designed to do and quickly.  </li>
            <li>So people looking for the buffing tool to give them a super shiny finish will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This little kit is great to have with my arsenal of nail care tools.  </li>
            <li>To provide a little more information, I own the corded micro-pedi callus remover by</li>
            <li>Perhaps the Emjoi I own isn&#x27;t powerful enough to make this Micro-Pedi kit work well; however, I was under the impression that the corded Emjoi was supposedly stronger than the battery operated one (though I could be mistaken).  </li>
            <li>Nice extra, use it on feet and hands.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>different little shapes makes them perfect for any job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They are sturdy and come in a very nice sturdy small case.  </li>
            <li>I have used only the buffers so far and they did a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many items sold out there to get rid of my rough heals and to clean up my toe nails.</li>
            <li>Great for the hard to get places</li>
            <li>I have the battery operated Emjoi and love it, the implements are easy to attach, stay on tightly when in use.  </li>
            <li>Read the directions first to know what each piece does.</li>
            <li>I use each of the tools somewhat as needed, but tend to prefer the two white tipped tools the most.</li>
            <li>they really get the job done!</li>
            <li>The Emjoi Micro Pedi is an Amazing little machine.  </li>
            <li>Really extends the range of the Emjoi.  </li>
            <li>Especially like being able to smooth my rough cuticles.</li>
            <li>It would take you a fraction of the time and effort required to shape and smooth your nails using a regular nail file.  </li>
            <li>Cleans up the foot calluses very well.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to file away too much.</li>
            <li>I would like to use these tools to smooth out the shaping at that point, but they still aren&#x27;t aggressive enough to do that.</li>
            <li>B00CQAT83C Emjoi Micro-Pedi Precision Accessory Kit]] work much better for rough shaping.</li>
            <li>Now I get the whole pedicure experience without spending the time and money to have to go to a salon to do it.</li>
            <li>I believe my nails are pretty much average, healthy nails.</li>
            <li>All the parts worked well with the main part, the Micro Pedi Callus Remover.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend t.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Bought them for volunteers to do foot Pedi&#x27;s at cancer center for free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth spending the extra dollars for...</li>
            <li>and I assumed they would be a lot tougher (rough like the original emjoli wheels).  </li>
            <li>So far I mainly use two of the heads.</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised at how well it works!</li>
            <li>The picture is exactly what it looks like, but I assumed it would be bigger.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Disappointed that I spent money on this though at first glance, it looks like a really promising kit.  </li>
            <li>However, you have to be very careful because they are so aggressive, you could ruin the shape quickly if you&#x27;re not paying close attention to what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really removes that white stuff (soap residue, lotion residue)</li>
            <li>but I will go back to a regular 99 cent nail buffer block which is much faster, easier to handle and really makes your nails look shiny and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that the Emjoi tool itself isn&#x27;t turning fast enough.</li>
            <li>That means you can&#x27;t really get a shiny buffing on the flat surface of your nail from the buffing tool.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this with having high expectations.</li>
            <li>However, the shaping is still pretty rough.</li>
            <li>It also takes a lot more work/effort than I thought it would to &#x27;poorly&#x27; buff each of your nails using this tool.  </li>
            <li>This tool removes the dullness that occurs after smoothing down your nail bed; but it leaves your nails looking un-buffed -- your nails will look the same as when you first started.  </li>

            <li> It also takes a lot more work/effort than I thought it would to &#x27;poorly&#x27; buff each of your nails using this tool.  </li>
            <li> This tool removes the dullness that occurs after smoothing down your nail bed; but it leaves your nails looking un-buffed -- your nails will look the same as when you first started.  </li>
            <li> A flat tool (such as an emery board shape) contacts a much larger part of your nail.</li>
            <li> I find these attachments helpful for smoothing the cut ends of my fingernails, but not for buffing the flat part.</li>
            <li> They grow too long for typing</li>
            <li> I wish I had found this long ago.</li>
            <li> Not enough power to properly sand down dry skin around nail beds.  </li>
            <li> I USE IT ON MY HANDS TO REMOVE THE DRY SKIN AROUND MY NAIL</li>
            <li> but it was battery operated &amp; inevitably slowed down.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a little hard to say much.  </li>
            <li> I get the rough shape finished</li>
            <li> Because they are round, only a small portion of the tool itself touches the nail at any single spot.</li>
            <li> so I need to trim them down every week or two.</li>
            <li> The case looks big in this photo but is is very small (about 3 inches) and it is convenient to use.  </li>
            <li> The power of your emjoi is enough that these attachments don&#x27;t slow down when you put it to your feet!</li>
            <li> The cuticle tool also did little for me, if anything, made my cuticles look a little ragged in some places.  </li>
            <li> It does work, but it is a bet less convenient to use than a plain  powered manicure set.</li>
            <li> Money well spent !!!</li>
            <li> The product is made well, but I find it a little difficult to hold firmly enough for some of the tips to do their intended job.</li>
            <li> I usually leave my nails</li>
            <li> When I do, I usually shape them</li>
            <li> use them to get between toes, cuticles on feet and hands, or is you have a callous in a hard to reach spot.</li>
            <li> No more Mani Pedi&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> But they are a little difficult to use if you not use to these tools.</li>
            <li> I tried all 5 pieces and they were all useless.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The filing tools for shaping are 100% worthless - I was not able to file my nails at all with them, period.  </li>
            <li> The set up is a tad bit awkward since it goes in sideways.</li>
            <li> be disappointed.    </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It worked well just wish some tips were more abrasive for callouses</li>
            <li> Great pedicure kit, but not for manicure.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for the Emjoi Micro-Pedi; Allows easy use on fingers or toes; great pricing and prompt shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many items sold out there to get rid of my rough heals and to clean up my toe nails. This kit is great and I can not praise it all enough.  It&#x27;s definitely with the money and it&#x27;s performance is unmatched.</li>
            <li> thanks&lt;br /&gt;very good material</li>
            <li> After using the accessory kit for mani&#x27;s, I found this. Another accessory must-have for the micro-pedi.</li>
            <li> It really removes that white stuff (soap residue, lotion residue) that&#x27;s around your cuticle beds that appears. These accompanying accessories are great to use with the Emjoi Micro-Pedi. It&#x27;s worth spending the extra dollars for...</li>
            <li> So far I mainly use two of the heads. An excellent addition to the Emjoi Micro-Pedi Nano Callus Remover (corded)!</li>
            <li> Easy and GREAT to use.  I purchased one for my mother.  She and I don&#x27;t have to go to the shop and get our feet done</li>
            <li> i am neutral on this one, I tried using on my nails but it just wasn&#x27;t working well..</li>
            <li> I just got this kit for Christmas.  Love it!  Really extends the range of the Emjoi.  Be sure to shop around for prices.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s designed to do and quickly.  Especially like being able to smooth my rough cuticles.</li>
            <li> Works very good!  No complaints.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the Emjoi I own isn&#x27;t powerful enough to make this Micro-Pedi kit work well; however, I was under the impression that the corded Emjoi was supposedly stronger than the battery operated one (though I could be mistaken).  To provide a little more information, I own the corded micro-pedi callus remover by Emjoi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The filing tools for shaping are 100% worthless - I was not able to file my nails at all with them, period.  It would take you a fraction of the time and effort required to shape and smooth your nails using a regular nail file.  The cuticle tool also did little for me, if anything, made my cuticles look a little ragged in some places.  I did think the tool for smoothing the nail bed worked fairly well but the buffing tool was subpar.  When I buff my nails or get them buffed, I expect a nice shiny, healthy finish.  This tool removes the dullness that occurs after smoothing down your nail bed; but it leaves your nails looking un-buffed -- your nails will look the same as when you first started.  It also takes a lot more work/effort than I thought it would to &#x27;poorly&#x27; buff each of your nails using this tool.  It was the idea that this would save me some time and be easier to use that made me give this a try but I will go back to a regular 99 cent nail buffer block which is much faster, easier to handle and really makes your nails look shiny and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed that I spent money on this though at first glance, it looks like a really promising kit.  Would not recommend this product at all.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> I love the Micro-Pedi Manicure Kit!  Awesome attachments, that make a pedi manicure so amazingly easy with professional results!  A must have for your Emjoi Pedi.</li>
            <li> Works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  Cleans up the foot calluses very well.  Easy to use and easy to store.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this with having high expectations. I was hoping it would perform just as well as my emjoi callous remover.  It doesn&#x27;t have enough grit on the tools to file your nails.  I do like the cuticle pushing tool. It works really good</li>
            <li> great accessory for the Emjoi micro pedi</li>
            <li> I would not brag about these. They are just ok for the purpose they serve. But they are a little difficult to use if you not use to these tools. The set up is a tad bit awkward since it goes in sideways. This means you don&#x27;t really have a good handle on how to work them to optimum performance. Not a bad product but not the greatest either.</li>
            <li> Not too great but good for ad-ons</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m diabetic and don&#x27;t like to cut my nails- I&#x27;d rather file. Was hoping this would do the job but there&#x27;s not enough power from the Emoji. The buffer doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL! Save your money.</li>
            <li> Works great and will extend your manicure.  Takes a bit to get used to how to operate.  Read the directions first to know what each piece does.</li>
            <li> Great for the hard to get places</li>
            <li> An interesting addition to the Micro-Pedi, but I think most people will find a separate manicure set preferable.  It does work, but it is a bet less convenient to use than a plain  powered manicure set.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works amazingly well, l very, very pleased!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used these once so it&#x27;s a little hard to say much.  The parts that I used did their job efficiently.</li>
            <li> It OK, however, I wish I had something else like a battery operated item</li>
            <li> This little kit is great to have with my arsenal of nail care tools.  I have used only the buffers so far and they did a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> Not enough power to properly sand down dry skin around nail beds.  Possibly tools don&#x27;t have proper product on them?</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!  These things are awesome on my Emjoi Micro-Pedi Nano Callus Remover.</li>
            <li> These implements are very nice, they work great on my fingers and around my toes.  They are sturdy and come in a very nice sturdy small case.  The case looks big in this photo but is is very small (about 3 inches) and it is convenient to use.  I have the battery operated Emjoi and love it, the implements are easy to attach, stay on tightly when in use.  I love this system it works great and I highly recommend t.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.  Arrived before promised date.</li>
            <li> I find these attachments helpful for smoothing the cut ends of my fingernails, but not for buffing the flat part. I believe my nails are pretty much average, healthy nails. I take vitamins, but don&#x27;t do anything else special. They grow too long for typing so I need to trim them down every week or two. When I do, I like my nails to be well shaped and smooth without jagged areas. I usually leave my nails natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of the attachments are aggressive enough to reduce the nail length so I still have to cut my nails. When I do, I usually shape them so I don&#x27;t have to file away too much. However, the shaping is still pretty rough. I would like to use these tools to smooth out the shaping at that point, but they still aren&#x27;t aggressive enough to do that. It&#x27;s not that the Emjoi tool itself isn&#x27;t turning fast enough. It is. It&#x27;s that the grit on the tools are not aggressive enough. I find the [[ASIN:B00CQAT83C Emjoi Micro-Pedi Precision Accessory Kit]] work much better for rough shaping. However, you have to be very careful because they are so aggressive, you could ruin the shape quickly if you&#x27;re not paying close attention to what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I get the rough shape finished, I finally use this manicure kit. I find they work well for smoothing off the shaping very nicely. I use each of the tools somewhat as needed, but tend to prefer the two white tipped tools the most. I finish off with the buffer tool mostly to ensure that I have a very smooth, snag-free finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think they work best for the cut end of your nails and not the flat surface. That&#x27;s because of the basic shape of the tools themselves. Because they are round, only a small portion of the tool itself touches the nail at any single spot. That means you can&#x27;t really get a shiny buffing on the flat surface of your nail from the buffing tool. A flat tool (such as an emery board shape) contacts a much larger part of your nail. So people looking for the buffing tool to give them a super shiny finish will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you&#x27;re looking for a set of tools to finish your cut ends to perfection, then these attachments will work well. That&#x27;s what I use them for, and I&#x27;m very happy with the results.ill be disappointed.

            <li> helps me feel like a human again . do my feet on a weekly basic .</li>
            <li> I use this all of the time. I had an el cheapo version of these that I really liked but it was battery operated &amp; inevitably slowed down. I use these with the electric machine &amp; I love it.</li>
            <li> Great product - just as described!!</li>
            <li> The Emjoi Micro Pedi is an Amazing little machine.  Make sure you get these to go with it they really get the job done! I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this. Who needs to pay for a pedicure?!?</li>
            <li> Nice extra, use it on feet and hands.  No more Mani Pedi&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Hi,got items,Thank you</li>
            <li> Just the best attachments to use with your emjoi foot shaver. You can have your feet looking great in no&lt;br /&gt;time! The power of your emjoi is enough that these attachments don&#x27;t slow down when you put it to your feet! Great product!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she is very pleased with the versatility of this micro kit.  All the parts worked well with the main part, the Micro Pedi Callus Remover.</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting. The picture makes it look a lot bigger and I assumed they would be a lot tougher (rough like the original emjoli wheels).  Most of them are buffers and not grinders at all. Overall though, I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Product is a great improvement over the &amp;#34;file and clipper&amp;#34; technique for my wife to treat her nails.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. I was really surprised at how well it works! Would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful accessory for the Emjoi electric unit. Now I get the whole pedicure experience without spending the time and money to have to go to a salon to do it. Great deal, great price.</li>
            <li> not as effective as I&#x27;d hoped</li>
            <li> This was a great addition to my Emjoi Pedicure device.  I have really enjoyed it and am so glad I got it.</li>
            <li> but it seems to do a nice job buffing the nails and trims the cuticles rather effectively without pain or other issues.</li>
            <li> Received on time and happy with product.  I have not used it yet, but I have it for when I do need it.</li>
            <li> The product is made well, but I find it a little difficult to hold firmly enough for some of the tips to do their intended job.</li>
            <li> I saw this as a perfection addition to my micro pedi</li>
            <li> Recommend this addition to my Emjoi.  I found this very useful and works great on my old feet.  Handy storage.  It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> Nice set of manicure tools!</li>
            <li> My nails look awesome!  Did it all myself and don&#x27;t have to share used items at the salons anymore!!!</li>
            <li> They love them.  Bought them for volunteers to do foot Pedi&#x27;s at cancer center for free.</li>
            <li> Love these for toe nails and finger nails</li>
            <li> I bought this to go with my AP-3NM Micro Pedi and it was working but has no effect on my nails at all. I tried all 5 pieces and they were all useless. I dont know if the problem is the material of the pieces or the speed but if anyone is thinking of buying this then DON&#x27;T.</li>
            <li> MY CUTICLES HAVE NEVER LOOKED SO GOOD!! I USE IT ON MY HANDS TO REMOVE THE DRY SKIN AROUND MY NAIL TOO....THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT11&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to run at 3 RPM&#x27;s.  It doesn&#x27;t run at all.  The picture is exactly what it looks like, but I assumed it would be bigger.  Don&#x27;t buy this.  Not a lot of anything else to say because I have a backache!  Wonder if Amazon can fix that?</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing ! I wish I had found this long ago. Money well spent !!!</li>
            <li> Attaches easily to my emjoi.  I love multi purpose uses for one item!!</li>
            <li> It fits easily into my Emjoi power micro-pedi but I can&#x27;t get it to shape my nails at all. I probably just don&#x27;t know how to use it correctly but a regular nail fail works much better. Some of the tips do work well on getting places on my feet that the regular roller can&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> Bought this attachement set for my Emjoi Pedi gadget.&lt;br /&gt;So glad I added this to my cart.&lt;br /&gt;The different little shapes makes them perfect for any job.&lt;br /&gt;I use them to get between toes, cuticles on feet and hands, or is you have a callous in a hard to reach spot.</li>
            <li> Another great manicure kit!!!</li>
