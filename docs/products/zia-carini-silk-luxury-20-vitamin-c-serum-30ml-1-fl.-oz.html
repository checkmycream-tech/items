            <li>That&#x27;s a pleasant start to my day</li>
            <li>So this review, I don&#x27;t think, is really fair.</li>
            <li>Anyone can throw some moisturizer on their skin, but nourishing your skin with vitamins is so wise, and that&#x27;s what this serum does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 10 days in now, and I feel like I can share a fair assessment.</li>
            <li>I wanted to give this a good couple of weeks before reviewing this product.</li>
            <li>It is good to know how to store it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lightweight serum, smells great and makes my skin very smooth</li>
            <li>Silk is a great name for this product, because it goes on silky smooth!</li>
            <li>I will gladly continue to use it and recommend it to my friends!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin smooth, soft, and silky which is a perfect face prep for applying foundation as it gives you a perfect canvas.</li>
            <li>I just love the feel of it!</li>
            <li>I love this Vitamin C Serum!</li>
            <li>These changes make this product a huge win for me.</li>
            <li>Sure...it smells fantastic and it has great texture ...</li>

            <li>I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>All thoughts are my own and have not been influenced.</li>
            <li>I have used 2 bottles, feels nice, but does not work.</li>
            <li>I received a discount for this product for my honest review and I don&#x27;t hesitate giving it the 5 stars it deserves.</li>
            <li>Love the smooth and silky feeling and it smells wonderful with a light fragrance of citrus.</li>
            <li>I â€˜ve gave the product a good couple of weeks before reviewing to be sure I could get the full effects of the serum.</li>
            <li>OK...</li>
            <li>Love everything about this serum.</li>
            <li>My face and hands love the feel.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.  </li>
            <li>It smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>Feels wonderful on my skin, even though I have used it for a short time, it seems to be working.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a month now, love the feel of this.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Many thanks for offering a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I find that the pump works out much better for me.  </li>
            <li>Love how this stuff feels, it is truly like silk.  </li>
            <li>so I sure I will love this one too.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how much I so love this product</li>
            <li>I love using just this at night as I don&#x27;t feel like I have a pound of moisturizer on my face.</li>
            <li>I do not wear makeup and people have commented on how much better</li>
            <li>It has a light, pleasant smell, and soaks right in!</li>
            <li>This product appears to be of very high quality and is very nicely packaged.  </li>
            <li>It is brighter, more even toned, and smooth.</li>
            <li>and I love it already, goes on smooth and feels so silky</li>
            <li>Your fingers warm it right up</li>
            <li>to be sure I could get the full effects of the serum.</li>
            <li>My skin is softer and I have noticed fewer fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I am really hoping they will come out with more products to compliment this serum!</li>
            <li>I love the feel - super light and smooth.</li>
            <li>It feels smooth and silky and it smells wonderful--a light fragrance of citrus.</li>
            <li>This serum by Zia Carini is a great example of going the extra mile for your skin.</li>
            <li>I like light scents on my face.</li>
            <li>What this serum HAS done, however, is lighten my freckles, brighten my complexion, and made my skin feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very silky and rubs into my skin nicely.</li>
            <li>This feels light</li>
            <li>This is not a cream that goes on your face, it&#x27;s this clear soft liquid that feels wonderful and smells like citrus.  </li>
            <li>It gives the skin a very smooth, silky feel and absorbs very well.  </li>
            <li>liked this so much the first day I tried it, I wanted to review it immediately.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s claims are true</li>
            <li>Am seeing some diminishing fine lines on my face, love that a little goes a long ways and am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Periodically I will try another company&#x27;s serum to compare because there are so many out there, and they&#x27;re ok, but I always come back to this one.</li>
            <li>Since I have seen some improvement I will continue using this on a more regular basis and will be ordering more.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is sleek and modern, and the instructions are easy to read and follow.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to review it&#x27;s effectiveness but was really impressed with the email from the company explaining everything about this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this 1x per day and probably haven&#x27;t been on a good enough skin regimen for this product to show more improvement.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost 66 years old and know I it will take longer than someone younger than me to see all the great improvements of my skin.</li>
            <li>Other reviews seem to mention a great smell, however, I don&#x27;t notice any scent really at all.</li>
            <li>When I read the other reviews I wondered why they were all saying how they loved the &amp;#34;silky feel&amp;#34; ..</li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice- a soft citrusy scent, the serum is light and and goes on smoothly without feeling heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li>makes face feel soft and smooth</li>
            <li>This is called Silk because that&#x27;s exactly how it feels.</li>
            <li>Any product that can help with that, I&#x27;m willing to try.</li>
            <li>In fairness, however, I wanted to use it for awhile first.</li>
            <li>You definitely don&#x27;t want a face product that your husband turns away from!! :-)  </li>
            <li>and I really see the difference!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m enjoying the facial benefits...</li>
            <li>It is not greasy or sticky, it is just so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>And since the years are coming I&#x27;ve decided to put a bit more care into my daily wash and moisturize routine.</li>
            <li>Product is like silk, dispenser is easy to use and very efficient with no waste of contents.</li>
            <li>but I honestly prefer to use it on places other than my face, like my neck, hands and chest.  </li>
            <li>really hope I dont have to spend anymore then $45 on it in the future :)</li>
            <li>I have no affiliation with the company at all, and I am not required to leave a positive review.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and not thick, for very soft skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of fine lines in my face, but I do have one big one on my forehead from a lifetime of brow furrowing.</li>
            <li>I really notice the effect of this serum.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do anything for me.</li>
            <li>I think I am really going to like it.</li>
            <li>my skin tone is looking so much</li>
            <li>The airless pump works really well and</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really made a difference.  </li>
            <li>What a refreshing, rejuvenating experience for my older, dry skin.  </li>
            <li>While I do love this product for other reasons, it hasn&#x27;t made a difference in that wrinkle at all.</li>
            <li>But I love all of their other products</li>
            <li>I love this one so far I haven&#x27;t used it for very long.</li>
            <li>Packaging was very well done with a professional and modern look.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup, I don&#x27;t bake in the sun, I don&#x27;t use a lot of product, but I am getting older.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this serum.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to feel little bumps in my pores under my eyes, and they are GONE.</li>
            <li>this is a very inexpensive alternative to many of the serums out there that claim to restore and revive damaged skin but in actuality do very little.</li>
            <li>My right hand was so dry, cracked, and looked so much older.</li>
            <li>I recently ordered Zia Carini Silk Serum for the first time</li>
            <li>It goes on like silk, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Let me first start out by saying i&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars on my skin care and nothing really seemed to do the trick.</li>
            <li>There is a slight, not strong at all, fragrance that is pleasant as well.</li>
            <li>For the first week I only put the serum on the back of my left hand and applied it with the fingers on my right hand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 60 years old.</li>
            <li>Silk feels so soft and luxurious on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have been applying twice daily for 10 days now, so the results are fast.</li>
            <li>Your skin feels so soft even after one application.  </li>
            <li>It is also perfect for a pre foundation base.</li>
            <li>I added several other products at the same time that I began using this one, but my skin has never looked or felt better.  </li>
            <li>I have found my new daily face regiment!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s actually a good thing since the last face serum I tried had a strong fragrance that my husband hated.</li>
            <li>My lines have decreased and my skin looks healthy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely sensitive to that though, so I&#x27;m not surprised.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> When I read the other reviews I wondered why they were all saying how they loved the &amp;#34;silky feel&amp;#34; ..</li>
            <li> The fragrance is nice- a soft citrusy scent, the serum is light and and goes on smoothly without feeling heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> makes face feel soft and smooth</li>
            <li> This is called Silk because that&#x27;s exactly how it feels.</li>
            <li> Any product that can help with that, I&#x27;m willing to try.</li>
            <li> In fairness, however, I wanted to use it for awhile first.</li>
            <li> You definitely don&#x27;t want a face product that your husband turns away from!! :-)  </li>
            <li> and I really see the difference!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m enjoying the facial benefits...</li>
            <li> It is not greasy or sticky, it is just so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> And since the years are coming I&#x27;ve decided to put a bit more care into my daily wash and moisturize routine.</li>
            <li> Product is like silk, dispenser is easy to use and very efficient with no waste of contents.</li>
            <li> but I honestly prefer to use it on places other than my face, like my neck, hands and chest.  </li>
            <li> really hope I dont have to spend anymore then $45 on it in the future :)</li>
            <li> I have no affiliation with the company at all, and I am not required to leave a positive review.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and not thick, for very soft skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of fine lines in my face, but I do have one big one on my forehead from a lifetime of brow furrowing.</li>
            <li> I really notice the effect of this serum.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything for me.</li>
            <li> I think I am really going to like it.</li>
            <li> my skin tone is looking so much</li>
            <li> The airless pump works really well and</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really made a difference.  </li>
            <li> What a refreshing, rejuvenating experience for my older, dry skin.  </li>
            <li> While I do love this product for other reasons, it hasn&#x27;t made a difference in that wrinkle at all.</li>
            <li> But I love all of their other products</li>
            <li> I love this one so far I haven&#x27;t used it for very long.</li>
            <li> Packaging was very well done with a professional and modern look.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup, I don&#x27;t bake in the sun, I don&#x27;t use a lot of product, but I am getting older.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this serum.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to feel little bumps in my pores under my eyes, and they are GONE.</li>
            <li> this is a very inexpensive alternative to many of the serums out there that claim to restore and revive damaged skin but in actuality do very little.</li>
            <li> My right hand was so dry, cracked, and looked so much older.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered Zia Carini Silk Serum for the first time</li>
            <li> It goes on like silk, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Let me first start out by saying i&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars on my skin care and nothing really seemed to do the trick.</li>
            <li> There is a slight, not strong at all, fragrance that is pleasant as well.</li>
            <li> For the first week I only put the serum on the back of my left hand and applied it with the fingers on my right hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 years old.</li>
            <li> Silk feels so soft and luxurious on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have been applying twice daily for 10 days now, so the results are fast.</li>
            <li> Your skin feels so soft even after one application.  </li>
            <li> It is also perfect for a pre foundation base.</li>
            <li> I added several other products at the same time that I began using this one, but my skin has never looked or felt better.  </li>
            <li> I have found my new daily face regiment!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s actually a good thing since the last face serum I tried had a strong fragrance that my husband hated.</li>
            <li> My lines have decreased and my skin looks healthy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely sensitive to that though, so I&#x27;m not surprised.  </li>
            <li> If I had read the directions carefully I would have read that the serum is dispensed into your hand by tipping the container a bit and gently pressing down.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry hands, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t had any trouble with this (no irritation, acne, drying, etc).</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t do what I expected from this product , especially at that price.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant about a &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; as I don&#x27;t like a heavy feeling on my face but this product is not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> I plan on being a life long customer.</li>
            <li> have noticed that my eyes don&#x27;t look like a crow&#x27;s feet when I wake in the morning because my skin is usually dry when I wake up.</li>
            <li> A little of this goes a long way, so I anticipate the 1 oz to last me awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So silly and smooth, not greasy doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your skin.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few weeks but am intending to continue use.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I should add that I&#x27;ve always had a really uneven tone and acne since I was a teen.  </li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t like heavy scents</li>
            <li> I also like that the bottle has a pump, I have gotten other brands that used a dropper</li>
            <li> ; that you get with other products.  </li>
            <li> I recently reviewed this item and complained that it did not come with a &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; allowing the serum to spray.  </li>
            <li> I usually pump the serum on to the back of my hand so as not to waste it moisturizing my palms (as suggested in the email info I received).</li>
            <li> I am already noticing that my face is smoother and the dark circles around my eyes have lightened up.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my skin tone is evening out, slightly, and my son spot is fading, slightly.  </li>
            <li> I have always had naturally dry skin, and after going through surgical menopause in my late 20&#x27;s, I found my skin rapidly aging in my 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have that little &amp;#34;blast of cold&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I thought it was missing.  </li>
            <li> I gave this product a few weeks of use before posting this review so here goes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and wanted to do a review on my results.</li>
            <li> I also see an improvement in my acne scarring and uneven skin time.</li>
            <li> I have small acne scars and uneven skin tone, it has been two weeks since I have been using this product (morning and night)</li>
            <li> I am not recommending it and I am not going to buy it no more...</li>
            <li> My skin looks less tired as well.</li>
            <li> I look lately (should I be insulted?)  </li>
            <li> Sorry another money wasted!</li>
            <li> WRONG!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m stupid!!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really notice the effect of this serum. I&#x27;m 60 years old. Periodically I will try another company&#x27;s serum to compare because there are so many out there, and they&#x27;re ok, but I always come back to this one. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product appears to be of very high quality and is very nicely packaged.  It gives the skin a very smooth, silky feel and absorbs very well.  I have only been using it for a few weeks but am intending to continue use.  I believe I do see an improvement.  If it&#x27;s claims are true this is a very inexpensive alternative to many of the serums out there that claim to restore and revive damaged skin but in actuality do very little.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful product. My skin is very happy using this. It is brighter, more even toned, and smooth.</li>
            <li> I recently reviewed this item and complained that it did not come with a &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; allowing the serum to spray.  I thought it was missing.  WRONG!!  If I had read the directions carefully I would have read that the serum is dispensed into your hand by tipping the container a bit and gently pressing down.  OK...I know...I&#x27;m stupid!!!  So....please disregard my earlier published review.</li>
            <li> makes face feel soft and smooth</li>
            <li> This is called Silk because that&#x27;s exactly how it feels. I have only been using it for a few weeks so that&#x27;s the only reason for the 4 stars. I know that it may take another few weeks to notice a real difference. So this review, I don&#x27;t think, is really fair. As of now, it does seem to be working on the finer lines of my face.</li>
            <li> The name says it ALL!</li>
            <li> Packaging was very well done with a professional and modern look. Emails were pleasant and informative. Product is like silk, dispenser is easy to use and very efficient with no waste of contents. Am seeing some diminishing fine lines on my face, love that a little goes a long ways and am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Love everything about this serum. It feels smooth and silky and it smells wonderful--a light fragrance of citrus. The sun spot on my cheek is fading, my wrinkles are lessening and my skin has a healthier tone.</li>
            <li> Silk feels so soft and luxurious on my skin.  My face and hands love the feel.  I have used it for just a month and my friends and family have commented on how my face &#x27;seems younger&#x27;.  My skin is softer and I have noticed fewer fine lines.  The roughness around my nose and mouth has disappeared.  I will be ordering more.  Thank You for this wonderful product; even the packaging is elegant.  Pat, age 68/ Kansas</li>
            <li> Silk is a great name for this product, because it goes on silky smooth! I have always had naturally dry skin, and after going through surgical menopause in my late 20&#x27;s, I found my skin rapidly aging in my 30&#x27;s. Any product that can help with that, I&#x27;m willing to try. This serum by Zia Carini is a great example of going the extra mile for your skin. Anyone can throw some moisturizer on their skin, but nourishing your skin with vitamins is so wise, and that&#x27;s what this serum does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy. It smells fantastic! There is a hint of citrus, a nod to the Vitamin C. I like light scents on my face. Anything that&#x27;s going to be close to my nose has no business being overpowering. The bottle is sleek and modern, and the instructions are easy to read and follow. (This is not your granny&#x27;s face product!) A little of this goes a long way, so I anticipate the 1 oz to last me awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this so much the first day I tried it, I wanted to review it immediately. In fairness, however, I wanted to use it for awhile first. I&#x27;m 10 days in now, and I feel like I can share a fair assessment. I don&#x27;t have a lot of fine lines in my face, but I do have one big one on my forehead from a lifetime of brow furrowing. While I do love this product for other reasons, it hasn&#x27;t made a difference in that wrinkle at all. What this serum HAS done, however, is lighten my freckles, brighten my complexion, and made my skin feel silky smooth. These changes make this product a huge win for me. I will gladly continue to use it and recommend it to my friends! I purchased this Silk Luxury Serum at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> This product feels AMAZING on the skin! I love it!</li>
            <li> I just started using this and I love it already, goes on smooth and feels so silky, I will update review in a month, when hopefully, I see results!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything for me. Used it for over a month</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this a good couple of weeks before reviewing this product. to be sure I could get the full effects of the serum. This stuff is great. Some serums I have tried have been too oily and give my skin a greasy look, not this stuff. Its like your skin craves it and absorbs it fully. My skin under my eyes has softened up and evened in tone. I used to be able to feel little bumps in my pores under my eyes, and they are GONE. I have been applying twice daily for 10 days now, so the results are fast.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh this stuff is awesome!! So silly and smooth, not greasy doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your skin. I have found my new daily face regiment! (Also great on hands,feet)</li>
            <li> The name &amp;#34;Silk&amp;#34; describes perfectly the serum I purchased.  What a refreshing, rejuvenating experience for my older, dry skin.  A 5-star rating is definitely deserved  Packaging and delivery were excellent..</li>
            <li> It did not deliver any result as they claim it will do to your skin. Sorry another money wasted! I would say Amazon has best costumer service.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 weeks. I apply it every night before bed after washing my face. It&#x27;s very silky and rubs into my skin nicely. Not at all greasy. I can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s there. I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in wrinkles on my forehead and around my eyes. I have sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t had any trouble with this (no irritation, acne, drying, etc). Other reviews seem to mention a great smell, however, I don&#x27;t notice any scent really at all. That&#x27;s actually a good thing since the last face serum I tried had a strong fragrance that my husband hated. You definitely don&#x27;t want a face product that your husband turns away from!! :-)  I usually pump the serum on to the back of my hand so as not to waste it moisturizing my palms (as suggested in the email info I received). Great suggestion! Makes perfect sense and has made a drastic difference in my hands. I have very dry hands, especially in the winter. For the first week I only put the serum on the back of my left hand and applied it with the fingers on my right hand. I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference between the back of my hands! My right hand was so dry, cracked, and looked so much older. I now put some on the back of both hands and I&#x27;m very happy with the improvement. Nice bonus!!  Disclosure: I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I have not been compensated in any way, nor promised any future promotions. I have no affiliation with the company at all, and I am not required to leave a positive review. All thoughts are my own and have not been influenced.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a few weeks of use before posting this review so here goes.  The fragrance is nice- a soft citrusy scent, the serum is light and and goes on smoothly without feeling heavy or greasy.  I have noticed that my skin tone is evening out, slightly, and my son spot is fading, slightly.  I&#x27;ve only been using this 1x per day and probably haven&#x27;t been on a good enough skin regimen for this product to show more improvement.  Since I have seen some improvement I will continue using this on a more regular basis and will be ordering more.  I should add that I&#x27;ve always had a really uneven tone and acne since I was a teen.  I&#x27;m hoping with longer use some of the scars will fade.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to receive this product. Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to review it&#x27;s effectiveness but was really impressed with the email from the company explaining everything about this product. It is good to know how to store it so it retains it&#x27;s potency. I have used it a couple days, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel oily. I think I am really going to like it.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Feels wonderful on my skin, even though I have used it for a short time, it seems to be working.</li>
            <li> Let me first start out by saying i&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars on my skin care and nothing really seemed to do the trick. I have small acne scars and uneven skin tone, it has been two weeks since I have been using this product (morning and night) and I really see the difference! I am hyper critical of myself but when I look at my face in the mirror my skin feels and looks tighter and the spots are fading. I absolutely love this product really hope I dont have to spend anymore then $45 on it in the future :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month now, love the feel of this. I&#x27;m almost 66 years old and know I it will take longer than someone younger than me to see all the great improvements of my skin. With that being said I feel my pores are getting smaller and my skin tone is looking so much better.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;JC from Union, Mi.</li>
            <li> Love the smooth and silky feeling and it smells wonderful with a light fragrance of citrus. I have a sun spot on my cheek that is fading and my wrinkles are lessening and my skin has a healthier tone. I love the feel - super light and smooth. I â€˜ve gave the product a good couple of weeks before reviewing to be sure I could get the full effects of the serum. The airless pump works really well and the packaging is beautiful.</li>
            <li> Sure...it smells fantastic and it has great texture ...but it didn&#x27;t do what I expected from this product , especially at that price. I am not recommending it and I am not going to buy it no more...</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and wanted to do a review on my results. This stuff is wonderful, it feels wonderful on my skin and smells wonderful. I have acne prone skin and acne scarring. It does not break me out and works well with my proactiv. It is also perfect for a pre foundation base. It leaves your skin smooth, soft, and silky which is a perfect face prep for applying foundation as it gives you a perfect canvas. I also see an improvement in my acne scarring and uneven skin time. My skin looks less tired as well. I highly recommend this serum. It&#x27;s a must for every skin care routine.</li>
            <li> This is the silkiest, softest skin oil I have tried. It goes on smoothly and not thick, for very soft skin. I just love the feel of it!</li>
            <li> I have used 2 bottles, feels nice, but does not work. Will not buy again</li>
            <li> This serum feels great on my skin and my skin loves it. My skin seems to drink it in. I have a place on my face that was damaged years ago by frostbite; using this serum has dramatically reduced the wrinkles in that spot. Love it.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered Zia Carini Silk Serum for the first time and I&#x27;m enjoying the facial benefits...love the way it feels on my skin and the wonderful citrus smell when applying.  One of the nicest vitamin C serums I&#x27;ve tried to date...will continue using to improve the texture and appearance of my aging skin.  Many thanks for offering a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Have been using Silk serum now for over a year...love the results and the wonderful fragrance...still one my favorites and will continue using!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This serum is amazing!! It smells so wonderful and truly leaves my skin feeling like silk.  It is not greasy or sticky, it is just so soft and smooth.  I am already noticing that my face is smoother and the dark circles around my eyes have lightened up. I also like that the bottle has a pump, I have gotten other brands that used a dropper and I find that the pump works out much better for me.  I will definitely continue to use this!</li>
            <li> I love this Vitamin C Serum! It goes on like silk, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin! It has a light, pleasant smell, and soaks right in! I am really hoping they will come out with more products to compliment this serum! An eye cream, and night cream would be great!</li>
            <li> Love how this stuff feels, it is truly like silk.  I added several other products at the same time that I began using this one, but my skin has never looked or felt better.  I will definitely keep this as part of my regime.</li>
            <li> I love this one so far I haven&#x27;t used it for very long. But I love all of their other products so I sure I will love this one too. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always trying out different facial serums and I like this one but I honestly prefer to use it on places other than my face, like my neck, hands and chest.  It&#x27;s a lightweight serum, smells great and makes my skin very smooth but it makes me break out on my face.  I&#x27;m extremely sensitive to that though, so I&#x27;m not surprised.  But, I&#x27;ll still continue to buy this one for my neck and decolletage.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how much I so love this product and I&#x27;m not a big beauty product type gal. I don&#x27;t wear makeup, I don&#x27;t bake in the sun, I don&#x27;t use a lot of product, but I am getting older. And since the years are coming I&#x27;ve decided to put a bit more care into my daily wash and moisturize routine. I was a bit hesitant about a &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; as I don&#x27;t like a heavy feeling on my face but this product is not heavy at all. It is a lighter serum it doesn&#x27;t feel oily and my face loves it. There is a slight, not strong at all, fragrance that is pleasant as well. I personally don&#x27;t like heavy scents so this is just perfect. I love using just this at night as I don&#x27;t feel like I have a pound of moisturizer on my face. This feels light and I so understand why its called silk because that is what my skin feels like. Even adding it to my day routine of moisturizer it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that my eyes don&#x27;t look like a crow&#x27;s feet when I wake in the morning because my skin is usually dry when I wake up. That&#x27;s a pleasant start to my day I must say. I received a discount for this product for my honest review and I don&#x27;t hesitate giving it the 5 stars it deserves. I plan on being a life long customer.</li>
            <li> When I read the other reviews I wondered why they were all saying how they loved the &amp;#34;silky feel&amp;#34; .. well, now I know!  This is not a cream that goes on your face, it&#x27;s this clear soft liquid that feels wonderful and smells like citrus.  Your fingers warm it right up so you don&#x27;t have that little &amp;#34;blast of cold&amp;#34; that you get with other products.  Your skin feels so soft even after one application.  I&#x27;ve had it for a month now and it&#x27;s really made a difference.  My lines have decreased and my skin looks healthy.  I do not wear makeup and people have commented on how much better I look lately (should I be insulted?)  Anyway .. good product!</li>
