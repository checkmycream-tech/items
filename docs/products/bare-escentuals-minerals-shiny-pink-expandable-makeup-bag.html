            <li>I can fit my mascara, foundation, lipsticks etc</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Absolutely beautiful, I feel like a queen having this pink piece of royalty.</li>
            <li>quick.  </li>
            <li>Mine still has room,  despite all that, including the huge powder compact, 4 or more lip products, and such.</li>
            <li>does not look cheaply made and works very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually quite a nice size bag</li>
            <li>and I was right.</li>
            <li>Beautiful... but won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>The color and dimensions were exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Pretty unattractive now although it still serves its purpose.</li>
            <li>The zipper is super smooth so overall</li>
            <li>way smaller than i thought it would be, i bought it to put my urban decay naked palettes in, and they dont fit length wise.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s big and it can fit all my make up and accessories.</li>
            <li>This one is reasonable compared to what I see in person in the stores.  </li>
            <li>Bought this makeup bag for my daughter and she really likes it.</li>
            <li>The price was so much cheaper than purchasing one in a store</li>
            <li>This is a really cute make-up bag; it&#x27;s a shiny pink</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very roomy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super shiny, super pink, super roomy and holds a lot without being too bulky, and it&#x27;s very well made as far as cosmetic bags go.</li>
            <li>If you need a new cosmetic bag and you like shiny pink stuff, you&#x27;ll love this bag.</li>
            <li>The metallic pink faux leather isn&#x27;t cheap or plastic looking.</li>
            <li>At least, that is what mine holds nicely in my purse.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice looking on the outside, but rather small and not sturdy.</li>
            <li>It keeps me from having to dig around in my purse or various smaller bags for items I need quickly.  </li>
            <li>i got some super light pink, flat, TINY make up with the words bare essentials on it.</li>
            <li>I figured the quality of this bag would be decent since it&#x27;s a Bare Minerals bag</li>
            <li>Used the smaller light pink bag for contact lenses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised at the price of makeup bags these days.</li>
            <li>Larger than the light pink metallic bag by Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li>The color is a pretty metallic pink.</li>
            <li>Hot pink metallic bsg.  </li>
            <li>nothing shiny about it and its more of a pale pink</li>
            <li>The size is very comfortable, for everyday use even a bit large, for travelling very small, of course.</li>
            <li>I use it to store all of my bare mineral eye shadows.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that the material is not top-quality and it already has scratches like an old worn-out thing</li>
            <li>Not even worth the few dollars I paid.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s big and it can fit all my make up and accessories.</li>
            <li> I needed a make up bag quick.  This was available fast through Prime, price was good and a nice color.  If you have shopped for makeup bags you will know how over priced they are.  This one is reasonable compared to what I see in person in the stores.  I don&#x27;t know how durable it will be, for now it is suitable for what I need it for.  I can fit my mascara, foundation, lipsticks etc and it fits in my bag just fine.</li>
            <li> if i could give this a big fat ZERO i would! i did not receive anything that looked even slightly similar to the pictured image!!! i got some super light pink, flat, TINY make up with the words bare essentials on it. i will never use it. not what i wanted. highly disappointed and dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> Bought this makeup bag for my daughter and she really likes it. Always good to make loved ones happy.</li>
            <li> The price was so much cheaper than purchasing one in a store and I didn&#x27;t have to leave the house. The color and dimensions were exactly as described. Very happy and might purchase more as gifts.</li>
            <li> I am unable to bag.  I didn&#x27;t get this bag in the mail.  I was sent a different bag.  So I don&#x27;t know how well this bag works.</li>
            <li> Instead I received a Brown bag that looks nothing like the picture shown below.  I fear that if I ordered it again I would receive yet another bag other than the pink one shown in the picture.  Considering it was so inexpensive, I would have kept it, but what I received was so cheap looking and ugly.  Not even worth the few dollars I paid.  So back it went!</li>
            <li> This is so pretty and great size to fit all my makeup.  Super girly!</li>
            <li> This is a really cute make-up bag; it&#x27;s a shiny pink and it&#x27;s very roomy. I use it to store all of my bare mineral eye shadows. It&#x27;s actually quite a nice size bag and it&#x27;s sturdy and works well!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice makeup bag.The color is a pretty metallic pink.I&#x27;m very pleased with it, and glad I got it.</li>
            <li> The quality is great. I wish the bag were a little larger, but my fault, I didn&#x27;t get out a tape measure before I ordered. I&#x27;m surprised at the price of makeup bags these days.</li>
            <li> Compared to other makeup bags I&#x27;ve purchased on AMAZON (see my reviews) not worth it.  It&#x27;s nice looking on the outside, but rather small and not sturdy.</li>
            <li> I bought this makeup bag as a gift for my cousin sister. She loved it. It is perfect size to keep the essentials and carry around in a purse.</li>
            <li> Hot pink metallic bsg.  Larger than the light pink metallic bag by Bare Minerals.  This bag fits medication bottles easily in width for great travel bag.  Used the smaller light pink bag for contact lenses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both are well constructed. They make a great set. (Sold separately).</li>
            <li> The makeup bag is the perfect size for me. I like my bags to be not too small or too big so this one is a medium size and I love it.The color is beautiful. The zipper is super smooth so overall I would totally recommend this bag it is just perfect.</li>
            <li> This cosmetic bag is awesome. It&#x27;s super shiny, super pink, super roomy and holds a lot without being too bulky, and it&#x27;s very well made as far as cosmetic bags go. I thought it would look awesome inside my transparent Furla Candy Bag and I was right. I figured the quality of this bag would be decent since it&#x27;s a Bare Minerals bag and I was not disappointed. The inside is lined and slightly padded which is nice and the shape is excellent. The metallic pink faux leather isn&#x27;t cheap or plastic looking. It&#x27;s a great bag for a great price and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. If you need a new cosmetic bag and you like shiny pink stuff, you&#x27;ll love this bag.</li>
            <li> nothing shiny about it and its more of a pale pink but it still functions</li>
            <li> Cute and  my makeup fits in bag perfect!</li>
            <li> way smaller than i thought it would be, i bought it to put my urban decay naked palettes in, and they dont fit length wise. very cute bag though!</li>
            <li> I purchased this make bag based on the dimensions listed 8x4x4.  The bag is smaller 6x3x3 and does not meet the size requirements I need.  Otherwise a cute bag.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect size and made very well I love it and am going to order a couple more to put away.</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful, I feel like a queen having this pink piece of royalty. The size is very comfortable, for everyday use even a bit large, for travelling very small, of course. The only problem is that the material is not top-quality and it already has scratches like an old worn-out thing</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size to hold makeup,  kleenex packs, hair ties, medicine, perfume, floss, hand sanitizer, and lotion... At least, that is what mine holds nicely in my purse.  It keeps me from having to dig around in my purse or various smaller bags for items I need quickly.  Mine still has room,  despite all that, including the huge powder compact, 4 or more lip products, and such.</li>
            <li> Beautiful... but won&#x27;t last long. StArts cracking soon!!!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful bag until a few months after use being in your purse, the corners wear out, turn white because the pink metallic finish rubs off :(( Sad.</li>
            <li> everything I expected. does not look cheaply made and works very well. zipper isn&#x27;t cheap either!!</li>
            <li> Bag still functional but pink outer cover has completely peeled away. Pretty unattractive now although it still serves its purpose.</li>
