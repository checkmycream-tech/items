    <ol>
            <li>Probably not the best to use this regularly/long term.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>THIS IS THE BEST MOUTHWASH I&#x27;VE</li>

            <li>Very good have been using this product for a while now and always get compliments on how good my teeth look.</li>
            <li>crest did a great job with this product</li>
            <li>But anyway, it is great for  a pre-brushing swish.</li>
            <li>I was happy to see this product offered on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Crest makes a great mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>but it still does a great job of whitening teeth.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job of freshening breath as well.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product....</li>
            <li>great product , I would  recommend it to anyone .</li>
            <li>It has a very strong alcohol taste and you may get that burning sensation in your mouth!</li>
            <li>The rinse is a good addition to the whitening strips.  </li>
            <li>Has peroxide in it and gives you the feeling it is good for your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>good product.  </li>
            <li>This is a good buy becauuse</li>
            <li>It has changed a good bit over the years</li>
            <li>Good product for oral mouthwash was and rinse, freshens breath.</li>
            <li>Good product .</li>
            <li>The best way I&#x27;ve used it with great results is flossing -&amp;#62; brushing with a whitening toothpaste -&amp;#62; rinsing with this mouthwash for 1 minute at night time (a full 1 minute gives better</li>
            <li>This mouthwash works great and tastes okay.</li>
            <li>this is great, use it 2-3 times a day, keeps my gums healthy</li>
            <li>So if you have sensitive teeth or gums this might not be the best for you, but if you don&#x27;t it&#x27;s a great option to throw into your oral hygiene routine.</li>
            <li>P.S.- was also able to use a $1.50 off coupon that I found on Amazon!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as strong as listerine which is great.</li>
            <li>Nice smell to it and works how it should.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it seems effective.</li>
            <li>I liked this item...because it does whiten temporarily.</li>
            <li>Pleasant taste, not too strong.</li>
            <li>but I ended up loving it so much more.</li>
            <li>My first time trying this product, it works good, good taste.</li>
            <li>The greatest form of praise is the sound of consecrated feet seeking out the lost and helpless.</li>
            <li>It works splendidly and (purely as a superficial aesthetic)</li>
            <li>A good mouthwash that would leave a clean refreshing taste in mouth.</li>
            <li>Love this rinse.  </li>
            <li>This does not have that &amp;#34;chalky&amp;#34; taste that most whitening mouthwashes have.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s been the most convenient way of using it.</li>
            <li>I love the taste and find it much better than sensodyne, listerine, and colgate.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE TASTE</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this out andI love how they have added peroxide into this mouthwash!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a very big bottle by the way for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;Great deal!</li>
            <li>Love it&lt;br /&gt;Great quality.</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>I have opened the bottle and will not be able to return it to Amazon..</li>
            <li>Would love to be able to return it to the manufacturer though.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it was the most affordable of mouth</li>
            <li>Love this mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I use it every day has the safe amount of peroxide so you do not hurt your teeth .</li>
            <li>This is more affordable</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean feeling to it.</li>
            <li>I would say that this is not as strong as regular Listerine, but it is the best whitening mouthwash I have found.</li>
            <li>Pretty fairly priced product.</li>
            <li>This mouthwash is by a long shot the best I have used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It does whiten your teeth and there is a significant difference!</li>
            <li>It was good as a mouth wash and is not too intense.</li>
            <li>It tastes good, leaves your mouth feeling fresh, and begins whitening teeth quickly.  </li>
            <li>Used with the other 3D products and they go perfect together.</li>
            <li>I really like the Crest 3D Whitening products and the Arctic Fresh Mouth Rinse is a great addition to the toothpaste and whitening strips.  </li>
            <li>have a strong alcohol burning sensation when you&#x27;re rinsing with this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Strong tasting</li>
            <li>Foams and leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh, not a lot of flavor but a nice rinse.  </li>
            <li>My best description of this is like a chalky-bitter taste, but it goes away in a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I appreciate that this is alcohol and fluoride free.</li>
            <li>What it does do great is maintain white teeth.  </li>
            <li>After a year of use my smile looks better and gums and teeth are doing well .</li>
            <li>So far so good, but</li>
            <li>but now my wife confirmed my breathe was supper fresh!</li>
            <li>Breath feels clean and supposedly whitens your teeth.</li>
            <li>works great, especially when using with the Arctic Fresh toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I love it because it is really work for whiting your teeth</li>
            <li>Not necessarily a bad thing, but the hydrogen peroxide (whitening agent)</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;ll feel that fresh clean tingle and suds from the peroxide&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>now that I&#x27;m pregnant I&#x27;ve found that it can irritate my gums.  </li>
            <li>I now feel a lot more confident speaking to people knowing that they can only be drawn to me by my fresh breathe.</li>
            <li>I have been using this mouth wash for several months now and I am very pleased with the whiteness and the way my mouth feels.</li>
            <li>the taste is more neutral, it doesn&#x27;t give a strong minty breath (not a big deal for me, but some like a minty</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a personal preference, but I enjoy a more liquid mouthwash</li>
            <li>In any case, it gives me fresh breath without hurting the inside of my mouth...</li>
            <li>its mouthwash, keeps my breath fresh..........</li>
            <li>TOO, MY MOUTH IS FRESH.</li>
            <li>that arctic fresh taste.</li>
            <li>and it makes for a nice white smile.</li>
            <li>but so far it has seemed to work ok.  </li>
            <li>My mouth feels fresh without the burn.  </li>
            <li>Not too much to say about this other than it gets the job done and leaves your breath smelling good and your mouth feeling fresh!</li>
            <li>and she was right about it.  </li>
            <li>This mouth wash really leaves my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>It does WORK upon your teeth whitening, it really does!</li>
            <li>Try it first @</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I can see a difference when I use its consistently.</li>
            <li>Love this product makes my teeth so white and doesn&#x27;t even take seven days like the package says I can notice a difference over night.</li>
            <li>Would prefer the more traditional type of flavor.  </li>
            <li>instead if using both individually I can use just this and get a better clean.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Satisfied with how white my teeth are.</li>
            <li>No weird alcohol taste and not too minty.</li>
            <li>Used in conjunction with Crest 3D White toothpaste its a winning combination.</li>
            <li>I have been using this mouthwash for years, it has good whitening capability if you use it everyday</li>
            <li>Very fresh feeling after using this product - even better than my old Crest 3D White rinse.</li>
            <li>The combination is quite effective in whitening your teeth and mouthwash is powerful but not harsh and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if time will tell if it gives better results in the long run.</li>
            <li>My teeth is starting to look whiter thanks to this fantastic thing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the taste of this mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know if it works.</li>
            <li>Very over priced.  </li>
            <li>I rinse before my shower, and don&#x27;t eat or drink anything while getting ready.</li>
            <li>And it was an absolute steal with the Prime</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t say I noticed much whitening in my teeth.  </li>
            <li>(That would be too much liquid.)</li>
            <li>In fact I don&#x27;t really think this whitens all that much.  </li>
            <li>I really like the taste versus listerine.  </li>
            <li>It really makes my teeth feel brittle.</li>
            <li>Do not use straight peroxide it will hurt your enamel .</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a foamy mouthwash and doesn&#x27;t do very well.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had several people comment on how white and nice my teeth</li>
            <li>I am not a huge fan of the taste, it&#x27;s got kind of a hydrogen peroxide taste to it (also a great/cheap mouthwash).</li>
            <li>Leaves your mouth feeling clean and white.  </li>
            <li>It maybe really good for the oral health as claimed, however It tastes like bad vinegar and it does not give refreshing feeling in the mouth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this particular mouthwash for a couple of months now.</li>
            <li>Seems to be working decently well.  </li>
            <li>This has done beautifully so far, and leaves a refreshing taste without the bitter burn of alcohol.</li>
            <li>I think the larger size price at Amazon is a better bargain than at my local stores and why I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li>High quality product.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I used this with Whitestrips and the rinse definitely sealed the deal for a whiter smile for my wedding.</li>
            <li>Lasts a few months or more .</li>
            <li>It turns into a thick, frothy kind of mouthwash...</li>
            <li>at least that leaves your breath feeling clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>After getting a good cleaning or using a round of white strips using this on a regular basis will keep your teeth whiter much longer.  </li>
            <li>Although, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for ppl with sensitive gums!</li>
            <li>I have ordered many times, and will continue to do so, especially since I can&#x27;t find this larger size locally!  </li>
            <li>Flavor is a little too strong for my liking</li>
            <li>I have a hard time keeping it in my mouth for more than 2 seconds.   </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting to whiten their teeth with fast results.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t work properly and has alcohol by the way so that is usually not recommended for a mouth wash.  </li>
            <li>I like those little floss picks too , well worth the money</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m convinced its better to use this as a less harsh alternative.</li>
            <li>Think of this as a really really repulsive absinthe, I could barely keep it in my mouth for a few seconds without having to spit it out.</li>
            <li>The only problem with it is sometimes the tingling is a little intense, and</li>

            <li> instead if using both individually I can use just this and get a better clean.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Satisfied with how white my teeth are.</li>
            <li> No weird alcohol taste and not too minty.</li>
            <li> Used in conjunction with Crest 3D White toothpaste its a winning combination.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mouthwash for years, it has good whitening capability if you use it everyday</li>
            <li> Very fresh feeling after using this product - even better than my old Crest 3D White rinse.</li>
            <li> The combination is quite effective in whitening your teeth and mouthwash is powerful but not harsh and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if time will tell if it gives better results in the long run.</li>
            <li> My teeth is starting to look whiter thanks to this fantastic thing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the taste of this mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know if it works.</li>
            <li> Very over priced.  </li>
            <li> I rinse before my shower, and don&#x27;t eat or drink anything while getting ready.</li>
            <li> And it was an absolute steal with the Prime</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t say I noticed much whitening in my teeth.  </li>
            <li> (That would be too much liquid.)</li>
            <li> In fact I don&#x27;t really think this whitens all that much.  </li>
            <li> I really like the taste versus listerine.  </li>
            <li> It really makes my teeth feel brittle.</li>
            <li> Do not use straight peroxide it will hurt your enamel .</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a foamy mouthwash and doesn&#x27;t do very well.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had several people comment on how white and nice my teeth</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of the taste, it&#x27;s got kind of a hydrogen peroxide taste to it (also a great/cheap mouthwash).</li>
            <li> Leaves your mouth feeling clean and white.  </li>
            <li> It maybe really good for the oral health as claimed, however It tastes like bad vinegar and it does not give refreshing feeling in the mouth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this particular mouthwash for a couple of months now.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working decently well.  </li>
            <li> This has done beautifully so far, and leaves a refreshing taste without the bitter burn of alcohol.</li>
            <li> I think the larger size price at Amazon is a better bargain than at my local stores and why I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> High quality product.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I used this with Whitestrips and the rinse definitely sealed the deal for a whiter smile for my wedding.</li>
            <li> Lasts a few months or more .</li>
            <li> It turns into a thick, frothy kind of mouthwash...</li>
            <li> at least that leaves your breath feeling clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> After getting a good cleaning or using a round of white strips using this on a regular basis will keep your teeth whiter much longer.  </li>
            <li> Although, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for ppl with sensitive gums!</li>
            <li> I have ordered many times, and will continue to do so, especially since I can&#x27;t find this larger size locally!  </li>
            <li> Flavor is a little too strong for my liking</li>
            <li> I have a hard time keeping it in my mouth for more than 2 seconds.   </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting to whiten their teeth with fast results.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t work properly and has alcohol by the way so that is usually not recommended for a mouth wash.  </li>
            <li> I like those little floss picks too , well worth the money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced its better to use this as a less harsh alternative.</li>
            <li> Think of this as a really really repulsive absinthe, I could barely keep it in my mouth for a few seconds without having to spit it out.</li>
            <li> The only problem with it is sometimes the tingling is a little intense, and</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s clear and can be a little hard to see exactly how much I poured into my little dixie cup.</li>
            <li> The whitening rinses always have a distinct taste due to their ingredients but it isn&#x27;t excessive.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t know the long term results for a while</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> This might whiten my teeth and perform other miracles but it tastes gross.  </li>
            <li> but it can sometimes dry out the inside of your mouth and cause peeling</li>
            <li> I am not normally very good at consistently using mouthwash but this one (for some reason) has been different.  </li>
            <li> Have been trying to use it up for the last year and still have half a bottle but don&#x27;t want to be wasteful.</li>
            <li> I have used a few different whitening mouthwashes but none that worked as well as this one.  </li>
            <li> My teeth ARE getting whiter, but I don&#x27;t know if I should attribute it to this mouthwash or all the items or some of the OTHER items I&#x27;m using.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t minty like other washes.  </li>
            <li> the packaging suits my other purple/silver furnishings in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Keeps breath fresh long after brushing without leaving unpleasant minty taste in mouth or burning when swishing.</li>
            <li> However, I notice the difference after 3 days of consecutive use, not right away.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that this mouthwash tastes a little funny and leaves a weird taste in your mouth.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as harsh as some of the previous 3d mouthwashes, and everything was shipped on time.</li>
            <li> I also have noticed it has lightened up my teeth a little.</li>
            <li> Save yourself the trouble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it works or not.  </li>
            <li> not sure I can say it helps with whitening, but like the mouthwash aspect of it</li>
            <li> Not sure I will buy again because of this.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s been 3 weeks, and the difference is hardly visible, with twice/day use.</li>
            <li> If u look on line you find that mouthwashes, unless organic or natural, are bad for u</li>
            <li> Wife and I both commented to each other how it has a bit of a weird flavor.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that it took four days to get here, but that&#x27;s Amazon&#x27;s bad, not Crest&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The taste is too bad for me to use it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Almost everyone knows how to brush their teeth, so please excuse the boring and graphic details.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day, morning and night and gargle/rinse my mouth for approximately 60 seconds.</li>
            <li> plus it has bad after taste not worth it</li>
            <li> I noticed a slight bleachy after taste but not to bad.</li>
            <li> Horrible, horrible taste.  </li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
            <li> I used to have terrible breathe</li>
            <li> Tastes Horrible and leaves a film on your teeth.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this mouthwash for its whitening effects and have been using it on-and-off for a year now. It does whiten your teeth and I&#x27;ve had several people comment on how white and nice my teeth look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It does whiten your teeth and there is a significant difference! However, I notice the difference after 3 days of consecutive use, not right away. The best way I&#x27;ve used it with great results is flossing -&amp;#62; brushing with a whitening toothpaste -&amp;#62; rinsing with this mouthwash for 1 minute at night time (a full 1 minute gives better results).&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t have a strong alcohol burning sensation when you&#x27;re rinsing with this.&lt;br /&gt;-Even rinsing with a tiny amount will help your teeth become whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s foamy. Not necessarily a bad thing, but the hydrogen peroxide (whitening agent) in it makes it foamy. It&#x27;s a personal preference, but I enjoy a more liquid mouthwash so you can actually feel the &amp;#34;swoosh.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;-It is NOT alcohol-free. It has 5% alcohol, which studies have shown that mouthwashes with alcohol might increase the risk of oral cancer.&lt;br /&gt;-Since the taste is more neutral, it doesn&#x27;t give a strong minty breath (not a big deal for me, but some like a minty breath).&lt;br /&gt;-The whiteness fades away once you stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;-It has citric acid in it, which can erode your enamel. Probably not the best to use this regularly/long term.</li>
            <li> Flavor is a little too strong for my liking</li>
            <li> I purchased this mouthwash as a follow-up to the Crest 3D tooth whitening kit.  My teeth ARE getting whiter, but I don&#x27;t know if I should attribute it to this mouthwash or all the items or some of the OTHER items I&#x27;m using.  In any case, it gives me fresh breath without hurting the inside of my mouth...a big plus in my book.</li>
            <li> Think of this as a really really repulsive absinthe, I could barely keep it in my mouth for a few seconds without having to spit it out. I had to dump what not already spilled in the box in the sink. Save yourself the trouble.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the taste of this mouthwash.  It isn&#x27;t minty like other washes.  I don&#x27;t really know if it works.</li>
            <li> Love this rinse.  Leaves your mouth feeling clean and white.  I used this with Whitestrips and the rinse definitely sealed the deal for a whiter smile for my wedding.</li>
            <li> My dentist Recommended this line of crest products and I have to admit I like how well it works. I use this in the morning and sensodyne before bed.</li>
            <li> Great product! It does WORK upon your teeth whitening, it really does! Although, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for ppl with sensitive gums! It has a very strong alcohol taste and you may get that burning sensation in your mouth! Try it first @ your local supermarkets b4 you order it on-line! Just a piece of advice!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. A good mouthwash that would leave a clean refreshing taste in mouth. This does not have that &amp;#34;chalky&amp;#34; taste that most whitening mouthwashes have. I would say that this is not as strong as regular Listerine, but it is the best whitening mouthwash I have found.</li>
            <li> I noticed whiter teeth after only a couple of uses. Pretty fairly priced product. I can&#x27;t complain about this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it works or not.  I couldn&#x27;t continue using it.  The taste is too bad for me to use it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this particular mouthwash for a couple of months now. I use it twice a day, morning and night and gargle/rinse my mouth for approximately 60 seconds. At about 2 weeks into it I started noticing results! I knew these results were valid and not just my imagination because I was getting compliments regarding the whiteness of my teeth at work and from my friends. I definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting to whiten their teeth with fast results. My only complaint is that this mouthwash tastes a little funny and leaves a weird taste in your mouth. My best description of this is like a chalky-bitter taste, but it goes away in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Nice smell to it and works how it should. Used with the other 3D products and they go perfect together.</li>
            <li> Tastes and feels like bleach.  Horrible, horrible taste.  I felt like I had to wash it out immediately after using or my teeth would fall out.  Awful.</li>
            <li> Very over priced.  I thought there were three bottles not just one.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that this is alcohol and fluoride free. I use it daily, and have had no problems. I rinse before my shower, and don&#x27;t eat or drink anything while getting ready. That&#x27;s been the most convenient way of using it. I wouldn&#x27;t use it before bed, if you don&#x27;t wish to have the lingering &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; that some speak of. I love the taste and find it much better than sensodyne, listerine, and colgate.</li>
            <li> Very good have been using this product for a while now and always get compliments on how good my teeth look.</li>
            <li> My first time trying this product, it works good, good taste. It isn&#x27;t an all-in-one just a teeth cleaner. It does foam up when using. I noticed a slight bleachy after taste but not to bad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the taste of this mouthwash, but it does the job. I can see a difference when I use its consistently. I will probably repurchase this when it runs out..</li>
            <li> I have been using this mouthwash for years, it has good whitening capability if you use it everyday but it can sometimes dry out the inside of your mouth and cause peeling</li>
            <li> its mouthwash, keeps my breath fresh.......... not sure I can say it helps with whitening, but like the mouthwash aspect of it</li>
            <li> The highest form of worship is the worship of unselfish Christian service. The greatest form of praise is the sound of consecrated feet seeking out the lost and helpless.</li>
            <li> Realized the danger in this. Ended up getting rid of it. If u look on line you find that mouthwashes, unless organic or natural, are bad for u</li>
            <li> The rinse is a good addition to the whitening strips.  You can tell that the product is doing what it is meant to.</li>
            <li> Has peroxide in it and gives you the feeling it is good for your teeth and gums. Pleasant taste, not too strong. I will continue to purchase!</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is by a long shot the best I have used. I used to have terrible breathe but now my wife confirmed my breathe was supper fresh! I now feel a lot more confident speaking to people knowing that they can only be drawn to me by my fresh breathe.</li>
            <li> I was using the Colgate version, which gave me immediate results, and required daily use. The Crest whitening products are so well rated I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. But it&#x27;s been 3 weeks, and the difference is hardly visible, with twice/day use. I don&#x27;t know if time will tell if it gives better results in the long run.</li>
            <li> I truly do think this helps to keep my teeth whitened. Along with the toothpaste. I don&#x27;t have to use my teeth whitening from the Dentist so often</li>
            <li> this was definitely mouthwash</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST MOUTHWASH I&#x27;VE EVER USE WILL KEEP ON BUYING I LOVE THE TASTE TOO, MY MOUTH IS FRESH.</li>
            <li> Very fresh feeling after using this product - even better than my old Crest 3D White rinse. And it was an absolute steal with the Prime price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it took four days to get here, but that&#x27;s Amazon&#x27;s bad, not Crest&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Love this product makes my teeth so white and doesn&#x27;t even take seven days like the package says I can notice a difference over night.</li>
            <li> My teeth is starting to look whiter thanks to this fantastic thing. It isn&#x27;t as strong as listerine which is great.</li>
            <li> Wife and I both commented to each other how it has a bit of a weird flavor.  Not sure I will buy again because of this.  Would prefer the more traditional type of flavor.  Also, it&#x27;s clear and can be a little hard to see exactly how much I poured into my little dixie cup. Otherwise, it seems effective.</li>
            <li> Ive been using only the crest 3d white toothpaste and whitening strips for quite sometime now&lt;br /&gt;So I wanted to try this out andI love how they have added peroxide into this mouthwash!&lt;br /&gt;So instead if using both individually I can use just this and get a better clean.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t even taste it but you&#x27;ll feel that fresh clean tingle and suds from the peroxide&lt;br /&gt;With that arctic fresh taste. This is a very big bottle by the way for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;Great deal!</li>
            <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt;Great quality. When it comes to amazon and saving money this is the place to do it. Thanks</li>
            <li> The bast seller&lt;br /&gt;I love the freash&lt;br /&gt;It is greet to ues and ti is lot of freash to ues for 3 month</li>
            <li> Seems to be working decently well.  Have never used whitening strips before, but used listerine pre brush rinse before.  Satisfied with how white my teeth are.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. My teeth are already very white, but I use this as maintenance.</li>
            <li> this mouth wash does the job it really does give you white teeth if you use it everyday. crest did a great job with this product</li>
            <li> good product.  i can&#x27;t say I noticed much whitening in my teeth.  It was good as a mouth wash and is not too intense.</li>
            <li> This mouth wash really leaves my mouth feeling clean. And minty. I also have noticed it has lightened up my teeth a little. Use in conjunction with crest 3d tooth paste and it makes for a nice white smile.</li>
            <li> Foams and leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh, not a lot of flavor but a nice rinse.  Will continue to get from subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks. I don&#x27;t see any difference yet and i&#x27;m not that found of the foam.</li>
            <li> Almost everyone knows how to brush their teeth, so please excuse the boring and graphic details. But anyway, it is great for  a pre-brushing swish. But then I leave it in my mouth while I am brushing my teeth with toothpaste. The only difference is that I don&#x27;t wet the (soft) toothbrush with water before brushing. (That would be too much liquid.) After rinsing, and tongue brushing, I floss, and rinse again. I think it definately helps. This is a good buy becauuse it is much more expensive at the store.</li>
            <li> I got this to help keep my teeth white between using white strips.  I won&#x27;t know the long term results for a while but so far it has seemed to work ok.  The whitening rinses always have a distinct taste due to their ingredients but it isn&#x27;t excessive.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mouth wash for several months now and I am very pleased with the whiteness and the way my mouth feels.</li>
            <li> I was happy to see this product offered on Amazon.  I have regularly purchased this at the grocery store and now I don&#x27;t have to.  No weird alcohol taste and not too minty. Crest makes a great mouthwash.  P.S.- was also able to use a $1.50 off coupon that I found on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I began using Crest whitening rinse when I had braces over 8 years ago, and couldn&#x27;t use whitestrips.  It has changed a good bit over the years but it still does a great job of whitening teeth.  It tastes good, leaves your mouth feeling fresh, and begins whitening teeth quickly.  It does a great job of freshening breath as well.  The only problem with it is sometimes the tingling is a little intense, and now that I&#x27;m pregnant I&#x27;ve found that it can irritate my gums.  So if you have sensitive teeth or gums this might not be the best for you, but if you don&#x27;t it&#x27;s a great option to throw into your oral hygiene routine.</li>
            <li> I have used a few different whitening mouthwashes but none that worked as well as this one.  This is not going to work as well as white strips do.  In fact I don&#x27;t really think this whitens all that much.  What it does do great is maintain white teeth.  After getting a good cleaning or using a round of white strips using this on a regular basis will keep your teeth whiter much longer.  I am not a huge fan of the taste, it&#x27;s got kind of a hydrogen peroxide taste to it (also a great/cheap mouthwash).</li>
            <li> I really like the taste versus listerine.  My mouth feels fresh without the burn.  I&#x27;m convinced its better to use this as a less harsh alternative.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash works great and tastes okay.</li>
            <li> as advertised - convenient delivery</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  My dental hygienist recommended it and she was right about it.  It&#x27;s also a lot cheaper than Crest White Strips but has the same whitening effects.</li>
            <li> I use it all of the time.  Nothing else</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome and definitely works, there is just a horrible aftertaste.</li>
            <li> It felt like this product is corroding my teeth, just after 2 uses. I have opened the bottle and will not be able to return it to Amazon.. Would love to be able to return it to the manufacturer though. It really makes my teeth feel brittle.</li>
            <li> Well, I like how it tastes but can&#x27;t speak for its whitening ability at the moment.  It has a nice clean feeling to it.</li>
            <li> It maybe really good for the oral health as claimed, however It tastes like bad vinegar and it does not give refreshing feeling in the mouth</li>
            <li> Not too much to say about this other than it gets the job done and leaves your breath smelling good and your mouth feeling fresh!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time. I love it because it is really work for whiting your teeth</li>
            <li> Low alcohol percentage (5%) means no sting. Breath feels clean and supposedly whitens your teeth. I bought this product because it was the most affordable of mouth washes on Amazon I could find. High quality product.</li>
            <li> I have ordered many times, and will continue to do so, especially since I can&#x27;t find this larger size locally!  This is a great product....works great, especially when using with the Arctic Fresh toothpaste.  I order both from Amazon, as the prices are cheaper than local stores, too!</li>
            <li> Love this mouthwash. Refreshes my mouth and keeps my teeth white and glossy! I use with the Crest 3D white toothpaste.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t work properly and has alcohol by the way so that is usually not recommended for a mouth wash.  plus it has bad after taste not worth it</li>
            <li> I actually received a different product but I ended up loving it so much more. I actually received a purple mouthwash from Crest called the 3D Luxe. It works splendidly and (purely as a superficial aesthetic) the packaging suits my other purple/silver furnishings in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I liked this item...because it does whiten temporarily. BUT - the mouthwash is sort of chalky white and you have to rinse it out well because it leaves a gross residue. It turns into a thick, frothy kind of mouthwash... I say use the 3D white toothpaste instead....at least that leaves your breath feeling clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> Keeps breath fresh long after brushing without leaving unpleasant minty taste in mouth or burning when swishing. Our go-to mouthwash!</li>
            <li> great product , I would  recommend it to anyone . Good product for oral mouthwash was and rinse, freshens breath.</li>
            <li> this is great, use it 2-3 times a day, keeps my gums healthy</li>
            <li> I use it every day has the safe amount of peroxide so you do not hurt your teeth . This is more affordable then the competition when you purchase the quart size . Lasts a few months or more . After a year of use my smile looks better and gums and teeth are doing well . Simply rinse while shaving , floss and brush . I like those little floss picks too , well worth the money and as you see the difference your brushing habits improve . Good product . Do not use straight peroxide it will hurt your enamel .</li>
            <li> My teeth feel fresher with this mouthwash. It isn&#x27;t as harsh as some of the previous 3d mouthwashes, and everything was shipped on time. Always a plus!</li>
            <li> Tastes Horrible and leaves a film on your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it gets the job done though...</li>
            <li> Been on the lookout for a mouthwash that doesn&#x27;t burn and also whitens. This has done beautifully so far, and leaves a refreshing taste without the bitter burn of alcohol.</li>
            <li> I am not normally very good at consistently using mouthwash but this one (for some reason) has been different.  I like the taste, it leaves my mouth &#x27;tingly&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This might whiten my teeth and perform other miracles but it tastes gross.  I have a hard time keeping it in my mouth for more than 2 seconds.   Have been trying to use it up for the last year and still have half a bottle but don&#x27;t want to be wasteful.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a foamy mouthwash and doesn&#x27;t do very well. I end up having to rinse my mouth out after I use it.</li>
            <li> Strong tasting but it actually made my husband&#x27;s and my teeth whiter after about a week, using once a day before bed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks with a noticeable difference.  (improvement).  Used in conjunction with Crest 3D White toothpaste its a winning combination.</li>
            <li> I bought this product along with the Crest Whitening Strips and toothpaste. The combination is quite effective in whitening your teeth and mouthwash is powerful but not harsh and lasts a long time. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> After getting whitening done at the dentist or using an at home treatment, I think that this product has been keeping the whiteness that I achieved</li>
            <li> I really like the Crest 3D Whitening products and the Arctic Fresh Mouth Rinse is a great addition to the toothpaste and whitening strips.  I think the larger size price at Amazon is a better bargain than at my local stores and why I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> So far so good, but I do not know if the whitening effect will be taken as what it&#x27;s described on the product information page. Let&#x27;s wait for a month or two to see its effect. Thus, a 4-star is given to the product.</li>
