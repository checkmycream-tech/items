            <li>I was very dispointed.</li>
            <li>it is quick and it will last even longer.</li>
            <li>I do not know if it would work on someone that is hairy, as there was very light to little hair to began with to work on.</li>
            <li>To my amazement, a few minutes on each leg resulted in very smooth and razor nick-free legs.  </li>
            <li>First I&#x27;ll tell you having used the Smooth Away vs these these are a little rougher</li>
            <li>Though it&#x27;s no as popular anymore, I&#x27;m not ready to give up the use of this product, and I know I have been using it at least a year, so I just bought 4 packages dirt cheap on ebay.</li>

            <li>Very gentle upon the skin, even after stroking the same area 10 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved and I used to buy in stores before they stopped selling them in my area but turns out they are Silky Smooth by Body Trends my bad for not double checking, but for the price I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>the irritation bumps are back very pissed off</li>
            <li>/&gt;For those with sensitive skins there is no pain that was felt.</li>
            <li>so if you have sensitive skin you probably shouldn&#x27;t use these.</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>I did try using these in one line on my leg on without using the no no before using it own and after 5 sets up and down, circling up and then circling down in the opposite direction equaling one set, and I still had a 1/4 of the hair so on these</li>
            <li>That is the major draw-back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe because I can actually see what I am doing since I wear glasses and can&#x27;t very well use them in the shower and dry shaving is not an option.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> takes a lot of scrubbing to remove a lil bit of hair would of been faster to use a razor</li>
            <li> Works great and a good price. My advice, go ahead and buy extra pads.</li>
            <li> Was happy when I got done using it thought I finally had a solution to getting rid of the irritation bumps from shaving but as soon as I jumped in the shower my legs started burning n the irritation bumps are back very pissed off</li>
            <li> I was excited about this product because I hate to shave, but sadly, it doesn&#x27;t work.  not even a little bit.  I wish I had my $10 back.</li>
            <li> I picked up the product today at my local ACO Hardware store for $2.99.   I do not enjoy shaving my legs and I figured for $2.99 - it&#x27;s worth a try.   To my amazement, a few minutes on each leg resulted in very smooth and razor nick-free legs.  I did have to use one \\&quot;flex-crystal\\&quot; pad on each leg.  Don&#x27;t know how long the smoothness will last, but for the immediate day or two, it&#x27;s great.  Would like to be able to purchase additional replacement pads, but for the low cost - I guess I can afford to buy new kits as needed.</li>
            <li> Brought this product today for $3.00. The box reads the following:&lt;br /&gt;1 Travel Case&lt;br /&gt;1 large backing pad&lt;br /&gt;1 Small backing pad&lt;br /&gt;Extra 4 large flex-crystal replacement pads&lt;br /&gt;Extra 4 small flex-crystal replacement pads&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opening the box contains a very cheap and flimsy plastic \\&quot;travel case\\&quot; with the \\&quot;made in china\\&quot; stamped upon its sleeve. Inside of the case were the two backing pads. The \\&quot;Extra\\&quot; crystal pads are not extras, but what is needed to use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions was very easy to read. Circle clockwise three times, circle counter-clockwise 3 times with little pressure until hair is removed. As easy as it sounds, I was somewhat disappointed at the time it took for the product to work. First it seemed that it wasn&#x27;t working at all, but after 10 \\&quot;strokes\\&quot; I began to see and feel the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would have been better if the product would have worked instantly. I do not know if it would work on someone that is hairy, as there was very light to little hair to began with to work on. Much better than receiving razor bumps/cuts from using a razor, but not for those in a hurry. This product takes time to use, it works, but it takes time. That is the major draw-back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the backings themselves they are made of a very flexible and comfortable plastic that can bend within the hand. Very nice when those different places needed extra touches!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not to be used with those with skin problems/diabetic, with any oils/moisture. The skin must be completely dry in order for the product to work properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those with sensitive skins there is no pain that was felt. Very gentle upon the skin, even after stroking the same area 10 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice product to start with pre-teens or those with sensitive skin. Not a good product for those in a hurry or want to see quicker results.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical of this, but it completely got rid of the dark, gross hair on my stomach. It takes a bit of time, but it does work. You have to be careful to use it as directed: be very, very light on the pressure, and alternate rotations. It does take a bit longer than shaving but it&#x27;s worth it to avoid razor burn and the pain of waxing.</li>
            <li> It is just OK, not as easy as I had thought.  I had bought it for my chin and lip, yes some does come off but I still have to pluck.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t  think it works any better than anything else seen on TV. Was very disappointed. Should have known better. Waste of money</li>
            <li> not sure why I&#x27;m surprised - I bought it on a whim to see if it would work. It doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s almost like sanding your hair off.</li>
            <li> Very poorly made. Wouldn&#x27;t recommended. Not at all like the ones that are as seen on TV. Comes in ugly brown, cheap case.</li>
            <li> When I used these it irritated my skin so badly I couldn&#x27;t wear pants! It&#x27;s basically a fine sheet of sand paper that you use on your skin to rub the hair away. It left a rash and felt like a rug burn. Every pad only lasted for one use which was a shame. I would NOT recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Gives me feeling worse than razor burn my skin is all patchy and red. It hurts... and i still have hair... it sand papers your skin off....</li>
            <li> This product did not work at all for me.  The vendor was kind enough to return my money.  I was grateful for that.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, good product works well. The pads wear out fast though.</li>
            <li> better off buying snad paper than this stuff.</li>
            <li> I even have hair that just stopped growing.  I had some bristly hairs and some just stopped growing, others are just getting finer with time. Though it&#x27;s no as popular anymore, I&#x27;m not ready to give up the use of this product, and I know I have been using it at least a year, so I just bought 4 packages dirt cheap on ebay. This has to be cheaper than laser, and I don&#x27;t miss the wax strips, the bleach creams. This is my favourite!</li>
            <li> First I thought I ordered the Smooth Away I loved and I used to buy in stores before they stopped selling them in my area but turns out they are Silky Smooth by Body Trends my bad for not double checking, but for the price I can&#x27;t complain. First I&#x27;ll tell you having used the Smooth Away vs these these are a little rougher so if you have sensitive skin you probably shouldn&#x27;t use these. Second I used to use Smooth Away on their own and it was time consuming but worked so much better then shaving for me because when I shave I always have stubble or patches left and I don&#x27;t get that with buffers. Yes they are like a fine sandpaper and if you use them in one spot for too long you will turn your skin red, or can even take off the skin and not just the dried dead skin. Maybe because I can actually see what I am doing since I wear glasses and can&#x27;t very well use them in the shower and dry shaving is not an option. Third I got these to replace the no no buffers. The no no buffers are awful they don&#x27;t last even one time after using the no no these are made to last a few times normally. As I already stated using the smooth away they take a bit of time to use but when you pair it with the no no wow it is quick and it will last even longer. I did the no no then buffed with these and it was great. I didn&#x27;t get any over buffing redness and it was quick. I buffed in small circles moving in a line down my leg once, back up my leg rotating (circling) in the opposite direction, then back down rotating in the opposite direction and back up rotating in the opposite direction and my hair was gone and my legs were silky smooth. I did the same thing with my face and underarms and again no over buffing irritation. I did try using these in one line on my leg on without using the no no before using it own and after 5 sets up and down, circling up and then circling down in the opposite direction equaling one set, and I still had a 1/4 of the hair so on these I think they are good but I think they are even better if paired with something else.&lt;br /&gt;Even though I love these paired with my no no pro I am only giving it 3 stars is because on it&#x27;s own I like them but if you have long hair you&#x27;re not going to be able to get rid of it all in one day and you&#x27;ll have to do it everyday for a few days so that you don&#x27;t over buff until it is all gone then every couple days plus those with sensitive skin may have some problems with these because they are rougher than the smooth away brand.they are even better if paired with something else.&lt;br /&gt;Even though I love these paired with my no no pro I am only giving it 3 stars is because on it&#x27;s own I like them but if you have long hair you&#x27;re not going to be able to get rid of it all in one day and you&#x27;ll have to do it everyday for a few days so that you don&#x27;t over buff until it is all gone then every couple days plus those with sensitive skin may have some problems with these because they are rougher than the smooth away brand.</li>
            <li> I looked at the description &amp; all details I could to see if it could be used on head &amp; it said nothing intill i had opened the package &amp; on a small piece of paper it says not to use on head which is the only reason I had purchesed it. I was very dispointed.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it. I think is the same as shave.</li>
