            <li>I wore this on my honeymoon over 22 years ago, and it is still one of my favorite fragrances.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for years, and appreciate still be able to purchase it even though it&#x27;s no longer manufactured.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and have received a myriad of compliments from friends and family members.</li>
            <li>I love those fragrances too.</li>
            <li>The price was fantastic!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad this is out to buy again.</li>
            <li>I get compliments all the time :)</li>
            <li>I have worn this cologne for 25 years and I still love it and get complimented on it.</li>
            <li>It smells even better that I remembered.  </li>
            <li>My husband used this for many years and wanted some more</li>
            <li>I was so glad that I was able to find the cologne for him.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I love curve and Mambo from Liz Claiborne</li>
            <li>One of my favorite Colognes.</li>
            <li>This cologne appeals to many others, as I have had many many types of cologne</li>
            <li>when I hug women, they sniff me while placing their head on my chest and with a very pleasant smile on there face, they simply say to me you smell good.</li>
            <li>This is a GREAT classic scent.</li>
            <li>Quick response and my husband&#x27;s favorite!</li>
            <li>, all the ladies seem to like,i think I made a pretty good choice.</li>
            <li>I been used to this cologne for a very long time, the price was so very good, and IÂ´m using it every day!!</li>
            <li>I love the smell isn&#x27;t too strong</li>
            <li>It just smells great, and people will notice it if they get near you.</li>
            <li>This cologne has a nice fresh smell.</li>
            <li>the upside, the seller was great and shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>The smell is very mild.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to find it here and also at such a great price.</li>
            <li>it is never too strong or smells overly perfumed or loud, but it has a crisp clean wonderful fragrance that everyone must enjoy.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a bit strong smelling to me,I think it smells more like something a woman would be drawn too,but for the price it&#x27;s well worth it,nice size bottle.</li>
            <li>It smelled great thin and it smells great now.</li>
            <li>i liked it so much that i wanted to get me another bottle</li>
            <li>even fit to leave in the bathroom for air freshener.</li>
            <li>but smooth smell as you pass others</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was great but this will probably be a last resort Cologne...</li>
            <li>I loved this cologne in the early 1990&#x27;s and decided to pick up a bottle</li>
            <li>I am blown away by how easy to order, how great the pricing is,  how fabulous the cologne itself is and most especially, how FAST my order arrives!  </li>
            <li>Very fresh and light.  </li>
            <li>a classic scent i wore this when i was a teenager it smells way better as a grown sexy man</li>
            <li>I was excited to find it at Amazon and took a chance, but either our sense of smell has changed or this is just a cheap knock-off...</li>
            <li>Honey was so excited that I found the scent that he wore &amp;#34;back in the day&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Now, you can see by his clean wife and kids that he has access to a shower, just chooses, for whatever reason, to avoid it like the plague.</li>
            <li>To be honest with you its pretty decent, its great for the early morning, really smooth and gentle.</li>
            <li>Oh, Sweet Baby Jesus, I&#x27;m so thankful that I didn&#x27;t meet him then, because this would have defo put a damper on the romance!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>years later I came across it again for $12, it was too good a deal to pass up.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much : )&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Fresh and so clean clean</li>
            <li>But quick response and refund.</li>
            <li>The scent seems to wear off quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love the classic colognes from the 90&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite all around colognes in my top 5 for sure, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this cologne as a daily wear, or to add to a collection of scents.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li>Excellent product, super fast shipping, only the packaging could be a little more secure.</li>
            <li>Awesome thanks for the blast from the past</li>
            <li>I love this cologne and intend on buying many more bottles as this cologne is hard to find</li>
            <li>Over all well worth my money.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is still just as fresh as it was when it came out years ago.</li>
            <li>i ordered it right away .</li>
            <li>Great price for a daily wear cologne at office and such.  </li>
            <li>An old standby back in the day that still smells good.</li>
            <li>It will be a gift for someone I don&#x27;t like very much.</li>
            <li>The fact that it is very reasonably priced doesn&#x27;t hurt either.</li>
            <li>Thanks!    </li>
            <li>Thanks!    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure those are &amp;#34;Curly-Q&amp;#34; french fries he&#x27;s got stuck on his untied shoelaces....</li>
            <li>Now I am a married man.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh citrius smell which my boyfriend really likes.</li>
            <li>Exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li>be buying this again in the future for sure.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>This was my first time buying it...</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Get this cologne if youve never tried it before I promise youll be back for more.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s Monster Truck day at the fair, and you&#x27;re waiting in line for your funnel cake, the grease hanging heavily in the air.</li>
            <li>this is now where near the original.</li>
            <li>Delivered in less than 36 hours, clean, fresh and sweet scent....that lasts!</li>
            <li>I used to have this same cologne back in the day and the memories were good</li>
            <li>First, the reason I gave this a three star review was purely for the fact that I got this for my husband</li>
            <li>Now, the bottle is a large size, the packaging was department store quality, the shipping was timely, and of course the value was excellent, but I just hate the smell and couldn&#x27;t bring myself to give it any more stars.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I found it after a long search.</li>
            <li>The scent remained, although much weaker than when first sprayed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strange that everyone love this fragrance, but no one seems to know the bargain of what their sense of smell enjoys so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all good because he&#x27;d obviously bathed himself in the $2.00 &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34; that his kids bought him for Father&#x27;s Day 13 years ago, at the little elementary school store set up by the PTA to let kids shop for their Dear Ol&#x27; Dad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really the smell and the way this cologne is packaged and the design.</li>
            <li>It is really a shame that we cannot trust this channel of distribution any longer.</li>
            <li>He really likes it.  </li>
            <li>It can be overpowering if you spray too much on yourelf.</li>
            <li>thanks to tuccini company for the delivery of ths product.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery....</li>
            <li>\\&quot;you really smell good\\&quot;</li>
            <li>cologne packing looked used and the top of the bottle was wet..</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s not broken why then fix it, or so the saying goes.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this smells.  </li>
            <li>I really like the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for getting it to me so soon.</li>
            <li>so you have to touch up once or twice  a day or put too much on which</li>
            <li>The mysteries were not mine, my wifes  Thanks</li>
            <li>It does not last as the original version.</li>
            <li>The best part was that the amazon shipping box (the small one) was actually wrapped in a plastic bag and taped before it was put into the larger box and shipped to me...</li>
            <li>It kinda has that same clean smell</li>
            <li>The cologne kind of reminds me of a citrusy, mossy, scent similar to Hugo Boss yet less powerful.  </li>
            <li>I finally used the last of a bottle I&#x27;d had for quite awhile and was looking for some more.  </li>
            <li>Mr. Greasy Sh*tpants is in front of you, wearing most of the several Italian sausages and pulled-pork sandwiches</li>
            <li>This cologne is a classic.</li>
            <li>A classic scent.</li>
            <li>Would highly recomand both to anyone.  </li>
            <li>I used this stuff in Jr. high and high school.</li>
            <li>kinda scent added,  when I wore it back in the day it smelled clean, crisp and had a slight sweet scent  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>As it arrived I decided to spray two sprays and come back a day later to see if it was strong enough to stay or how quickly it faded.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is light enough that you really cannot overuse it, even with several sprays.</li>
            <li>but is the same adress  i use to received the first one order.</li>
            <li>if im not the first person to open it</li>
            <li>The first one I had came in a smaller bottle.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>a little strong for me</li>
            <li>I know this is an oldie, but have always enjoyed the clean scent for work and casual occasions.  </li>
            <li>This was my first plunge into designer fragrances back in the early 90&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t tested it, be careful and try it in person first!</li>
            <li>I like LIZ Clairborne for men but the version sold at amazon was completely dissappointing.</li>
            <li>And for the price, WOW.</li>
            <li>I have been using Claiborne for men since it was introduced in the early 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Smells great,and last the whole day.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>some go as far as to say &amp;#34; I just want to lay here for a while.</li>
            <li>However I thought that I would surprise her with my trusty old lady killer and of course, she was quite please with the scent as well.</li>
            <li>My gf said I smell like an old man at salvation army.</li>
            <li>This is a direct comparison to what I have sitting on my shelf.  </li>
            <li>Great for a casual once in awhile cologne!</li>
            <li>since it was so long ago I can&#x27;t really tell.</li>
            <li>I pour a lot of this bottled water everyday and the fragance fade away so quickly that I am NOT LONGER buying the promotions offered at Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is not as expensive as other but it smells great.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t go wrong my daughters old and young love it and ladies</li>
            <li>only way I can describe this stench is thusly: Have you ever gone to the county fair and had the pleasure of standing downwind of the greasy guy in filthy sweatpants with a very suspect butt stain, and sweaty, old teeshirt?</li>
            <li>I really think my money was well spent!</li>
            <li>I have purchased this cologne in the past from department stores, and the product I received did not smell right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering, not too weak, yet strong enough to last all day.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I wore this on my honeymoon over 22 years ago, and it is still one of my favorite fragrances.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for years, and appreciate still be able to purchase it even though it&#x27;s no longer manufactured.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and have received a myriad of compliments from friends and family members.</li>
            <li> I love those fragrances too.</li>
            <li> The price was fantastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad this is out to buy again.</li>
            <li> I get compliments all the time :)</li>
            <li> I have worn this cologne for 25 years and I still love it and get complimented on it.</li>
            <li> It smells even better that I remembered.  </li>
            <li> My husband used this for many years and wanted some more</li>
            <li> I was so glad that I was able to find the cologne for him.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I love curve and Mambo from Liz Claiborne</li>
            <li> One of my favorite Colognes.</li>
            <li> This cologne appeals to many others, as I have had many many types of cologne</li>
            <li> when I hug women, they sniff me while placing their head on my chest and with a very pleasant smile on there face, they simply say to me you smell good.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT classic scent.</li>
            <li> Quick response and my husband&#x27;s favorite!</li>
            <li> , all the ladies seem to like,i think I made a pretty good choice.</li>
            <li> I been used to this cologne for a very long time, the price was so very good, and IÂ´m using it every day!!</li>
            <li> I love the smell isn&#x27;t too strong</li>
            <li> It just smells great, and people will notice it if they get near you.</li>
            <li> This cologne has a nice fresh smell.</li>
            <li> the upside, the seller was great and shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> The smell is very mild.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to find it here and also at such a great price.</li>
            <li> it is never too strong or smells overly perfumed or loud, but it has a crisp clean wonderful fragrance that everyone must enjoy.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a bit strong smelling to me,I think it smells more like something a woman would be drawn too,but for the price it&#x27;s well worth it,nice size bottle.</li>
            <li> It smelled great thin and it smells great now.</li>
            <li> i liked it so much that i wanted to get me another bottle</li>
            <li> even fit to leave in the bathroom for air freshener.</li>
            <li> but smooth smell as you pass others</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was great but this will probably be a last resort Cologne...</li>
            <li> I loved this cologne in the early 1990&#x27;s and decided to pick up a bottle</li>
            <li> I am blown away by how easy to order, how great the pricing is,  how fabulous the cologne itself is and most especially, how FAST my order arrives!  </li>
            <li> Very fresh and light.  </li>
            <li> a classic scent i wore this when i was a teenager it smells way better as a grown sexy man</li>
            <li> I was excited to find it at Amazon and took a chance, but either our sense of smell has changed or this is just a cheap knock-off...</li>
            <li> Honey was so excited that I found the scent that he wore &amp;#34;back in the day&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Now, you can see by his clean wife and kids that he has access to a shower, just chooses, for whatever reason, to avoid it like the plague.</li>
            <li> To be honest with you its pretty decent, its great for the early morning, really smooth and gentle.</li>
            <li> Oh, Sweet Baby Jesus, I&#x27;m so thankful that I didn&#x27;t meet him then, because this would have defo put a damper on the romance!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> years later I came across it again for $12, it was too good a deal to pass up.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much : )&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Fresh and so clean clean</li>
            <li> But quick response and refund.</li>
            <li> The scent seems to wear off quickly.  </li>
            <li> I love the classic colognes from the 90&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite all around colognes in my top 5 for sure, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this cologne as a daily wear, or to add to a collection of scents.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, super fast shipping, only the packaging could be a little more secure.</li>
            <li> Awesome thanks for the blast from the past</li>
            <li> I love this cologne and intend on buying many more bottles as this cologne is hard to find</li>
            <li> Over all well worth my money.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is still just as fresh as it was when it came out years ago.</li>
            <li> i ordered it right away .</li>
            <li> Great price for a daily wear cologne at office and such.  </li>
            <li> An old standby back in the day that still smells good.</li>
            <li> It will be a gift for someone I don&#x27;t like very much.</li>
            <li> The fact that it is very reasonably priced doesn&#x27;t hurt either.</li>
            <li> Thanks!    </li>
            <li> Thanks!    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure those are &amp;#34;Curly-Q&amp;#34; french fries he&#x27;s got stuck on his untied shoelaces....</li>
            <li> Now I am a married man.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh citrius smell which my boyfriend really likes.</li>
            <li> Exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li> be buying this again in the future for sure.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying it...</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Get this cologne if youve never tried it before I promise youll be back for more.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s Monster Truck day at the fair, and you&#x27;re waiting in line for your funnel cake, the grease hanging heavily in the air.</li>
            <li> this is now where near the original.</li>
            <li> Delivered in less than 36 hours, clean, fresh and sweet scent....that lasts!</li>
            <li> I used to have this same cologne back in the day and the memories were good</li>
            <li> First, the reason I gave this a three star review was purely for the fact that I got this for my husband</li>
            <li> Now, the bottle is a large size, the packaging was department store quality, the shipping was timely, and of course the value was excellent, but I just hate the smell and couldn&#x27;t bring myself to give it any more stars.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I found it after a long search.</li>
            <li> The scent remained, although much weaker than when first sprayed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strange that everyone love this fragrance, but no one seems to know the bargain of what their sense of smell enjoys so much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all good because he&#x27;d obviously bathed himself in the $2.00 &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34; that his kids bought him for Father&#x27;s Day 13 years ago, at the little elementary school store set up by the PTA to let kids shop for their Dear Ol&#x27; Dad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really the smell and the way this cologne is packaged and the design.</li>
            <li> It is really a shame that we cannot trust this channel of distribution any longer.</li>
            <li> He really likes it.  </li>
            <li> It can be overpowering if you spray too much on yourelf.</li>
            <li> thanks to tuccini company for the delivery of ths product.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery....</li>
            <li> \\&quot;you really smell good\\&quot;</li>
            <li> cologne packing looked used and the top of the bottle was wet..</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s not broken why then fix it, or so the saying goes.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this smells.  </li>
            <li> I really like the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for getting it to me so soon.</li>
            <li> so you have to touch up once or twice  a day or put too much on which</li>
            <li> The mysteries were not mine, my wifes  Thanks</li>
            <li> It does not last as the original version.</li>
            <li> The best part was that the amazon shipping box (the small one) was actually wrapped in a plastic bag and taped before it was put into the larger box and shipped to me...</li>
            <li> It kinda has that same clean smell</li>
            <li> The cologne kind of reminds me of a citrusy, mossy, scent similar to Hugo Boss yet less powerful.  </li>
            <li> I finally used the last of a bottle I&#x27;d had for quite awhile and was looking for some more.  </li>
            <li> Mr. Greasy Sh*tpants is in front of you, wearing most of the several Italian sausages and pulled-pork sandwiches</li>
            <li> This cologne is a classic.</li>
            <li> A classic scent.</li>
            <li> Would highly recomand both to anyone.  </li>
            <li> I used this stuff in Jr. high and high school.</li>
            <li> kinda scent added,  when I wore it back in the day it smelled clean, crisp and had a slight sweet scent  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> As it arrived I decided to spray two sprays and come back a day later to see if it was strong enough to stay or how quickly it faded.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is light enough that you really cannot overuse it, even with several sprays.</li>
            <li> but is the same adress  i use to received the first one order.</li>
            <li> if im not the first person to open it</li>
            <li> The first one I had came in a smaller bottle.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> a little strong for me</li>
            <li> I know this is an oldie, but have always enjoyed the clean scent for work and casual occasions.  </li>
            <li> This was my first plunge into designer fragrances back in the early 90&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tested it, be careful and try it in person first!</li>
            <li> I like LIZ Clairborne for men but the version sold at amazon was completely dissappointing.</li>
            <li> And for the price, WOW.</li>
            <li> I have been using Claiborne for men since it was introduced in the early 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Smells great,and last the whole day.</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> some go as far as to say &amp;#34; I just want to lay here for a while.</li>
            <li> However I thought that I would surprise her with my trusty old lady killer and of course, she was quite please with the scent as well.</li>
            <li> My gf said I smell like an old man at salvation army.</li>
            <li> This is a direct comparison to what I have sitting on my shelf.  </li>
            <li> Great for a casual once in awhile cologne!</li>
            <li> since it was so long ago I can&#x27;t really tell.</li>
            <li> I pour a lot of this bottled water everyday and the fragance fade away so quickly that I am NOT LONGER buying the promotions offered at Amazon.</li>
            <li> It is not as expensive as other but it smells great.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong my daughters old and young love it and ladies</li>
            <li> only way I can describe this stench is thusly: Have you ever gone to the county fair and had the pleasure of standing downwind of the greasy guy in filthy sweatpants with a very suspect butt stain, and sweaty, old teeshirt?</li>
            <li> I really think my money was well spent!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this cologne in the past from department stores, and the product I received did not smell right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering, not too weak, yet strong enough to last all day.</li>
            <li> The daily scent just dose not last as long from the store for some reason.</li>
            <li> and only one coment: I try to make an other order but amazon put a message when a put the order indicating that its not possible to send the product to the adress i selected.</li>
            <li> This is the first really bad example of a shipping issue I&#x27;ve had with amazon - have to say that I&#x27;m surprised at the lack of care and actual conscious effort that went into packaging up a pre-broken bottle of cologne.  </li>
            <li> It was different and the fragrance is not the same as previous purchases.  </li>
            <li> For you single guys this will turn the heads of the lady&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> real claiborne has the info on the bottom of bottel.this is being ship to a place in new york.water down do not buy from amazon.com till they stop selling fake things.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As said previous, it smells different.  </li>
            <li> itd last all day long!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This version is quite different than the original.my dad was looking for that same oldschool frag but he guesses thats hard to find these days.</li>
            <li> um... was not what i expected shouldve known you get what you pay for..</li>
            <li> What I received was a box which contained a small amazon shipping box soaked in cologne full of broken glass.  </li>
            <li> im not interested..</li>
            <li> Hard to find this product locally.</li>
            <li> My current/original bottle is heavier on the pine, sandlewood, and black pepper notes.  </li>
            <li> It came from the Kentucky distribution center, so I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the problem or</li>
            <li> On one side, it was a small investment, yet on the other side, now I will have to turn to another fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At this price I could bath in it everyday.  </li>
            <li> cologne is not to heavy and lasts along time.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even bothered opening the small shipping box which is soaked.  </li>
            <li> Most cologne sprays for men are terrible.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is difficult to find outlets that sell it.</li>
            <li> this smell is obnoctious and stinks and should be pulled off the inventory shipping sheet,this is not the same product purchased in the 90&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I use to ware this in the late 90s up to 2001 until I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores</li>
            <li> This is not what I remember the original smelling like, This has a horrible smell I would not even use this as air freshener</li>
            <li> I am seriously going to have to wash EVERYTHING in an attempt to put it out of my misery....</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate the look of the bottle, it reminds me of lipstick, but you don&#x27;t purchase cologne to look at itso no big deal.</li>
            <li> this is fake cologne.</li>
            <li> They smell terrible sometimes, and weird other times.</li>
            <li> All I know is this version stinks.</li>
            <li> Smelledcheap and fake!</li>
            <li> Bad idea!</li>
            <li> , it literally put me in a bad mood!  </li>
            <li> AWFUL.</li>
            <li> I hadto throw it away!~ Horrible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed!  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I always loved this cologne. I could not find this cologne at any Marc&#x27;s Discount Store or any WAl-mart Store. I am so glad that your service provided with this. Thanks!    Dave</li>
            <li> Bought this for my brother for Christmas.  He really likes it.  It is now discontinued but he said that Curves is the same fragrance</li>
            <li> The best smelling stuff for men</li>
            <li> Some one at my job had bought this for me as a birthday gift two years ago. i liked it so much that i wanted to get me another bottle but I never came around to getting it. Then when I saw u could get this product on Amazon i ordered it right away . I love the smell isn&#x27;t too strong but u shouldn&#x27;t spray alot of it though. Itz a good buy</li>
            <li> This is not what I remember the original smelling like, This has a horrible smell I would not even use this as air freshener this is a knock off that is out of control!</li>
            <li> Good stuff to put on for the ladies</li>
            <li> this smell is obnoctious and stinks and should be pulled off the inventory shipping sheet,this is not the same product purchased in the 90&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I wonder if it still smells the same!? My brother used to have this stuff about 15+ yrs ago and I used to sneak in his room and spray a lil bit on and itd last all day long!!!!!! It can be overpowering if you spray too much on yourelf. But, overall, very good stuff indeed!</li>
            <li> I remember my mom used to buy this for my brothers and me... i didn&#x27;t quite remember the smell so i thought \\&quot;ohh well its just 10 bucks\\&quot;. To be honest with you its pretty decent, its great for the early morning, really smooth and gentle. I use it to work every day!!</li>
            <li> this was not as I remembered it smelling like. I used to have this same cologne back in the day and the memories were good which is why I bought this one. Bad idea! I dont know if it was just me or this is now where near the original. since it was so long ago I can&#x27;t really tell. All I know is this version stinks. Thank god it was only $10. It will be a gift for someone I don&#x27;t like very much. lol...</li>
            <li> First, the reason I gave this a three star review was purely for the fact that I got this for my husband and I cannot stand the smell!  I thought I had smelled this before and it was good, but he wore it weekly for about a month and I sheepishly had to ask him to put it away, it literally put me in a bad mood!  Now, the bottle is a large size, the packaging was department store quality, the shipping was timely, and of course the value was excellent, but I just hate the smell and couldn&#x27;t bring myself to give it any more stars.  If you know that this scent is for you, then by all means, consider this a five-star review.  If you haven&#x27;t tested it, be careful and try it in person first!</li>
            <li> thanks to tuccini company for the delivery of ths product. and only one coment: I try to make an other order but amazon put a message when a put the order indicating that its not possible to send the product to the adress i selected. but is the same adress  i use to received the first one order. what can i do?</li>
            <li> this is fake cologne. real claiborne has the info on the bottom of bottel.this is being ship to a place in new york.water down do not buy from amazon.com till they stop selling fake things. only one star becouse they make you put something dowm.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product! and very good Price!</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne years ago and couldn&#x27;t find it. It smelled great thin and it smells great now. It&#x27;s not overpowering, not too weak, yet strong enough to last all day. I used to go to the department stores to purchase my cologne, now it&#x27;s Amazon. I find the same thing on Amazon for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Honey was so excited that I found the scent that he wore &amp;#34;back in the day&amp;#34;. Oh, Sweet Baby Jesus, I&#x27;m so thankful that I didn&#x27;t meet him then, because this would have defo put a damper on the romance!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way I can describe this stench is thusly: Have you ever gone to the county fair and had the pleasure of standing downwind of the greasy guy in filthy sweatpants with a very suspect butt stain, and sweaty, old teeshirt? Now, you can see by his clean wife and kids that he has access to a shower, just chooses, for whatever reason, to avoid it like the plague. Hey, I&#x27;m not judging; each to his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s Monster Truck day at the fair, and you&#x27;re waiting in line for your funnel cake, the grease hanging heavily in the air. Mr. Greasy Sh*tpants is in front of you, wearing most of the several Italian sausages and pulled-pork sandwiches he&#x27;s delighted himself with throughout the day. I&#x27;m pretty sure those are &amp;#34;Curly-Q&amp;#34; french fries he&#x27;s got stuck on his untied shoelaces....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;....but, HEY! It&#x27;s all good because he&#x27;d obviously bathed himself in the $2.00 &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34; that his kids bought him for Father&#x27;s Day 13 years ago, at the little elementary school store set up by the PTA to let kids shop for their Dear Ol&#x27; Dad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just....AWFUL. EYE WATERING.&lt;br /&gt;GAG INDUCING.&lt;br /&gt;Not even fit to leave in the bathroom for air freshener. And, it LINGERS. Oh, how it LINGERS! Honey sprayed it twice prior to my asking him not to, and I am STILL getting phantom whiffs of it! I am seriously going to have to wash EVERYTHING in an attempt to put it out of my misery....furniture and draperies included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the upside, the seller was great and shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance.  Not too overpowering!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, super fast shipping, only the packaging could be a little more secure. Overall, grade 9 (out of 10).</li>
            <li> It was a good buy! I really think my money was well spent! I&#x27;m really happy for the item I bought!</li>
            <li> Quick response and my husband&#x27;s favorite!</li>
            <li> I wore this on my honeymoon over 22 years ago, and it is still one of my favorite fragrances. The fact that it is very reasonably priced doesn&#x27;t hurt either.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT classic scent. I&#x27;ve used this for years and co-workers always ask what I&#x27;m wearing. And for the price, WOW. I hope you continue to stock this for years to come!</li>
            <li> Excellent product...Fast delivery....Great Price!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for years, and appreciate still be able to purchase it even though it&#x27;s no longer manufactured.</li>
            <li> This is a real nice smelling cologne, not overbearing.. but smooth smell as you pass others and they ask you..\\&quot;what is that you are wearing? or they say..\\&quot;you really smell good\\&quot;</li>
            <li> excellent product for the price. Bought this for regular use and i&#x27;m impressed with the cologne. I would recommend buying</li>
            <li> um... was not what i expected shouldve known you get what you pay for.. cologne packing looked used and the top of the bottle was wet.. smh as if someone sprayed it on them then shipped it to me.. i didnt expect that at all.. product is in the trash.. if im not the first person to open it im not interested.. its just the way i am.. the city dump can appreciate the smell</li>
            <li> I been used to this cologne for a very long time, the price was so very good, and IÂ´m using it every day!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this because my husband loves it and was out.  What I received was a box which contained a small amazon shipping box soaked in cologne full of broken glass.  The best part was that the amazon shipping box (the small one) was actually wrapped in a plastic bag and taped before it was put into the larger box and shipped to me... thus telling me the broke it in the warehouse and decided to send it on to me anyway.  The best part is that because this is considered a &amp;#34;hazardous material&amp;#34; I cannot return it.  So... I&#x27;m now in the process of trying to figure out how to get this remedied.  This is the first really bad example of a shipping issue I&#x27;ve had with amazon - have to say that I&#x27;m surprised at the lack of care and actual conscious effort that went into packaging up a pre-broken bottle of cologne.  I haven&#x27;t even bothered opening the small shipping box which is soaked.  It came from the Kentucky distribution center, so I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the problem or what.  Just beware ordering cologne from this site since it&#x27;s considered &amp;#34;hazardous.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great seller.  This stuff makes a man smell amazing.  At this price I could bath in it everyday.  It has been around and while and is a proven product.</li>
            <li> i bought this Fragrance,It is so unique,My friends compliment me about it,Great fragrance by Claiborne,I would buy again any day.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and the price is nice too.</li>
            <li> I like this item, smell very good and is the same fragance that I was looking for :) really good</li>
            <li> I have been using Claiborne for men since it was introduced in the early 90&#x27;s. I love the scent and have received a myriad of compliments from friends and family members. My wife loves the scent and will not let me even try another product. My only complaint is that it is difficult to find outlets that sell it.</li>
            <li> This cologne is a classic. Smells great,and last the whole day. Very light and summery</li>
            <li> Most cologne sprays for men are terrible. They smell terrible sometimes, and weird other times. This is perfect, I think, for men.</li>
            <li> inexpensive, wonder fragrance. Smell nice.</li>
            <li> smells very good after u take a shower.the right one. but all three products looks like water and have no smells so did i get scam.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid I can&#x27;t complain about this cologne, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again even at the low price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice cologne but it&#x27;s a bit strong smelling to me,I think it smells more like something a woman would be drawn too,but for the price it&#x27;s well worth it,nice size bottle.</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for.  The smell is very mild.  The next time, I&#x27;ll get a more expensive colonge.</li>
            <li> Added Claiborne by Liz Claiborne to collection. It is a must have. Wore it in my twenties and had to find it once again to add back to my collection now in my mid-forties. It reminds me of an &amp;#34;old-school&amp;#34; type of cologne. The design and shape of bottle is different than all the rest. Will continue to have as a part of my collection. Thank You!</li>
            <li> I tend to go for the citrus, lemon, piney sort of scent and this one fits into that category. The bottle has a nice matte feel. I have been using this scent for about 20 years now.</li>
            <li> This version is quite different than the original.my dad was looking for that same oldschool frag but he guesses thats hard to find these days.</li>
            <li> This reminds me of my teenage Years! WOW</li>
            <li> I know this is an oldie, but have always enjoyed the clean scent for work and casual occasions.  I use it to refresh my mood or even a musty jacket, if needed.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this cologne in the past from department stores, and the product I received did not smell right.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s not broken why then fix it, or so the saying goes. I have been wearing this men&#x27;s cologne not for 3 days, not for 3 weeks, not even for 3 years. This great smelling cologne has been an all time favorite fragrance to me as well as to people who doesn&#x27;t know the name of this cologne. For almost three decades I have been getting the same complement again and again. People say you smell good. What are you wearing. when I hug women, they sniff me while placing their head on my chest and with a very pleasant smile on there face, they simply say to me you smell good. what is the name of that cologne. some go as far as to say &amp;#34; I just want to lay here for a while. You smell so good. Now I am a married man. In fact, I am a newlywed man.  My Wife likes YSL L&#x27;Homme, and Versace poure homme. I love those fragrances too. However I thought that I would surprise her with my trusty old lady killer and of course, she was quite please with the scent as well. The very nice thing about Claiborne for Men by Liz Claiborne is the clean smell that it has. It doesn&#x27;t even matter if you spray it on your body or your clothing. It just smells great, and people will notice it if they get near you. it is never too strong or smells overly perfumed or loud, but it has a crisp clean wonderful fragrance that everyone must enjoy. And now, unlike it was a while ago, this is affordable for anyone. It&#x27;s strange that everyone love this fragrance, but no one seems to know the bargain of what their sense of smell enjoys so much.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this smells.  It has a fresh citrius smell which my boyfriend really likes.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT STILL IS WHAT I THOUGHT IT IS!!!!</li>
            <li> Not my type of scent.. but hey as a gift it was good</li>
            <li> smells great!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;drives women crazy!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love it...</li>
            <li> I really like the fragrance.  I have owned it before and was happy to find it on the site.  The price was fantastic!</li>
            <li> Exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li> Nothing great but a steal for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> Still in there after all these years.  Very fresh and light.  A good price on this to wear every once in a while or to have around for relatives and friends to freshen up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad this is out to buy again. I had this 15 years ago and could not find anymore. The first one I had came in a smaller bottle.&lt;br /&gt;This cologne is not to heavy and lasts along time. Unlike the Polo Blue Ice I have. All you need is 2 squirts about an hour before you go out. It needs to mellow a little.&lt;br /&gt;Lady&#x27;s if you have never come across this before get it for your man. You&#x27;ll love it !! For you single guys this will turn the heads of the lady&#x27;s. I give it 5 stars I hope I can continue to get it.</li>
            <li> Have always been a great fan of this cologne. It is not as expensive as other but it smells great.</li>
            <li> Great for a casual once in awhile cologne!</li>
            <li> Have always like this product and Amason has the best prices.  Would highly recomand both to anyone.  Good shopping everyone.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for his birthday. He loves it and so do I. It arrived when they said it would.</li>
            <li> Super excellent item...</li>
            <li> a little strong for me</li>
            <li> Smelledcheap and fake! I hadto throw it away!~ Horrible. But quick response and refund.</li>
            <li> Very Delightful refreshing scent. Lots of compliments!</li>
            <li> This cologne is one of the best I&#x27;ve purchased. Awesome smell and distinct from all the orders. One of Liz Claiborne&#x27;s best!</li>
            <li> Good smell, all the ladies seem to like,i think I made a pretty good choice. Thanks for getting it to me so soon.</li>
            <li> It was a return trip for me to order this product. I am blown away by how easy to order, how great the pricing is,  how fabulous the cologne itself is and most especially, how FAST my order arrives!  You guys rock, keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> My husband wore this exclusively for years and I loved it, then it seemed to disappear off the market.  I was excited to find it at Amazon and took a chance, but either our sense of smell has changed or this is just a cheap knock-off...neither of us liked it so I ended up giving it away.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing Claiborne for men on Amazon for multiple years since I rediscovered it.  Great price for a daily wear cologne at office and such.  The last bottle was not the same.  It was different and the fragrance is not the same as previous purchases.  What happened?  On one side, it was a small investment, yet on the other side, now I will have to turn to another fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As said previous, it smells different.  The scent seems to wear off quickly.  Kinda like the value store knock off colognes.  It is disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...This was my first plunge into designer fragrances back in the early 90&#x27;s.  It was a pleasantly good fragrance then and years later I came across it again for $12, it was too good a deal to pass up.  It has become my daily wear Fragrance.  I have a current expensive scent I use for more than daily wear occasions.  Over all well worth my money.</li>
            <li> great price smell good</li>
            <li> I used this stuff in Jr. high and high school. I love the classic colognes from the 90&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying this again in the future for sure.</li>
            <li> An old standby back in the day that still smells good.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome cologne and I love the way it smells on me! I get compliments all the time :)</li>
            <li> This cologne has a nice fresh smell. It is one of my favorites and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. I absolutely hate the look of the bottle, it reminds me of lipstick, but you don&#x27;t purchase cologne to look at itso no big deal.</li>
            <li> Fresh and so clean clean</li>
            <li> Simply superb! Great scent at an excellent price. Delivery was on time.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, son will like it.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase love the smell arrived on time one of the best products I have bought will buy more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many colognes and I got to say, this is the best cologne I&#x27;ve ever tried. If you&#x27;re looking for a cologne, this is the one to buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed!  I use to ware this in the late 90s up to 2001 until I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not the same smell!  It kinda has that same clean smell but it has perfume kinda scent added,  when I wore it back in the day it smelled clean, crisp and had a slight sweet scent  but now it&#x27;s different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent doesn&#x27;t last ( but it was like that back then)  so you have to touch up once or twice  a day or put too much on which will stink especially with the blend they have now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was great but this will probably be a last resort Cologne...it doesn&#x27;t stink just doesn&#x27;t smell like it use too.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product. I have been using it for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;Great Product.&lt;br /&gt;I hope to purchase again.</li>
            <li> love this cologne! Fast Shipping! Thank you!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great smell. Lasts all day. This was my first time buying it...May purchase another once this one is out. Thank You.</li>
            <li> I have worn this cologne for 25 years and I still love it and get complimented on it.</li>
            <li> A classic scent. I hope they never stop making this one.  Ladies ask me to wear it when we go out.  One asked for a hand kerchief sprayed with it, and put in an airtight container so she could keep it.&lt;br /&gt;It is not oily at all, and can be used as an aftershave if you like.&lt;br /&gt;It is light enough that you really cannot overuse it, even with several sprays.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this and I buy it every Christmas!!</li>
            <li> Received product as specified,  highly-rated!</li>
            <li> good.........for the night.....</li>
            <li> Awesome thanks for the blast from the past</li>
            <li> It smells even better that I remembered.  I wasn&#x27;t seeing it in stores anymore so when I found it here at that really low price, I jumped on it.</li>
            <li> a classic scent i wore this when i was a teenager it smells way better as a grown sexy man</li>
            <li> Great product,great price!</li>
            <li> Well packaged and arrived intact.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Nice spicy smell. My fiancee loves this cologne and so do I. Nice price for this bottle of cologne. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Thanks! just as stated. Looking forward to doing it again.</li>
            <li> This is another very good mans cologne. If you have a gift to purchase for a man that loves wearing colognes. I highly recommend this product. Ive been using Liz Claiborne for years now.</li>
            <li> Liz Claiborne what else can you say..its Liz C. evrything she touches even the men fragrances are just untouchable. And this smell just as I remembered it over 20 years ago. When I say it on Amazon.com it bought back memorys and I remembered it was a keeper then and its a keeper NOW!..Get this cologne if youve never tried it before I promise youll be back for more.</li>
            <li> My husband used this for many years and wanted some more so I ordered some cologne for him. I was so glad that I was able to find the cologne for him.</li>
            <li> Yeah there is a reason why this isn&#x27;t sold anymore in stores. My gf said I smell like an old man at salvation army. lol Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is still just as fresh as it was when it came out years ago. People love to just take a very strong inhale when you walk by and then ask what are you wearing. Claiborne you still deliver. Its great for warmer weather areas and when it rains out side.</li>
            <li> Great smell for a Guy.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I love curve and Mambo from Liz Claiborne and this did not disappoint! Very nice distinct cologne I will definitely get this again in the future!</li>
            <li> Delivered in less than 36 hours, clean, fresh and sweet scent....that lasts! Perfect bang for your buck!</li>
            <li> Came on time.  Great product and the price was right.  Will definately order this again.</li>
            <li> I have yet to have any luck with Cologne or perfume from amazon, I think I am 0 for 4 or 5 now. The daily scent just dose not last as long from the store for some reason.</li>
            <li> I am not writing this review off of memory.  This is a direct comparison to what I have sitting on my shelf.  I immediately noticed that the color of the product was not the same; yes the glass container is, but the cologne is not.  Ultimately color of the product does not matter, you do not wear this for its color....However, the scents are not the same.  My current/original bottle is heavier on the pine, sandlewood, and black pepper notes.  They are almost none existent in the product I received.  Bottom line, not the same.</li>
            <li> Very good got material as displayed.  The mysteries were not mine, my wifes  Thanks</li>
            <li> I loved this cologne in the early 1990&#x27;s and decided to pick up a bottle and I use it daily!!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite Colognes.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong my daughters old and young love it and ladies ask all the time what&#x27;s that great summer ever day sent</li>
            <li> I used to wear this cologne years ago and recall loving the scent and receiving compliments unlike any cologne I have ever wore.  Just doodling around I found this on Amazon and figured it was a must buy, especially at the price point it was at.  As it arrived I decided to spray two sprays and come back a day later to see if it was strong enough to stay or how quickly it faded.  The scent remained, although much weaker than when first sprayed.  I love this cologne and intend on buying many more bottles as this cologne is hard to find and I believe it is no longer in production.  I have heard the company that used to make this now makes Curve.  The cologne kind of reminds me of a citrusy, mossy, scent similar to Hugo Boss yet less powerful.  This cologne appeals to many others, as I have had many many types of cologne and I receive compliments with this one unlike all of the others.  This is one of my favorite all around colognes in my top 5 for sure, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this cologne as a daily wear, or to add to a collection of scents.</li>
            <li> Hard to find this product locally. I was very excited to find it here and also at such a great price. Thank you so much : )&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again as needed.</li>
