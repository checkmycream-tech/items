            <li>conditioners are ruined by a floral smell, but Agedefy has a pleasant unisex scent.  </li>

            <li>Good product</li>

            <li>list of ingredients is good, and I suppose that I&#x27;ll get the amount to use figured out.</li>
            <li>This is a good conditioner.  </li>
            <li>This is a good conditioner.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Agedefy Conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have used Pantene and Olay products for many years and have always found them to be a nice quality, pleasantly scented, and generally good at what they say they will do.</li>
            <li>Amazing transformation.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li>I had been using the &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; brands and nothing has made my hair as nice as this.</li>
            <li>This product has a nice aroma and leaves my hair silky afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Pantene Pro-V Agedefy for a month now and am thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I see a real difference in my own hair, but hers looks great!</li>
            <li>Contains a thickening formula that gives off a nice aroma.</li>
            <li>I remember when Pantene was THE deluxe brand.  </li>
            <li>but honestly I can&#x27;t see any difference</li>
            <li>My hair thanks you for an awesome product Pantene!</li>
            <li>I have always liked Pantene products, so I was thrilled I could give this conditioner a try.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent while not being too strong.</li>
            <li>It smells very strongly of coconut, even after you have rinsed your hair.</li>
            <li>This product changes my opinion, completely, as it can compete with the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>This has by far worked the best for me.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice clean scent and it a nice texture.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks full and very healthy.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s economical to use which is always good.  </li>
            <li>Using the Pantene has tamed many &#x27;fuzzy&#x27; ends that always used to show no matter what I tried.....</li>
            <li>a hair coater providing more elasticity; Divinyldimethicone/ dimethicone crosspolymer &#x3D;</li>
            <li>like so many conditioners do.</li>
            <li>but this conditioner is lovely.  </li>
            <li>I tried this with the matching shampoo and ordered them both after using the samples gave such wonderful results.  </li>
            <li>Instead I brushed my hair &amp; it fell perfectly into place.  </li>
            <li>I purchased these items because of the many glowing reviews at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I tried it for two weeks and the results were just ok.  </li>
            <li>Better than a lot of salon formulas</li>
            <li>This product delivers healthy hair.t all overpowering.  </li>
            <li>This product delivers healthy hair.</li>
            <li>Their conditioner was so much better than anything on the market.  </li>
            <li>Going to purchase more for sure.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say that this is any better than Suave.  </li>
            <li>and I think my hair has more static when I use it.</li>
            <li>Better,</li>
            <li>The icing on the cake is that it is inexpensively available in our small-town Walmart!  </li>
            <li>What more could I ask for?  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>After using this conditioner, I found that I had so much static and fly-aways.....</li>
            <li>It is more emollient and makes my hair shinier.</li>
            <li>My hair did seem to be brighter in color and was shinier, a bit more silky and had more body.</li>
            <li>mostly does what it says.</li>
            <li>Pantene&#x27;s Agedefy conditioner gets it right for my hair, giving a good amount of body and softness.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised how good my hair feels after I rinse!</li>
            <li>It rinses easily and cleanly from hands and hair, and has a pleasant, very light, clean</li>
            <li>Excellent for my hair that has been Chemical treated for so many year to cover my stuburn grey hair.</li>
            <li>It is very clean as you can expect from Pantene, but not at all overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Most of my life, my hair has been easy to style and control.  </li>
            <li>So, bottom line would be that it is a fine product, comparable with many of the others that are on the market</li>
            <li>Product as described, fair price, well packed, fast delivery</li>
            <li>Hands down, this is the best shampoo/conditioner I have used in more than 30 years.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s perfect for a quick fix during a daily shower.</li>
            <li>Rinses out well, and my hair is easy to comb and not too fly-away.</li>
            <li>Easy to comb through, as well.  </li>
            <li>No other products needed to get great results.</li>
            <li>My hair looks as good as it did when I graduated from high school over 30 years ago.</li>
            <li>conditioner has a very gentle scent -- nothing fruity, just kind of an organic smell.  </li>
            <li>I have a problem with fine hair that tangles easily, breaks and falls out because of the tangling.  </li>
            <li>It looked beautiful, and I didn&#x27;t need to use anything for frizzies, no extra products at all.  </li>
            <li>conditioner has a pleasant but not overpowering scent, which is important to me because I am very sensitive to odors.  </li>
            <li>The cap was tight, but when I lifted the tube up, after it had been in the shower stall, water pours out of the space between the cap and the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an excellent conditioner and my hair feels softer than it has felt in years.</li>
            <li>I can tell a huge difference quickly!</li>
            <li>A fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I used this product in conjunction with the shampoo and the advanced thickening agent</li>
            <li>I have had much more success with Toppik and Folicure lines and can recommend either of them.</li>
            <li>B001B2NMRY Fekkai Advanced Salon Technician Color Care</li>
            <li>Pantene Pro-V Nature Fusion Smooth Vitality Conditioner, 25.4-Fluid Ounce (Pack of 2)]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>YES, I&#x27;m still getting fabulous results, but</li>
            <li>really, it&#x27;s nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li>Shiney, smooth, no frizz, just youthful and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have always loved the look and feel that pantene gives my hair after washing and have been solely using Pantene for nearly 7 years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice product and decent value</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping for a nice head of while to silver hair someday instead of a general face that my mom has, and while it might be too ealry to tell for sure, this product seems to be helping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many brands of conditioner, and I think this is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>Secondly, the texture and smell of the conditioner is light and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>It does a very good job of taming the frizzy gray hairs without weighing down the rest of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I can say that I have not seen a significant difference in dryness, frizz, a change in my grays, a change in my color, or a difference in the amount of hair that I see in the drain after using it.</li>
            <li>It just detangles beautifully allowing my wet comb to just glide through my hair.  </li>
            <li>It smells clean and rinses away without leaving an over powering scent.</li>
            <li>Pantene didn&#x27;t do anything special for my hair.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>Age Defy definitely passed the first test!&lt;br /&gt;First off, the price is great.  </li>
            <li>But it is not aggravating my many allergies, so that may be a small price to pay for inexpensive great conditioner.</li>
            <li>bottom line was that the product was good enough</li>
            <li>The lotion itself is much thicker than most, perhaps that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s in a tube instead of</li>
            <li>I have fine hair  (color treated and several gray hairs) and love this product!</li>
            <li>Received a sample in the mail a while back and was impressed but didn&#x27;t buy until recently.</li>
            <li>As someone with \\&quot;combination hair\\&quot; -- meaning I&#x27;m not entirely gray as of yet, nor even mostly gray -- I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this product.  </li>
            <li>But it does a very good job on both the silvery-gray hairs and the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair that hasn&#x27;t turned that color as of yet, while leaving my hair feeling softer than usual.  </li>
            <li>My first tube is not even finished and I can tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li>It would be good if you have oily or normal hair, but if your hair is dry or damaged or it is older, more brittle hair, I would recommend looking for something more emollient.  </li>
            <li>It is true to it&#x27;s word, &amp;#34;Age Defy&amp;#34;.... my hair now proves that statement.</li>
            <li>I just got lucky the first time I used it!</li>
            <li>Using one to two times a week, my hair is gradually getting stronger and less fly away.</li>
            <li>My hair is healthy, soft, and shiny.</li>
            <li>but at this price it&#x27;s certainly worth a try.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and is much more manageable.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>Soft, smooth but with volume!</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>I honestly cannot say enough about this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Not as good results as other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>In other words, it makes good compromises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked the Pantene brand, but this seems more of an improvement on the usual in their line.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is light and pleasant; a different smell than regular Pantene.</li>
            <li>I am not a huge fan of Pantene but they finally made a great product!</li>
            <li>but like most, unless you use a deep conditioning mask and let it soak in for an hour, the results wash away with each shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I had frizzy hair for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>My wife and I have been using this product (she, obviously, uses it more than I).</li>
            <li>and I followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty neutral when it comes to this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps it is more suited to a different hair type.</li>
            <li>To me, this product has a kinda funny smell</li>
            <li>I find that this product helps keep my hair hydrated, tangle free and soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting married in a year</li>
            <li>Hot water is your hair&#x27;s enemy.  </li>
            <li>My hair was NOT as soft and smooth as it is with Redken Color Extend Shampoo that I use at home.  </li>
            <li>But, and this is a big but-- like most of these products</li>
            <li>First off, my hair is brown with some gray and wavy to curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t actually aware that your hair changes</li>
            <li>I have an allergy to formaldehyde and would really appreciate it if manufacturers either stopped using this ingredient-- or at least put it more prominently on the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I would really like to have long healthy locks to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My color, blow dry, curling iron treated hair loves this product and looks healthy.</li>
            <li>I have been using vitamins, drinking more water, changing my diet, trying every single hair care product on the market, switched to satin pillowcases, wearing a sleep cap, no heat tools, etcetera for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky that my hair is thick but with all the bleaching I need a good conditioner/treatment to keep it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It is white and thinning and now has a coarse texture where it had always been fine and smooth.</li>
            <li>hair lose and hair is much fuller after washing it.</li>
            <li>This conditioner soaks in fast</li>
            <li>It conditions very well and along with</li>
            <li>conditioner works very well for me</li>
            <li>So I ordered this and the matching shampoo for when I need to go fast and just get ready &amp; run out the door.  </li>
            <li>She said it didn&#x27;t help with hair loss, though maybe that was too much to expect, although the product&#x27;s advertising claims a lot of benefit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
            <li>I think you really have to give something like hair products a real work out before you can form an opinion.  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser wondered how much I was paying to keep my hair moisturized.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, this conditioner was nothing short of FANTASTIC.  </li>
            <li>It is more expensive then most of their products..but worth the price.</li>
            <li>So the next time, I took the tube, and with the cap securely on, squished the product around inside for a while.</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>and I was really hoping that this line from Pantene would make a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>Knots and tangles can become a problem, but with this my hair was very silky feeling afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover it all.</li>
            <li>Pantene&#x27;s 8.4 ounce size Pro-V Expert Collection Agedefy Conditioner works very well.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really see a difference in the conditon of my hair after using it.</li>
            <li>In future, I&#x27;d probably use it every other wash or even once a week in the summer when it&#x27;s more humid and hair gets more naturally oily.</li>
            <li>really cannot say enough good about this product and how fantastically my hair responded, other than I will always use it, no matter the cost.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is thick and rich, though, and leaves my hair softer than many others have.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really used it long enough to decide if it truly lives up to its claims, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I noticed any difference from many other conditioners, so I&#x27;ll give this 4 stars instead of 5.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, dry, frizzy hair and am always searching for a conditioner that will improve it&#x27;s appearance.</li>
            <li>I have dry, fine hair</li>
            <li>The Pantene Pro-V  not only softened my hair but actually make it feel more hydrated and look much smoother after blow drying.  </li>
            <li>First of all I have old lady hair.</li>
            <li>After the color grew out, the underlying color (a mix of dark brown and luminous silver) was stunning.</li>
            <li>The stuff is full of polymers (plastics, essentially).</li>
            <li>- Less frizz and more body&lt;</li>
            <li>For those who bleach their hair it helps to smooth hair cuticle keep the ends from looking too dry.</li>
            <li>But what are some of its main ingredients?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gifted the serum cause it dried out my hair too much.  </li>
            <li>Like the shampoo, has a decent scent-not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Those are definitely hallmarks of younger healthy hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling very soft and I&#x27;ve noticed that it doesn&#x27;t break as much.  </li>
            <li>&quot; I was expecting a little more moisturizing and conditioning impact on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I only apply to the bottom half of my hair and not on top to keep it from becoming too flat.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and managable with much body.  </li>
            <li>I normally use Pantene shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is not as flowery as Pantene normally is.  </li>
            <li>Feels thicker than a normal conditioner.</li>
            <li>&quot; On first try, I followed the directions on the tube, but my hair remained saturated with oil for a full day at work, never absorbing completely.</li>
            <li>My hair is about 8\\&quot; below my shoulders and I normally wear it in a ponytail or braid.</li>
            <li>Less is more as far as scented products go in my book.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But if you&#x27;re at all sensitive to chemicals, you might want to look for other, more natural options.</li>
            <li>This product, as with the other Agedefy collection, does a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner is part of the new trio from Pantene - a shampoo, a conditioner and a leave-in hair thickener.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m always on the look out for new things.</li>
            <li>I even saw quite a bit of new hair growth with this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So, did it live up to addressing those seven things?</li>
            <li>My ends are not snagging and breaking like they have in the past, they are very smooth and snag</li>
            <li>The combined effect is worth the trouble of finding the right shampoo to use with it.  </li>
            <li>hair is also definitely thinning, which is why I wanted to try this product in the first place.  </li>
            <li>I have really long, fine, not chemically treated platinum-colored hair--almost white.</li>
            <li>I figured someone big at the retailer was friendly with the someone big at Pantene because the product was okay but not worthy of such prestige.</li>
            <li>nothing special to make it stand out among some of the other conditioners she&#x27;s used.</li>
            <li>Great, thick conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product having tried many other conditioners which were specifically formulated for very dry hair.  </li>
            <li>It claims to be gentle enough for daily use on color-treated hair, though it does not have the typical \\&quot;sulfate-free\\&quot; label that most color protective shampoos and conditioners have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, because I have DRY, color treated fine hair, and I live in a DRY climate</li>
            <li>I turn 50 and my hair completely chained .  </li>
            <li>I am 54 years old and naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is also much stronger than with my regular product which I am not keen on.</li>
            <li>it is keeping my dreams alive that I can grow it out.  </li>
            <li>it is keeping my dreams alive that I can grow it out.  </li>
            <li>Used it for a week now, and hair feels really soft and silky but not greasy.</li>
            <li>It takes a lot longer to rinse completely than others.</li>
            <li>One product I recently tried that I really like, for example, is Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Conditioner.</li>
            <li>Hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I called Pantene, where the rep insisted this product was a real conditioner and didn&#x27;t coat the hair with anything and couldn&#x27;t POSSIBLY have changed my color, but I know my hair</li>
            <li>I have lousey hair so anything that helps my poor hair should really help anyone with better hair than mine.  </li>
            <li>It does not leave any kind of residue behind.</li>
            <li>As my hair tends to be coarse and thick (yes, even now, when I&#x27;m mumble-mumble past thirty-five), that&#x27;s a very good</li>
            <li>My hair is much silkier, feels in much better condition and yet not weighed down with heavy oils.  </li>
            <li>But once I started getting a decent amount of white hair it started to have a mind of</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down and make it look thin which is pretty good for such a moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li>great when I take out of the shower, and it really helps to add a little weight to it (my hair usually stands straight and thick).</li>
            <li>My hair was much softer, easier to control, and not nearly as frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I have very long, fine,, straight hair and in the last few years, I&#x27;ve noticed it is dryer, tangles easier and just not as shiny...</li>
            <li>so if you have sensitive skin (as I do), you might want to consider this product even if you&#x27;re like me and aren&#x27;t anywhere near the expected age to use this particular product (as it seems to be geared for women ages 55 and up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes in a flip-top, easy to squeeze tube and has a thick texture.</li>
            <li>I used my normal amount of conditioner, it was really too much and extremely hard to rinse out, even the shower floor became slippery.</li>
            <li>+ year old hair is more manageable than with my usual conditioner -- I really do not even need the hair spray to keep the frizzes in place.  </li>
            <li>When I leave the shower I use the anti age cream by pantene which is a liquid spritz, I spray three spritzes down my center part, and then lift my hair with a comb and spritz several more times along the roots.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend using this for long hair.  </li>
            <li>The consistency of the shampoo is very thick and doesn&#x27;t lather like most shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I always had that soft, straight, dark blond hair that is silky.</li>
            <li>&quot; I&#x27;m a natural blonde but the sun lightens and dries my hair out.</li>
            <li>Within 2 weeks of starting to use this product, my white hair started getting very noticeable yellow streaks.</li>
            <li>and generally it&#x27;s only about 4-5 years old at the split</li>
            <li>Two years ago, at age 40, I finally decided to stop fighting the grays that had plagued me since I was 12 and let my hair go &#x27;natural.&#x27;</li>
            <li>Overall, I definitely prefer this over their normal conditioner.</li>
            <li>After I started using this conditioner, my hair does not seem as thin and it certainly is more manageable, like it was years</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell any difference between this and any other conditioner, but at least this one works fine.</li>
            <li>Which is very much appreciated because I don&#x27;t use mousse or other styling aides because they my my scalp</li>
            <li>Just a small dab is enough to work its magic on wet</li>
            <li>that It took several shampoos of my regular shampoo and mousse to get it back to normal.</li>
            <li>I am horrified that some people with natural white hair had their hair turn yellow.  </li>
            <li>But worse, my lovely silver highlights had turned yellow.</li>
            <li>It is much heavier than my normal conditioner even after rinsing for an extra long time it felt like it continued to weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>used this product with my regular shampoo and at first was a little taken aback when combing it out after the shower.  </li>
            <li>I have been on some anti seizure medication that causes my hair to thin and break easily.  </li>
            <li>and this is super thick and not overpowering in the scent department.  </li>
            <li>I am 38yrs old and have long (mid back) highlighted blonde hair.</li>
            <li>as you age (other than gray hair obviously), but have found that along with everything else, your hair starts to loose its OOMPH when you hit a certain age.</li>

            <li> This is exactly what I have been looking for and I am very happy with this well priced and excellent conditioner.  </li>
            <li> conditioners are ruined by a floral smell, but Agedefy has a pleasant unisex scent.  </li>
            <li> my mom say it is very very good, she love it.</li>
            <li> Good product</li>

            <li> list of ingredients is good, and I suppose that I&#x27;ll get the amount to use figured out.</li>
            <li> This is a good conditioner.  </li>
            <li> This is a good conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Agedefy Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have used Pantene and Olay products for many years and have always found them to be a nice quality, pleasantly scented, and generally good at what they say they will do.</li>
            <li> Amazing transformation.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li> I had been using the &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; brands and nothing has made my hair as nice as this.</li>
            <li> This product has a nice aroma and leaves my hair silky afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Pantene Pro-V Agedefy for a month now and am thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I see a real difference in my own hair, but hers looks great!</li>
            <li> Contains a thickening formula that gives off a nice aroma.</li>
            <li> I remember when Pantene was THE deluxe brand.  </li>
            <li> but honestly I can&#x27;t see any difference</li>
            <li> My hair thanks you for an awesome product Pantene!</li>
            <li> I have always liked Pantene products, so I was thrilled I could give this conditioner a try.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant scent while not being too strong.</li>
            <li> It smells very strongly of coconut, even after you have rinsed your hair.</li>
            <li> This product changes my opinion, completely, as it can compete with the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> This has by far worked the best for me.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice clean scent and it a nice texture.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks full and very healthy.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s economical to use which is always good.  </li>
            <li> Using the Pantene has tamed many &#x27;fuzzy&#x27; ends that always used to show no matter what I tried.....</li>
            <li> a hair coater providing more elasticity; Divinyldimethicone/ dimethicone crosspolymer &#x3D;</li>
            <li> like so many conditioners do.</li>
            <li> but this conditioner is lovely.  </li>
            <li> I tried this with the matching shampoo and ordered them both after using the samples gave such wonderful results.  </li>
            <li> Instead I brushed my hair &amp; it fell perfectly into place.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these items because of the many glowing reviews at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I tried it for two weeks and the results were just ok.  </li>
            <li> Better than a lot of salon formulas</li>
            <li> This product delivers healthy hair.t all overpowering.  </li>
            <li> This product delivers healthy hair.</li>
            <li> Their conditioner was so much better than anything on the market.  </li>
            <li> Going to purchase more for sure.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say that this is any better than Suave.  </li>
            <li> and I think my hair has more static when I use it.</li>
            <li> Better,</li>
            <li> The icing on the cake is that it is inexpensively available in our small-town Walmart!  </li>
            <li> What more could I ask for?  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> After using this conditioner, I found that I had so much static and fly-aways.....</li>
            <li> It is more emollient and makes my hair shinier.</li>
            <li> My hair did seem to be brighter in color and was shinier, a bit more silky and had more body.</li>
            <li> mostly does what it says.</li>
            <li> Pantene&#x27;s Agedefy conditioner gets it right for my hair, giving a good amount of body and softness.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised how good my hair feels after I rinse!</li>
            <li> It rinses easily and cleanly from hands and hair, and has a pleasant, very light, clean</li>
            <li> Excellent for my hair that has been Chemical treated for so many year to cover my stuburn grey hair.</li>
            <li> It is very clean as you can expect from Pantene, but not at all overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Most of my life, my hair has been easy to style and control.  </li>
            <li> So, bottom line would be that it is a fine product, comparable with many of the others that are on the market</li>
            <li> Product as described, fair price, well packed, fast delivery</li>
            <li> Hands down, this is the best shampoo/conditioner I have used in more than 30 years.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s perfect for a quick fix during a daily shower.</li>
            <li> Rinses out well, and my hair is easy to comb and not too fly-away.</li>
            <li> Easy to comb through, as well.  </li>
            <li> No other products needed to get great results.</li>
            <li> My hair looks as good as it did when I graduated from high school over 30 years ago.</li>
            <li> conditioner has a very gentle scent -- nothing fruity, just kind of an organic smell.  </li>
            <li> I have a problem with fine hair that tangles easily, breaks and falls out because of the tangling.  </li>
            <li> It looked beautiful, and I didn&#x27;t need to use anything for frizzies, no extra products at all.  </li>
            <li> conditioner has a pleasant but not overpowering scent, which is important to me because I am very sensitive to odors.  </li>
            <li> The cap was tight, but when I lifted the tube up, after it had been in the shower stall, water pours out of the space between the cap and the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an excellent conditioner and my hair feels softer than it has felt in years.</li>
            <li> I can tell a huge difference quickly!</li>
            <li> A fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I used this product in conjunction with the shampoo and the advanced thickening agent</li>
            <li> I have had much more success with Toppik and Folicure lines and can recommend either of them.</li>
            <li> B001B2NMRY Fekkai Advanced Salon Technician Color Care</li>
            <li> Pantene Pro-V Nature Fusion Smooth Vitality Conditioner, 25.4-Fluid Ounce (Pack of 2)]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> YES, I&#x27;m still getting fabulous results, but</li>
            <li> really, it&#x27;s nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> Shiney, smooth, no frizz, just youthful and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always loved the look and feel that pantene gives my hair after washing and have been solely using Pantene for nearly 7 years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product and decent value</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping for a nice head of while to silver hair someday instead of a general face that my mom has, and while it might be too ealry to tell for sure, this product seems to be helping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many brands of conditioner, and I think this is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> Secondly, the texture and smell of the conditioner is light and pleasant.  </li>
            <li> It does a very good job of taming the frizzy gray hairs without weighing down the rest of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I can say that I have not seen a significant difference in dryness, frizz, a change in my grays, a change in my color, or a difference in the amount of hair that I see in the drain after using it.</li>
            <li> It just detangles beautifully allowing my wet comb to just glide through my hair.  </li>
            <li> It smells clean and rinses away without leaving an over powering scent.</li>
            <li> Pantene didn&#x27;t do anything special for my hair.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> Age Defy definitely passed the first test!&lt;br /&gt;First off, the price is great.  </li>
            <li> But it is not aggravating my many allergies, so that may be a small price to pay for inexpensive great conditioner.</li>
            <li> bottom line was that the product was good enough</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is much thicker than most, perhaps that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s in a tube instead of</li>
            <li> I have fine hair  (color treated and several gray hairs) and love this product!</li>
            <li> Received a sample in the mail a while back and was impressed but didn&#x27;t buy until recently.</li>
            <li> As someone with \\&quot;combination hair\\&quot; -- meaning I&#x27;m not entirely gray as of yet, nor even mostly gray -- I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this product.  </li>
            <li> But it does a very good job on both the silvery-gray hairs and the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair that hasn&#x27;t turned that color as of yet, while leaving my hair feeling softer than usual.  </li>
            <li> My first tube is not even finished and I can tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li> It would be good if you have oily or normal hair, but if your hair is dry or damaged or it is older, more brittle hair, I would recommend looking for something more emollient.  </li>
            <li> It is true to it&#x27;s word, &amp;#34;Age Defy&amp;#34;.... my hair now proves that statement.</li>
            <li> I just got lucky the first time I used it!</li>
            <li> Using one to two times a week, my hair is gradually getting stronger and less fly away.</li>
            <li> My hair is healthy, soft, and shiny.</li>
            <li> but at this price it&#x27;s certainly worth a try.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and is much more manageable.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> Soft, smooth but with volume!</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I honestly cannot say enough about this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Not as good results as other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> In other words, it makes good compromises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked the Pantene brand, but this seems more of an improvement on the usual in their line.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is light and pleasant; a different smell than regular Pantene.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of Pantene but they finally made a great product!</li>
            <li> but like most, unless you use a deep conditioning mask and let it soak in for an hour, the results wash away with each shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I had frizzy hair for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using this product (she, obviously, uses it more than I).</li>
            <li> and I followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty neutral when it comes to this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it is more suited to a different hair type.</li>
            <li> To me, this product has a kinda funny smell</li>
            <li> I find that this product helps keep my hair hydrated, tangle free and soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting married in a year</li>
            <li> Hot water is your hair&#x27;s enemy.  </li>
            <li> My hair was NOT as soft and smooth as it is with Redken Color Extend Shampoo that I use at home.  </li>
            <li> But, and this is a big but-- like most of these products</li>
            <li> First off, my hair is brown with some gray and wavy to curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t actually aware that your hair changes</li>
            <li> I have an allergy to formaldehyde and would really appreciate it if manufacturers either stopped using this ingredient-- or at least put it more prominently on the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I would really like to have long healthy locks to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My color, blow dry, curling iron treated hair loves this product and looks healthy.</li>
            <li> I have been using vitamins, drinking more water, changing my diet, trying every single hair care product on the market, switched to satin pillowcases, wearing a sleep cap, no heat tools, etcetera for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky that my hair is thick but with all the bleaching I need a good conditioner/treatment to keep it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It is white and thinning and now has a coarse texture where it had always been fine and smooth.</li>
            <li> hair lose and hair is much fuller after washing it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner soaks in fast</li>
            <li> It conditions very well and along with</li>
            <li> conditioner works very well for me</li>
            <li> So I ordered this and the matching shampoo for when I need to go fast and just get ready &amp; run out the door.  </li>
            <li> She said it didn&#x27;t help with hair loss, though maybe that was too much to expect, although the product&#x27;s advertising claims a lot of benefit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
            <li> I think you really have to give something like hair products a real work out before you can form an opinion.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser wondered how much I was paying to keep my hair moisturized.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, this conditioner was nothing short of FANTASTIC.  </li>
            <li> It is more expensive then most of their products..but worth the price.</li>
            <li> So the next time, I took the tube, and with the cap securely on, squished the product around inside for a while.</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> and I was really hoping that this line from Pantene would make a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> Knots and tangles can become a problem, but with this my hair was very silky feeling afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover it all.</li>
            <li> Pantene&#x27;s 8.4 ounce size Pro-V Expert Collection Agedefy Conditioner works very well.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t really see a difference in the conditon of my hair after using it.</li>
            <li> In future, I&#x27;d probably use it every other wash or even once a week in the summer when it&#x27;s more humid and hair gets more naturally oily.</li>
            <li> really cannot say enough good about this product and how fantastically my hair responded, other than I will always use it, no matter the cost.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is thick and rich, though, and leaves my hair softer than many others have.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really used it long enough to decide if it truly lives up to its claims, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I noticed any difference from many other conditioners, so I&#x27;ll give this 4 stars instead of 5.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, dry, frizzy hair and am always searching for a conditioner that will improve it&#x27;s appearance.</li>
            <li> I have dry, fine hair</li>
            <li> The Pantene Pro-V  not only softened my hair but actually make it feel more hydrated and look much smoother after blow drying.  </li>
            <li> First of all I have old lady hair.</li>
            <li> After the color grew out, the underlying color (a mix of dark brown and luminous silver) was stunning.</li>
            <li> The stuff is full of polymers (plastics, essentially).</li>
            <li> - Less frizz and more body&lt;</li>
            <li> For those who bleach their hair it helps to smooth hair cuticle keep the ends from looking too dry.</li>
            <li> But what are some of its main ingredients?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gifted the serum cause it dried out my hair too much.  </li>
            <li> Like the shampoo, has a decent scent-not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Those are definitely hallmarks of younger healthy hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling very soft and I&#x27;ve noticed that it doesn&#x27;t break as much.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I was expecting a little more moisturizing and conditioning impact on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I only apply to the bottom half of my hair and not on top to keep it from becoming too flat.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and managable with much body.  </li>
            <li> I normally use Pantene shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is not as flowery as Pantene normally is.  </li>
            <li> Feels thicker than a normal conditioner.</li>
            <li> &quot; On first try, I followed the directions on the tube, but my hair remained saturated with oil for a full day at work, never absorbing completely.</li>
            <li> My hair is about 8\\&quot; below my shoulders and I normally wear it in a ponytail or braid.</li>
            <li> Less is more as far as scented products go in my book.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But if you&#x27;re at all sensitive to chemicals, you might want to look for other, more natural options.</li>
            <li> This product, as with the other Agedefy collection, does a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner is part of the new trio from Pantene - a shampoo, a conditioner and a leave-in hair thickener.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m always on the look out for new things.</li>
            <li> I even saw quite a bit of new hair growth with this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, did it live up to addressing those seven things?</li>
            <li> My ends are not snagging and breaking like they have in the past, they are very smooth and snag</li>
            <li> The combined effect is worth the trouble of finding the right shampoo to use with it.  </li>
            <li> hair is also definitely thinning, which is why I wanted to try this product in the first place.  </li>
            <li> I have really long, fine, not chemically treated platinum-colored hair--almost white.</li>
            <li> I figured someone big at the retailer was friendly with the someone big at Pantene because the product was okay but not worthy of such prestige.</li>
            <li> nothing special to make it stand out among some of the other conditioners she&#x27;s used.</li>
            <li> Great, thick conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product having tried many other conditioners which were specifically formulated for very dry hair.  </li>
            <li> It claims to be gentle enough for daily use on color-treated hair, though it does not have the typical \\&quot;sulfate-free\\&quot; label that most color protective shampoos and conditioners have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, because I have DRY, color treated fine hair, and I live in a DRY climate</li>
            <li> I turn 50 and my hair completely chained .  </li>
            <li> I am 54 years old and naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is also much stronger than with my regular product which I am not keen on.</li>
            <li> it is keeping my dreams alive that I can grow it out.  </li>
            <li> it is keeping my dreams alive that I can grow it out.  </li>
            <li> Used it for a week now, and hair feels really soft and silky but not greasy.</li>
            <li> It takes a lot longer to rinse completely than others.</li>
            <li> One product I recently tried that I really like, for example, is Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Conditioner.</li>
            <li> Hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I called Pantene, where the rep insisted this product was a real conditioner and didn&#x27;t coat the hair with anything and couldn&#x27;t POSSIBLY have changed my color, but I know my hair</li>
            <li> I have lousey hair so anything that helps my poor hair should really help anyone with better hair than mine.  </li>
            <li> It does not leave any kind of residue behind.</li>
            <li> As my hair tends to be coarse and thick (yes, even now, when I&#x27;m mumble-mumble past thirty-five), that&#x27;s a very good</li>
            <li> My hair is much silkier, feels in much better condition and yet not weighed down with heavy oils.  </li>
            <li> But once I started getting a decent amount of white hair it started to have a mind of</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down and make it look thin which is pretty good for such a moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li> great when I take out of the shower, and it really helps to add a little weight to it (my hair usually stands straight and thick).</li>
            <li> My hair was much softer, easier to control, and not nearly as frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I have very long, fine,, straight hair and in the last few years, I&#x27;ve noticed it is dryer, tangles easier and just not as shiny...</li>
            <li> so if you have sensitive skin (as I do), you might want to consider this product even if you&#x27;re like me and aren&#x27;t anywhere near the expected age to use this particular product (as it seems to be geared for women ages 55 and up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes in a flip-top, easy to squeeze tube and has a thick texture.</li>
            <li> I used my normal amount of conditioner, it was really too much and extremely hard to rinse out, even the shower floor became slippery.</li>
            <li> + year old hair is more manageable than with my usual conditioner -- I really do not even need the hair spray to keep the frizzes in place.  </li>
            <li> When I leave the shower I use the anti age cream by pantene which is a liquid spritz, I spray three spritzes down my center part, and then lift my hair with a comb and spritz several more times along the roots.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend using this for long hair.  </li>
            <li> The consistency of the shampoo is very thick and doesn&#x27;t lather like most shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I always had that soft, straight, dark blond hair that is silky.</li>
            <li> &quot; I&#x27;m a natural blonde but the sun lightens and dries my hair out.</li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks of starting to use this product, my white hair started getting very noticeable yellow streaks.</li>
            <li> and generally it&#x27;s only about 4-5 years old at the split</li>
            <li> Two years ago, at age 40, I finally decided to stop fighting the grays that had plagued me since I was 12 and let my hair go &#x27;natural.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Overall, I definitely prefer this over their normal conditioner.</li>
            <li> After I started using this conditioner, my hair does not seem as thin and it certainly is more manageable, like it was years</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell any difference between this and any other conditioner, but at least this one works fine.</li>
            <li> Which is very much appreciated because I don&#x27;t use mousse or other styling aides because they my my scalp</li>
            <li> Just a small dab is enough to work its magic on wet</li>
            <li> that It took several shampoos of my regular shampoo and mousse to get it back to normal.</li>
            <li> I am horrified that some people with natural white hair had their hair turn yellow.  </li>
            <li> But worse, my lovely silver highlights had turned yellow.</li>
            <li> It is much heavier than my normal conditioner even after rinsing for an extra long time it felt like it continued to weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> used this product with my regular shampoo and at first was a little taken aback when combing it out after the shower.  </li>
            <li> I have been on some anti seizure medication that causes my hair to thin and break easily.  </li>
            <li> and this is super thick and not overpowering in the scent department.  </li>
            <li> I am 38yrs old and have long (mid back) highlighted blonde hair.</li>
            <li> as you age (other than gray hair obviously), but have found that along with everything else, your hair starts to loose its OOMPH when you hit a certain age.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find the right balance in a conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it would bother anyone who&#x27;s sensitive to smells, as other hair products might.</li>
            <li> /&gt;  - I no longer need to add a second conditioner before styling with the flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but this product has made my hair feel and look better than it has in a long time.</li>
            <li> If you have kinky grey or white hairs invading your head, try this and see if it helps.</li>
            <li> This product has brought back the shine I once had in my hair so that it looked \\&quot;blond\\&quot; rather than grey.</li>
            <li> Incidentally, aside from dying my hair, I use a blow dryer and flat iron.</li>
            <li> Nothing beats grays into submission except dye and/or flat irons.</li>
            <li> I generally do not like pantene products because my hair feels coated.</li>
            <li> I have a very thick hair and so far I have not find anything that will make my hair shiny and this one really works for me.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works well enough, leaving my hair tangle-free and soft, without leaving it greasy or limp.  </li>
            <li> This is for those other occasional times when I&#x27;m short of time.</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s about the same as other products of a similar vein.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should also say that, though it is no better than other brands, it certainly is no worse than anything I have used recently.</li>
            <li> Lately, I hadn&#x27;t really been feeling that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not nearly as bothered by frizz or fly-away gray hair as I was before trying the shampoo-conditioner combination.</li>
            <li> Continuing from my review on the shampoo, this conditioner is what women with long hair have been waiting for, for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and she said that turn her grey hair purple je je je</li>
            <li> I have long hair and have had some issues with breakage, but this conditioner has helped with that, too.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have to leave it on too long.</li>
            <li> With some, my hair has body, but is too dry and frizzy, while others make it soft, but also clumpy and limp.</li>
            <li> It is thick and I ended up using a little more than usual trying to get it through my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The thing is the other products either didn&#x27;t work at all or only provided minor improvement!  </li>
            <li> Although I do not suffer from all of the above, I have noticed my hair is a little less thin, and does not break so easily when brushing.  </li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry for about 10 minutes before using any sort or hair dryer or styling aides.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I use a blow dry speed up spray from Kenra so that I am not blow drying my hair for extended periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this Pantene system for almost four weeks.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product on my sometimes frizzy, dry hair and it delivered as promised.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that this product really stops hair loss, which is my biggest problem, but it may be helping a little.  </li>
            <li> For the first week I was skeptical; it wasn&#x27;t much different than all the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I style my hair minimally but had to work at getting my hair to do something other than fall flat while using this conditioner.</li>
            <li> started using this product, and a week and a half later, my hair had changed.</li>
            <li> She also said she was not sure that it was necessarily an \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot; product; she got similar benefits from other conditioners that didn&#x27;t claim to be specialized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another plus is that it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of product to saturate wet hair</li>
            <li> Well -- I might like it to be odorless; I really do not like the scent when I use it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I find it particularly frustrating that they use Quarternium which is really just another word for formaldehyde.  </li>
            <li> For the past few years I have spent my mornings beating it into submission--a new thing for me.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product to tame my white hairs.</li>
            <li> have long hair down to my backside and was running into issue before of shampoos and conditioners being too harsh on the long hair and ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works well with the other Pro-V Expert Collection Agedefy products.</li>
            <li> Read my reviews on the other Age defying products.  </li>
            <li> My hair is extremely shiny and bouncy.  </li>
            <li> Which is one thing other Pantene products have done for my hair.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soft and silky, not the least bit heavy.  </li>
            <li> I have tried lots of different shampoos and conditioners and even my old, expensive stand bys</li>
            <li> My hair was starting to fall out and truly looked lifeless and dull.</li>
            <li> IF you are not loving this conditioner, then try a different shampoo with it.  </li>
            <li> I would say it is about average in terms of conditioning.</li>
            <li> I am 55 years old and have thin, frizz hair.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to those with thin, dry or color treated hair.</li>
            <li> My hair looks fuller and thicker from the roots all the way down to the ends.  </li>
            <li> as the hair ends didn&#x27;t settle down completely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not oily or weighted down.</li>
            <li> My hair seemed sort of stiff and a bit difficult to comb out, it did not feel all that moisturized, BUT when completely dry, WOW!!</li>
            <li> I have less hair in my comb.  </li>
            <li> Less hair pulls out when I take out ponytails.  </li>
            <li> No breakage, no tangling, no pulling, SIGNIFICANTLY less hair in my shower drain.  </li>
            <li> a sticky coater found in conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;agedefy&amp;#34;ing components mean nothing to me as that means simply this product coats (dead) hair and prevents sunburn to hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair</li>
            <li> It does not leave my hair weighted down and limp</li>
            <li> It does help add a little thickness, and I&#x27;m hoping that over time my hair will become fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little background.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since this discovery, I have scrubbed my hair with clarifying shampoo (NOT Pantene) to little avail.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair limp or over-condition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a firm believer in mixing it up with my shampoos and conditioners</li>
            <li> Yes, I have a few years on you too...</li>
            <li> The thin, flat look is gone.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, nobody has come up to me and commented that my hair looks darker, less grayish -- but I feel that it does look younger.  </li>
            <li> The AgeDefy is designed to help with breakage, split ends, frizz, unruly grey hairs, lackluster colors, thin look and dryness.</li>
            <li> That said, over the past few years (as I am getting older)I have specifically begun looking for shampoos and conditioners that will protect my colored hair and help keep it moisturized since it has begun to get dryer and a bit</li>
            <li> The conditioner is also very thick and while the bottle does not give any directions to use, my hairstylist recommends letting sit for 3 minutes, combing through with a wide toothed comb and then rinsing with cooler water.  </li>
            <li> like that it also doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling limp and dull.</li>
            <li> No more frizz, no more split ends and</li>
            <li> Usually I use Wen, but it takes some time.  </li>
            <li> Only downfall is that it is difficult to rinse out.</li>
            <li> This conditioner made my hair so very limp  </li>
            <li> It was also difficult to manage and did not want to behave when blown dry.</li>
            <li> I have wavy, medium thick, with a smattering of gray hairs and it just didn&#x27;t do it for</li>
            <li> Usually I buy salon products, but thought I would give this a try because it said it targets breakage and split ends....and that it does!  </li>
            <li> After I shampooed, I applied a very small amount of this conditioner, about the size of a pea.</li>
            <li> When my hair was air dried later, I was not stuck with an annoying perfume which some conditioners that Pantene have made before did with me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair had thinned a bit (not like going bald type of thin, but like each hair was thinner).</li>
            <li> I have not experienced breakage, split ends or thinning hair yet.  </li>
            <li> My hair is still thin, frizzes and no improvement</li>
            <li> have thin hair</li>
            <li> My hair has always been on the thin side.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve tried everything from expensive conditioners to non expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> After months of stress r/t medical cares received, my hair was in horrible shape, handfuls coming out each day.</li>
            <li> Sadly, the product did not work for me AT ALL.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has spent months or (in my case) years cultivating a hairstyle can imagine how devastating this</li>
            <li> I have been trying everything on my hair since my color treatments started breaking my hair really bad.  </li>
            <li> Although I would not continue using anything that hurt me or smelled bad or didn&#x27;t do the basics.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Hands down, this is the best shampoo/conditioner I have used in more than 30 years. My hair is healthy, soft, and shiny. I can tell a huge difference quickly!</li>
            <li> Good product but like all products from this manufacturer it will become unavailable soon</li>
            <li> Excellent product. made my hair silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> Use both products. Hair is fuller after using it.&lt;br /&gt;No hair lose and hair is much fuller after washing it.</li>
            <li> Product as described, fair price, well packed, fast delivery</li>
            <li> This conditioner is very good but like most, unless you use a deep conditioning mask and let it soak in for an hour, the results wash away with each shampoo. It smells good and guys would like it too so the fragrance isn&#x27;t \\&quot;girly.\\&quot; I&#x27;m a natural blonde but the sun lightens and dries my hair out. I could use a hat but here in the land of sunshine, I&#x27;d have to wear one all the time. This conditioner soaks in fast so it&#x27;s perfect for a quick fix during a daily shower. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair limp or over-condition.</li>
            <li> I have been trying everything on my hair since my color treatments started breaking my hair really bad.  This conditioner is awesome.  My hair looks full and very healthy.  And I&#x27;ve tried everything from expensive conditioners to non expensive ones.  BTW, I am african american.  This is my happy place.</li>
            <li> It works well with the other Pro-V Expert Collection Agedefy products.</li>
            <li> This product, as with the other Agedefy collection, does a fantastic job.  It conditions very well and along with it&#x27;s shampoo and hair thickener have my hair in great shape.  The thin, flat look is gone.  A fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product having tried many other conditioners which were specifically formulated for very dry hair.  The thing is the other products either didn&#x27;t work at all or only provided minor improvement!  The Pantene Pro-V  not only softened my hair but actually make it feel more hydrated and look much smoother after blow drying.  Another plus is that it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of product to saturate wet hair so it&#x27;s economical to use which is always good.  Using the Pantene has tamed many &#x27;fuzzy&#x27; ends that always used to show no matter what I tried.....this product has virtually eliminated the &#x27;fuzzies&#x27;.  Give it a try, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product to tame my white hairs. I always had that soft, straight, dark blond hair that is silky. But once I started getting a decent amount of white hair it started to have a mind of it&#x27;s own and I had frizzy hair for the first time in my life. For the past few years I have spent my mornings beating it into submission--a new thing for me. But now that I have found this shampoo and conditioner, my hair is back to it&#x27;s compliant nature that I am used to. I had been using the &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; brands and nothing has made my hair as nice as this. If you have kinky grey or white hairs invading your head, try this and see if it helps.</li>
            <li> I have uncolored white hair. Within 2 weeks of starting to use this product, my white hair started getting very noticeable yellow streaks. Could be because of the yellow color of the conditioner. BTW, I had been using the shampoo for a while with no problem, even though it is the same color. The problem started with the use of the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beautician corroborated that she has seen this problem with some hair products.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is a companion to the Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Agedefying Collection.  I don&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> After months of stress r/t medical cares received, my hair was in horrible shape, handfuls coming out each day. Using one to two times a week, my hair is gradually getting stronger and less fly away. Yea!</li>
            <li> This product has a nice aroma and leaves my hair silky afterwards.  But what are some of its main ingredients?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Behentrimonium Chloride &#x3D; a waxlike component ideal for anti-static; Silicone Quaternium-25 &#x3D; a hair coater providing more elasticity; Divinyldimethicone/ dimethicone crosspolymer &#x3D; a sticky coater found in conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;agedefy&amp;#34;ing components mean nothing to me as that means simply this product coats (dead) hair and prevents sunburn to hair and scalp.  So while this product may not let 70-year-old hair look 20 again, it can provide some protection.  Just a small dab is enough to work its magic on wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it also doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling limp and dull.</li>
            <li> I have fine, dry, frizzy hair and am always searching for a conditioner that will improve it&#x27;s appearance. I have been using Pantene Pro-V Agedefy for a month now and am thrilled with the results. For the first week I was skeptical; it wasn&#x27;t much different than all the others I&#x27;ve tried. But after a week I began to see a difference:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  - Shinier hair&lt;br /&gt;  - Color is more brilliant (Yes, I color my hair)&lt;br /&gt;  - Less frizz and more body&lt;br /&gt;  - I no longer need to add a second conditioner before styling with the flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light and pleasant; a different smell than regular Pantene. I would definitely recommend this to those with thin, dry or color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I turn 50 and my hair completely chained .  This line of products has strengthens my hair and makes it fuller.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I have ever used. I am 54 years old and naturally curly hair. My hair was starting to fall out and truly looked lifeless and dull. My first tube is not even finished and I can tell a huge difference. My hair looks as good as it did when I graduated from high school over 30 years ago. Amazing transformation. I had no idea my hair would ever look this good again.</li>
            <li> First of all I have old lady hair. It is white and thinning and now has a coarse texture where it had always been fine and smooth. This product has brought back the shine I once had in my hair so that it looked \\&quot;blond\\&quot; rather than grey. It does not leave my hair weighted down and limp like so many conditioners do. I was skeptical but this product has made my hair feel and look better than it has in a long time.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is awesome. I have dry, fine hair and this is super thick and not overpowering in the scent department.  Would definitely get this again.  Their Agedefy thickener is good too.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is part of the new trio from Pantene - a shampoo, a conditioner and a leave-in hair thickener.  I have not tried the shampoo yet but this conditioner is lovely.  It recommends that you use the hair thickener afterwards and I have also tried that (will review it separately).  I have lousey hair so anything that helps my poor hair should really help anyone with better hair than mine.  So I can recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Agedefy Conditioner. My hair had thinned a bit (not like going bald type of thin, but like each hair was thinner). It was also difficult to manage and did not want to behave when blown dry. After I started using this conditioner, my hair does not seem as thin and it certainly is more manageable, like it was years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a flip-top, easy to squeeze tube and has a thick texture. I thought it would be greasy but it was not. It rinses easily and cleanly from hands and hair, and has a pleasant, very light, clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner works very well for me and therefore I recommend it with two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the corresponding shampoo, so I thought I&#x27;d try both together. I can&#x27;t really tell any difference between this and any other conditioner, but at least this one works fine. I&#x27;m not nearly as bothered by frizz or fly-away gray hair as I was before trying the shampoo-conditioner combination. So overall, I&#x27;d give this a thumbs-up.</li>
            <li> Excellent for my hair that has been Chemical treated for so many year to cover my stuburn grey hair.</li>
            <li> Bought all three products of this line:  conditioner, serum and shampoo.  I gifted the serum cause it dried out my hair too much.  I continue to use the shampoo and conditioner in the hopes that my hair will add some volume.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using this product (she, obviously, uses it more than I). I can&#x27;t say that I see a real difference in my own hair, but hers looks great! I can say that my hair *feels* great when I take out of the shower, and it really helps to add a little weight to it (my hair usually stands straight and thick).</li>
            <li> Continuing from my review on the shampoo, this conditioner is what women with long hair have been waiting for, for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair down to my backside and was running into issue before of shampoos and conditioners being too harsh on the long hair and ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This formula solved all the issues I was combating for years.  No more frizz, no more split ends and even the ends of my hair are shiny like the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend using this for long hair.  It is true to it&#x27;s word, &amp;#34;Age Defy&amp;#34;.... my hair now proves that statement.</li>
            <li> I tried this with the matching shampoo and ordered them both after using the samples gave such wonderful results.  I used this on a Sunday morning, and then I slept all day.  Got up at 10PM &amp; went to the grocery store and then came home &amp; went back to bed.  So the next morning when I had a doctor appointment I was expecting to do a lot of styling and product using after I got out of the shower.  Instead I brushed my hair &amp; it fell perfectly into place.  It looked beautiful, and I didn&#x27;t need to use anything for frizzies, no extra products at all.  So I ordered this and the matching shampoo for when I need to go fast and just get ready &amp; run out the door.  Usually I use Wen, but it takes some time.  This is for those other occasional times when I&#x27;m short of time.</li>
            <li> Read my reviews on the other Age defying products.  This probably won&#x27;t happen with others who try this product.  It&#x27;s just something about my hair.  I have really long, fine, not chemically treated platinum-colored hair--almost white.</li>
            <li> I used this product in conjunction with the shampoo and the advanced thickening agent and I followed the directions exactly. I purchased these items because of the many glowing reviews at Amazon. Sadly, the product did not work for me AT ALL. I have had much more success with Toppik and Folicure lines and can recommend either of them.</li>
            <li> My wife used this product a number of times. She reports noticeable improvement in a \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; or \\&quot;silky\\&quot; hair feeling; a reduction in dryness and brittleness; a reduction in split ends. She said it didn&#x27;t help with hair loss, though maybe that was too much to expect, although the product&#x27;s advertising claims a lot of benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her bottom line was that the product was good enough (I made it four stars from her descriptions) but nothing special to make it stand out among some of the other conditioners she&#x27;s used. She also said she was not sure that it was necessarily an \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot; product; she got similar benefits from other conditioners that didn&#x27;t claim to be specialized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair results, though, are probably very individual. If you want to try this product, maybe start out with one tube and see how it works for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty neutral when it comes to this conditioner.  Didn&#x27;t do much for me but at this price it&#x27;s certainly worth a try. I am 38yrs old and have long (mid back) highlighted blonde hair. I&#x27;ve been highlighting and low lighting it for over 15yrs. I&#x27;m lucky that my hair is thick but with all the bleaching I need a good conditioner/treatment to keep it soft and shiny. Pantene didn&#x27;t do anything special for my hair. I tried it for two weeks and the results were just ok.  I didnt care for the texture, reminded me of mayonnaise. Not as good results as other products I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m a firm believer in mixing it up with my shampoos and conditioners so I&#x27;m always on the look out for new things. This is a skip for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of my fave in hair care&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0006Q3NTS WEN by Chaz Dean Fig Cleansing Conditioner 16 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0006Q0HEC Wen by Chaz Dean Tea Tree Cleansing Conditioner 16 oz.]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0046MH00Q aussie - 3 minute miracle Deeep condtioning for damaged dos]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002MVD2JQ Frederic Fekkai Frederic Fekkai Technician Color Care Shampoo 16 fl oz (473 ml)]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001B2NMRY Fekkai Advanced Salon Technician Color Care Conditioner-16 oz.]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001JQLNRI Pantene Pro-V Nature Fusion Smooth Vitality Conditioner, 25.4-Fluid Ounce (Pack of 2)]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002CMLHEC It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave-In Product, 10-Ounce Bottle]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003E23HGU Miracle Styling Serum Serum Unisex by It&#x27;S A 10, 4 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002CMLRX8 Aveda Damage Remedy Conditioner, 6.7-Ounce Tube]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003OW8H38 AVEDA by Aveda: DAMAGE REMEDY DAILY HAIR REPAIR 3.4 OZ]]</li>
            <li> I have used this conditioner all the way to the bottom of the tube.  I think you really have to give something like hair products a real work out before you can form an opinion.  Although I would not continue using anything that hurt me or smelled bad or didn&#x27;t do the basics.  Age Defy definitely passed the first test!&lt;br /&gt;First off, the price is great.  You get a lot for your bucks. Secondly, the texture and smell of the conditioner is light and pleasant.  When my hair was air dried later, I was not stuck with an annoying perfume which some conditioners that Pantene have made before did with me.&lt;br /&gt;I am 62 and do not color my hair.  My hair is called salt and pepper with the white hairs being very coarse, wiry and flyaway.  Most of my life, my hair has been easy to style and control.  The white hairs are now quite a challenge.  This product is what I needed.  My hair feels soft and is much more manageable.  This is exactly what I have been looking for and I am very happy with this well priced and excellent conditioner.  I have not experienced breakage, split ends or thinning hair yet.  But it delivered on the promise of controlling frizz, unruly grays, lackluster color and definitely improved on dryness.</li>
            <li> I normally use Pantene shampoo and conditioner so I thought I would give this a try. It is much heavier than my normal conditioner even after rinsing for an extra long time it felt like it continued to weigh my hair down. I style my hair minimally but had to work at getting my hair to do something other than fall flat while using this conditioner. Perhaps it is more suited to a different hair type. I have wavy, medium thick, with a smattering of gray hairs and it just didn&#x27;t do it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is also much stronger than with my regular product which I am not keen on. Less is more as far as scented products go in my book.</li>
            <li> This conditioner made my hair so very limp  that It took several shampoos of my regular shampoo and mousse to get it back to normal.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find the right balance in a conditioner.  With some, my hair has body, but is too dry and frizzy, while others make it soft, but also clumpy and limp. Pantene&#x27;s Agedefy conditioner gets it right for my hair, giving a good amount of body and softness.  In other words, it makes good compromises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some conditioners are ruined by a floral smell, but Agedefy has a pleasant unisex scent.  It has not irritated my eyes, as some do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many brands of conditioner, and I think this is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> I have always loved the look and feel that pantene gives my hair after washing and have been solely using Pantene for nearly 7 years. The AgeDefy is designed to help with breakage, split ends, frizz, unruly grey hairs, lackluster colors, thin look and dryness. Although I do not suffer from all of the above, I have noticed my hair is a little less thin, and does not break so easily when brushing.  My split ends however, seemed to disappear from using this product twice. Contains a thickening formula that gives off a nice aroma. Overall, I definitely prefer this over their normal conditioner.</li>
            <li> This product is great and I would recommend as I have to friends and family.  My sister upon hearing about this product said she would be purchasing some soon.</li>
            <li> Excellent condition. Better than a lot of salon formulas</li>
            <li> my mom say it is very very good, she love it. and she said that turn her grey hair purple je je je</li>
            <li> To me, this product has a kinda funny smell so I&#x27;m still trying to get used to that, works well on my hair though.</li>
            <li> best I have found for my colored aging hair</li>
            <li> Very good conditioner that leaves my hair silky.</li>
            <li> About a thousand years ago Neiman Marcus briefly sold Pantene products. I figured someone big at the retailer was friendly with the someone big at Pantene because the product was okay but not worthy of such prestige. This product changes my opinion, completely, as it can compete with the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. Received a sample in the mail a while back and was impressed but didn&#x27;t buy until recently. Now, it will be my exclusive hair conditioner. For those who bleach their hair it helps to smooth hair cuticle keep the ends from looking too dry. My hair feels stronger, yet softer and looks really great. I can&#x27;t guarantee you&#x27;ll have the same results as me but it&#x27;s definitely worth a try. Incidentally, aside from dying my hair, I use a blow dryer and flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have a very thick hair and so far I have not find anything that will make my hair shiny and this one really works for me.</li>
            <li> I find that this product helps keep my hair hydrated, tangle free and soft.  I will purchase this again in the future.</li>
            <li> I have been on some anti seizure medication that causes my hair to thin and break easily.  I have been using vitamins, drinking more water, changing my diet, trying every single hair care product on the market, switched to satin pillowcases, wearing a sleep cap, no heat tools, etcetera for my hair.  My hairdresser told me to keep my hair moisturized in order to stop all the breaking.  I saw this product and thought why not give it a whirl.  I&#x27;m getting married in a year and I would really like to have long healthy locks to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have been using the shampoo, conditioner and the cream that you put on afterward.  The consistency of the shampoo is very thick and doesn&#x27;t lather like most shampoos.  It rather smooths on.  The conditioner is also very thick and while the bottle does not give any directions to use, my hairstylist recommends letting sit for 3 minutes, combing through with a wide toothed comb and then rinsing with cooler water.  Hot water is your hair&#x27;s enemy.  When I leave the shower I use the anti age cream by pantene which is a liquid spritz, I spray three spritzes down my center part, and then lift my hair with a comb and spritz several more times along the roots.  I let my hair air dry for about 10 minutes before using any sort or hair dryer or styling aides.  Sometimes I use a blow dry speed up spray from Kenra so that I am not blow drying my hair for extended periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this Pantene system for almost four weeks.  I have less hair in my comb.  Less hair pulls out when I take out ponytails.  My hair looks fuller and thicker from the roots all the way down to the ends.  My hair is extremely shiny and bouncy.  My hairdresser wondered how much I was paying to keep my hair moisturized.  My ends are not snagging and breaking like they have in the past, they are very smooth and snag free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not as flowery as Pantene normally is.  It is very clean as you can expect from Pantene, but not at all overpowering.  This product may or may not reverse aging, but it definitely has kept my hair healthier then it was and it is keeping my dreams alive that I can grow it out.  This product delivers healthy hair.t all overpowering.  This product may or may not reverse aging, but it definitely has kept my hair healthier then it was and it is keeping my dreams alive that I can grow it out.  This product delivers healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I remember when Pantene was THE deluxe brand.  Their conditioner was so much better than anything on the market.  Lately, I hadn&#x27;t really been feeling that.  However, because I have DRY, color treated fine hair, and I live in a DRY climate, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  Yes, I have a few years on you too...but I cut my hair often and generally it&#x27;s only about 4-5 years old at the split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this conditioner was nothing short of FANTASTIC.  Now I&#x27;m not suffering with frizzy fly-away hair.  It moisturizes without causing my hair to clump or look greasy.  It does *not* cause the color to fade.  Formerly used Purology, but I&#x27;ve tried everything from Redken to Matrix, to Organix.  This has by far worked the best for me.  I just hope they don&#x27;t change the formula!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(update 7/13)  We traveled over the 4th of July weekend and I discovered something about this product.  YES, I&#x27;m still getting fabulous results, but since I forgot to bring shampoo, I used this with the hotel shampoo.  My hair was NOT as soft and smooth as it is with Redken Color Extend Shampoo that I use at home.  IF you are not loving this conditioner, then try a different shampoo with it.  The combined effect is worth the trouble of finding the right shampoo to use with it.  I just got lucky the first time I used it!</li>
            <li> This is the best over the counter conditioner I have tried!  Usually I buy salon products, but thought I would give this a try because it said it targets breakage and split ends....and that it does!  I even saw quite a bit of new hair growth with this product.  Going to purchase more for sure.</li>
            <li> Great, thick conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioners I have used.  My hair is much silkier, feels in much better condition and yet not weighed down with heavy oils.  I have fine hair  (color treated and several gray hairs) and love this product!</li>
            <li> This product is great- I wish I could find it in stores- I would recommend to all my &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; friends!</li>
            <li> I like the way it smells, and it feels good, not too greasy. Feels thicker than a normal conditioner. Rinses out well, and my hair is easy to comb and not too fly-away. Haven&#x27;t really used it long enough to decide if it truly lives up to its claims, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say that this is any better than Suave.  I saw it in a magazine and wanted to try it.  Wish it did something but honestly I can&#x27;t see any difference and I think my hair has more static when I use it.</li>
            <li> I use this and the treatment and must say i am really impressed. I am not a huge fan of Pantene but they finally made a great product! It is more expensive then most of their products..but worth the price. And you can find it on sale. It has a nice clean scent and it a nice texture.  It does not leave any kind of residue behind. Which is one thing other Pantene products have done for my hair.  I am surprised how good my hair feels after I rinse! Soft, smooth but with volume! Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to try because I have \\&quot;aging hair.\\&quot; On first try, I followed the directions on the tube, but my hair remained saturated with oil for a full day at work, never absorbing completely. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and wash it out. So the next time, I took the tube, and with the cap securely on, squished the product around inside for a while. After I shampooed, I applied a very small amount of this conditioner, about the size of a pea. Better, but I may have erred on the conservative side, as the hair ends didn&#x27;t settle down completely.&lt;br /&gt;The list of ingredients is good, and I suppose that I&#x27;ll get the amount to use figured out. The manufacturer may want to identify a range of application amount so that consumers might expect to have to work with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum: after squishing the tube around a bit and re-trying, I&#x27;ve become a fan of this product, and since I&#x27;m getting low on my current supply, plan to buy it from now on. May have just been a fluke of storage or shipping.</li>
            <li> I have used Pantene and Olay products for many years and have always found them to be a nice quality, pleasantly scented, and generally good at what they say they will do. That said, over the past few years (as I am getting older)I have specifically begun looking for shampoos and conditioners that will protect my colored hair and help keep it moisturized since it has begun to get dryer and a bit frizzier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Pantene Pro-V Agedefy promises to address \\&quot;Seven signs of aging hair\\&quot; including breakage, split ends,frizz, unruly grays, lackluster color, the look of thinning and dryness. It claims to be gentle enough for daily use on color-treated hair, though it does not have the typical \\&quot;sulfate-free\\&quot; label that most color protective shampoos and conditioners have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, did it live up to addressing those seven things? I can say that I have not seen a significant difference in dryness, frizz, a change in my grays, a change in my color, or a difference in the amount of hair that I see in the drain after using it. I should also say that, though it is no better than other brands, it certainly is no worse than anything I have used recently. So, bottom line would be that it is a fine product, comparable with many of the others that are on the market right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could say it was a miraculous combination of Pantene and Olay that will transform our hair, but I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I honestly cannot say enough about this conditioner.  I have a problem with fine hair that tangles easily, breaks and falls out because of the tangling.  There is a NOTICEABLE difference between the amount of hair in my shower when I use this product then when I don&#x27;t.  It just detangles beautifully allowing my wet comb to just glide through my hair.  No breakage, no tangling, no pulling, SIGNIFICANTLY less hair in my shower drain.  This conditioner is perfection for me.  I am horrified that some people with natural white hair had their hair turn yellow.  I hope Pantene can fix this because I don&#x27;t want this product to ever go off the market.  My hair thanks you for an awesome product Pantene!</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner.  My 70+ year old hair is more manageable than with my usual conditioner -- I really do not even need the hair spray to keep the frizzes in place.  Unfortunately, nobody has come up to me and commented that my hair looks darker, less grayish -- but I feel that it does look younger.  The icing on the cake is that it is inexpensively available in our small-town Walmart!  What more could I ask for?  Well -- I might like it to be odorless; I really do not like the scent when I use it.  But it is not aggravating my many allergies, so that may be a small price to pay for inexpensive great conditioner.</li>
            <li> So after reading the reviews about how great this product is, I tried it for a month. I am 55 years old and have thin, frizz hair. When I wash my hair alot falls off. This did not work at ALL for me. I will not buy it or recommend it. Agedefy? My hair is still thin, frizzes and no improvement what so ever.</li>
            <li> This is a good conditioner.  It leaves my hair feeling very soft and I&#x27;ve noticed that it doesn&#x27;t break as much.  Also my bottle has lasted for two months so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin hair and I was really hoping that this line from Pantene would make a noticeable difference.  I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo, conditioner, and leave-in treatment for a couple of months.  It does help add a little thickness, and I&#x27;m hoping that over time my hair will become fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner has a very gentle scent -- nothing fruity, just kind of an organic smell.  I don&#x27;t think it would bother anyone who&#x27;s sensitive to smells, as other hair products might.</li>
            <li> I have always liked Pantene products, so I was thrilled I could give this conditioner a try.  I love it.  It leaves my hair feeling soft and silky, not the least bit heavy.  Easy to comb through, as well.  I even think I have fewer split ends.  I have long hair and have had some issues with breakage, but this conditioner has helped with that, too.  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Conditions really well and I didn&#x27;t have to leave it on too long. Used it for a week now, and hair feels really soft and silky but not greasy. I only apply to the bottom half of my hair and not on top to keep it from becoming too flat. In future, I&#x27;d probably use it every other wash or even once a week in the summer when it&#x27;s more humid and hair gets more naturally oily.</li>
            <li> A great product.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I tried this product on my sometimes frizzy, dry hair and it delivered as promised.  My hair was much softer, easier to control, and not nearly as frizzy.  But, and this is a big but-- like most of these products the array of chemicals used to create the end-result is staggering. Just try reading the ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it particularly frustrating that they use Quarternium which is really just another word for formaldehyde.  I have an allergy to formaldehyde and would really appreciate it if manufacturers either stopped using this ingredient-- or at least put it more prominently on the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So-- I&#x27;m giving it three stars because it works about the way you would expect this type of product to work.  I would say it&#x27;s about the same as other products of a similar vein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you&#x27;re at all sensitive to chemicals, you might want to look for other, more natural options.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked the Pantene brand, but this seems more of an improvement on the usual in their line. It smells very strongly of coconut, even after you have rinsed your hair. The lotion itself is much thicker than most, perhaps that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s in a tube instead of a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;When I used my normal amount of conditioner, it was really too much and extremely hard to rinse out, even the shower floor became slippery. My hair is about 8\\&quot; below my shoulders and I normally wear it in a ponytail or braid. Knots and tangles can become a problem, but with this my hair was very silky feeling afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, even with the smaller amount used, when I applied it to hair around my scalp, the hair, especially my bangs looked oily. I remedied this by just applying it to the hair that was below my chin line.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle rests on its lid, so you can use it to the last drop. The cap was tight, but when I lifted the tube up, after it had been in the shower stall, water pours out of the space between the cap and the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an excellent conditioner and my hair feels softer than it has felt in years.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works well enough, leaving my hair tangle-free and soft, without leaving it greasy or limp.  I can&#x27;t say I noticed any difference from many other conditioners, so I&#x27;ll give this 4 stars instead of 5.  It&#x27;s a nice product and decent value and I&#x27;d buy it in the future, but, really, it&#x27;s nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> Very nice Conditioner, I used it with the matching shampoo and the results are fantastic!!! No other products needed to get great results. My color, blow dry, curling iron treated hair loves this product and looks healthy. Not oily or weighted down.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is the thickest formula I have ever use. It has a pleasant scent while not being too strong. I have thick, long hair and it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover it all. Only downfall is that it is difficult to rinse out. It takes a lot longer to rinse completely than others. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> First off, my hair is brown with some gray and wavy to curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner has a pleasant but not overpowering scent, which is important to me because I am very sensitive to odors.  It does a very good job of taming the frizzy gray hairs without weighing down the rest of my hair.  I&#x27;m hoping for a nice head of while to silver hair someday instead of a general face that my mom has, and while it might be too ealry to tell for sure, this product seems to be helping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is also definitely thinning, which is why I wanted to try this product in the first place.  This is not a miracle thickener, but it does seem to give some additional body.  Which is very much appreciated because I don&#x27;t use mousse or other styling aides because they my my scalp itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also paired this up with the matching shampoo and the effect has been very nice.</li>
            <li> Pantene&#x27;s 8.4 ounce size Pro-V Expert Collection Agedefy Conditioner works very well.  As someone with \\&quot;combination hair\\&quot; -- meaning I&#x27;m not entirely gray as of yet, nor even mostly gray -- I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this product.  But it does a very good job on both the silvery-gray hairs and the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair that hasn&#x27;t turned that color as of yet, while leaving my hair feeling softer than usual.  As my hair tends to be coarse and thick (yes, even now, when I&#x27;m mumble-mumble past thirty-five), that&#x27;s a very good sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, I&#x27;ve used this product for several weeks and have had no reactions -- no allergies, no skin rashs, nothing of that sort -- so if you have sensitive skin (as I do), you might want to consider this product even if you&#x27;re like me and aren&#x27;t anywhere near the expected age to use this particular product (as it seems to be geared for women ages 55 and up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars, with my highest recommendation for personal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barb Caffrey</li>
            <li> Used with the comlimentary shampoo.  Leaves hair soft and managable with much body.  Like the shampoo, has a decent scent-not overpowering.  Will but this along with the shampoo in the future.</li>
            <li> After using this conditioner, I found that I had so much static and fly-aways.....and I didn&#x27;t really see a difference in the conditon of my hair after using it.</li>
            <li> Because this was advertised as an \\&quot;Agedefy Conditioner\\&quot; I was expecting a little more moisturizing and conditioning impact on my hair.  I would say it is about average in terms of conditioning. Nothing special. It would be good if you have oily or normal hair, but if your hair is dry or damaged or it is older, more brittle hair, I would recommend looking for something more emollient.  One product I recently tried that I really like, for example, is Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Conditioner. It is more emollient and makes my hair shinier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that this product really stops hair loss, which is my biggest problem, but it may be helping a little.  The conditioner is thick and rich, though, and leaves my hair softer than many others have.</li>
            <li> I used this conditioning product along with the The shampoo for several weeks on a 2-3 times a week basis.  My hair did seem to be brighter in color and was shinier, a bit more silky and had more body.</li>
            <li> This is a good conditioner. I generally do not like pantene products because my hair feels coated. There was none of that with the Agedefy Conditioner. It smells clean and rinses away without leaving an over powering scent. It is thick and I ended up using a little more than usual trying to get it through my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It mostly does what it says. Hair is soft and shiny. Those are definitely hallmarks of younger healthy hair. I did not notice any impact on my wiry grays. But even though the product description says that this conditioner treats that, I did not expect it. Nothing beats grays into submission except dye and/or flat irons. But it does address dryness and dullness. It also doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down and make it look thin which is pretty good for such a moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t actually aware that your hair changes as you age (other than gray hair obviously), but have found that along with everything else, your hair starts to loose its OOMPH when you hit a certain age. I have very long, fine,, straight hair and in the last few years, I&#x27;ve noticed it is dryer, tangles easier and just not as shiny... I have tried lots of different shampoos and conditioners and even my old, expensive stand bys just didnt seem to do it anymore.  Constant, deep conditioning with masks seemed to be the only thing that helped at all, but the results just didn&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product with my regular shampoo and at first was a little taken aback when combing it out after the shower.  My hair seemed sort of stiff and a bit difficult to comb out, it did not feel all that moisturized, BUT when completely dry, WOW!! It is like my hair was BACK, in all its glory!!! Shiney, smooth, no frizz, just youthful and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really cannot say enough good about this product and how fantastically my hair responded, other than I will always use it, no matter the cost. Job well done Pantene!</li>
            <li> A little background. Two years ago, at age 40, I finally decided to stop fighting the grays that had plagued me since I was 12 and let my hair go &#x27;natural.&#x27; After the color grew out, the underlying color (a mix of dark brown and luminous silver) was stunning. Not a week would go by without a stranger stopping me and complimenting me on my &#x27;highlights.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside? My hair has always been on the thin side. So when I saw a commercial for this product, I decided to give it a try. Granted, I had no illusions my hair would look like Courteney Cox&#x27;s (if it&#x27;s even hers and not extensions, but no matter); at any rate, I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product, and a week and a half later, my hair had changed. It wasn&#x27;t noticeably shinier, but it felt...coated. Looking at the label, I could only say of COURSE! The stuff is full of polymers (plastics, essentially). But worse, my lovely silver highlights had turned yellow. Yellow! Anyone who has spent months or (in my case) years cultivating a hairstyle can imagine how devastating this was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this discovery, I have scrubbed my hair with clarifying shampoo (NOT Pantene) to little avail. It seems that in order to get back my highlights, I will have to--oh, the irony--go to a salon and have my hair treated. I called Pantene, where the rep insisted this product was a real conditioner and didn&#x27;t coat the hair with anything and couldn&#x27;t POSSIBLY have changed my color, but I know my hair and I know the truth. The one variable in this has been Pantene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I suppose that&#x27;ll teach me. Not only did Courteney Cox get to dance with Bruce Springsteen in that video (it was supposed to be me!), she also sold me on a product that shellacked my hair and ruined the color. Never again, Pantene!</li>
