            <li>but since they don&#x27;t carry Cellutherm (which is excellent in tightening skin)</li>
            <li>The gel didn&#x27;t make all of the cellulite disappear, but it did a great job of making my thighs look and feel smoother and firmer.</li>
            <li>amazing!</li>
            <li>good gel.....</li>
            <li>I think the results for her have been spectacular.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>, Thank you for selling such an awesome product, I will re-order again and again.</li>
            <li>This is the best product ive ever bought, im still amazed by the instant changes, i have toner smoother skin, will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li>I will definately continue to use this product :)</li>
            <li>Nothing works better than diet, ecxercize and zerona.  </li>
            <li>Obviously you have to drink water, eat right, work out for the best results but doing that while using this is so good.</li>
            <li>Awesome result in few weeks......</li>
            <li>Instant shipping is a bonus :)</li>
            <li>but you do have to consistently use it.  </li>
            <li>It does not has a very strong smell like other cream products too.</li>
            <li>So I got this product and it really made a difference for me</li>
            <li>and it finishes fast.</li>
            <li>I have just gotten my very 1st bottle end</li>
            <li>The gel is very cooling and not greasy.</li>
            <li>really makes your legs look like you have no cellulite!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that she doesn&#x27;t use it as much as directed on the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Work fast.......</li>
            <li>It really does work  </li>
            <li>I would suggest that anybody who wants to minimize the appearance of cellulite but is also realistic that no gel can make it all disappear should try this product.</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t expect the cellulite to completely disappear or to have it be a 3 month process.</li>
            <li>She uses it generally once a day but sometimes misses.  </li>
            <li>The first few months she had noticeably tighter skin and the cellulite dimples appeared smaller.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have too much cellulite over all but the little</li>

            <li> My legs are getting smaller and a little toner due to excersise but the dimple have mot diminished in the slightest.</li>
            <li> Messy, smelly, pointless and stains if it falls on anything that&#x27;s white</li>
            <li> This stuff did ZERO for my minimal trouble areas.  </li>
            <li> Her cellulite is probably 1/2 to 2/3 less visible.  </li>
            <li> What a waste!</li>
            <li> This product did not or at least has not worked for me.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed in it being a gel because it did not get absorbed &amp; stuck to my clothes after waiting 1/2 hour before dressing.  </li>
            <li> The worst thing the price</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waist your money!!</li>
            <li> I have noticed an improvement in my skin.  I will continue to use this product and give you an update as time goes on.</li>
            <li> This product did not or at least has not worked for me. I have been using it religiously twice a day as instructed for almost a month and i havent seen a change yet. My skin is the same. I have cellulite on the inside of my thighs which i want to get rid of. i workout 2 hrs a day 6 days a week and apply this treatment as instructed. Its not working. My legs are getting smaller and a little toner due to excersise but the dimple have mot diminished in the slightest. Im disapointed. On to the next one.</li>
            <li> I used this once (sometimes twice) a day, and within a couple of weeks I definitely noticed that the skin on my outer thighs and above my knees was firmer and smoother. The gel didn&#x27;t make all of the cellulite disappear, but it did a great job of making my thighs look and feel smoother and firmer. I would suggest that anybody who wants to minimize the appearance of cellulite but is also realistic that no gel can make it all disappear should try this product.</li>
            <li> So I got this product and it really made a difference for me, I saw it immediately and I have told my friends about it and hopefully they plan to order this too. Obviously you have to drink water, eat right, work out for the best results but doing that while using this is so good. I love it, Thank you for selling such an awesome product, I will re-order again and again.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ive ever bought, im still amazed by the instant changes, i have toner smoother skin, will continue to buy this product. Instant shipping is a bonus :)</li>
            <li> Inmediately you find your skin smoother. Obviously you have to combine it with some exercise. The worst thing the price and it finishes fast.</li>
            <li> To those who are looking for solution to your \\&quot;orange peel\\&quot; skin, please do not hesitate to try this product. I have just gotten my very 1st bottle end Nov/ beginning Dec&#x27;10 and been using only every morning instead of morning &amp; nite (as recommended). I can see skin on my butt and tighs are smoother and firmer and I have not even finish 1/2 bottle of it! The gel is very cooling and not greasy. It does not has a very strong smell like other cream products too. I will definately continue to use this product :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about two weeks now.  It does seem to be making a difference!  I do, however, wish that they would make it so that, after application, I don&#x27;t smell like a combination of facial cleanser and cough syrup.</li>
            <li> I put some by the buttocks, and I was shocked!&lt;br /&gt;It really makes your legs look like you have no cellulite!&lt;br /&gt;Its amazing! I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product did not produce andy results for me</li>
            <li> I prefer to order from Amazon but since they don&#x27;t carry Cellutherm (which is excellent in tightening skin) I decided to try Cellulean.  Was very disappointed in it being a gel because it did not get absorbed &amp; stuck to my clothes after waiting 1/2 hour before dressing.  Back to Cellutherm which is on a dodgy website...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife.  Of course I wouldn&#x27;t buy it without her asking.  She asked for a cellulite treatment so I read reviews and bought this one.  I just ordered her 3rd bottle so here are the results.  Keep in mind that she doesn&#x27;t use it as much as directed on the bottle.  She uses it generally once a day but sometimes misses.  She massages the area with a roller hand massage tool.  She also works out 5-6 times a week.  Keep in mind that the change has been gradual.  The first few months she had noticeably tighter skin and the cellulite dimples appeared smaller.  After 11 months she still has dimples and visible cellulite but it is significantly smaller and less pronounced.  Her skin appears smoother.  Her cellulite is probably 1/2 to 2/3 less visible.  Considering the price and effort involved I think the results for her have been spectacular.  But don&#x27;t expect the cellulite to completely disappear or to have it be a 3 month process.</li>
            <li> Work fast.......good gel..... Awesome result in few weeks......</li>
            <li> I am truly amazed at this product!  It really does work  but you do have to consistently use it.  I can&#x27;t wait to buy another bottle!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff doesnt work, leaves you sticky and slimy and I chucked the product into the garbage. What a waste!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used cellulean for 4-5 years during the summer months.  It does work as well as any &amp;#34;rub-in&amp;#34; &amp;#34;topical&amp;#34; cream does.  Nothing works better than diet, ecxercize and zerona.  This will keep the &amp;#34;edge&amp;#34; off the cellulite but you won&#x27;t see results just alone.  Couple with diet and exercise.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I wasted my money on a topical product for cellulite.  This stuff did ZERO for my minimal trouble areas.  I exercise &amp; weight lift 5 days a week, but still struggled with a stubborn area on my stomach.  This gel left my skin with &amp;#34;crumbles&amp;#34; and slightly sticky.  Would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Used this product before and I like it.</li>
            <li> I have been using it regularly and have not noticed any difference on my legs. I don&#x27;t have too much cellulite over all but the little I do seems to just stay there even with this product;</li>
            <li> Messy, smelly, pointless and stains if it falls on anything that&#x27;s white</li>
