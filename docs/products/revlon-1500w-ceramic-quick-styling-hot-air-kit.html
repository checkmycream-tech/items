            <li>it has excellent air speed and lots of heat.  </li>

            <li>Does a great job, just be careful.&lt;br /&gt;Betty</li>
            <li>Great tool with plenty of power.  </li>
            <li>..Wife is happy.........</li>
            <li>then I&#x27;m happy.  </li>
            <li>Great one handed product- meaning</li>
            <li>I tried this at  my daughters and thought it wad great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all fly away looking.</li>
            <li>It was so great at styling my hair</li>
            <li>Great end result, lightweight,</li>
            <li>Its magic to your hair!!</li>
            <li>This awesome styling brush is quieter than the blow dryer I reaplaced, and a MUCH better and faster styling tool.  </li>
            <li>This is a good alternative to blow drying your hair with a brush and hairdryer.</li>
            <li>and my sister LOVED it.</li>
            <li>Anyway, all the good things still stand:</li>
            <li>I loved the idea of replacing my hair dryer &amp; barrel brush combo with something I could use with one hand</li>
            <li>and I loved the results.  </li>
            <li>but otherwise it is good.</li>
            <li>I am sure it functions beautifully, but I have a sensitivity to volume.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>i really love it!</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li>I had a hot air brush for 15 years that was awesome.  </li>
            <li>In love!</li>
            <li>Am amazing their testing didn&#x27;t reveal this flaw.</li>
            <li>AMAZING</li>
            <li>Totally thrilled with this.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled with the results and</li>
            <li>The bristles kept the hair against the brush nicely.  </li>
            <li>This leaves my hair kind of kinky and shows bends where the hair was against seams.  </li>
            <li>Kind of a neat touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Settings - nice assortment for an inexpensive dryer.  </li>
            <li>Great power, dries my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>And at $25 you can&#x27;t find a better one, it allows you to turn on ions for smoother finish or off for more volume!  </li>
            <li>Cost does not matter to me ~ it is important to get a product that works well, with good results.      </li>
            <li>Yes it is loud, but it works GREAT!  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this dryer!</li>
            <li>For a more staying curl I still use a curling iron just because I like more curl, but this gives nice body to start with.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m really happy with this hot air</li>
            <li>The hot air is great except it seems to blow out around the handle instead of through the bristles of the attachments.  </li>
            <li>It does have great power at 1500w but is pretty loud.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As in, if you were in a work setting, OSHA would fine your employer!  </li>
            <li>However, the product itself is very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Very cheap.</li>
            <li>it detaches from the accessories nicely and is easy to store.  </li>
            <li>PLEASE find something of better quality</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My hair style lasted for more than 3 days.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I use all the time</li>
            <li>Defective design for sure.</li>
            <li>I did not get the volume I wanted, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>To top it all off I got the waves and bounce I wanted.</li>
            <li>I also have the RV440, which I love too.  </li>
            <li>Then I tried the one my sister had - this one - and loved it so much I bought mine own.  </li>
            <li>The hair around the brush flies away from it, leaving you with even more frizz than before styling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I love my curler.</li>
            <li>Love love love this.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the way this dries my hair-good look practically every time I used it.</li>
            <li>I feel I should have shopped around a lot more before deciding on this one.  </li>
            <li>Again, if it turned to release the hair, it would be a better design.  </li>
            <li>My favorite hairstyling product.</li>
            <li>The last one I bought (still works perfectly), but after 5 years I just wanted a change.</li>
            <li>The product is great and works very well.</li>
            <li>have never ever received so many complements on my hair.</li>
            <li>and i love this dryer.   </li>
            <li>The blow dryer is much faster and this product is great for the finish drying and styling.  </li>
            <li>Amazon price is better than what I paid at Target, too, so get it here.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used better.</li>
            <li>and I love it..</li>
            <li>but I still love it..</li>
            <li>Best invention for the girl who doesn&#x27;t have the coordination to hold the hair dryer and the roller brush at the same time.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>and I simply love it....</li>
            <li>all love</li>
            <li>but it worked great and my hair&#x27;s bounciness held much longer than with the brush.</li>
            <li>I have used this type of product for many, many years.</li>
            <li>Tried to curl bangs and more air blew in my face than my hair.  </li>
            <li>It also comes with a concentrator attachment to just blow the air more like a hair dryer, but keep in mind it limits the air flow to a smallarea.</li>
            <li>Be sure and compare model number</li>
            <li>sometimes more my hair will get caught in the barrel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned two of them, and neither has lasted more than 6 months.</li>
            <li>you aren&#x27;t sure about it, they sell it at Site-to-Store function online at Walmart.  </li>
            <li>I bought mine about a year ago to replace my older model Revlon Perfect Heat hot air brush</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!!.</li>
            <li>It is great for my new A-frame cut.</li>
            <li>Really nice product, Its more useful for my wife</li>
            <li>Quick results with a nice bend in the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li>So once I received this I knew I had to give myself more time to do my hair, which was fine.</li>
            <li>I wanted to find something that would give my hair more volume, with a smooth and shiny look.</li>
            <li>If it had that feature (as some of the other models) it would be perfect.  </li>
            <li>Dryer is easy to use, easy for me to manipulate, and because it comes apart it is easy to pack for travel.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was easy to use</li>
            <li>- yes you can dial it from 1 inch to 1.5 but it doesn&#x27;t lock in position so it easily collapses.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the non-turning barrell that allows you to easily unroll the heated hair without getting stuck.</li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>My hair does NOT curl around things easily.  </li>
            <li>-hope it doesn&#x27;t break easily.</li>
            <li>dries quickly, makes my hair look pretty good.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and won&#x27;t curl easily</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine hair to my shoulder blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this Revlon appliance has incredible power &amp; with one appliance I can dry &amp; style my hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping and everything else was fine.</li>
            <li>so I think it&#x27;s fine.   </li>
            <li>I really liked this tool for my fine straight hair.  </li>
            <li>the handle is huge).    </li>
            <li>; is probably accurate.  </li>
            <li>That made a huge difference for me.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the heat or the sound because it WORKS.</li>
            <li>I did get the shiny smooth look from the ions in the styler.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great if you can get it to last...</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s great return policy made getting a refund simple.</li>
            <li>This is a great blow dryer for also curling your hair and getting some style at the same time.</li>
            <li>so it was lint free</li>
            <li>dries hair fast, leaves my hair with nice waves.</li>
            <li>Overall, extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li>Hair turns out smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>but so cheaply made.</li>
            <li>This one is definitely more powerful.  </li>
            <li>The brushes secure onto the body with a notch.  </li>
            <li>I loved the old model of this item, it lasted for years, and when it died...</li>
            <li>Looks like a light bouncy curl, with life, very soft, very healthy looking.</li>
            <li>THANKS!!!</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and super light.</li>
            <li>This makes my fine hair full and smooth looking.</li>
            <li>This would not make it very easy to switch from hot to cool.</li>
            <li>I like the ideal of the product, but the first one i got only lasted about 4-6 months before the attachments wouldn&#x27;t stay on.  </li>
            <li>Super easy to return if it isn&#x27;t what you like.</li>
            <li>The good thing is that it gets hotter than most hot air brushes, but the handle is just too big to use easily.  </li>
            <li>Now I have another hot air styler to add to the collection ~~ but am looking for a cheap online source for earplugs!  </li>
            <li>It survived many falls and never failed on me.</li>
            <li>The original design had a release button that allowed you to roll your hair around the brush, release it and let the curl drop.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a higher wattage than most of the others.  </li>
            <li>but it is very fine and straight.  </li>
            <li>if your hair is very fine, maybe too much.  </li>
            <li>The only concern I have is the loud noise it makes; otherwise, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>but you can not take apart to clean when dust will build up.</li>
            <li>My basic WalMart Revlon hot air styler literally came apart at the seam and broke, and have been searching for a good replacement; thought I would upgrade to a better \\&quot;ceramic ion\\&quot;.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been good at the dryer in one hand and brush in the other hand, other than to just have hair fly all over!  </li>
            <li>This is a very good product, however, be very careful because it gets very hot quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is so large that you need monster size hands to be able to use it.  </li>
            <li>I should have read dimensions more closely and certainly will from now on.  </li>
            <li>but anyways if you put enough effort you might get a pretty great hairdry.</li>
            <li>This seemed to be a good item, but it stopped working 2 months later after The purchase date.</li>
            <li>The comment about the on/off switch at the bottom is completely true as well.  </li>
            <li>I loved the power and have had them last as follows:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>I love this product so much.  </li>
            <li>so one must turn the dryer to cool before shutting off.</li>
            <li>The tourmaline ionic technology is something I look for in a dryer as it has made a difference with my fine hair, making it soft, without static or frizz, and infusing moisture for healthier hair.</li>
            <li>Light and easy, love the different settings.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident you can find a better product at the same price point.</li>
            <li>1500 watts makes this a quick dryer.  </li>
            <li>It takes out all my frizz and dries super quick.</li>
            <li>no giran los cepillos y es super pesado</li>
            <li>Believe me, you will never be able to use the brush on high speed.</li>
            <li>Is very hot and, therefore, works quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And....it gets very hot</li>
            <li>so this is better, i still have the pink part of my old one which works great...</li>
            <li>I have arthritis and the large size is easy to grip.</li>
            <li>Air was too strong and blew my hair right out and got too hot</li>
            <li>I have an older 1200W dryer that&#x27;s more powerful and quieter than this 1500W.  </li>
            <li>This model i am a first time user and love the power and how fast it dries my hair.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend to anyone!!!</li>
            <li>My hair is completely straight and fine, so with this I get great body and a slight curl when holding the hair wrapped in the barrel brush a bit longer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 1500w, which is the same as most blow dryers, so it sounds like a blow dryer!</li>
            <li>I would honestly like it more if it worked a little deeper in your roots</li>
            <li>It takes both hands to use it effectively which leaves none left for working with your hair.  </li>
            <li>She loves it, so much more versitile then the old one this replaced.  </li>
            <li>3 useful</li>
            <li>: Barrel of dryer unit could be smaller and it would be nice to have some type of grip on it.</li>
            <li>It stopped working days after being able to send it back for free.  </li>
            <li>would HIGHLY recommend this product for anyone who is always rushing in the AM to get ready and out the door :)  </li>
            <li>Gives just the right amount of curl to my hair.</li>
            <li>That person is right.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure I am going to suffer long-term hearing loss from the 3 times I&#x27;ve used it, and I&#x27;m surprised it hasn&#x27;t been recalled for the 125 decibel scream that comes from it.</li>
            <li>this dryer is an excellent dryer brush for drying your hair from completely wet stage with the various attachments or just touching up your style later.  </li>
            <li>Do not buy.&lt;br /&gt;For the same price you will be far more satisfied with the John Frieda air brush.</li>
            <li>I have ALWAYS used a curling brush (hot air curling brush), so I thought this product would be worth a try.  </li>
            <li>Apparently the higher wattage which provides more heat and air flow is the reason for weight, size and noise level of this item.  </li>
            <li>This brush works really well, but tends to overheat and burn out quickly.</li>
            <li>The bristles hold my hair nicely while I curl and dry it.  </li>
            <li>My daughter in law was visiting this past weekend and used it and fell in love with it too, so she is purchasing it too!!</li>
            <li>It works REALLY fast, een on my very thick hair, and makes beautiful smooth lines or curled ends.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been an avid user of hot air dryer brushes since they came out as I like the extra body and light curl I get with my fine hair both at shorter and shoulder lengths.</li>
            <li>I took one star off because it really does become very hot, but it&#x27;s not an issue.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t blow away, then hold it on high, then it MUST go to cool.</li>
            <li>The first time it happened, I assumed it was a fluke</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time and now regret it.    </li>
            <li>This comes with three attachments (2 roller brushes + 1 flathead), all of which have 3 slits at the bottom (you can see in the product picture) through which hot air escapes and makes your ears and neck really hot.  </li>
            <li>Then, as you try to use it, it gets so hot that it burns you.  </li>
            <li>My first replacement try was a  WIGO Europe WG5120</li>
            <li>;)    </li>
            <li>This hair dryer  will shut off after using it on the hot cycle for just a minute.  </li>
            <li>If you want curls, just use hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>After so many searches and reviews I bought this one, The biggest shock was when I started the dryer and the air flow was not actually going through the brush</li>
            <li>it made a funny noise and seemed like it was going to burn up.  </li>
            <li>The first one the motor burned out in about a week.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;3. 6 months (replaced by factory)&lt;br /&gt;4. 2 years (factory replacement exactly like this</li>
            <li>sooooooooo hot</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace the Revlon 440c (which was too hot</li>
            <li>hair around this barrel of this Hot Air  item.  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted about a year.  </li>
            <li>There is so much hot air coming out before the curl brush that is burns your hands, ears, or scalp.  </li>
            <li>although I&#x27;m aware these things die out after awhile, I&#x27;d be willing to buy another just for the convenience of it.  </li>
            <li>its too hot almost like a straightener..</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I also think the unit gets too hot.</li>
            <li>The only redeeming quality of this styler is the color.  </li>
            <li>However, I have had 2 more after that, and they all broke in the same place within a week.</li>
            <li>The most recent one burnt out in 3.</li>
            <li>, what&#x27;s better than having to use only one hair tool?!?</li>
            <li>a more positive note, it does dry my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>, it has a very high pitch motor, and vents right where the brushes go into the unit.</li>
            <li>After using the revo styler for 15 years, i though this might be nice not having to use a dryer in one hand and the brush in the other, but the brush does not rotate as i thought it would as i asked for a revolving styler.</li>
            <li>First one functionable after 10 years, but wanted a new colorful one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, the first time I used this, the hair dryer heated up so much, that the plastic clips holding the brush in place melted, and ripped off just pulling it through my hair.  </li>
            <li>I really like this hot air brush.</li>
            <li>The first time it happened, I bought another one, thinking that I must have pulled with too much tension.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the coordination to round brush my own hair, but with this clever contraption, I can!!  </li>
            <li>It does make noise, and at the high setting it makes more noise than a standard blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>it will ONLY smooth the very top layer of hair, everything underneath stays a mess</li>
            <li>I have very thick curly hair and with the Revlon Quick Hot Air Curling Brush I am able to style and smooth.  </li>
            <li>( so I&#x27;m not super thrilled about</li>
            <li>On this unit you have to hold it in one hand while turning a large dial on the bottom.  </li>
            <li>Large brush.  </li>
            <li>There are other high end, pricier ones that I figured were amazing</li>
            <li>Bought this product in April 2011 , everything seems to be working fine and suddenly it just stopped working.</li>
            <li>The brush ends work great and are super with my short hair and dry my hair in no time flat.</li>
            <li>Be sure to blow-dry your hair to &#x27;almost dry&#x27; before using the brush!</li>
            <li>it were a review for the older one, I&#x27;d say 5 stars!  </li>
            <li>It only takes me half an hour to turn my wet hair to nice, smooth lovely hair.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for straightening , but it&#x27;s hard to use it for curling.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;concentrator&amp;#34; is my favorite part as the adjustable brush is hard plastic and doesn&#x27;t even fit the adjustments correctly</li>
            <li>The only draw back is that with the original one I purchased the switch broke after only 5 months but it was such a good dryer that I decided to re-purchase with the hopes that this one will not break as quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because I really like the speed of the dryer.</li>
            <li>and  I do use all three attachments depending on how much volume I want.  </li>
            <li>It also, I think, has too MUCH power -</li>
            <li>I ended up getting a 1200 watt barrel brush dryer that was much easier to work with.</li>
            <li>A leaf blower isn&#x27;t much noisier.</li>
            <li>You really need ear plugs to use this one.    </li>
            <li>I dislike it so much that I&#x27;m going to return it.    </li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t quit on me while getting ready for work.  </li>
            <li>(speciañly since i have really curly/puffy hair),</li>
            <li>This thing overheats, and between the cheap plastic, and the motor, it won&#x27;t last you long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I swear she wants to purchase like 10 of these for the years to come just in case.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is loud, but what do you want from a powerful tool?</li>
            <li>I gently twist and release the curl, without brushing it out immediately until all the hair is finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the brush grabs the hair without tangling very well</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>so can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>Made well and very sturdy.</li>
            <li>This works very well and has lots of power which is something that I really like.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased 3 of these Revlon dryer brushes in the past and this one is my favorite because it leaves my hair shiny and full of volume.  </li>
            <li>Also, if I use it like I would a curling iron, (i.e., roll a strand of hair around the brush and hold it there for a few seconds, then unroll it), it gives my hair a gentle curl and nice</li>
            <li>There are 3 settings, cool, low and high, and I use it exclusively on high and love how it dries my hair just as quickly as a regular hair dryer, but with the ability to boost body and add shape all in one step.</li>
            <li>High (hot), low (hot), cool (a high setting)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The noise wasn&#x27;t as high pitched, didn&#x27;t sound like it was working as hard, curled better.  </li>
            <li>It took some getting use to the extra weight and length over my other dryer brushes, but having more heat and air flow along with the other features I&#x27;ve mentioned are more important to me.  </li>
            <li>I agree with many of the other comments here..</li>
            <li>This one works so much better than any other one.</li>
            <li>I have long, medium thickness, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>The heat does not seem to distribute very well, even on high heat...</li>
            <li>Well, when I used the brush for the first and only time, I have to say that the reviewers had a point, and those who warned not to buy, were absolutely right.</li>
            <li>My fine hair falls out of the bristles before I can get my hair dry.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it too loud or too hot like</li>
            <li>I have normal hair that is mid-length and straight.  </li>
            <li>and this helps us dry and style and get rid of the frizzies pretty quickly too.</li>
            <li>but I called the manufacture and the company sent me a new one!  </li>
            <li>they should just sell the brush part for when that breaks you can replace it instead of buying a whole new set.  </li>
            <li>Just okay, Thought the 2 black buttons on the barrel were on/off, nope,</li>
            <li>Also its design is not made for quick drying, but I&#x27;ve found that drying and styling is much easier when you blow dry in sections (I have long, fine hair).</li>
            <li>After years struggling with a dryer and round brush, I am delighted by this tool, I&#x27;ll never use a regular dryer again!</li>
            <li>It works well, and creates decent style.</li>
            <li>The main problem with this product is the volume.</li>
            <li>While there are a couple of things I don&#x27;t particularly like about this dryer brush, I still decided to purchase it again after comparing it to the competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have the earlier models of this hair dryer and really liked them except the last two models have had some major issues.    </li>
            <li>However, the slightest tension on the brush (such as when pulling hair taut and straight) will break the brush right off the styler.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, but even on high</li>
            <li>Third, the \\&quot;warm\\&quot; setting is not \\&quot;warm\\&quot;, it is HOT!  </li>
            <li>Oh well I&#x27;ll give it a little more time before I give up and look for something else.</li>
            <li>I used the regular blow dry feature first till it was damp then used the larger attachment &amp; turned on high mostly, but when I wanted to use like curling iron and roll hair up and hold it, it does get hot</li>
            <li>The soft bristle brush really works, though, and smooths and styles my hair all in one without having both a brush and a hair dryer in your hands.</li>
            <li>It really is too loud for how close you have to hold it to your ear.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately this did not make for a great replacement.</li>
            <li>it sounds like a normal hair dryer.</li>
            <li>only find one of the attachments useful.</li>
            <li>The two other attachments work fine</li>
            <li>Not only does it sound like a high pitched jet engine next to your ears, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the older one I have.  </li>
            <li>You need your other hand to turn it on, but here is the problem:  The brush attachments do not grab onto your hair (I have smooth hair</li>
            <li>If you buy it just keep the receipt because you will have to get a new one about once a month.  </li>
            <li>New Review:</li>
            <li>When our hair dryer died Mrs. Boilermate dug this one out of the \\&quot;archives\\&quot; for us to use until the new one got here.</li>
            <li>I rushed out to Amazon to get a new one....</li>
            <li>on seeing this new model I assumed it would be just as wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they replaced it with a new one, but</li>
            <li>This new one I haven&#x27;t gotten the hang of yet</li>
            <li>I am no longer going to use it, in the market for a new one.</li>
            <li>yes, it is heavier than other models, but since it works so quickly, that doesn&#x27;t really seem to be an issue for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even across the room, the noise is so loud that it hurt my ears -- I cannot imagine trying to use it on your hair right next to your ear.  </li>
            <li>I used this for the first time today, and it&#x27;s going back!  </li>
            <li>The hot setting blows ALOT of hot air, so like other reviewers mentioned, it blows your hair around before you can get it all wrapped around the barrel.</li>
            <li>Please do not be put off by the reports of how loud it is!  </li>
            <li>My Revlon hot air brush went in the garbage last week.  </li>
            <li>Most other dryer brushes are only 1000 or 1200 watts.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried others like hot tools which 3 broke in 6 weeks total time</li>
            <li>(the only positive over the older), much louder, and much less useful.  </li>
            <li>My old one had the on/off switch positioned nicely for the thumb to slide it up to low then high or all the way back down to off - all with one hand.  </li>
            <li>I have had the same positive experience with each of them.  </li>
            <li>Fine if you want to dry a small area of hair, not like a full fledge hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Pretty loud, have only used once so far</li>
            <li>The effects last longer and the hair does not frizz back as quickly.</li>
            <li>the 2nd one last less then a month when the attachments started coming off, so my husband put to screws in the large brush, cuz that is what i use the most of the time</li>
            <li>A little super glue fixed it, since I only use the bigger brush, it didnt seem that important.  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s supposed to screw out to a larger size, but there is no locking mechanism so it won&#x27;t stay large.  </li>
            <li>I only use the 1 large barrel attachment, so I can&#x27;t comment on the others.  </li>
            <li>I have only used the large brush.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product at Target and read Amazon reviews after, and was really scared to open and try it based on reviews saying it&#x27;s too loud.  </li>
            <li>Steer clear of this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, I admit I should have paid more attention to the person here in Amazon who complained that the product was too loud.</li>
            <li>It is incredibly loud.  </li>
            <li>How can Revlon sell this thing - aren&#x27;t there regulations for decibel levels on products one holds near their ears?    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way too LOUD</li>
            <li>i wish i never wasted my money on it.</li>
            <li>Revlon seems to have fixed the loudness problem and even made it a bit lighter.  </li>
            <li>Lots of air comes out of the vents before the brush directly onto your hand as you style.  </li>
            <li>the 1\\&quot; attachment is what i really wanted for my short hair but the bristles are really way too short to even hold my hair.</li>
            <li>I did not pay much attention to the noise problem, thinking that the reviewers were just making it a big deal.</li>
            <li>I bought this one to replace an old faithful Conair version.  </li>
            <li>As others posted, I too, find this dryer way too loud.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>No one has ever thought that it was too loud for the dressing room.  </li>
            <li>The blow-drying wand makes styling and shaping much easier than trying to work with a brush and a blow dryer at the same time.</li>
            <li>I do not find it so loud that it hurts my ears though???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchases this item for my wife, but it emitted an ear piercing noise so loud that we had to return it.</li>
            <li>It is loud, but I can&#x27;t relate to the complaints about it being eardrum-shattering -</li>
            <li>And yes it is loud and it gets louder if any hair got stuck inside of it</li>
            <li>I wish the switch buttons were closer to my finger tips than near the cord.</li>
            <li>I bought three of these so far, one for me and two for my sisters.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I&#x27;ve bought several of them just in case they stop making them!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned at least 5, probably more.</li>
            <li>I do wear ear plugs as it is loud.  </li>
            <li>I always use tresemme&#x27; thermal creations before I dry my hair with anything, so I did that first</li>
            <li>I wish I purchased one of these brushes in the past because it made easy work of drying my hair.</li>
            <li>But when you turn it on you discover it is loud on low and dangerously loud on \\&quot;cool\\&quot; or high.</li>
            <li>So I need this type styling tool to add as much volume as I can to my flat life-less hair.  </li>
            <li>There must be a little cheap piece of plastic in there which apparently snaps off so that the brush will no longer snap into place.</li>
            <li>Not only loud, but high pitched.</li>
            <li>The air escapes from vent holes before it even gets to the brush, blasting down on your head and hand in one concentrated stream with very hot air.  </li>
            <li>I recently got a new hairstyle &amp; my regular blow dryer &amp; curling iron were too much work.  </li>
            <li>like with regular hair drying, make sure you blow dry your hair when it is wet.</li>
            <li>The older unit allows me to hit each section with a blast of cooler air by pushing the button up with the same hand that I use to use the wand.    </li>
            <li>It gets too hot, shuts off, emits a deafening, shrill, high-pitched sound rivaled in volume only by the gaping maw of Hell itself, and considering how hot this gets there may actually be a portal to Hell inside of it.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it was caught where the different ends attach, but it is actually when the metal barrel meets the plastic.  </li>
            <li>This dryer is VERY loud, way too big / uncomfortable to hold and most of the hot air that should go through the brush attachment escapes through the vent near the connection to the motor wand and burned my neck / ears.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros: high wattage makes for quick drying, barrel size, hard tines instead of soft bristles on the adjustable barrel, tourmaline ionic technology, and price.</li>
            <li>I love how it styles my hair, but the quality on this is not good.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised, got here faster than expected</li>
            <li>There are other vendors on Amazon selling this same item usually in white instead of hot pink/red for a much higher price under misleading names.</li>
            <li>I was expecting one of the sleek new, little stylers and was very surprised at how large this was.  </li>
            <li>the smaller attachment is still too large for really short hair.</li>
            <li>I read all of the reviews prior to purchasing this item and was aware that it was loud and heavy, but I was looking for something that had a lot of power because I do not have a lot of time in the AM to get ready.  </li>
            <li>I recently needed to purchase a new one and bought this one.</li>
            <li>this is my 2nd one and its still too new to let you know if its fallen off yet.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush hair blower because it does NOT tangle the hair and the ions dry the hair in half the time compared to a regular blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I do feel like this might work better on extremely thick or coarse hair</li>
            <li>and I absolutely could not live without it.</li>
            <li>This model forces me to take it down off of my hair, change the setting by moving the ring around at the bottom using both hands and then put it back in my hair and hit it with cool hair after I reroll it.      </li>
            <li>I prefer the hard plastic tines with my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Then if you try to hold onto it with your other hand the tip is too hot to touch.</li>
            <li>I have 3 kids, barely can shower at that!</li>
            <li>I would have to agree with some of the other reviewers that on high, this thing is like a 747 near your ear!</li>
            <li>or maybe because I don&#x27;t know how.&lt;br /&gt;In general I like the product.</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s a bit loud, and yes it&#x27;s a bit bulky, but not any bulkier than holding a traditional hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at a name brand such as Revlon having an inferior product.</li>
            <li>have only used this unit once because of how loud it is.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, I find myself going back to my old blow-dryer-and-separate-round-brush method about 50% of the time.</li>
            <li>First of all being round with a rotary switch on the end is far from convenient.</li>
            <li>The unit is way too thick to be comfortable in your hand.  </li>
            <li>This thing is loud, too hot, unwieldy, heavy and I should have returned it.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair, lightly color treated.</li>
            <li>The results are not as good (my hair is little less shiny), but who cares since it takes much less time.</li>
            <li>and the other brush is just too large for my hair.  </li>
            <li>The dryer is a little hot on high, so I recommend using on the low setting if you have short hair.</li>
            <li>It would normally take me close to an hour to do my hair (dry it</li>
            <li>While I have not used this brush, it does have a unique feature that may appeal to some:  If you twist it, the size of the barrel changes from small to a bit larger.  </li>
            <li>After 5 years my Revlon hot air brush same as this one, but in white, died due to the cord wearing out at the rotating connector.  </li>
            <li>It works so much better than other air stylers because the bristles are hard and they grip your hair.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty thick hair, and my hair keeps flying off the barrel when I try to dry it using the large attachment.</li>
            <li>An earlier model was also a disaster since the removed one of the tiny pegs around the top of the unit that allowed it to securely hold the base of the brush on the unit.  </li>
            <li>The control is at the very bottom of the dryer and must be twisted to change to cool burst setting, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d had a styler brush before, but it had little power &amp; really could not dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>Overall, the pros outweigh the cons for me, so much so that I won&#x27;t consider another dryer brush that isn&#x27;t at least a high wattage like this one.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace the less expensive non-ceramic model I&#x27;ve loved for years but had problems with the barrel bending.</li>
            <li>I use a curling iron, even on a low setting, to get a little curl or bounce, my hair really suffers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It heats up to a high temp and the air flow is powerful enough to dry and style very thick hair.</li>
            <li>Too bad they ruined a good thing.</li>

            <li> I had a Helen of Troy one that was perfect</li>
            <li> This product works perfectly for it&#x27;s intended use.  </li>
            <li> I use this on damp hair and ALWAYS get perfect \\&quot;blow-out\\&quot; results.  </li>
            <li> Have use it and am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Got the order for 2 Revlon Curls ahead of time &amp; found them in excellent packaging conditions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase, thank you!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer brush is great!</li>
            <li> Awesome product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost every type of brush dryer and this one works the best</li>
            <li> Wonderful addition to my hair appliances...</li>
            <li> SO HAPPY!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with a purchase.</li>
            <li> Great styling tool and dryer in one!</li>
            <li> it has excellent air speed and lots of heat.  </li>
            <li> but when traveling it is excellent all by itself.  </li>
            <li> And, IMHO, best price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this one for quite awhile, and it&#x27;s still working great!</li>
            <li> That would have made it perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for shorter hair.</li>
            <li> So this was perfect!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Love the ionizer, and the power!!!  </li>
            <li> Very good but</li>
            <li> it gives my hair this wavy beautiful look...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this.</li>
            <li> Works great.  </li>
            <li> and it works great now, and the attachment stays on.  </li>
            <li> Does a great job, just be careful.&lt;br /&gt;Betty</li>
            <li> Great tool with plenty of power.  </li>
            <li> ..Wife is happy.........</li>
            <li> then I&#x27;m happy.  </li>
            <li> Great one handed product- meaning</li>
            <li> I tried this at  my daughters and thought it wad great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all fly away looking.</li>
            <li> It was so great at styling my hair</li>
            <li> Great end result, lightweight,</li>
            <li> Its magic to your hair!!</li>
            <li> This awesome styling brush is quieter than the blow dryer I reaplaced, and a MUCH better and faster styling tool.  </li>
            <li> This is a good alternative to blow drying your hair with a brush and hairdryer.</li>
            <li> and my sister LOVED it.</li>
            <li> Anyway, all the good things still stand:</li>
            <li> I loved the idea of replacing my hair dryer &amp; barrel brush combo with something I could use with one hand</li>
            <li> and I loved the results.  </li>
            <li> but otherwise it is good.</li>
            <li> I am sure it functions beautifully, but I have a sensitivity to volume.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> i really love it!</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> I had a hot air brush for 15 years that was awesome.  </li>
            <li> In love!</li>
            <li> Am amazing their testing didn&#x27;t reveal this flaw.</li>
            <li> AMAZING</li>
            <li> Totally thrilled with this.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled with the results and</li>
            <li> The bristles kept the hair against the brush nicely.  </li>
            <li> This leaves my hair kind of kinky and shows bends where the hair was against seams.  </li>
            <li> Kind of a neat touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Settings - nice assortment for an inexpensive dryer.  </li>
            <li> Great power, dries my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> And at $25 you can&#x27;t find a better one, it allows you to turn on ions for smoother finish or off for more volume!  </li>
            <li> Cost does not matter to me ~ it is important to get a product that works well, with good results.      </li>
            <li> Yes it is loud, but it works GREAT!  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love this dryer!</li>
            <li> For a more staying curl I still use a curling iron just because I like more curl, but this gives nice body to start with.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy with this hot air</li>
            <li> The hot air is great except it seems to blow out around the handle instead of through the bristles of the attachments.  </li>
            <li> It does have great power at 1500w but is pretty loud.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As in, if you were in a work setting, OSHA would fine your employer!  </li>
            <li> However, the product itself is very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> Very cheap.</li>
            <li> it detaches from the accessories nicely and is easy to store.  </li>
            <li> PLEASE find something of better quality</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> My hair style lasted for more than 3 days.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I use all the time</li>
            <li> Defective design for sure.</li>
            <li> I did not get the volume I wanted, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> To top it all off I got the waves and bounce I wanted.</li>
            <li> I also have the RV440, which I love too.  </li>
            <li> Then I tried the one my sister had - this one - and loved it so much I bought mine own.  </li>
            <li> The hair around the brush flies away from it, leaving you with even more frizz than before styling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I love my curler.</li>
            <li> Love love love this.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the way this dries my hair-good look practically every time I used it.</li>
            <li> I feel I should have shopped around a lot more before deciding on this one.  </li>
            <li> Again, if it turned to release the hair, it would be a better design.  </li>
            <li> My favorite hairstyling product.</li>
            <li> The last one I bought (still works perfectly), but after 5 years I just wanted a change.</li>
            <li> The product is great and works very well.</li>
            <li> have never ever received so many complements on my hair.</li>
            <li> and i love this dryer.   </li>
            <li> The blow dryer is much faster and this product is great for the finish drying and styling.  </li>
            <li> Amazon price is better than what I paid at Target, too, so get it here.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better.</li>
            <li> and I love it..</li>
            <li> but I still love it..</li>
            <li> Best invention for the girl who doesn&#x27;t have the coordination to hold the hair dryer and the roller brush at the same time.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> and I simply love it....</li>
            <li> all love</li>
            <li> but it worked great and my hair&#x27;s bounciness held much longer than with the brush.</li>
            <li> I have used this type of product for many, many years.</li>
            <li> Tried to curl bangs and more air blew in my face than my hair.  </li>
            <li> It also comes with a concentrator attachment to just blow the air more like a hair dryer, but keep in mind it limits the air flow to a smallarea.</li>
            <li> Be sure and compare model number</li>
            <li> sometimes more my hair will get caught in the barrel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two of them, and neither has lasted more than 6 months.</li>
            <li> you aren&#x27;t sure about it, they sell it at Site-to-Store function online at Walmart.  </li>
            <li> I bought mine about a year ago to replace my older model Revlon Perfect Heat hot air brush</li>
            <li> Totally worth it!!.</li>
            <li> It is great for my new A-frame cut.</li>
            <li> Really nice product, Its more useful for my wife</li>
            <li> Quick results with a nice bend in the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> So once I received this I knew I had to give myself more time to do my hair, which was fine.</li>
            <li> I wanted to find something that would give my hair more volume, with a smooth and shiny look.</li>
            <li> If it had that feature (as some of the other models) it would be perfect.  </li>
            <li> Dryer is easy to use, easy for me to manipulate, and because it comes apart it is easy to pack for travel.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was easy to use</li>
            <li> - yes you can dial it from 1 inch to 1.5 but it doesn&#x27;t lock in position so it easily collapses.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the non-turning barrell that allows you to easily unroll the heated hair without getting stuck.</li>
            <li> So easy to use.</li>
            <li> My hair does NOT curl around things easily.  </li>
            <li> -hope it doesn&#x27;t break easily.</li>
            <li> dries quickly, makes my hair look pretty good.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine and won&#x27;t curl easily</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine hair to my shoulder blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this Revlon appliance has incredible power &amp; with one appliance I can dry &amp; style my hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping and everything else was fine.</li>
            <li> so I think it&#x27;s fine.   </li>
            <li> I really liked this tool for my fine straight hair.  </li>
            <li> the handle is huge).    </li>
            <li> ; is probably accurate.  </li>
            <li> That made a huge difference for me.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the heat or the sound because it WORKS.</li>
            <li> I did get the shiny smooth look from the ions in the styler.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great if you can get it to last...</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s great return policy made getting a refund simple.</li>
            <li> This is a great blow dryer for also curling your hair and getting some style at the same time.</li>
            <li> so it was lint free</li>
            <li> dries hair fast, leaves my hair with nice waves.</li>
            <li> Overall, extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li> Hair turns out smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> but so cheaply made.</li>
            <li> This one is definitely more powerful.  </li>
            <li> The brushes secure onto the body with a notch.  </li>
            <li> I loved the old model of this item, it lasted for years, and when it died...</li>
            <li> Looks like a light bouncy curl, with life, very soft, very healthy looking.</li>
            <li> THANKS!!!</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use and super light.</li>
            <li> This makes my fine hair full and smooth looking.</li>
            <li> This would not make it very easy to switch from hot to cool.</li>
            <li> I like the ideal of the product, but the first one i got only lasted about 4-6 months before the attachments wouldn&#x27;t stay on.  </li>
            <li> Super easy to return if it isn&#x27;t what you like.</li>
            <li> The good thing is that it gets hotter than most hot air brushes, but the handle is just too big to use easily.  </li>
            <li> Now I have another hot air styler to add to the collection ~~ but am looking for a cheap online source for earplugs!  </li>
            <li> It survived many falls and never failed on me.</li>
            <li> The original design had a release button that allowed you to roll your hair around the brush, release it and let the curl drop.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a higher wattage than most of the others.  </li>
            <li> but it is very fine and straight.  </li>
            <li> if your hair is very fine, maybe too much.  </li>
            <li> The only concern I have is the loud noise it makes; otherwise, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> but you can not take apart to clean when dust will build up.</li>
            <li> My basic WalMart Revlon hot air styler literally came apart at the seam and broke, and have been searching for a good replacement; thought I would upgrade to a better \\&quot;ceramic ion\\&quot;.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been good at the dryer in one hand and brush in the other hand, other than to just have hair fly all over!  </li>
            <li> This is a very good product, however, be very careful because it gets very hot quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is so large that you need monster size hands to be able to use it.  </li>
            <li> I should have read dimensions more closely and certainly will from now on.  </li>
            <li> but anyways if you put enough effort you might get a pretty great hairdry.</li>
            <li> This seemed to be a good item, but it stopped working 2 months later after The purchase date.</li>
            <li> The comment about the on/off switch at the bottom is completely true as well.  </li>
            <li> I loved the power and have had them last as follows:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> I love this product so much.  </li>
            <li> so one must turn the dryer to cool before shutting off.</li>
            <li> The tourmaline ionic technology is something I look for in a dryer as it has made a difference with my fine hair, making it soft, without static or frizz, and infusing moisture for healthier hair.</li>
            <li> Light and easy, love the different settings.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident you can find a better product at the same price point.</li>
            <li> 1500 watts makes this a quick dryer.  </li>
            <li> It takes out all my frizz and dries super quick.</li>
            <li> no giran los cepillos y es super pesado</li>
            <li> Believe me, you will never be able to use the brush on high speed.</li>
            <li> Is very hot and, therefore, works quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And....it gets very hot</li>
            <li> so this is better, i still have the pink part of my old one which works great...</li>
            <li> I have arthritis and the large size is easy to grip.</li>
            <li> Air was too strong and blew my hair right out and got too hot</li>
            <li> I have an older 1200W dryer that&#x27;s more powerful and quieter than this 1500W.  </li>
            <li> This model i am a first time user and love the power and how fast it dries my hair.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend to anyone!!!</li>
            <li> My hair is completely straight and fine, so with this I get great body and a slight curl when holding the hair wrapped in the barrel brush a bit longer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 1500w, which is the same as most blow dryers, so it sounds like a blow dryer!</li>
            <li> I would honestly like it more if it worked a little deeper in your roots</li>
            <li> It takes both hands to use it effectively which leaves none left for working with your hair.  </li>
            <li> She loves it, so much more versitile then the old one this replaced.  </li>
            <li> 3 useful</li>
            <li> : Barrel of dryer unit could be smaller and it would be nice to have some type of grip on it.</li>
            <li> It stopped working days after being able to send it back for free.  </li>
            <li> would HIGHLY recommend this product for anyone who is always rushing in the AM to get ready and out the door :)  </li>
            <li> Gives just the right amount of curl to my hair.</li>
            <li> That person is right.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure I am going to suffer long-term hearing loss from the 3 times I&#x27;ve used it, and I&#x27;m surprised it hasn&#x27;t been recalled for the 125 decibel scream that comes from it.</li>
            <li> this dryer is an excellent dryer brush for drying your hair from completely wet stage with the various attachments or just touching up your style later.  </li>
            <li> Do not buy.&lt;br /&gt;For the same price you will be far more satisfied with the John Frieda air brush.</li>
            <li> I have ALWAYS used a curling brush (hot air curling brush), so I thought this product would be worth a try.  </li>
            <li> Apparently the higher wattage which provides more heat and air flow is the reason for weight, size and noise level of this item.  </li>
            <li> This brush works really well, but tends to overheat and burn out quickly.</li>
            <li> The bristles hold my hair nicely while I curl and dry it.  </li>
            <li> My daughter in law was visiting this past weekend and used it and fell in love with it too, so she is purchasing it too!!</li>
            <li> It works REALLY fast, een on my very thick hair, and makes beautiful smooth lines or curled ends.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an avid user of hot air dryer brushes since they came out as I like the extra body and light curl I get with my fine hair both at shorter and shoulder lengths.</li>
            <li> I took one star off because it really does become very hot, but it&#x27;s not an issue.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t blow away, then hold it on high, then it MUST go to cool.</li>
            <li> The first time it happened, I assumed it was a fluke</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time and now regret it.    </li>
            <li> This comes with three attachments (2 roller brushes + 1 flathead), all of which have 3 slits at the bottom (you can see in the product picture) through which hot air escapes and makes your ears and neck really hot.  </li>
            <li> Then, as you try to use it, it gets so hot that it burns you.  </li>
            <li> My first replacement try was a  WIGO Europe WG5120</li>
            <li> ;)    </li>
            <li> This hair dryer  will shut off after using it on the hot cycle for just a minute.  </li>
            <li> If you want curls, just use hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> After so many searches and reviews I bought this one, The biggest shock was when I started the dryer and the air flow was not actually going through the brush</li>
            <li> it made a funny noise and seemed like it was going to burn up.  </li>
            <li> The first one the motor burned out in about a week.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;3. 6 months (replaced by factory)&lt;br /&gt;4. 2 years (factory replacement exactly like this</li>
            <li> sooooooooo hot</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace the Revlon 440c (which was too hot</li>
            <li> hair around this barrel of this Hot Air  item.  </li>
            <li> The first one lasted about a year.  </li>
            <li> There is so much hot air coming out before the curl brush that is burns your hands, ears, or scalp.  </li>
            <li> although I&#x27;m aware these things die out after awhile, I&#x27;d be willing to buy another just for the convenience of it.  </li>
            <li> its too hot almost like a straightener..</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I also think the unit gets too hot.</li>
            <li> The only redeeming quality of this styler is the color.  </li>
            <li> However, I have had 2 more after that, and they all broke in the same place within a week.</li>
            <li> The most recent one burnt out in 3.</li>
            <li> , what&#x27;s better than having to use only one hair tool?!?</li>
            <li> a more positive note, it does dry my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> , it has a very high pitch motor, and vents right where the brushes go into the unit.</li>
            <li> After using the revo styler for 15 years, i though this might be nice not having to use a dryer in one hand and the brush in the other, but the brush does not rotate as i thought it would as i asked for a revolving styler.</li>
            <li> First one functionable after 10 years, but wanted a new colorful one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, the first time I used this, the hair dryer heated up so much, that the plastic clips holding the brush in place melted, and ripped off just pulling it through my hair.  </li>
            <li> I really like this hot air brush.</li>
            <li> The first time it happened, I bought another one, thinking that I must have pulled with too much tension.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the coordination to round brush my own hair, but with this clever contraption, I can!!  </li>
            <li> It does make noise, and at the high setting it makes more noise than a standard blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> it will ONLY smooth the very top layer of hair, everything underneath stays a mess</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair and with the Revlon Quick Hot Air Curling Brush I am able to style and smooth.  </li>
            <li> ( so I&#x27;m not super thrilled about</li>
            <li> On this unit you have to hold it in one hand while turning a large dial on the bottom.  </li>
            <li> Large brush.  </li>
            <li> There are other high end, pricier ones that I figured were amazing</li>
            <li> Bought this product in April 2011 , everything seems to be working fine and suddenly it just stopped working.</li>
            <li> The brush ends work great and are super with my short hair and dry my hair in no time flat.</li>
            <li> Be sure to blow-dry your hair to &#x27;almost dry&#x27; before using the brush!</li>
            <li> it were a review for the older one, I&#x27;d say 5 stars!  </li>
            <li> It only takes me half an hour to turn my wet hair to nice, smooth lovely hair.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for straightening , but it&#x27;s hard to use it for curling.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;concentrator&amp;#34; is my favorite part as the adjustable brush is hard plastic and doesn&#x27;t even fit the adjustments correctly</li>
            <li> The only draw back is that with the original one I purchased the switch broke after only 5 months but it was such a good dryer that I decided to re-purchase with the hopes that this one will not break as quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame because I really like the speed of the dryer.</li>
            <li> and  I do use all three attachments depending on how much volume I want.  </li>
            <li> It also, I think, has too MUCH power -</li>
            <li> I ended up getting a 1200 watt barrel brush dryer that was much easier to work with.</li>
            <li> A leaf blower isn&#x27;t much noisier.</li>
            <li> You really need ear plugs to use this one.    </li>
            <li> I dislike it so much that I&#x27;m going to return it.    </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t quit on me while getting ready for work.  </li>
            <li> (speciañly since i have really curly/puffy hair),</li>
            <li> This thing overheats, and between the cheap plastic, and the motor, it won&#x27;t last you long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I swear she wants to purchase like 10 of these for the years to come just in case.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is loud, but what do you want from a powerful tool?</li>
            <li> I gently twist and release the curl, without brushing it out immediately until all the hair is finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the brush grabs the hair without tangling very well</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> so can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> Made well and very sturdy.</li>
            <li> This works very well and has lots of power which is something that I really like.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased 3 of these Revlon dryer brushes in the past and this one is my favorite because it leaves my hair shiny and full of volume.  </li>
            <li> Also, if I use it like I would a curling iron, (i.e., roll a strand of hair around the brush and hold it there for a few seconds, then unroll it), it gives my hair a gentle curl and nice</li>
            <li> There are 3 settings, cool, low and high, and I use it exclusively on high and love how it dries my hair just as quickly as a regular hair dryer, but with the ability to boost body and add shape all in one step.</li>
            <li> High (hot), low (hot), cool (a high setting)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The noise wasn&#x27;t as high pitched, didn&#x27;t sound like it was working as hard, curled better.  </li>
            <li> It took some getting use to the extra weight and length over my other dryer brushes, but having more heat and air flow along with the other features I&#x27;ve mentioned are more important to me.  </li>
            <li> I agree with many of the other comments here..</li>
            <li> This one works so much better than any other one.</li>
            <li> I have long, medium thickness, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> The heat does not seem to distribute very well, even on high heat...</li>
            <li> Well, when I used the brush for the first and only time, I have to say that the reviewers had a point, and those who warned not to buy, were absolutely right.</li>
            <li> My fine hair falls out of the bristles before I can get my hair dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it too loud or too hot like</li>
            <li> I have normal hair that is mid-length and straight.  </li>
            <li> and this helps us dry and style and get rid of the frizzies pretty quickly too.</li>
            <li> but I called the manufacture and the company sent me a new one!  </li>
            <li> they should just sell the brush part for when that breaks you can replace it instead of buying a whole new set.  </li>
            <li> Just okay, Thought the 2 black buttons on the barrel were on/off, nope,</li>
            <li> Also its design is not made for quick drying, but I&#x27;ve found that drying and styling is much easier when you blow dry in sections (I have long, fine hair).</li>
            <li> After years struggling with a dryer and round brush, I am delighted by this tool, I&#x27;ll never use a regular dryer again!</li>
            <li> It works well, and creates decent style.</li>
            <li> The main problem with this product is the volume.</li>
            <li> While there are a couple of things I don&#x27;t particularly like about this dryer brush, I still decided to purchase it again after comparing it to the competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have the earlier models of this hair dryer and really liked them except the last two models have had some major issues.    </li>
            <li> However, the slightest tension on the brush (such as when pulling hair taut and straight) will break the brush right off the styler.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, but even on high</li>
            <li> Third, the \\&quot;warm\\&quot; setting is not \\&quot;warm\\&quot;, it is HOT!  </li>
            <li> Oh well I&#x27;ll give it a little more time before I give up and look for something else.</li>
            <li> I used the regular blow dry feature first till it was damp then used the larger attachment &amp; turned on high mostly, but when I wanted to use like curling iron and roll hair up and hold it, it does get hot</li>
            <li> The soft bristle brush really works, though, and smooths and styles my hair all in one without having both a brush and a hair dryer in your hands.</li>
            <li> It really is too loud for how close you have to hold it to your ear.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this did not make for a great replacement.</li>
            <li> it sounds like a normal hair dryer.</li>
            <li> only find one of the attachments useful.</li>
            <li> The two other attachments work fine</li>
            <li> Not only does it sound like a high pitched jet engine next to your ears, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the older one I have.  </li>
            <li> You need your other hand to turn it on, but here is the problem:  The brush attachments do not grab onto your hair (I have smooth hair</li>
            <li> If you buy it just keep the receipt because you will have to get a new one about once a month.  </li>
            <li> New Review:</li>
            <li> When our hair dryer died Mrs. Boilermate dug this one out of the \\&quot;archives\\&quot; for us to use until the new one got here.</li>
            <li> I rushed out to Amazon to get a new one....</li>
            <li> on seeing this new model I assumed it would be just as wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they replaced it with a new one, but</li>
            <li> This new one I haven&#x27;t gotten the hang of yet</li>
            <li> I am no longer going to use it, in the market for a new one.</li>
            <li> yes, it is heavier than other models, but since it works so quickly, that doesn&#x27;t really seem to be an issue for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even across the room, the noise is so loud that it hurt my ears -- I cannot imagine trying to use it on your hair right next to your ear.  </li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today, and it&#x27;s going back!  </li>
            <li> The hot setting blows ALOT of hot air, so like other reviewers mentioned, it blows your hair around before you can get it all wrapped around the barrel.</li>
            <li> Please do not be put off by the reports of how loud it is!  </li>
            <li> My Revlon hot air brush went in the garbage last week.  </li>
            <li> Most other dryer brushes are only 1000 or 1200 watts.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried others like hot tools which 3 broke in 6 weeks total time</li>
            <li> (the only positive over the older), much louder, and much less useful.  </li>
            <li> My old one had the on/off switch positioned nicely for the thumb to slide it up to low then high or all the way back down to off - all with one hand.  </li>
            <li> I have had the same positive experience with each of them.  </li>
            <li> Fine if you want to dry a small area of hair, not like a full fledge hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Pretty loud, have only used once so far</li>
            <li> The effects last longer and the hair does not frizz back as quickly.</li>
            <li> the 2nd one last less then a month when the attachments started coming off, so my husband put to screws in the large brush, cuz that is what i use the most of the time</li>
            <li> A little super glue fixed it, since I only use the bigger brush, it didnt seem that important.  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s supposed to screw out to a larger size, but there is no locking mechanism so it won&#x27;t stay large.  </li>
            <li> I only use the 1 large barrel attachment, so I can&#x27;t comment on the others.  </li>
            <li> I have only used the large brush.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product at Target and read Amazon reviews after, and was really scared to open and try it based on reviews saying it&#x27;s too loud.  </li>
            <li> Steer clear of this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I admit I should have paid more attention to the person here in Amazon who complained that the product was too loud.</li>
            <li> It is incredibly loud.  </li>
            <li> How can Revlon sell this thing - aren&#x27;t there regulations for decibel levels on products one holds near their ears?    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too LOUD</li>
            <li> i wish i never wasted my money on it.</li>
            <li> Revlon seems to have fixed the loudness problem and even made it a bit lighter.  </li>
            <li> Lots of air comes out of the vents before the brush directly onto your hand as you style.  </li>
            <li> the 1\\&quot; attachment is what i really wanted for my short hair but the bristles are really way too short to even hold my hair.</li>
            <li> I did not pay much attention to the noise problem, thinking that the reviewers were just making it a big deal.</li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace an old faithful Conair version.  </li>
            <li> As others posted, I too, find this dryer way too loud.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> No one has ever thought that it was too loud for the dressing room.  </li>
            <li> The blow-drying wand makes styling and shaping much easier than trying to work with a brush and a blow dryer at the same time.</li>
            <li> I do not find it so loud that it hurts my ears though???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchases this item for my wife, but it emitted an ear piercing noise so loud that we had to return it.</li>
            <li> It is loud, but I can&#x27;t relate to the complaints about it being eardrum-shattering -</li>
            <li> And yes it is loud and it gets louder if any hair got stuck inside of it</li>
            <li> I wish the switch buttons were closer to my finger tips than near the cord.</li>
            <li> I bought three of these so far, one for me and two for my sisters.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> I like it so much that I&#x27;ve bought several of them just in case they stop making them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned at least 5, probably more.</li>
            <li> I do wear ear plugs as it is loud.  </li>
            <li> I always use tresemme&#x27; thermal creations before I dry my hair with anything, so I did that first</li>
            <li> I wish I purchased one of these brushes in the past because it made easy work of drying my hair.</li>
            <li> But when you turn it on you discover it is loud on low and dangerously loud on \\&quot;cool\\&quot; or high.</li>
            <li> So I need this type styling tool to add as much volume as I can to my flat life-less hair.  </li>
            <li> There must be a little cheap piece of plastic in there which apparently snaps off so that the brush will no longer snap into place.</li>
            <li> Not only loud, but high pitched.</li>
            <li> The air escapes from vent holes before it even gets to the brush, blasting down on your head and hand in one concentrated stream with very hot air.  </li>
            <li> I recently got a new hairstyle &amp; my regular blow dryer &amp; curling iron were too much work.  </li>
            <li> like with regular hair drying, make sure you blow dry your hair when it is wet.</li>
            <li> The older unit allows me to hit each section with a blast of cooler air by pushing the button up with the same hand that I use to use the wand.    </li>
            <li> It gets too hot, shuts off, emits a deafening, shrill, high-pitched sound rivaled in volume only by the gaping maw of Hell itself, and considering how hot this gets there may actually be a portal to Hell inside of it.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was caught where the different ends attach, but it is actually when the metal barrel meets the plastic.  </li>
            <li> This dryer is VERY loud, way too big / uncomfortable to hold and most of the hot air that should go through the brush attachment escapes through the vent near the connection to the motor wand and burned my neck / ears.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros: high wattage makes for quick drying, barrel size, hard tines instead of soft bristles on the adjustable barrel, tourmaline ionic technology, and price.</li>
            <li> I love how it styles my hair, but the quality on this is not good.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised, got here faster than expected</li>
            <li> There are other vendors on Amazon selling this same item usually in white instead of hot pink/red for a much higher price under misleading names.</li>
            <li> I was expecting one of the sleek new, little stylers and was very surprised at how large this was.  </li>
            <li> the smaller attachment is still too large for really short hair.</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews prior to purchasing this item and was aware that it was loud and heavy, but I was looking for something that had a lot of power because I do not have a lot of time in the AM to get ready.  </li>
            <li> I recently needed to purchase a new one and bought this one.</li>
            <li> this is my 2nd one and its still too new to let you know if its fallen off yet.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush hair blower because it does NOT tangle the hair and the ions dry the hair in half the time compared to a regular blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I do feel like this might work better on extremely thick or coarse hair</li>
            <li> and I absolutely could not live without it.</li>
            <li> This model forces me to take it down off of my hair, change the setting by moving the ring around at the bottom using both hands and then put it back in my hair and hit it with cool hair after I reroll it.      </li>
            <li> I prefer the hard plastic tines with my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Then if you try to hold onto it with your other hand the tip is too hot to touch.</li>
            <li> I have 3 kids, barely can shower at that!</li>
            <li> I would have to agree with some of the other reviewers that on high, this thing is like a 747 near your ear!</li>
            <li> or maybe because I don&#x27;t know how.&lt;br /&gt;In general I like the product.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s a bit loud, and yes it&#x27;s a bit bulky, but not any bulkier than holding a traditional hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at a name brand such as Revlon having an inferior product.</li>
            <li> have only used this unit once because of how loud it is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, I find myself going back to my old blow-dryer-and-separate-round-brush method about 50% of the time.</li>
            <li> First of all being round with a rotary switch on the end is far from convenient.</li>
            <li> The unit is way too thick to be comfortable in your hand.  </li>
            <li> This thing is loud, too hot, unwieldy, heavy and I should have returned it.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, lightly color treated.</li>
            <li> The results are not as good (my hair is little less shiny), but who cares since it takes much less time.</li>
            <li> and the other brush is just too large for my hair.  </li>
            <li> The dryer is a little hot on high, so I recommend using on the low setting if you have short hair.</li>
            <li> It would normally take me close to an hour to do my hair (dry it</li>
            <li> While I have not used this brush, it does have a unique feature that may appeal to some:  If you twist it, the size of the barrel changes from small to a bit larger.  </li>
            <li> After 5 years my Revlon hot air brush same as this one, but in white, died due to the cord wearing out at the rotating connector.  </li>
            <li> It works so much better than other air stylers because the bristles are hard and they grip your hair.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair, and my hair keeps flying off the barrel when I try to dry it using the large attachment.</li>
            <li> An earlier model was also a disaster since the removed one of the tiny pegs around the top of the unit that allowed it to securely hold the base of the brush on the unit.  </li>
            <li> The control is at the very bottom of the dryer and must be twisted to change to cool burst setting, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d had a styler brush before, but it had little power &amp; really could not dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> Overall, the pros outweigh the cons for me, so much so that I won&#x27;t consider another dryer brush that isn&#x27;t at least a high wattage like this one.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the less expensive non-ceramic model I&#x27;ve loved for years but had problems with the barrel bending.</li>
            <li> I use a curling iron, even on a low setting, to get a little curl or bounce, my hair really suffers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It heats up to a high temp and the air flow is powerful enough to dry and style very thick hair.</li>
            <li> Too bad they ruined a good thing.</li>
            <li> I first purchased the more expensive brush that spins that pulled, knotted up my hair and had little power to dry.</li>
            <li> First I dry it a little with the brush, then curl up each section, on low</li>
            <li> First of all, it is HUGE, nearly impossible to hold.</li>
            <li> It is loud, but no louder than other similar products.</li>
            <li> Two barrels come with it, one being adjustable from 1&amp;#34; to 1 1/2&amp;#34; by twisting the barrel and the other is fixed at 1 1/2&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> They made one design change to the original product that renders it practically unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> The smaller barrell must be for short hair because it doesn&#x27;t do anything but get stuck in my long hair.</li>
            <li> Too loud, too bulky for handling, adjustable brush doesn&#x27;t adjust properly and is hard plastic rather than a brush, the other brush is too large for use.  </li>
            <li> The end isn&#x27;t long enough to hold to try to force the roll.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;dryer&amp;#34; by itself would take too long use on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> As others have commented this dryer brush is big - weighing about 14 oz and is 17 inches long with the barrel attached.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even have to straighten it with the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I only use this tool to dry and style my hair.  </li>
            <li> I use it on the lower setting and it&#x27;s forceful enough to dry and style  without blowing out my eardrum.</li>
            <li> On the HIGH setting, the product is very loud and shrill.</li>
            <li> This one, however, has a very small plastic piece that holds the brush on the dryer - broke in the first week.  </li>
            <li> You can get more of that effect by just using the base without any attachments, but be careful as the air outlet gets extremely hot when not covered by the attachments.</li>
            <li> it gets too hot to remove the brushes and have to leave it out to cool down, and this is inconvenient</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this product, I have read other reviews from customers who bought this specific model from different sellers.</li>
            <li> The adjustable barrel is a durable plastic with short hard tines, while the other barrel has the nano ceramic coating with soft short nylon bristles typical of other hot air brush models.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint is that after it gets old the clip on the brush breaks off and falls off periodically when your in the middle of doing your hair.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s rather long (about to my shoulder blades).  </li>
            <li> far as it being heavy -</li>
            <li> long (maybe longer) with the brush attachment.  </li>
            <li> I have long fingers and can&#x27;t reach around the handle</li>
            <li> The adjustable barrel, while a neat feature it is not really that practical as there is no way to lock it to the larger size, so expect it to remain as a 1&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I wish I would have purchased this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> But the absolute worst is that when you curl one section and move on to the next the air that vents from this thing blows very forcefully onto the part of your hair that you just styled, so hair doesn&#x27;t have a chance to cool and set.</li>
            <li> Just as loud as my normal one, not too bad, I definitely rather have to listen to a little noise than use 500w that took 3 times longer and didn&#x27;t get hot enough!</li>
            <li> it was more expensive than the previous model I had ($30) at Target.</li>
            <li> I have to use two hands to hold the wand and dry my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and models of this same hair tool, and I would buy this one again and again!</li>
            <li> I need only one hand which helps when you have a bit of arthritis in the other-</li>
            <li> This item is also noisier than other dryer brushes of lower wattage - it is comparable to a full-fledge hand hair dryer of similar wattage.</li>
            <li> My hair gets tangled around the attachments and it takes FOREVER to dry my hair with the curling attachments.  </li>
            <li> Often I air dry, so it is not like I used it every day...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Normally it takes me 20 minutes to just dry my hair with a brush and dryer.</li>
            <li> and I can dry and style my shoulder length hair (from dripping stage) in around 4-5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> After sectioning off areas of hair, it allows you to easily dry the underside without having to hold a brush and a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Only negative is that it is a bit loud, but</li>
            <li> My last one lasted a few months short of 2 years.</li>
            <li> Secondly, the control to turn the setting from warm to \\&quot;cool\\&quot; to set your curl is at the base of the styler, and can&#x27;t be adjusted with just the thumb on one hand....</li>
            <li> I am an average size woman - I don&#x27;t have tiny hands  -  </li>
            <li> There is an odor when you turn it on high heat, but I&#x27;ve been using it daily and it hasn&#x27;t broken or sparked or exploded,</li>
            <li> Only downside, usually lasts about 6 months with daily use.</li>
            <li> not real hot gets tangled sometimes</li>
            <li> I used this less than ten times.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t whether I used it with wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li> In comparison, my other 1000 watt Revlon dryer brush weighs just 6 oz and is 14 inches long.  </li>
            <li> The air flow is so massive coming out of the vents at the bottom of the bristles, that it blows all of your hair off the brush and makes a frizzy mess.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s overpriced anyway, because the brushes do not hold the hair tight enough to style.  </li>
            <li> The brushes don&#x27;t lock tightly into position, and the 1 inch piece came apart into pieces after I&#x27;d only had it for three weeks.  </li>
            <li> Now all it does is blow dry your hair just like every other product out there.  </li>
            <li> 1000 Watt Ceramic 1 1/4\\&quot;, but have a hard time getting the skimpy bristles on the brush to hold my hair around the barrel the way my old Revlon would (plus</li>
            <li> how can you make products to last a few months........</li>
            <li> A few weeks later, it will not turn on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had bought one a few years back at Target.</li>
            <li> Then I would hold the bigger round portion at my roots for a few seconds just to give them some added volume and extra drying time.  </li>
            <li> Not very convient to use.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s handle is smaller and uniformly round)</li>
            <li> to heavy to hold up for the entire time you style your hair.</li>
            <li> Just be careful it might burn you..</li>
            <li> Had to destroy that to get it open.</li>
            <li> but it takes longer than I expected to do my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, it&#x27;s big and heavy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t emphasize enough to you what an inappropriately, uncomfortably LOUD, shrill noise the motor on this thing makes.  </li>
            <li> It HAS to be dangerous for your hearing using it right next to your ears.  </li>
            <li> The handle of this is long, big and bulky and hard to manage with just one hand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very coordinated and trying to hold a big blow dryer with one hand and round brush  in other just didn&#x27;t work, and didn&#x27;t want to have to use a curling iron too!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice how bad it was at first, but it is so loud that I&#x27;ve considered wearing earplugs to avoid loosing hearing.</li>
            <li> On the lower speed, I can dry and style all of my hair in less than 10 minutes.     </li>
            <li> You need both hands to turn the dial at the bottom to change the temperature, as opposed to doing so with just one thumb on other styling brush dryers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this problem with any other curler/dryer before.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers stated....</li>
            <li> some other reviewers are saying.</li>
            <li> I use this product every other day</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the other barrel, but probably would if I had longer hair.  </li>
            <li> There are two other attachments, but I never switch to either of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other thing to note is that the barrel is one continuous piece of metal.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this unit is any louder than other hair dryers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> I would do this 2 times for each little section of hair and it would dry it and curl it</li>
            <li> Found this very awkward to handle, and the high setting gets too hot to even put down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disapointed an also highly annoyed it worked for 6 months, this was a waste of money, come on Revlon</li>
            <li> It gets very dried out just from getting it dry, no real styling.</li>
            <li> so this may be less problematic for others), so I need the other hand to hold my hair against the brush barrel, which means the drier needs to be ON before I do that, but with the air flowing this becomes a clumsier task.    </li>
            <li> This styler is basically useless, the handle is too big, i can barely hold on it.</li>
            <li> For those who have left negative reviews, I say consider your hair type.  </li>
            <li> , only complaint</li>
            <li> Plus, the air flow is too forceful, so half of the hair won&#x27;t wrap around the brush; if your hair is like mine, semi-wavy blonde &amp; thin, you end up with a crinkled flat mess.      </li>
            <li> From sopping wet hair to finish it took me just over half an hour!</li>
            <li> I am always very careful how tightly I wind&lt;</li>
            <li> And the setting  switch is at the bottom which means it can&#x27;t be changed without laying it down.  </li>
            <li> (#2 down the drain)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like to use the round brush attachments for my hair style and even on low it blows too hard to work.</li>
            <li> Hairdryer burned out on 8/20/15- less than 3 weeks old.&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy again!&lt;br /&gt;Nothing to do with seller.</li>
            <li> black band at the bottom is on/off.  </li>
            <li> Quite a few people mentioned the excessive noise the brush makes when on high speed, and also a problem with hot air coming from the base of the brush instead of where the bristles are.</li>
            <li> However, I find it easy to use because now I don&#x27;t need a brush and a dryer which was very awkward for me.</li>
            <li> The small brush is too rough, it hurts my head</li>
            <li> theory is that they didnt test it on anyone with thick or long hair.  </li>
            <li> We have long, thick hair</li>
            <li> The design was clearly not tested on a person with thick hair before put into the market.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a curling iron, don&#x27;t buy this if you want tight curls.  </li>
            <li> Bad design not very functionable, on/off high/low switch at end of sytler which twists back and forth, rather than sliding up/down switch in middle of styler, hard to use, changed from prior model.  </li>
            <li> , I appreciate the quick shipment, this is just a bad product.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd one of this model (long story, but the others didn&#x27;t fail).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like they modified the motor to be a little lighter</li>
            <li> it has a little give</li>
            <li> It is very hard to use this plastic brush on my short hair.</li>
            <li> Even being slightly deaf in one ear, it was too loud and very shrill.  </li>
            <li> This is now the second one of these dryers that has broken within days of me receiving.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> so I bought this a few years ago.</li>
            <li> but instead there are three openings at the bottom of the brush that waste the air flow out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have lost quite a few strands of hair to this thing....  </li>
            <li> stopped working after a few months</li>
            <li> I am a firm believer in this product and wish I would have found it sooner.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not at all heavy.  </li>
            <li> an epic fail by Revlon.  </li>
            <li> It dried, styled, curled, and gave my hair tons of volume all in one step.</li>
            <li> a waste of money</li>
            <li> appliance works quite poorly- too much trouble to send it back, though.</li>
            <li> My first clue should have been the impossible packaging.</li>
            <li> It causes an awful burning-hair smell and made one of mine less powerful (#1 back to the store)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can not get tired to use in my long hair.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t pictured, but it comes with a hard plastic expandable round plastic brush and also a round metal attachment with a lot of bristles sticking through the brush part.</li>
            <li> If you have coarse, thick, hard-to-style hair then don&#x27;t leave this a bad review simply because it didn&#x27;t work for you.  </li>
            <li> The big brush does NOT brush your hair, it&#x27;s USELESS..</li>
            <li> not overwhelmingly so.    </li>
            <li> I feel it is not a safe product to use.</li>
            <li> and I am not able to find the seller&#x27;s e-mail to write.  </li>
            <li> I returned it and got a replacement, which just burned out this past weekend--</li>
            <li> I was never able to use the adjustable size brush because it does not grip my hair.</li>
            <li> though for those who may have a concern handling a heavier than usual dryer brush since others have mentioned these as well.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it was motor or what had happened..</li>
            <li> The design is poor as fine hair can get caught in the openings in the base of the attachments.</li>
            <li> For curling, there are large air vents at the base of the brush, destroying the rest of your hair while you are trying to curl.  </li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers about the shrill noise.      </li>
            <li> I have only had this CRAP for a month, and the big brush is already DONE.</li>
            <li> I have had shoulder surgery and was a bit difficult holding long times on that side.</li>
            <li> Releasing the hair you&#x27;ve put on the curling rod can be difficult if you have long hair.  </li>
            <li> I have a minor disability that makes it difficult for me to use a roller brush and a hairdryer simultaneously, and this styler just takes the cake.</li>
            <li> The attachments were to hot to handle at the base when trying to change from diffuser to brush.  </li>
            <li> Really not sure why the negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the hard bristle brush AT ALL.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find at retail store</li>
            <li> I have always had a hard time styling my hair.</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed overall and will be ordering a duplicate of my old dryer online.</li>
            <li> I dropped it hard and it broke.</li>
            <li> The part were you hold it is too cumbersome and hard to hold</li>
            <li> it was extremely hard to keep a grip while trying to style my hair.  </li>
            <li> Plus the barrel is so fat that I can hardly hold it in my hand.</li>
            <li> Fewer tangles seem to occur with the hard tines.</li>
            <li> The base of the brush attachment has a large space -- air comes blasting out, and blows everything.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Not surprising when you see what a small piece it is.  </li>
            <li> It is also enormous, difficult to store, and not great for traveling with either.  </li>
            <li> I am in my late 40&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I was shocked to read all of the \\&quot;too loud to use\\&quot; reviews for this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really sensitive to loud noises and was afraid I would hate it.  </li>
            <li> I have gone through 5 different types and this one is by far the worst one I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I bought this 3 months ago and although it dries, at least once a week</li>
            <li> I never heard the high-pitch noises others complained about--with any of the 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> i HATE this thing and am VERY dissappointed in it...</li>
            <li> It is too thick.  </li>
            <li> I have curly thick hair and this straightens my hair in 20/25 minutes.</li>
            <li> my hair, bring the dryer to the ends then wrap up my hair slowly.  </li>
            <li> But it was a failure, it had a lot of noise and also it burnt my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY HEAVY!</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to get the different heads on and off.  </li>
            <li> but mine is thick, thick, thick!</li>
            <li> Also the handle feels longer and the brush itself isn&#x27;t that long, so it puts your hand and arm in an awkward position to style your hair.  </li>
            <li> i shocked of the big noise and hard heat ,plus</li>
            <li> I used this 3x and finally just threw it away, so that I would be forced to replace it instead of being totally frustrated each time I tried to use it.</li>
            <li> These vents send your hair flying everywhere and make it rather difficult to use the brush, it has even caught a few strands of hair in the vent and pulled it into the motor:</li>
            <li> It is a useless product , and I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Not a good investment for your money.</li>
            <li> Secondly, the airflow - it comes from the base of the brush making your styling pointless.</li>
            <li> GF was not very impressed with the drying power of this unit....</li>
            <li> I have very very thick hair (it takes 5 hours to highlight)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s poor design, very clumsy.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve put it into my suitcase for an overnight business trip and when I arrive at my destination, the plastic part holding the brush to the dryer has broken off, leaving it unusable.  </li>
            <li> Now I believe there&#x27;s something poorly designed in the part itself.  </li>
            <li> This is an extremely poorly designed product.</li>
            <li> Purchased to replace the wife&#x27;s broken one.  </li>
            <li> I suggest if you have thick hair, to avaoid this one-unless you want to thin it out!</li>
            <li> Let me add to the list of persons not happy with the construction and functionality.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but this product is ridiculous,</li>
            <li> -  If you have long hair, be cautious not to let the vents at the base suck your hair in.  </li>
            <li> HORRIBLE loud whine that hurts.  </li>
            <li> both hands have to be involved as you twist the base, so it is much harder to keep the hair in the styler while you&#x27;re changing the heat setting</li>
            <li> I bought this for the smaller styling brush but very disappointed it was not a brush but a plastic brush that does not hold my hair in it at all</li>
            <li> No warning anything is wrong.  </li>
            <li> I was so wrong.</li>
            <li> unfortunately Amazon, refunded me 60%.</li>
            <li> I did find it wasn&#x27;t that difficult to change out the parts</li>
            <li> It is unfortunate that this piece was not for me.</li>
            <li> As a hair dryer it does its job however the style is questionable.</li>
            <li> The air blows out in a weird place and messes up your hair where you don&#x27;t want it to.  </li>
            <li> this unit is very poorly designed.  </li>
            <li> My hair is always boring as well as dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> The brush attachment is difficult and I am afraid I am going to break it</li>
            <li> Bad and lousy product</li>
            <li> I already opened the package but am so unhappy with it that I&#x27;m going to look for a way to return it.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had an unhappy relationship ever since.</li>
            <li> It is also awkward to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very Disappointing...</li>
            <li> I find the placement of the power selections a bit awkward.</li>
            <li> The on, off, temp and ION switches are awkward to use.</li>
            <li> It has already broken; the brush has a plastic part that breaks off and will no longer stay attached to the dryer base.</li>
            <li> Sadly, the reason I know this is because these dryers tend to crap out on</li>
            <li> But this one is very difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about purchasing this.  </li>
            <li> Too bad they blew it with the ring around the bottom.</li>
            <li> so disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed in the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Disappointed..  </li>
            <li> Also hair catches at base of brush where it attaches to styler.</li>
            <li> No way to use the brush if you cannot attach it to the base.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the worst \\&quot;beauty\\&quot; product I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> This one is THE WORST of all.  </li>
            <li> HORRIBLE.  </li>
            <li> I ordered another, disregarding all the terrible reviews about the noise.  </li>
            <li> This is a terrible styling tool.  </li>
            <li> This is a terrible product.  </li>

            <li> You need both hands to turn the dial at the bottom to change the temperature, as opposed to doing so with just one thumb on other styling brush dryers.</li>
            <li> This is now the second one of these dryers that has broken within days of me receiving.  I&#x27;ve put it into my suitcase for an overnight business trip and when I arrive at my destination, the plastic part holding the brush to the dryer has broken off, leaving it unusable.  The first time it happened, I assumed it was a fluke so I ordered a replacement immediately.  Now I believe there&#x27;s something poorly designed in the part itself.  It&#x27;s a shame because I really like the speed of the dryer.</li>
            <li> This is a good alternative to blow drying your hair with a brush and hairdryer. The results are not as good (my hair is little less shiny), but who cares since it takes much less time. It only takes me half an hour to turn my wet hair to nice, smooth lovely hair.&lt;br /&gt;Just like with regular hair drying, make sure you blow dry your hair when it is wet. The effects last longer and the hair does not frizz back as quickly.</li>
            <li> This is the best CURLING BRUSH that I have ever had!!!  Love the ionizer, and the power!!!  My daughter in law was visiting this past weekend and used it and fell in love with it too, so she is purchasing it too!! THANKS!!!</li>
            <li> This is the worst \\&quot;beauty\\&quot; product I have ever purchased.  It is incredibly loud.  How can Revlon sell this thing - aren&#x27;t there regulations for decibel levels on products one holds near their ears?    Shame on them for even putting it on the market.  It&#x27;s overpriced anyway, because the brushes do not hold the hair tight enough to style.  Buy something else!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a number of these made by different people (including Revlon) over the years.  I use them daily, so I go through them every year or two.  This one is THE WORST of all.  I have to wear earplugs.  HORRIBLE loud whine that hurts.  I have thick hair and I can&#x27;t get the brushes to actually hold the hair to roll.  The end isn&#x27;t long enough to hold to try to force the roll.  I&#x27;ve never had this problem with any other curler/dryer before.  What a waste of money.  HORRIBLE.  Can&#x27;t say it enough.</li>
            <li> I bought this piece of JUNK so that I could rid myself of hair-dryer hassle... what a MISTAKE!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The big brush does NOT brush your hair, it&#x27;s USELESS.. it will ONLY smooth the very top layer of hair, everything underneath stays a mess&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The small brush is too rough, it hurts my head&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s way too LOUD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I have only had this CRAP for a month, and the big brush is already DONE. The plastic melted where the connection hooks are, so it will no longer connect to the dryer piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The heat does not seem to distribute very well, even on high heat... it seems to stay in the area where the dryer connects to the brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall.. i HATE this thing and am VERY dissappointed in it... i wish i never wasted my money on it. PLEASE find something of better quality</li>
            <li> This seemed to be a good item, but it stopped working 2 months later after The purchase date. Now I can&#x27;t even return/exchange it.</li>
            <li> I gave it a two because I do like it, but I have purchased two through a retail store and both lasted a month and then one morning I tried to turn it on and it just doesn&#x27;t start.  No warning anything is wrong.  And, yes, I did check the fuse button on the plug.  It is not that.  If you buy it just keep the receipt because you will have to get a new one about once a month.  I don&#x27;t like the hard bristle brush AT ALL.  Air was too strong and blew my hair right out and got too hot so it fried the ends of my hair.  Also, it&#x27;s supposed to screw out to a larger size, but there is no locking mechanism so it won&#x27;t stay large.  The soft bristle brush really works, though, and smooths and styles my hair all in one without having both a brush and a hair dryer in your hands.</li>
            <li> Love it. My hair style lasted for more than 3 days. It never happened before. My hair is shine and conditioned. I fully recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I just bought this from Target without reading the reviews.  I used it for the first time and now regret it.    I agree with other reviewers about the shrill noise.      This comes with three attachments (2 roller brushes + 1 flathead), all of which have 3 slits at the bottom (you can see in the product picture) through which hot air escapes and makes your ears and neck really hot.  Feels like only about 1/2 of the air is going through the brush portion.    The comment about the on/off switch at the bottom is completely true as well.  You need your other hand to turn it on, but here is the problem:  The brush attachments do not grab onto your hair (I have smooth hair so this may be less problematic for others), so I need the other hand to hold my hair against the brush barrel, which means the drier needs to be ON before I do that, but with the air flowing this becomes a clumsier task.    I already opened the package but am so unhappy with it that I&#x27;m going to look for a way to return it.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers stated....It&#x27;s VERY HEAVY! I have had shoulder surgery and was a bit difficult holding long times on that side. I like to use the round brush attachments for my hair style and even on low it blows too hard to work. It blows out multiple hair strands and in clumps so had to try to keep putting them on. I have never had that problem with others. I use it now just as a blow dryer without the curler attachment. It&#x27;s the only way it works for me. I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> This was ordered as a gift. Exactly as advertised, got here faster than expected and my sister LOVED it.</li>
            <li> New Review: Revlon seems to have fixed the loudness problem and even made it a bit lighter.  Sadly, the reason I know this is because these dryers tend to crap out on my after ~1yr. I&#x27;m on my 5th dryer (I always have two, one for home, one for the gym) and am learning to save my receipts because they DO come with a warranty.  Anyway, all the good things still stand: dries quickly, makes my hair look pretty good.  I have a lot of fine hair to my shoulder blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old review: I&#x27;ve owned this hair dryer for 2-3 years and wanted to get a second to keep at work for the days I bike.  I ordered another, disregarding all the terrible reviews about the noise.  It&#x27;s a hair dryer for pete&#x27;s sake, of course its noisy. I was so wrong. Not only does it sound like a high pitched jet engine next to your ears, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the older one I have.  It&#x27;s like they modified the motor to be a little lighter (the only positive over the older), much louder, and much less useful.  I&#x27;ll have to return this, it&#x27;s not at all what it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it were a review for the older one, I&#x27;d say 5 stars!  it&#x27;s awesome!  I don&#x27;t have the coordination to round brush my own hair, but with this clever contraption, I can!!  Too bad they ruined a good thing.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does have some design flaws. However, I find it easy to use because now I don&#x27;t need a brush and a dryer which was very awkward for me. I have arthritis and the large size is easy to grip.I like that one attachment is adjustable and  I do use all three attachments depending on how much volume I want.  My hair cutter recommended it and I&#x27;m happy. At this price it doesn&#x27;t have to last for years.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer! It&#x27;s the only thing that straightens my curly, frizzy hair. I don&#x27;t mind the heat or the sound because it WORKS. Only downside, usually lasts about 6 months with daily use. I&#x27;m on my 4th one.</li>
            <li> Dryer is easy to use, easy for me to manipulate, and because it comes apart it is easy to pack for travel.  On the lower speed, I can dry and style all of my hair in less than 10 minutes.     Only negative is that it is a bit loud, but not overwhelmingly so.    It&#x27;s hard to find at retail store - Amazon is the only place I can find it. I would purchase again (and I have done so).</li>
            <li> I love this product, I use all the time and I would recommend it to anyone who uses a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this. I have always had a hard time styling my hair. With this tool I could be mistaken for someone that knows what they&#x27;re doing. I have body and volume like never before. It is so easy to use and super light. I don&#x27;t find it too loud or too hot like some other reviewers are saying. Totally thrilled with this.</li>
            <li> I loved the idea of replacing my hair dryer &amp; barrel brush combo with something I could use with one hand so I bought this a few years ago. We&#x27;ve had an unhappy relationship ever since. It really is too loud for how close you have to hold it to your ear. It also, I think, has too MUCH power - I have pretty thick hair, and my hair keeps flying off the barrel when I try to dry it using the large attachment. I ended up getting a 1200 watt barrel brush dryer that was much easier to work with.</li>
            <li> I have used this type for years - and prefer Revlon.  But this one is very difficult to use.  It is too thick.  It is very difficult to get the different heads on and off.  And the setting  switch is at the bottom which means it can&#x27;t be changed without laying it down.  I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This purchase was a replacement for the same dryer I purchased last July.  It&#x27;s one of the best dryer&#x27;s I&#x27;ve had in quite some time.  The only draw back is that with the original one I purchased the switch broke after only 5 months but it was such a good dryer that I decided to re-purchase with the hopes that this one will not break as quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible styling tool.  It is so large that you need monster size hands to be able to use it.  It takes both hands to use it effectively which leaves none left for working with your hair.  Then, as you try to use it, it gets so hot that it burns you.  Lots of air comes out of the vents before the brush directly onto your hand as you style.  This is an extremely poorly designed product.</li>
            <li> Every time I try to use this the brush attachment falls off the dryer and gets tangled in my hair.  They don&#x27;t \\&quot;click into place\\&quot; as the directions say they should.  I guess I need some duct tape!! Defective design for sure.</li>
            <li> My basic WalMart Revlon hot air styler literally came apart at the seam and broke, and have been searching for a good replacement; thought I would upgrade to a better \\&quot;ceramic ion\\&quot;.   Cost does not matter to me ~ it is important to get a product that works well, with good results.      I can&#x27;t emphasize enough to you what an inappropriately, uncomfortably LOUD, shrill noise the motor on this thing makes.  As in, if you were in a work setting, OSHA would fine your employer!  Earplugs required!!!    Secondly, the control to turn the setting from warm to \\&quot;cool\\&quot; to set your curl is at the base of the styler, and can&#x27;t be adjusted with just the thumb on one hand....both hands have to be involved as you twist the base, so it is much harder to keep the hair in the styler while you&#x27;re changing the heat setting (i.e., the hair falls out).   It&#x27;s poor design, very clumsy.      Third, the \\&quot;warm\\&quot; setting is not \\&quot;warm\\&quot;, it is HOT!  Plus, the air flow is too forceful, so half of the hair won&#x27;t wrap around the brush; if your hair is like mine, semi-wavy blonde &amp; thin, you end up with a crinkled flat mess.      I am taking the time to write this review to warn potential buyers away from this item.   Wish I could recommend another in its place, but I am still looking.  My first replacement try was a  WIGO Europe WG5120 1000 Watt Ceramic 1 1/4\\&quot;, but have a hard time getting the skimpy bristles on the brush to hold my hair around the barrel the way my old Revlon would (plus the handle is huge).    Now I have another hot air styler to add to the collection ~~ but am looking for a cheap online source for earplugs!  ;)    Hope this review is helpful.      Again, in conclusion, would definitely NOT buy this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is always boring as well as dry and damaged. I wanted to find something that would give my hair more volume, with a smooth and shiny look. I also wanted to add some waves to my hair with bounce. I read a lot of reviews and watched tutorials on youtube and knew I had to try this.  So once I received this I knew I had to give myself more time to do my hair, which was fine. Its best to use after shower while hair has some dampness to it. I always use tresemme&#x27; thermal creations before I dry my hair with anything, so I did that first and my hair came out looking great!. I did not get the volume I wanted, but that&#x27;s okay. I did get the shiny smooth look from the ions in the styler. To top it all off I got the waves and bounce I wanted.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer  will shut off after using it on the hot cycle for just a minute.  I feel it is not a safe product to use.</li>
            <li> This styler is basically useless, the handle is too big, i can barely hold on it. the 1\\&quot; attachment is what i really wanted for my short hair but the bristles are really way too short to even hold my hair. I had a Helen of Troy one that was perfect but it finally stopped working. Should have bought that again but could not find it.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Yes it&#x27;s a bit loud, and yes it&#x27;s a bit bulky, but not any bulkier than holding a traditional hair dryer.  This isn&#x27;t a curling iron, don&#x27;t buy this if you want tight curls.  If you want curls, just use hot rollers.  This product works perfectly for it&#x27;s intended use.  I use this on damp hair and ALWAYS get perfect \\&quot;blow-out\\&quot; results.  I have purchased 3 of these Revlon dryer brushes in the past and this one is my favorite because it leaves my hair shiny and full of volume.  I also have the RV440, which I love too.  For those who have left negative reviews, I say consider your hair type.  If you have coarse, thick, hard-to-style hair then don&#x27;t leave this a bad review simply because it didn&#x27;t work for you.  We all have different hair types.</li>
            <li> When our hair dryer died Mrs. Boilermate dug this one out of the \\&quot;archives\\&quot; for us to use until the new one got here. First of all being round with a rotary switch on the end is far from convenient. It is also awkward to use. But when you turn it on you discover it is loud on low and dangerously loud on \\&quot;cool\\&quot; or high. Not only loud, but high pitched. A leaf blower isn&#x27;t much noisier. You really need ear plugs to use this one.    I would tell everyone to avoid this one.</li>
            <li> I have had several of these over the last several years and had given up on them.  Then I tried the one my sister had - this one - and loved it so much I bought mine own.  Great power, dries my hair quickly.  I only use the 1 large barrel attachment, so I can&#x27;t comment on the others.  It is loud, but no louder than other similar products.</li>
            <li> I have the earlier models of this hair dryer and really liked them except the last two models have had some major issues.    This model has to have been designed by someone who only uses one power and probably has short hair.  I use the different setting.  The older unit allows me to hit each section with a blast of cooler air by pushing the button up with the same hand that I use to use the wand.    This model forces me to take it down off of my hair, change the setting by moving the ring around at the bottom using both hands and then put it back in my hair and hit it with cool hair after I reroll it.      I dislike it so much that I&#x27;m going to return it.    An earlier model was also a disaster since the removed one of the tiny pegs around the top of the unit that allowed it to securely hold the base of the brush on the unit.  This unit brings that feature back.  Too bad they blew it with the ring around the bottom.</li>
            <li> I almost bought this until I realized that the speeds are at the bottom of the barrel and controlled by a knob. This would not make it very easy to switch from hot to cool.</li>
            <li> After so many searches and reviews I bought this one, The biggest shock was when I started the dryer and the air flow was not actually going through the brush but instead there are three openings at the bottom of the brush that waste the air flow out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT recommend this product and suggest people to focus about the openings at the bottom when they buy such type of dryers.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the smaller styling brush but very disappointed it was not a brush but a plastic brush that does not hold my hair in it at all</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this product, I have read other reviews from customers who bought this specific model from different sellers. Quite a few people mentioned the excessive noise the brush makes when on high speed, and also a problem with hot air coming from the base of the brush instead of where the bristles are. I did not pay much attention to the noise problem, thinking that the reviewers were just making it a big deal. We know that all fans make noise. Well, when I used the brush for the first and only time, I have to say that the reviewers had a point, and those who warned not to buy, were absolutely right. The noise is intolerable indeed. The unit screams when blows. Believe me, you will never be able to use the brush on high speed. Secondly, the airflow - it comes from the base of the brush making your styling pointless. The hair around the brush flies away from it, leaving you with even more frizz than before styling.&lt;br /&gt;The product is being returned. Do not buy.&lt;br /&gt;For the same price you will be far more satisfied with the John Frieda air brush.</li>
            <li> Have had one for about three years.  Thought I should get a back up so it doesn&#x27;t quit on me while getting ready for work.  Have use it and am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Bought this product in April 2011 , everything seems to be working fine and suddenly it just stopped working. I&#x27;m very disapointed an also highly annoyed it worked for 6 months, this was a waste of money, come on Revlon how can you make products to last a few months........</li>
            <li> I really liked this tool for my fine straight hair.  I thought it was easy to use and I loved the results.  However, the product itself is very cheaply made.  The brushes don&#x27;t lock tightly into position, and the 1 inch piece came apart into pieces after I&#x27;d only had it for three weeks.  I thought about exchanging it, but decided there was no reason another one might last longer and got a refund instead.  I am now using a curling iron and a blow dryer while I look for a better-quality replacement.</li>
            <li> I have used this revelon type brush dryer for years.  This one, however, has a very small plastic piece that holds the brush on the dryer - broke in the first week.  Not surprising when you see what a small piece it is.  I have it rigged to work - but if you use the brush regularly it has a design flaw.</li>
            <li> The high/low/cool/off settings bottom is not working and I am not able to find the seller&#x27;s e-mail to write.  I gave this item to my mother as a christmas gift and it did not work.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with it. Is well made, and solid. Needles to say, durable. I love my curler. I can not get tired to use in my long hair. After I&#x27;m done with it I fell like a star. No need to go to the hair dresser.</li>
            <li> Love love love this. Its magic to your hair!! I would honestly like it more if it worked a little deeper in your roots (speciañly since i have really curly/puffy hair), but anyways if you put enough effort you might get a pretty great hairdry.</li>
            <li> I love this brush hair blower because it does NOT tangle the hair and the ions dry the hair in half the time compared to a regular blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer. But it was a failure, it had a lot of noise and also it burnt my hair. I returned it and i paid $12 just for returning and unfortunately Amazon, refunded me 60%. it was a total regret.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer to replace the one I have been using for years (different brand, not sold in the store anymore) -  and I returned it two days later.  I did NOT like it.  This dryer is VERY loud, way too big / uncomfortable to hold and most of the hot air that should go through the brush attachment escapes through the vent near the connection to the motor wand and burned my neck / ears.  The knob at the end of the dryer is not big enough to hold while curling your hair and burned my fingers.  The bristles on the brush attachment are very short and wouldn&#x27;t even grab all of my hair ... VERY disappointed overall and will be ordering a duplicate of my old dryer online.</li>
            <li> I agree with many of the other comments here..this unit is very poorly designed.  I bought this one to replace an old faithful Conair version.  I have a lot of hair but it is very fine and straight.  So I need this type styling tool to add as much volume as I can to my flat life-less hair.  My old one had the on/off switch positioned nicely for the thumb to slide it up to low then high or all the way back down to off - all with one hand.  On this unit you have to hold it in one hand while turning a large dial on the bottom.  The unit is way too thick to be comfortable in your hand.  The air escapes from vent holes before it even gets to the brush, blasting down on your head and hand in one concentrated stream with very hot air.  The adjustable barrel is a joke - yes you can dial it from 1 inch to 1.5 but it doesn&#x27;t lock in position so it easily collapses.  Wish I had done my homework - I will be looking for a replacement immediately.</li>
            <li> I loved the old model of this item, it lasted for years, and when it died...I rushed out to Amazon to get a new one....on seeing this new model I assumed it would be just as wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the first time I used this, the hair dryer heated up so much, that the plastic clips holding the brush in place melted, and ripped off just pulling it through my hair.  A little super glue fixed it, since I only use the bigger brush, it didnt seem that important.  A few weeks later, it will not turn on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My theory is that they didnt test it on anyone with thick or long hair.  This thing overheats, and between the cheap plastic, and the motor, it won&#x27;t last you long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very Disappointing...</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product.  It gets too hot, shuts off, emits a deafening, shrill, high-pitched sound rivaled in volume only by the gaping maw of Hell itself, and considering how hot this gets there may actually be a portal to Hell inside of it.  My hair gets tangled around the attachments and it takes FOREVER to dry my hair with the curling attachments.  It is also enormous, difficult to store, and not great for traveling with either.  I am pretty sure I am going to suffer long-term hearing loss from the 3 times I&#x27;ve used it, and I&#x27;m surprised it hasn&#x27;t been recalled for the 125 decibel scream that comes from it.</li>
            <li> The handle is to big and after 2 weeks of use it made a funny noise and seemed like it was going to burn up.  I don&#x27;t recommend this item.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for it has the power to do the job</li>
            <li> GF was not very impressed with the drying power of this unit....</li>
            <li> Got the order for 2 Revlon Curls ahead of time &amp; found them in excellent packaging conditions. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase, thank you!</li>
            <li> I first purchased the more expensive brush that spins that pulled, knotted up my hair and had little power to dry. I bought this to replace the less expensive non-ceramic model I&#x27;ve loved for years but had problems with the barrel bending. This hair dryer brush is great! It&#x27;s got lots of power and strength  - luv it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the way this dries my hair-good look practically every time I used it. The first one the motor burned out in about a week.  I returned it and got a replacement, which just burned out this past weekend--owned it all of 70 days.  I have normal hair that is mid-length and straight.  Often I air dry, so it is not like I used it every day...just be forwarned.  It&#x27;s great if you can get it to last...</li>
            <li> Awesome product. We have long, thick hair and this helps us dry and style and get rid of the frizzies pretty quickly too.</li>
            <li> Bad and lousy product</li>
            <li> I recently got a new hairstyle &amp; my regular blow dryer &amp; curling iron were too much work.  This styler brush does the work of both.  I&#x27;d had a styler brush before, but it had little power &amp; really could not dry my hair.  this Revlon appliance has incredible power &amp; with one appliance I can dry &amp; style my hair.  It is great for my new A-frame cut.</li>
            <li> As others posted, I too, find this dryer way too loud.Even being slightly deaf in one ear, it was too loud and very shrill.  The &amp;#34;concentrator&amp;#34; is my favorite part as the adjustable brush is hard plastic and doesn&#x27;t even fit the adjustments correctly and the other brush is just too large for my hair.  My hair is fine and won&#x27;t curl easily but I had looked to this product for volume.  I feel I should have shopped around a lot more before deciding on this one.  Too loud, too bulky for handling, adjustable brush doesn&#x27;t adjust properly and is hard plastic rather than a brush, the other brush is too large for use.  I did find it wasn&#x27;t that difficult to change out the parts and the cord does swivel, should you wonder about those things.</li>
            <li> I like that it is 1500 watts.  It adds a lot of body and volume.  I don&#x27;t like the non-turning barrell that allows you to easily unroll the heated hair without getting stuck. Releasing the hair you&#x27;ve put on the curling rod can be difficult if you have long hair.  If it had that feature (as some of the other models) it would be perfect.  The smaller barrell must be for short hair because it doesn&#x27;t do anything but get stuck in my long hair. I don&#x27;t like the plastic it is made of and that the bristles don&#x27;t bend.  Again, if it turned to release the hair, it would be a better design.  The last one I purchased did turn to release. This model is an improvement with the heating wattage only but not the design.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Light and easy, love the different settings.  Leaves hair soft and shiny.  Would definately buy this product again.</li>
            <li> not real hot gets tangled sometimes</li>
            <li> 5th one I&#x27;ve owned and lasted a week. I loved the power and have had them last as follows:&lt;br /&gt;1. 2 years&lt;br /&gt;2. 1 year&lt;br /&gt;3. 6 months (replaced by factory)&lt;br /&gt;4. 2 years (factory replacement exactly like this one)&lt;br /&gt;5. 7 days&lt;br /&gt;I requested return and forgot to mail before deadline (my error).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so disappointed. I&#x27;ve tried almost every type of brush dryer and this one works the best when it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping and everything else was fine.</li>
            <li> My hair gets stuck between the metal and plastic parts of the brush barrel when I attempt to use this to blow out my hair. Quality construction would resolve this issue. I have lost quite a few strands of hair to this thing....  The control is at the very bottom of the dryer and must be twisted to change to cool burst setting, etc. Twisting the bottom while trying to style my hair is cumbersome.  Edited to add: 6/19/2015 The dryer started smoking last night, burnt plastic smell which would indicate a wiring flaw. I used this less than ten times. Amazon&#x27;s great return policy made getting a refund simple. Now, I just have to find the time to read reviews to find another dryer.</li>
            <li> Wonderful addition to my hair appliances...</li>
            <li> My favorite hairstyling product. Had bought one a few years back at Target. I dropped it hard and it broke. Couldn&#x27;t find it at Target anymore so I found it on here. SO HAPPY!</li>
            <li> stopped working after a few months</li>
            <li> sooooooooo hot ,i can&#x27;t hold it with my hands when i start using it i shocked of the big noise and hard heat ,plus i noticed the my hail become like some one firme it by shaver.i think its not health at all &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&amp; it cause lot of damage</li>
            <li> This is my second one.  First one functionable after 10 years, but wanted a new colorful one.  I only use this tool to dry and style my hair.  Use in medium setting.  Fab!</li>
            <li> I got this because a friend of mine loves hers.  The good thing is that it gets hotter than most hot air brushes, but the handle is just too big to use easily.  Also, the brushes don&#x27;t grip the hair well enough.  My fine hair falls out of the bristles before I can get my hair dry.</li>
            <li> I have been using this model for several years. The last one I bought (still works perfectly), but after 5 years I just wanted a change. It survived many falls and never failed on me.</li>
            <li> I really like this hot air brush. I have curly thick hair and this straightens my hair in 20/25 minutes. The only concern I have is the loud noise it makes; otherwise, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> This thing is loud, too hot, unwieldy, heavy and I should have returned it.</li>
            <li> Purchased to replace the wife&#x27;s broken one.  I swear she wants to purchase like 10 of these for the years to come just in case.</li>
            <li> Hairdryer burned out on 8/20/15- less than 3 weeks old.&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy again!&lt;br /&gt;Nothing to do with seller.</li>
            <li> I like the ideal of the product, but the first one i got only lasted about 4-6 months before the attachments wouldn&#x27;t stay on.  I sent it back to Revlon and they replaced it with a new one, but the 2nd one last less then a month when the attachments started coming off, so my husband put to screws in the large brush, cuz that is what i use the most of the time and it works great now, and the attachment stays on.  The company needs to re-work this so it works correctly and the attachments stay on.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace the Revlon 440c (which was too hot and I could never use anything but the low setting) the motor blew after about a year. This new one I haven&#x27;t gotten the hang of yet, it has a very high pitch motor, and vents right where the brushes go into the unit. These vents send your hair flying everywhere and make it rather difficult to use the brush, it has even caught a few strands of hair in the vent and pulled it into the motor:( so I&#x27;m not super thrilled about plus it was more expensive than the previous model I had ($30) at Target. Oh well I&#x27;ll give it a little more time before I give up and look for something else.</li>
            <li> The product is great and works very well. I&#x27;m very happy with a purchase. Exactly what I wanted! Yes, it is loud, but what do you want from a powerful tool?</li>
            <li> This is the worst drier/brush ever!! The end twists on but it twists the same way you blowdry your hair so when you put the hair around it and pull, it twists off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A load of rubbish! Am amazing their testing didn&#x27;t reveal this flaw.</li>
            <li> Pretty loud, have only used once so far but it worked well.  Quick results with a nice bend in the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great blow dryer for also curling your hair and getting some style at the same time. The brush ends work great and are super with my short hair and dry my hair in no time flat. The dryer is a little hot on high, so I recommend using on the low setting if you have short hair. Great styling tool and dryer in one!</li>
            <li> This product did not meet my expectations.The brushes  do not even go through my hair.It is a useless product , and I wasted my money.I was surprised at a name brand such as Revlon having an inferior product.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, lightly color treated. It gets very dried out just from getting it dry, no real styling. I use tons of conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;If I use a curling iron, even on a low setting, to get a little curl or bounce, my hair really suffers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this inexpensive dryer on a whim. it is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I section off my hair in to manageable chunks. First I dry it a little with the brush, then curl up each section, on low so it doesn&#x27;t blow away, then hold it on high, then it MUST go to cool. I gently twist and release the curl, without brushing it out immediately until all the hair is finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never ever received so many complements on my hair. Even my hairdresser though I had it set. Looks like a light bouncy curl, with life, very soft, very healthy looking. I am in my late 40&#x27;s and I swear it takes 10 years off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally it takes me 20 minutes to just dry my hair with a brush and dryer. This takes 30 minutes. Totally worth it!!.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, however, be very careful because it gets very hot quickly.  I am always very careful how tightly I wind&lt;br /&gt;my hair around this barrel of this Hot Air  item.  Does a great job, just be careful.&lt;br /&gt;Betty</li>
            <li> this dryer is an excellent dryer brush for drying your hair from completely wet stage with the various attachments or just touching up your style later.  it has excellent air speed and lots of heat.  if your hair is very fine, maybe too much.  but mine is thick, thick, thick! and i need extra air and heat!  the brush grabs the hair without tangling very well and i love this dryer.   i use it in addition to a larger dryer at home but when traveling it is excellent all by itself.  it detaches from the accessories nicely and is easy to store.  i really love it!</li>
            <li> LOUD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used this unit once because of how loud it is. I am sure it functions beautifully, but I have a sensitivity to volume. It is unfortunate that this piece was not for me.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today, and it&#x27;s going back!  It was the loudest hair appliance I&#x27;ve ever used!  It actually hurt my ears on the highest setting.  It HAS to be dangerous for your hearing using it right next to your ears.  I definitely DO NOT recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was shocked to read all of the \\&quot;too loud to use\\&quot; reviews for this product.  It does make noise, and at the high setting it makes more noise than a standard blow dryer.  I tend to use it at the low setting after pre-drying my hair with a blow dryer.  The blow dryer is much faster and this product is great for the finish drying and styling.  I use it at my gym and I have had countless people ask about it (all of whom hear the noise that it makes).  No one has ever thought that it was too loud for the dressing room.  In fact, I am purchasing another at a friend&#x27;s request so that she can have one too.  The blow-drying wand makes styling and shaping much easier than trying to work with a brush and a blow dryer at the same time.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about purchasing this.  There are other high end, pricier ones that I figured were amazing, I just didn&#x27;t want to pay the price.  So I tried this out and let me say, it has exceeded my expectations dramatically! I have very very thick hair (it takes 5 hours to highlight) and it&#x27;s rather long (about to my shoulder blades).  It would normally take me close to an hour to do my hair (dry it then curl it/straighten it).  I have only used this product once (I just got it and had to share my news).  From sopping wet hair to finish it took me just over half an hour! What I did was section off my hair. Then I would hold the bigger round portion at my roots for a few seconds just to give them some added volume and extra drying time.  Then I would \\&quot;Curl\\&quot; my hair, bring the dryer to the ends then wrap up my hair slowly.  I would do this 2 times for each little section of hair and it would dry it and curl it and then I was done! I am a firm believer in this product and wish I would have found it sooner.  You can&#x27;t beat this price either! AMAZING and I would highly recommend to anyone!!!</li>
            <li> This is a terrible hair dryer!  The base of the brush attachment has a large space -- air comes blasting out, and blows everything.&lt;br /&gt;This appliance works quite poorly- too much trouble to send it back, though.</li>
            <li> As a hair dryer it does its job however the style is questionable. I had a Vidal Sasoon of this type that after 12 years burnt out so I tried to find another could not so purchased this one. The wand attachment that is adjustable does not stay the size you want so when it reduces by itself that leaves you with a wand stuck in your hair. The two other attachments work fine but you can not take apart to clean when dust will build up. I expect this to have a shorter life span because of the last fact.</li>
            <li> Just okay, Thought the 2 black buttons on the barrel were on/off, nope, black band at the bottom is on/off.  Not very convient to use.  Need both hands to work this one.  Update April 26 2017.  Today it caught my hair on fire!!! I was not holding it close to my head and I smelled something burning and saw smoke and looked at my hair.  Now I don&#x27;t have hair on one side of my head.  I had just cleaned al the vents over the weekend so it was lint free</li>
            <li> Great tool with plenty of power.  I find the placement of the power selections a bit awkward.</li>
            <li> The brush attachment is difficult and I am afraid I am going to break it but otherwise it is good.</li>
            <li> I bought mine about a year ago to replace my older model Revlon Perfect Heat hot air brush (it&#x27;s handle is smaller and uniformly round) because I bent the brush itself and wore out alot of the bristles.  The handle of this is long, big and bulky and hard to manage with just one hand.  Also the handle feels longer and the brush itself isn&#x27;t that long, so it puts your hand and arm in an awkward position to style your hair.  Yes it&#x27;s also noisy and whiny. The hot setting blows ALOT of hot air, so like other reviewers mentioned, it blows your hair around before you can get it all wrapped around the barrel. Also for some reason, I don&#x27;t like the bristles on this brush, maybe they are too short. Uggg!</li>
            <li> They made one design change to the original product that renders it practically unnecessary.  The original design had a release button that allowed you to roll your hair around the brush, release it and let the curl drop.  Now all it does is blow dry your hair just like every other product out there.  And it seems a lot heavier than a standard blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews prior to purchasing this item and was aware that it was loud and heavy, but I was looking for something that had a lot of power because I do not have a lot of time in the AM to get ready.  I had another model prior to this and it was 500 watts and it took forrrrrrrrrrever!  This model has 1500 watts and I can dry and style my shoulder length hair (from dripping stage) in around 4-5 minutes.  Yes it is loud, but it works GREAT!  I do not find it so loud that it hurts my ears though???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as it being heavy - yes, it is heavier than other models, but since it works so quickly, that doesn&#x27;t really seem to be an issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would HIGHLY recommend this product for anyone who is always rushing in the AM to get ready and out the door :)  You will not be disappointed in the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these my wife has used.  The first one lasted about a year.  This one lasted 2 days.  She will use a different brand.</li>
            <li> Five stars for me.  This is my second unit after ??? years.  And, IMHO, best price.</li>
            <li> I really like this. I purchased it to replace another Revlon styler that I purchase several years ago and just recently died. I would have to agree with some of the other reviewers that on high, this thing is like a 747 near your ear! I use it on the lower setting and it&#x27;s forceful enough to dry and style  without blowing out my eardrum.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at Target and read Amazon reviews after, and was really scared to open and try it based on reviews saying it&#x27;s too loud.  I&#x27;m really sensitive to loud noises and was afraid I would hate it.  This awesome styling brush is quieter than the blow dryer I reaplaced, and a MUCH better and faster styling tool.  Please do not be put off by the reports of how loud it is!  Maybe they&#x27;ve improved the product recently, I don&#x27;t know, but even on high it&#x27;s quieter than my last blow dryer.  It&#x27;s also not at all heavy.  It works REALLY fast, een on my very thick hair, and makes beautiful smooth lines or curled ends.  Amazon price is better than what I paid at Target, too, so get it here.  After years struggling with a dryer and round brush, I am delighted by this tool, I&#x27;ll never use a regular dryer again!</li>
            <li> I use this product every other day and I absolutely could not live without it. I&#x27;ve had this one for quite awhile, and it&#x27;s still working great! I&#x27;ve tried other brands and models of this same hair tool, and I would buy this one again and again!</li>
            <li> Talk about power.  This is my only must have styling tool been using this type for years.  This model i am a first time user and love the power and how fast it dries my hair.  I will never buy a lower wattage than this one ever again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better. The air blows out in a weird place and messes up your hair where you don&#x27;t want it to.  But I&#x27;m using it and it&#x27;s working so can&#x27;t complain too much. Would not order this one again.</li>
            <li> dries hair fast, leaves my hair with nice waves. The only problem I have is with the adjustable styler-it doesn&#x27;t stay open to the 1 1/2 inch size.</li>
            <li> This is terrible design.  There is so much hot air coming out before the curl brush that is burns your hands, ears, or scalp.  Terrible, terrible, terrible.</li>
            <li> to heavy to hold up for the entire time you style your hair. The part were you hold it is too cumbersome and hard to hold</li>
            <li> How do you input \\&quot;zero\\&quot; stars?  I purchases this item for my wife, but it emitted an ear piercing noise so loud that we had to return it. Even across the room, the noise is so loud that it hurt my ears -- I cannot imagine trying to use it on your hair right next to your ear.  My wife couldn&#x27;t test it to see if it provided the results she wanted because she couldn&#x27;t get it that close to her head.</li>
            <li> I have a minor disability that makes it difficult for me to use a roller brush and a hairdryer simultaneously, and this styler just takes the cake. It is loud, but I can&#x27;t relate to the complaints about it being eardrum-shattering - it sounds like a normal hair dryer. Also its design is not made for quick drying, but I&#x27;ve found that drying and styling is much easier when you blow dry in sections (I have long, fine hair). I was thrilled with the results and although I&#x27;m aware these things die out after awhile, I&#x27;d be willing to buy another just for the convenience of it.  I took one star off because it really does become very hot, but it&#x27;s not an issue. There is an odor when you turn it on high heat, but I&#x27;ve been using it daily and it hasn&#x27;t broken or sparked or exploded, so I think it&#x27;s fine.   Overall, extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer a while ago and I love it.. it does what it&#x27;s suppose too.. Just be careful it might burn you.. its too hot almost like a straightener.. And yes it is loud and it gets louder if any hair got stuck inside of it but I still love it.. it gives my hair this wavy beautiful look...</li>
            <li> Best invention for the girl who doesn&#x27;t have the coordination to hold the hair dryer and the roller brush at the same time. Hair turns out smooth and shiny. Be sure to blow-dry your hair to &#x27;almost dry&#x27; before using the brush!</li>
            <li> I have used this type of blow brush for over 16 years.I have gone through 5 different types and this one is by far the worst one I have ever used! The actual brush has two spots that hair can get stuck in. When you pull the brush away, it takes a chunk of hair with it! I have the bald spots to prove it! The design was clearly not tested on a person with thick hair before put into the market. I will never EVER buy this product again. I suggest if you have thick hair, to avaoid this one-unless you want to thin it out!</li>
            <li> I love this, only complaint I wish the switch buttons were closer to my finger tips than near the cord. Made well and very sturdy. Would buy again</li>
            <li> Gives just the right amount of curl to my hair.</li>
            <li> Really nice product, Its more useful for my wife and I simply love it.... Deleviered within specified time frame. Thanks!</li>
            <li> ..Wife is happy.........then I&#x27;m happy.  She loves it, so much more versitile then the old one this replaced.  thank you</li>
            <li> I was never able to use the adjustable size brush because it does not grip my hair. I have however extensively used the metal barrel attachment. It works well, and creates decent style. The main problem with this product is the volume. I didn&#x27;t notice how bad it was at first, but it is so loud that I&#x27;ve considered wearing earplugs to avoid loosing hearing. I&#x27;m confident you can find a better product at the same price point. Steer clear of this one.</li>
            <li> My Revlon hot air brush went in the garbage last week.  1) The design is poor as fine hair can get caught in the openings in the base of the attachments. I lost a chunk of hair and set the fire alarms off in our house!! It will be months before my hair grows out  2) I also think the unit gets too hot.</li>
            <li> I bought three of these so far, one for me and two for my sisters.&lt;br /&gt;We all love it.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> The smaller brush was not a brush like the larger brush, it was a plastic adjustable item.  It is very hard to use this plastic brush on my short hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much.  The brush attachment broke when I dropped it but I called the manufacture and the company sent me a new one!  After the brush attachment broke I started using the smaller plastic brush attachment which I didn&#x27;t think I would like but it worked great and my hair&#x27;s bounciness held much longer than with the brush.</li>
            <li> Great one handed product- meaning I need only one hand which helps when you have a bit of arthritis in the other- I don&#x27;t need to hold a curling brush and a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> This makes my fine hair full and smooth looking. It works so much better than other air stylers because the bristles are hard and they grip your hair.  I like it so much that I&#x27;ve bought several of them just in case they stop making them!</li>
            <li> Very cheap. The attachment breaks even if you try to follow the instructions (align the arrows, ...). Will not buy this brand again</li>
            <li> Is very hot and, therefore, works quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy with this hot air brush.&lt;br /&gt;I would have preferred it, however, if the smaller brush cylinder&lt;br /&gt;were made of bristles rather than plastic.  The plastic doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;hold my hair but bristles would.  That would have made it perfect.</li>
            <li> Not what I wanted at all.  My first clue should have been the impossible packaging. Had to destroy that to get it open. The device itself didn&#x27;t meet my needs. The hot air is great except it seems to blow out around the handle instead of through the bristles of the attachments.  I am an average size woman - I don&#x27;t have tiny hands  -  it was extremely hard to keep a grip while trying to style my hair.  I do feel like this might work better on extremely thick or coarse hair but it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I tried this at  my daughters and thought it wad great.  Drying with it has put the curl back in my hair.  So easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have used this type of product for many, many years. I&#x27;ve owned at least 5, probably more. I recently needed to purchase a new one and bought this one. It&#x27;s horrible! The on, off, temp and ION switches are awkward to use. Plus the barrel is so fat that I can hardly hold it in my hand. But the absolute worst is that when you curl one section and move on to the next the air that vents from this thing blows very forcefully onto the part of your hair that you just styled, so hair doesn&#x27;t have a chance to cool and set. It&#x27;s all fly away looking. I used this 3x and finally just threw it away, so that I would be forced to replace it instead of being totally frustrated each time I tried to use it. Do not buy this, it&#x27;s a terrible design!</li>
            <li> I like the product but it takes longer than I expected to do my hair. Maybe I need to use different hair products to get my hair smoother as well.</li>
            <li> I should have read dimensions more closely and certainly will from now on.  This is definitely 16&amp;#34; long (maybe longer) with the brush attachment.  I have long fingers and can&#x27;t reach around the handle so 8&amp;#34; is probably accurate.  I was expecting one of the sleek new, little stylers and was very surprised at how large this was.  I have a short bob and thought it would help with some volume.  Didn&#x27;t whether I used it with wet or dry hair.  Tried to curl bangs and more air blew in my face than my hair.  The attachments were to hot to handle at the base when trying to change from diffuser to brush.  I have an older 1200W dryer that&#x27;s more powerful and quieter than this 1500W.  The only redeeming quality of this styler is the color.  This can&#x27;t go back soon enough!</li>
            <li> This hair styler is the only one that can get my hair to look like I want it to. It heats up to a high temp and the air flow is powerful enough to dry and style very thick hair. However, the slightest tension on the brush (such as when pulling hair taut and straight) will break the brush right off the styler. There must be a little cheap piece of plastic in there which apparently snaps off so that the brush will no longer snap into place. The first time it happened, I bought another one, thinking that I must have pulled with too much tension. However, I have had 2 more after that, and they all broke in the same place within a week. It&#x27;s a shame. It was so great at styling my hair but so cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I have ALWAYS used a curling brush (hot air curling brush), so I thought this product would be worth a try.  I&#x27;m sorry, but this product is ridiculous, an epic fail by Revlon.  First of all, it is HUGE, nearly impossible to hold. For curling, there are large air vents at the base of the brush, destroying the rest of your hair while you are trying to curl.  The &amp;#34;dryer&amp;#34; by itself would take too long use on a regular basis. Nothing to do with the seller at all, I appreciate the quick shipment, this is just a bad product.</li>
            <li> After 5 years my Revlon hot air brush same as this one, but in white, died due to the cord wearing out at the rotating connector.  So I was in the market again for another hair brush.  I&#x27;ve been an avid user of hot air dryer brushes since they came out as I like the extra body and light curl I get with my fine hair both at shorter and shoulder lengths. While there are a couple of things I don&#x27;t particularly like about this dryer brush, I still decided to purchase it again after comparing it to the competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: high wattage makes for quick drying, barrel size, hard tines instead of soft bristles on the adjustable barrel, tourmaline ionic technology, and price. 1500 watts makes this a quick dryer.  Most other dryer brushes are only 1000 or 1200 watts. This dryer makes the lower wattage ones act like wimps. There are 3 settings, cool, low and high, and I use it exclusively on high and love how it dries my hair just as quickly as a regular hair dryer, but with the ability to boost body and add shape all in one step. I&#x27;ve never been good at the dryer in one hand and brush in the other hand, other than to just have hair fly all over!  Two barrels come with it, one being adjustable from 1&amp;#34; to 1 1/2&amp;#34; by twisting the barrel and the other is fixed at 1 1/2&amp;#34;.  The adjustable barrel is a durable plastic with short hard tines, while the other barrel has the nano ceramic coating with soft short nylon bristles typical of other hot air brush models.  I prefer the hard plastic tines with my fine hair. Fewer tangles seem to occur with the hard tines. The adjustable barrel, while a neat feature it is not really that practical as there is no way to lock it to the larger size, so expect it to remain as a 1&amp;#34; barrel. It&#x27;s perfect for shorter hair. I don&#x27;t use the other barrel, but probably would if I had longer hair.  It also comes with a concentrator attachment to just blow the air more like a hair dryer, but keep in mind it limits the air flow to a smallarea. Fine if you want to dry a small area of hair, not like a full fledge hair dryer.  You can get more of that effect by just using the base without any attachments, but be careful as the air outlet gets extremely hot when not covered by the attachments. It&#x27;s not intended to be used without the attachments. The tourmaline ionic technology is something I look for in a dryer as it has made a difference with my fine hair, making it soft, without static or frizz, and infusing moisture for healthier hair. My hair is completely straight and fine, so with this I get great body and a slight curl when holding the hair wrapped in the barrel brush a bit longer.  For a more staying curl I still use a curling iron just because I like more curl, but this gives nice body to start with. For the wattage this dryer brush sells for an affordable price around $25-30.  There are other vendors on Amazon selling this same item usually in white instead of hot pink/red for a much higher price under misleading names. Be sure and compare model number RVHA6002C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Weight, size and noise.  As others have commented this dryer brush is big - weighing about 14 oz and is 17 inches long with the barrel attached.  In comparison, my other 1000 watt Revlon dryer brush weighs just 6 oz and is 14 inches long.  This item is also noisier than other dryer brushes of lower wattage - it is comparable to a full-fledge hand hair dryer of similar wattage. Apparently the higher wattage which provides more heat and air flow is the reason for weight, size and noise level of this item.  It took some getting use to the extra weight and length over my other dryer brushes, but having more heat and air flow along with the other features I&#x27;ve mentioned are more important to me.  I mention these &amp;#34;cons&amp;#34; though for those who may have a concern handling a heavier than usual dryer brush since others have mentioned these as well.  Hence the reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars. Overall, the pros outweigh the cons for me, so much so that I won&#x27;t consider another dryer brush that isn&#x27;t at least a high wattage like this one.  Since I seem to burn a dryer brush out about every 5 years using it 4-5 times a week, this one comes at an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 9/25/2015:  Just got a second one to put in our camper permanently.  Love, love, love this dryer!</li>
            <li> I selected this product because of a recommendation in a magazine to which I subscribe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I admit I should have paid more attention to the person here in Amazon who complained that the product was too loud. That person is right. On the HIGH setting, the product is very loud and shrill. To avoid harm to my ears, I always use the lower setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it&#x27;s big and heavy. I have to use two hands to hold the wand and dry my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only find one of the attachments useful. There are two other attachments, but I never switch to either of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a more positive note, it does dry my hair quickly. Also, if I use it like I would a curling iron, (i.e., roll a strand of hair around the brush and hold it there for a few seconds, then unroll it), it gives my hair a gentle curl and nice body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I find myself going back to my old blow-dryer-and-separate-round-brush method about 50% of the time. If I had to do it over again, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy this product.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have purchased this a long time ago. It dried, styled, curled, and gave my hair tons of volume all in one step. I will be using this often, if not every day.</li>
            <li> Bad design not very functionable, on/off high/low switch at end of sytler which twists back and forth, rather than sliding up/down switch in middle of styler, hard to use, changed from prior model.  Also hair catches at base of brush where it attaches to styler.</li>
            <li> I had a hot air brush for 15 years that was awesome.  Unfortunately this did not make for a great replacement. I bought this 3 months ago and although it dries, at least once a week sometimes more my hair will get caught in the barrel.  At first I thought it was caught where the different ends attach, but it is actually when the metal barrel meets the plastic.  It is screwed to the plastic and it has a little give so when you pull it through your hair it will catch.  I am no longer going to use it, in the market for a new one.</li>
            <li> This brush works really well, but tends to overheat and burn out quickly. I&#x27;ve owned two of them, and neither has lasted more than 6 months. The most recent one burnt out in 3.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd one of this model (long story, but the others didn&#x27;t fail).  I have had the same positive experience with each of them.  Really not sure why the negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It&#x27;s a higher wattage than most of the others.  That made a huge difference for me.  The noise wasn&#x27;t as high pitched, didn&#x27;t sound like it was working as hard, curled better.  I also tried the Revlon 1200 watt sister to this product.  This one is definitely more powerful.  I never heard the high-pitch noises others complained about--with any of the 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Large brush.  I have only used the large brush.  I have long, medium thickness, fine hair.  The bristles hold my hair nicely while I curl and dry it.  My hair does NOT curl around things easily.  It even flips out of some curling irons.  The bristles kept the hair against the brush nicely.  The other thing to note is that the barrel is one continuous piece of metal.  Some barrels (like the smaller one in this set) have sections that come together to form angled curves.  This leaves my hair kind of kinky and shows bends where the hair was against seams.  The big barrel/brush doesn&#x27;t do this since it is all one piece.  I cannot speak to the smaller brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Smaller brush.  While I have not used this brush, it does have a unique feature that may appeal to some:  If you twist it, the size of the barrel changes from small to a bit larger.  In essence, you can adjust the size of the barrel to various sizes.  Kind of a neat touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Dryer attachment.  Haven&#x27;t used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  Settings - nice assortment for an inexpensive dryer.  High (hot), low (hot), cool (a high setting)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two cautions:&lt;br /&gt;  -  If you have long hair, be cautious not to let the vents at the base suck your hair in.  It causes an awful burning-hair smell and made one of mine less powerful (#1 back to the store)&lt;br /&gt;  -  Don&#x27;t drop a brush.  The brushes secure onto the body with a notch.  I dropped one on our tilefloor and it broke the notch.  No way to use the brush if you cannot attach it to the base.  (#2 down the drain)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you aren&#x27;t sure about it, they sell it at Site-to-Store function online at Walmart.  Super easy to return if it isn&#x27;t what you like.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who they designed this for but you need man sized hands to hold the barrel. Then if you try to hold onto it with your other hand the tip is too hot to touch. It does have great power at 1500w but is pretty loud.&lt;br /&gt;I agree with another reviewer that it does not grab your hair at all; you almost have to place and hold your hair onto the brush.&lt;br /&gt;I am returning this product</li>
            <li> Found this very awkward to handle, and the high setting gets too hot to even put down. After using the revo styler for 15 years, i though this might be nice not having to use a dryer in one hand and the brush in the other, but the brush does not rotate as i thought it would as i asked for a revolving styler. it gets too hot to remove the brushes and have to leave it out to cool down, and this is inconvenient</li>
            <li> In love! My hair looks just like it did when I left the salon 2 weeks ago! I&#x27;m not very coordinated and trying to hold a big blow dryer with one hand and round brush  in other just didn&#x27;t work, and didn&#x27;t want to have to use a curling iron too! I have 3 kids, barely can shower at that! So this was perfect! I used the regular blow dry feature first till it was damp then used the larger attachment &amp; turned on high mostly, but when I wanted to use like curling iron and roll hair up and hold it, it does get hot so I turned to low. I will be buying thermal glove so i don&#x27;t have to stop and turn to low again! Lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loud?? It&#x27;s 1500w, which is the same as most blow dryers, so it sounds like a blow dryer! Just as loud as my normal one, not too bad, I definitely rather have to listen to a little noise than use 500w that took 3 times longer and didn&#x27;t get hot enough! And at $25 you can&#x27;t find a better one, it allows you to turn on ions for smoother finish or off for more volume!  I already recommended product! And will be using it daily, what&#x27;s better than having to use only one hair tool?!?</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair and with the Revlon Quick Hot Air Curling Brush I am able to style and smooth.  I do wear ear plugs as it is loud.  And....it gets very hot so one must turn the dryer to cool before shutting off.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 5 time of using&lt;br /&gt;Such a waste of money&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy it&lt;br /&gt;And there is no way u can contact seller</li>
            <li> It has already broken; the brush has a plastic part that breaks off and will no longer stay attached to the dryer base. This is the second of these that I have had that did the same thing. I love how it styles my hair, but the quality on this is not good.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that after it gets old the clip on the brush breaks off and falls off periodically when your in the middle of doing your hair.  this is my 2nd one and its still too new to let you know if its fallen off yet.  i&#x27;ve tried others like hot tools which 3 broke in 6 weeks total time so this is better, i still have the pink part of my old one which works great...they should just sell the brush part for when that breaks you can replace it instead of buying a whole new set.  My last one lasted a few months short of 2 years.</li>
            <li> I have medium/thick wavy hair with a lot of gray. It falls just below my ears and I always blow it out and straighten it. I wish I purchased one of these brushes in the past because it made easy work of drying my hair. I didn&#x27;t even have to straighten it with the flat iron. I did change the attachments during the course of drying my hair. After sectioning off areas of hair, it allows you to easily dry the underside without having to hold a brush and a hair dryer. It isn&#x27;t pictured, but it comes with a hard plastic expandable round plastic brush and also a round metal attachment with a lot of bristles sticking through the brush part. I don&#x27;t think this unit is any louder than other hair dryers I&#x27;ve owned. It does have a shrill sound that I don&#x27;t notice with my regular hair dryer though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Great end result, lightweight, 3 useful attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Barrel of dryer unit could be smaller and it would be nice to have some type of grip on it. I feel like I might break something when changing the attachments-hope it doesn&#x27;t break easily.</li>
            <li> This works very well and has lots of power which is something that I really like.  Also it is cheaper to buy it on Amazon then in Walmart.</li>
            <li> Disappointed..  Let me add to the list of persons not happy with the construction and functionality.  The air flow is so massive coming out of the vents at the bottom of the bristles, that it blows all of your hair off the brush and makes a frizzy mess.  Not a good investment for your money.</li>
            <li> Very good but the smaller attachment is still too large for really short hair.</li>
            <li> It stopped working days after being able to send it back for free.  Not sure if it was motor or what had happened..</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer I have ever had. I have gone through 3 different types like this and did not like any of them. This one works so much better than any other one. It takes out all my frizz and dries super quick.</li>
            <li> Bueno no es lo que pensé; realmente creía que al encenderlo los cepillos girarían mas no giran los cepillos y es super pesado</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for straightening , but it&#x27;s hard to use it for curling. or maybe because I don&#x27;t know how.&lt;br /&gt;In general I like the product.</li>
