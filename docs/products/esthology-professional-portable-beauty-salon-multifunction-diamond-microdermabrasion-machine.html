            <li>The amazing thing is it keeps working days after a treatment.</li>
            <li>It is housed in a nice looking case that fits all the accessories with ease.</li>
            <li>I loved that it came with 3 wands and so many diamond tipped attachments.</li>

            <li>Just being honest.</li>
            <li>All the attachments and pieces fit very nicely into the carry case.  </li>
            <li>It is also VERY easy and ituitive to use.</li>
            <li>Maybe it would be nice to spritz the face with refreshing water, though.  </li>
            <li>Even my color is more even.</li>
            <li>Better to spend a bit more on the MicrodermMD machine which has wonderful instructions, smaller and lightweight.</li>

            <li>But you can look online to see how to better use it.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t come with many</li>

            <li>I LOVE THE WAY THIS MACHINE IS IN A CASE AND COMES WITH LOTS OF ATATCHMENTS.</li>
            <li>After searching around and finally purchasing this uit, I am very happy.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m confident this product will get me there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m use to a more stable gauge when it&#x27;s set, it&#x27;s set.</li>
            <li>This machine is well built, has good suction and very durable heads.</li>
            <li>Overall good buy for the price!</li>
            <li>Easy to use as well.</li>
            <li>it broke so easily before I even got to use it</li>
            <li>The case is also pretty nice with a combo lock (all be it easily</li>
            <li>It does work just fine if you want to use it at max.</li>
            <li>I used the machine and was happy enough with it</li>
            <li>It looks professional and good buy for the price</li>
            <li>MAKES MY SKINS FEEL SO SMOOTH AND CLEAN.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this delivered.</li>
            <li>I am really excited about seeing results as I use it more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving the product so far.</li>
            <li>Your skin just keeps looking better and better for several days.</li>
            <li>machine is well worth the money in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t seem to have a good vacuum, make sure all your connections are tight (hoses on good and tip screwed down all the way.)</li>
            <li>HOPEFULLY IT WILL WORK GREAT FOR A LONG TIME!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>The first day I got the machine, one of the clasps on box broke.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for in home use but, not professional because of the suction that&#x27;s required when you do microdermabrasion.  </li>
            <li>My glass suction pieces broke in shipping and the wholesaler shipped new ones right away for me.</li>
            <li>My suction works fine and according to my gauge seems to be pulling a vacuum of about 1 inch of mercury.</li>
            <li>therefore it does not come with very intuitive instructions.</li>
            <li>I really like this microdermabrasion machine.</li>
            <li>The box that it is built into is also very sturdy and well built.  </li>
            <li>The next day your makeup will go on so smooth.  </li>
            <li>and I thought I&#x27;d really use them.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this product a whole lot, but this product does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, my machine offered no way to for me to gauge how much suction I was getting.  </li>
            <li>But, even this wasn&#x27;t really sufficient to tell what suction I should use since the suction is stronger on the plumper skin of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You may want to purchase more of the little wand filters right away</li>
            <li>Other than that I love using it.</li>
            <li>After the first use your skin will feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>I have blemish-prone skin and this has helped so much to clear up old and new problems and is working fabulously to keep my skin clear!</li>
            <li>Price point is great compared to other less stury machines.</li>
            <li>Thanks Professional beauty.</li>
            <li>Its pretty much ready to go from when you open it.  </li>
            <li>The only issue I had when I first purchase was there was lack of information on how to use it.</li>
            <li>I have only used the machine a couple times, but so far it works very well.  </li>
            <li>This machine is comparable in results to any professional microderm I&#x27;ve had in a salon or med spa.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it once so far made my skin really soft</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the machine 4 times and already see a marked reduction in my pore size.  </li>
            <li>Not good, i have so many problem on this.</li>
            <li>It works and i recommend to have a professional use it, i actually bough this for my mother</li>

            <li> Keep in mind the gauge only works when the wand is actually on your skin pulling a vacuum.</li>
            <li> this product came with demarcations for gauging suction and the knob was actually tight enough to control the settings properly, I would give this machine high marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really love the machine but the directions were very poor.</li>
            <li> I EXPECTED THE ENCLOSED TIPS TO DULL QUICKLY</li>
            <li> The knob that controls the vacuum turns extremely loosely, making it hard to get the suction at the right</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t tell what setting it&#x27;s on because the gauge tends to float back and forth making it hard to tell what number you set it to 7,8, 9 and so forth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it about a month and have used it about a half dozen times so far and feel it has already paid for itself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since it&#x27;s impossible to tell what kind reverse pressure</li>
            <li> AND YET IT IS VERY QUIET COMPARED TO OTHER MACHINES.</li>
            <li> To see if they can find other machines for the same price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to air dry them and the water</li>
            <li> just doesn&#x27;t dry out from within the tube.  </li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> cause the knob is soo loose.</li>
            <li> I like this product overall, the only small problem is that the suction dial is difficult to set, sometimes the suction is too powerful, even though it&#x27;s set on the lowest.</li>
            <li> and if I try to turn it down a bit I lose all suction.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED A FEW</li>
            <li> I actually thought maybe the knob was broken.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I am using correctly, dont know what some of the items in kit are for.</li>
            <li> But now I&#x27;m not sure that I will.</li>
            <li> It exfoliates your skin and sucks away the dead cells.  </li>
            <li> But it really isn&#x27;t hard to figure out how to put it together and use it.  </li>
            <li> I learned this the hard way.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the 3 glass vaccumn attatchments were broken and the 3 extras filters were missing.</li>
            <li> And, yes, the instructions are vague.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry.</li>
            <li> Im disappointed</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> What a God-send this machine is. I have blemish-prone skin and this has helped so much to clear up old and new problems and is working fabulously to keep my skin clear! I&#x27;ve had it about a month and have used it about a half dozen times so far and feel it has already paid for itself. It is housed in a nice looking case that fits all the accessories with ease. Its helped me with regular breakouts, cystic acne, blackheads, and ingrown hairs. Even my color is more even. The amazing thing is it keeps working days after a treatment. Your skin just keeps looking better and better for several days. It even seems to be softening some acne scars. My suction works fine and according to my gauge seems to be pulling a vacuum of about 1 inch of mercury. Keep in mind the gauge only works when the wand is actually on your skin pulling a vacuum. If you don&#x27;t seem to have a good vacuum, make sure all your connections are tight (hoses on good and tip screwed down all the way.) My glass suction pieces broke in shipping and the wholesaler shipped new ones right away for me.</li>
            <li> The instructions do not include all the pieces that come with the machine and how it is used.  It also doesn&#x27;t tell you at which level to use on each part of the face and body.  Instructions for all this woud have been great.  Better to spend a bit more on the MicrodermMD machine which has wonderful instructions, smaller and lightweight.</li>
            <li> This machine is comparable in results to any professional microderm I&#x27;ve had in a salon or med spa.  It is also VERY easy and ituitive to use.Its pretty much ready to go from when you open it.  It makes my last machine seem like a toy in comparison.  Now if I can get my husband to quit using it, that would be great.  My only issue is that it comes with one filter installed and one replacement filter.  How can I get more???</li>
            <li> the only thing mine came with is sheet that say location of controls, cant use it dont know what goes where</li>
            <li> Love it!!! works great. Easy to use as well.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this machine I had used the advertised one and didnt like the idea that it had to have replacement heads often. This machine is well built, has good suction and very durable heads. Price point is great compared to other less stury machines.</li>
            <li> I am an RN and have kept my master esthetician license up to date. I used to do microdermabrasion all the time using diamond tip machine. The first day I got the machine, one of the clasps on box broke. I used the machine and was happy enough with it toi keep it, but it kind of stinks it broke so easily before I even got to use it</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this delivered. Iam a mobile spa owner so this is perfect for my needs. I tried it out and it works great. Couldnt be more happy with it. Thanks Professional beauty.</li>
            <li> I really love the machine but the directions were very poor. I am not sure I am using correctly, dont know what some of the items in kit are for. The hose has already split after 2 uses.</li>
            <li> I like this product overall, the only small problem is that the suction dial is difficult to set, sometimes the suction is too powerful, even though it&#x27;s set on the lowest. It looks professional and good buy for the price</li>
            <li> I give this a four star only because as stated it is for professionals therefore it does not come with very intuitive instructions. But you can look online to see how to better use it. The suctions works great. You may want to purchase more of the little wand filters right away it doesn&#x27;t come with many or i guess you could probably get away with sticking some cotton in there. I&#x27;ve tried it once so far made my skin really soft i put some hyaluronic acid on afterwards felt great. Overall good buy for the price!</li>
            <li> THIS PURCHASE WAS THAT ONE IN A MILLION PURCHASES, IT WAS BETTER THAN I WAS EXPECTING IT TO BE I HAVE USED A FEW DIFFERENT AT HOME MACHINES AS WELL AS PROFFESIONAL ONES I WAS BLOWN AWAY AT THE SUCTION AND YET IT IS VERY QUIET COMPARED TO OTHER MACHINES. I LOVE THE WAY THIS MACHINE IS IN A CASE AND COMES WITH LOTS OF ATATCHMENTS. I DID PURCHASE A FOREVER TI[P ON AMAZON TO USE WITH IT I EXPECTED THE ENCLOSED TIPS TO DULL QUICKLY SO I CANNOT COMMIT ON TIPS HOWEVER THEY SEEM WELL MADE. ALL IN ALL THIS WAS A STEAL HOPEFULLY IT WILL WORK GREAT FOR A LONG TIME!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The unit is solid and sturdy. I loved that it came with 3 wands and so many diamond tipped attachments. Unfortunately, the 3 glass vaccumn attatchments were broken and the 3 extras filters were missing. I could&#x27;ve loved without those and just replaced them on my own but, just as someone mentioned in an earlier review there is no way to gauge the suction cause the knob is soo loose. I actually thought maybe the knob was broken. I have to use the machine to max suction in order to use it and if I try to turn it down a bit I lose all suction. It does work just fine if you want to use it at max. For me tho this machine isn&#x27;t going to work. Im disappointed cause I really liked the locking case it came it.</li>
            <li> I really like this microdermabrasion machine. It is a very solid product. The box that it is built into is also very sturdy and well built.  It makes it very nice for transporting and storing.  All the attachments and pieces fit very nicely into the carry case.  I have only used the machine a couple times, but so far it works very well.  After the first use your skin will feel so soft.  The next day your makeup will go on so smooth.  I am really excited about seeing results as I use it more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My unit came with two spray bottles and I thought I&#x27;d really use them.  But now I&#x27;m not sure that I will. It&#x27;s just easier to apply a moisturizing toner with a cotton ball for me.  Maybe it would be nice to spritz the face with refreshing water, though.  However, I do like having the spray function to use after cleaning the attachment tubing.  I&#x27;ve tried to air dry them and the water just doesn&#x27;t dry out from within the tube.  So I attached it to the spray attachment on the machine and it blew air through the tubing and got all the water out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suction is very good on this machine.  And, yes, the instructions are vague. But it really isn&#x27;t hard to figure out how to put it together and use it.  You can also watch some youtube videos to get the idea of how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This machine is well worth the money in my opinion.  After searching around and finally purchasing this uit, I am very happy.</li>
            <li> It works and i recommend to have a professional use it, i actually bough this for my mother and she use it on her work place at the Spa.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS VERY NICE. NOT CHEAP..VERY STURDY. WORKS WELL.  MAKES MY SKINS FEEL SO SMOOTH AND CLEAN. EVERYTHING CAME ON TIME AND WAS IN GREAT SHAPE. ITS EVERYTHING THAT IT CLAIMS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the machine 4 times and already see a marked reduction in my pore size.  I understand that it will take time to achieve my desired results but I&#x27;m confident this product will get me there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for in home use but, not professional because of the suction that&#x27;s required when you do microdermabrasion.  You really can&#x27;t tell what setting it&#x27;s on because the gauge tends to float back and forth making it hard to tell what number you set it to 7,8, 9 and so forth. I&#x27;m use to a more stable gauge when it&#x27;s set, it&#x27;s set. I&#x27;m sorry. Just being honest. Lori</li>
            <li> Not good, i have so many problem on this. I rather buy the At Home Mircrodermabrasion.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product a whole lot, but this product does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  It exfoliates your skin and sucks away the dead cells.  The case is also pretty nice with a combo lock (all be it easily opened).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my machine offered no way to for me to gauge how much suction I was getting.  The knob that controls the vacuum turns extremely loosely, making it hard to get the suction at the right setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it&#x27;s impossible to tell what kind reverse pressure I&#x27;ll get unless the wand is on something, I had to test the suction on my hand before trying it on my face.  I learned this the hard way.  But, even this wasn&#x27;t really sufficient to tell what suction I should use since the suction is stronger on the plumper skin of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this product came with demarcations for gauging suction and the knob was actually tight enough to control the settings properly, I would give this machine high marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not \\&quot;not\\&quot; recommend this exfoliator, since it works, and I got it for a great price.  But I advise people to search around. To see if they can find other machines for the same price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving the product so far. The only issue I had when I first purchase was there was lack of information on how to use it. I had to spend extra time researching it. Other than that I love using it. I have really dry skin so using it twice a month.</li>
