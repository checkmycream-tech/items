            <li>From now on, I am happy to pay a bit more from Younique.</li>

            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>You DiD NOT receive authentic younique products!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>you get more on your eyelid then eyelashes, then since its waterproof it will not come off!</li>
            <li>Both of which are amazing</li>
            <li>By the end of my day my eyelashes still looked amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Not as good as Younique 3D mascara, but it works for the most part.</li>
            <li>I love them.my lashes have never looked so good.</li>
            <li>and it also didn&#x27;t turn flaky which was nice</li>
            <li>The lashes curled up nicely.</li>
            <li>To be honest I don&#x27;t notice a difference  </li>
            <li>I am a lover of beautiful, full eyelashes.</li>
            <li>This is a good product for thickening lashes more than it is for lengthening.</li>
            <li>which is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!!</li>
            <li>It was very easy to apply and i was thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>it makes it very easy to take it off at night.  </li>
            <li>I switched from Youniqe 3d fiber lash to this brand and am much more pleased!</li>
            <li>Pretty good!</li>
            <li>:) LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how easily it washes off as I am still wearing it and ain&#x27;t taking it offtil tonight!    </li>
            <li>Great product, exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>This is very important, you must have the 2 products work correctly together.</li>
            <li>Huge fan!</li>
            <li>I love how they made a lashes longer and fuller .</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d like this more.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product and it  clumps and comes in the most tacky, hideous silver snake skin case I have ever seen.</li>
            <li>It also works best if the fiber is applied to the ends of lashes only.</li>
            <li>I love the lashes.</li>
            <li>(I get mine from lashalert.com) are definitely the best.</li>
            <li>Younique&#x27;s are better because they don&#x27;t flake,</li>
            <li>I love that when I woke up the morning after using my eyes weren&#x27;t burning like with out products</li>
            <li>Fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I get some many compliments on my eyes now.</li>
            <li>Love 3D Mascara.</li>
            <li>These fiber lashes is a safe alternative for your lashes.</li>
            <li>that I have bought their mascara and love it.</li>
            <li>I love this and to me</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t miss out :)</li>
            <li>I love my lashes.</li>
            <li>a lot more flakier than the younique brand  </li>
            <li>I am quite pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Make sure to &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; the deal with mascara</li>
            <li>The tea fibers seem to be more sparce.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually comical.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Youniques 3D fiber lash mascara is way better.</li>
            <li>I love it,</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love</li>
            <li>i will be ordering some more as gifts for my friends...</li>
            <li>Nothing more than mascara</li>
            <li>I love love love it.</li>
            <li>You need to have time as you may need to apply many coats (4-5) to get the length you desire.</li>
            <li>I just think I&#x27;d feel better if someone would acknowledge my &amp;#34;longer lashes&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with lash factory</li>
            <li>I have had others that was better.</li>
            <li>Works ok in a pinch</li>

            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>It was ok</li>
            <li>Satisfied with the product</li>
            <li>Love this and makes my lashes look longer</li>
            <li>I get another one free!</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I will gladly pay more for Younique.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to put bought lashes on nor have I had the desire to do so.</li>
            <li>but you do get more volume and length.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>So start where you need the length the most, 1/2 way or 1/3 of the way from your eye lash line.</li>
            <li>It seems to work better.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>and I am beyond pleased.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li>I started with curling my lashes and then put on a light coat of my own mascara.  </li>
            <li>so it was more a learning curve than prosuct issue.    </li>
            <li>My eyes are not red or irritated and my lashes still look awesome.  </li>
            <li>Big Win with this product!</li>
            <li>They worked ok..</li>
            <li>apply just like the directions and you will love it....</li>
            <li>My lashes have never looked so full and sexy!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and works perfectly - just follow the simple instructions!</li>
            <li>These are pretty good.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see the results!</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my lashes about them being so full!</li>
            <li>This product came quickly, and works amazingly.</li>
            <li>i loved it so much i well be using it all the time as apart of my daly rutined* love</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this product and my great, long lashes!!</li>
            <li>This product was as expected and customer service is awesome.</li>
            <li>It makes my eyes look more open and beautiful.</li>
            <li>You are right!!</li>
            <li>Their delivery was super fast and their customer service is great as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>at first blush, I LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Lasts all day and washes off easy.</li>
            <li>It is really easy to apply and</li>
            <li>but the gel dries VERY quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to remove with make-up remover.</li>
            <li>I also like that it&#x27;s easy to build on -</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Love the ease of having long beautiful lashes without the hasssle of glue.</li>
            <li>Washes off easily when needed too.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are more full and voluminous.</li>
            <li>(What can I say I love full volume lashes)&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are so easy to apply, are comfortable and easy to take off.</li>
            <li>Product works fine.</li>
            <li>THE FIBERS ARE BLACK... AND WORK PERFECT!</li>
            <li>It is so easy to apply and it looks fabulous after application.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I have fine lashes and we were going to a  family wedding.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These really do make your lashes look better!</li>
            <li>As long as you use the gel coat before and after applying the fibers... you are good to go!  </li>
            <li>Maybe less elaborate packaging would make it more affordable, or maybe once you have the case it would be great to just buy the tubes by themselves.  </li>
            <li>but it plumps lashes nicely - didn&#x27;t notice much of a length improvement</li>
            <li>I really do enjoy these but one must take there time.......</li>
            <li>I enjoy using the 3D mascara.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>important to use an eyelash comb to avoid clumping.</li>
            <li>Cheap knock off of Younique 3D Fiber Lashes Mascara.</li>
            <li>It is EXTREMELY important to follow directions.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions (which were in English), and I had great results.</li>
            <li>I enjoy my 3 D lashes</li>
            <li>The tubes came in a clamshell like case which closes securely and the case was shrink wrap sealed</li>
            <li>Btw..it works wonderfully for half the price of Younique Fiber lashes!</li>
            <li>worth the prize me and my  teen age girls loved it!</li>
            <li>Application is quick and easy...</li>
            <li>It is super easy to use, and i am hooked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply and really does make your lashes appear longer.</li>
            <li>You have to be careful when applying so that none of the fibers get in your eyes, but I love love love this!</li>
            <li>Best mascara hands down!!</li>
            <li>When you follow the (very specific) instructions, this is an amazing product!</li>
            <li>I have also found, however that the original (younique 3d moodstruck mascara)</li>
            <li>Totally worth it tho!</li>
            <li>I wear it everyday and will buy more very soon, but this is not waterproof and if it were that would make them the best mascara of all time, so watch out if you cry.</li>
            <li>I bought this lash product and was pretty well satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>but then again shouldn&#x27;t products be eye friendly too?</li>
            <li>Worked exactly how i wanted them to :)</li>
            <li>as long as you read and follow the instructions and do one eye at a time it was great.</li>
            <li>I just tried for the first time and I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li>Pretty sure this was a knock off.</li>
            <li>Clumps on so much and doesn&#x27;t change my eye lashes any more than a cheap mascara would.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to apply, and gives you long, gorgeous eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li>but if you like your mascara full and lashes fanned out then this might not be for you because the mascara makes your lashes thicker and longer.</li>
            <li>The instructions are clear to do one eye at a time (your own mascara, gel, fibers, gel)</li>
            <li>My lashes are full and look fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;STEPS</li>
            <li>Love it - make sure you only apply to outer lashes otherwise your eyes get irritated.</li>
            <li>And yes some fibers always fall onto my face during the application but a quick brush off with my powder brush</li>
            <li>THE PACKAGE CAME QUICK... AND I&#x27;LL</li>
            <li>Just found my new fav!!!!</li>
            <li>It takes more time than using normal mascara</li>
            <li>I tried them the first time 2 months ago and signed up immediately, because I knew these were fantastic and here to stay.</li>
            <li>After 1 application my lashes were Neary twice as long and stayed looking gorgeous all day and night.</li>
            <li>I even curl my eyelashes AFTER everything is good and dry and have no problems.</li>
            <li>both used them and they were easy to use and our lashes really showed up in the pictures.</li>
            <li>I have short, stubby lashes, and the fiber lashes give me more volume &amp; length!</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertisement!</li>
            <li>That being said, my lashes are extremely fine and can&#x27;t hold much weight.</li>
            <li>Once you finish applying and you make sure no fibers are free floating, then your lashes last well for the rest of the day and stay in curled place.</li>
            <li>It does take some practice but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>should have known there is really nothing to really give you more lashes..</li>
            <li>Worth the money👍🏻</li>
            <li>Good product for the money spent.</li>
            <li>Great product takes a little but of practice to get it right.</li>
            <li>#34;I loved your eyes the other night.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply and makes a big difference!</li>
            <li>I have shorter/thinner lashes, so this really makes my lashes look full and lengthy.</li>
            <li>They last all day and washes off easy!</li>
            <li>Once I FINALLY got them all applied the way I liked, throughout the day my eyes were very irritated &amp; I kept getting stuff in them.</li>
            <li>This is not the most current product available for this particular mascara.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and looks natural.  </li>
            <li>it may take a few times to practice how to properly apply the fibers, but once you learn how to use it, your lashes will look awesome!!</li>
            <li>I keep a safety pin in the case to separate lashes on rare occasions to provide a natural and clean finish.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product will buy again when I run out definitely.</li>
            <li>I was using Younnique, however these 3D Fibers do the exact same thing for a much better price.</li>
            <li>Spend the $40 and get what really works!</li>
            <li>Other than that, LOVE it!</li>
            <li>Problems at first</li>
            <li>i love having big lashes and this fiber mascara does that!!!</li>
            <li>Much easier to use than I thought!  </li>
            <li>- but - personally - I THINK they look lovely</li>
            <li>I most likely never will.</li>
            <li>Get the REAL 3D Fiber Lashes from a Younique Presenter!  </li>
            <li>She says it does exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li>I purchased it for gifts for several people and they love it as well.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>Also authentic younique is only sold by reps not on Amazon, eBay, ect.</li>
            <li>I tried the Younique product first.</li>
            <li>Another personal preference is, you can do the same steps to the top of your lashes so that they are sealed top and bottom.</li>
            <li>I have naturally very short and brittle lashes and most mascaras not exfoliate my lashes to the extent I would prefer.</li>
            <li>but first try . . .</li>
            <li>So then the first 45min your picking fibers out of your eye, or you cant see period.</li>
            <li>Today was the first day that I&#x27;ve used it...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried the other kind</li>
            <li>The first thing you do is use your favorite mascara first and let dry.</li>
            <li>I can definitely see the difference in how much fuller my lashes look, more so than any volumnizing mascara I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Great product I do recommend a eyelash comb because it&#x27;s thick and gets very globalized without a comb</li>
            <li>There are a couple other generics I saw that seem like they might be more worth trying.</li>
            <li>Lasts pretty much all day.</li>
            <li>If you have pretty straight lashes like I do don&#x27;t expect this product to change that.</li>
            <li>but this one just doesn&#x27;t do pretty much anything</li>
            <li>But Heather the amazon rep made my return simply and easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to remove with regular eye-makeup remover.</li>
            <li>(1) Make sure your mascara is dry.</li>
            <li>The 3D lashes came off easily at the end of the night with my regular Neutrogena makeup remover wipes.  </li>
            <li>I still prefer Youniques Moodstruck 3D Fiber Lashes because their product lengthens much more, but this a decent off brand if you already have long lashes and are looking for something to accentuate the lashes you already have.</li>
            <li>And finally, when removing the mascara in the shower, it comes off in huge flakes that fall into the eyes.</li>
            <li>As someone with the worlds shortest eyelashes I definitely noticed a huge improvement with 3d fiber lashes.</li>
            <li>It is okay, but nothing I expected.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>so I had to get something fast as I am going out of town and</li>
            <li>Very time consuming, sheds onto your face.  </li>
            <li>They do get much longer eyelash effect</li>
            <li>Just clumps together, don&#x27;t see much of a difference</li>
            <li>Really like it.  </li>
            <li>The tube indicated as A was really B and vice versa.  </li>
            <li>and then fiber  4-5 times can take up too much time.</li>
            <li>This mascara really works.  </li>
            <li>My eyes where also really itchy.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real.</li>
            <li>Not the real Younique, but reasonable.</li>
            <li>The fiber tube doesn&#x27;t have much in it at all.</li>
            <li>After 2 applications ( the second one lightly)</li>
            <li>I have very blond hair</li>
            <li>also, doesn&#x27;t really add much length.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>&quot; while I was getting him ready for school.    </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for my lashes.</li>
            <li>The only thing I will most likely do in the future is get a good eyelash comb, my first eye was a little more \\&quot;clumpy\\&quot; than the second but</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the other Younique ladies were being rude in their responses, I think they may have felt that you really get what you pay for, and wanted you to have the best product and service.</li>
            <li>It is a simple process and is well worth it!</li>
            <li>Works better than other fiber mascaras that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I may LOVE it due to</li>
            <li>The formula was updated many months ago and no purchases of Younique products made from anyone other than a Younique presenter is valid.</li>
            <li>I had used a different brand of the fiber lashes and was satisfied with my first order but didn&#x27;t like the second order I received.  </li>
            <li>You do NOT have to put on a coat of your own mascara first, it is personal choice, our mascara &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; (wet) can be used as mascara any time without the fibers.</li>
            <li>really give me a full look compared to regular mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>cheaper seems to be emptier/ less product inside only good for fewer application than younique</li>
            <li>It is good for a few weeks before the mascara begins to get much thicker which results in a less full look.</li>
            <li>Flake free long lashes...</li>
            <li>The fibers are not as generously supplied as I had hoped, but it is better than average mascara.</li>
            <li>The gel should be put on just like you would a nice coat of mascara, and if you need to use a comb to separate your lashes to get the full dramatic look, I suggest you use a &amp;#34;metal&amp;#34; eye lash/</li>
            <li>It arrived very quick and as expected from description.</li>
            <li>I love a different brand and thought this would be a cheaper version of the same thing.  </li>
            <li>If both companies would ditch the hard case, they&#x27;d sell more!</li>
            <li>My girlfriend absolutely loves it, and now there isn&#x27;t a bunch of fake eye lashes lying around my apartment, worked great for both of us</li>
            <li>Save your money and spend it with a true Younique presenter who will ensure that you receive a NEW, current and unaltered product.</li>
            <li>If you follow the directions, you will have thick, very long beautiful lashes.  </li>
            <li>Long lush lashes Easy Removal.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>I got this a little uncertain and no need I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>dry, clean</li>
            <li>Tedious application but looks great</li>
            <li>Considering I have only been using this product for 7 days, there really wasn&#x27;t that much practice!</li>
            <li>Went from none to full and long.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve never bought the younique brand, but if they all work like this then I&#x27;ll just stick to my normal one tube mascara.</li>
            <li>Applied one coat of transplanting gel on one eye (did not use any of my normal mascara).&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>I do not use soap/water normally</li>
            <li>I highly recommend if you want super long lashes!</li>
            <li>The color is just right, so it last.</li>
            <li>Sharing a picture of the 3D fibers on left versus right eye without the 3D lash applied.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t full dry flakes, it was like the dust of them or something that kept getting into my eyes.</li>
            <li>I usually apply it twice with my normal mascara (Mary Kay Lash Love).</li>
            <li>Places it so it would blow my lashes up and gave them a quick blow dry.</li>
            <li>Super long lashes!!</li>
            <li>Two other store bought mascaras that are similar to this have worked better for me.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>my lashes were long and lush, not clumpy and very pretty.</li>
            <li>After applying 2 coats my lashes are still soft.!  </li>
            <li>Looked almost exactly the same as when I went to bed</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t dry out through the day, dries quickly so it doesn&#x27;t smudge, and it is completely mineral.</li>
            <li>The gel step of this product was very gloopy and hard to apply smoothly.</li>
            <li>This product lengthens your lashes - making them look natural.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin .</li>
            <li>So far i like it.</li>
            <li>I would rather pay $20 extra for the real deal</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product.  </li>
            <li>I am a complete noob at makeup and these were 10 times easier than applying falsies for me.</li>
            <li>Spend the extra $ and get the real stuff.</li>
            <li>When I really want to look prettier and younger I use my 3D Fiber Lashes.</li>
            <li>Bought for my 15yr old daughter.</li>
            <li>At 78 I may be too old to pull off the FAB LASHES.</li>
            <li>I loved it, but it was expensive.</li>
            <li>I normally have short, straight eyelashes and traditional mascara</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a typical user.</li>
            <li>It is fabulous, but a little on the flaky side after it&#x27;s on a couple of hours!</li>
            <li>Younique&#x27;s 3D Fiberlash Mascara is AMAZING but purchasing from this seller is not going to get you a new product, unfortunately.</li>
            <li>These are no better than a cheap mascara.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something like that, which I assume most buyers on here are, this is not a good alternative.</li>
            <li>I saw before my very eyes my lashes transform from skimpy to long, and fuller.</li>
            <li>I also got a little of the fiber in my eyes which is challenging after you&#x27;ve already spent time applying your eye make-up.</li>
            <li>The product goes on quickly and easily with very little (usually none) fallout.  </li>
            <li>Younique released a metal comb as part of it&#x27;s new fall product line last week.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, it kind of flakes a lot which is very painful.</li>
            <li>Your tips for them was a major help.</li>
            <li>Last but not least it reasonably priced and long lasting.</li>
            <li>has only gone so far.  </li>
            <li>I actually fell asleep without removing this product and it was completely in place when I woke in the morning.</li>
            <li>You can barely see it on your eyes.</li>
            <li>My 7 yr old son actually said \\&quot;I like your eyelashes\\</li>
            <li>The instructions were clear and in English with a website for further information (which I have yet to look at)    </li>
            <li>It is irritating to pick the flakes off your makeup which then causes me to apply more makeup oppose to not having to do so prior to this purchase.</li>
            <li>Wish it worked a little better over all I can tell a little difference between just my regular mascara and th fiber mascara.</li>
            <li>you can go for a general look, or build on the product to go for a totally glamorous look!  </li>
            <li>Seeing how this version of 3D lashes was half as much as Younique, I ordered it.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really want to since this costs 1/3 less.  </li>
            <li>think it will take a few practice runs to get them exactly like I want them, but overall, I like a lot!</li>
            <li>y&#x27;all had a bad experience but urge you to please order directly from a younique rep even if it&#x27;s no me and try the authentic product!</li>
            <li>Pieces do fall down a little thru the day but not bad.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Beautiful package!  </li>

            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> You DiD NOT receive authentic younique products!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> you get more on your eyelid then eyelashes, then since its waterproof it will not come off!</li>
            <li> Both of which are amazing</li>
            <li> By the end of my day my eyelashes still looked amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Younique 3D mascara, but it works for the most part.</li>
            <li> I love them.my lashes have never looked so good.</li>
            <li> and it also didn&#x27;t turn flaky which was nice</li>
            <li> The lashes curled up nicely.</li>
            <li> To be honest I don&#x27;t notice a difference  </li>
            <li> I am a lover of beautiful, full eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for thickening lashes more than it is for lengthening.</li>
            <li> which is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!</li>
            <li> It was very easy to apply and i was thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> it makes it very easy to take it off at night.  </li>
            <li> I switched from Youniqe 3d fiber lash to this brand and am much more pleased!</li>
            <li> Pretty good!</li>
            <li> :) LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how easily it washes off as I am still wearing it and ain&#x27;t taking it offtil tonight!    </li>
            <li> Great product, exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> This is very important, you must have the 2 products work correctly together.</li>
            <li> Huge fan!</li>
            <li> I love how they made a lashes longer and fuller .</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d like this more.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and it  clumps and comes in the most tacky, hideous silver snake skin case I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> It also works best if the fiber is applied to the ends of lashes only.</li>
            <li> I love the lashes.</li>
            <li> (I get mine from lashalert.com) are definitely the best.</li>
            <li> Younique&#x27;s are better because they don&#x27;t flake,</li>
            <li> I love that when I woke up the morning after using my eyes weren&#x27;t burning like with out products</li>
            <li> Fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I get some many compliments on my eyes now.</li>
            <li> Love 3D Mascara.</li>
            <li> These fiber lashes is a safe alternative for your lashes.</li>
            <li> that I have bought their mascara and love it.</li>
            <li> I love this and to me</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t miss out :)</li>
            <li> I love my lashes.</li>
            <li> a lot more flakier than the younique brand  </li>
            <li> I am quite pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Make sure to &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; the deal with mascara</li>
            <li> The tea fibers seem to be more sparce.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually comical.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> Youniques 3D fiber lash mascara is way better.</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m in love</li>
            <li> i will be ordering some more as gifts for my friends...</li>
            <li> Nothing more than mascara</li>
            <li> I love love love it.</li>
            <li> You need to have time as you may need to apply many coats (4-5) to get the length you desire.</li>
            <li> I just think I&#x27;d feel better if someone would acknowledge my &amp;#34;longer lashes&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with lash factory</li>
            <li> I have had others that was better.</li>
            <li> Works ok in a pinch</li>

            <li> Just received my shipment and am extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> One more application of fibers and gel to seal.</li>
            <li> love it</li>

            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> It was ok</li>
            <li> Satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> Love this and makes my lashes look longer</li>
            <li> I get another one free!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I will gladly pay more for Younique.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to put bought lashes on nor have I had the desire to do so.</li>
            <li> but you do get more volume and length.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> So start where you need the length the most, 1/2 way or 1/3 of the way from your eye lash line.</li>
            <li> It seems to work better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> and I am beyond pleased.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li> I started with curling my lashes and then put on a light coat of my own mascara.  </li>
            <li> so it was more a learning curve than prosuct issue.    </li>
            <li> My eyes are not red or irritated and my lashes still look awesome.  </li>
            <li> Big Win with this product!</li>
            <li> They worked ok..</li>
            <li> apply just like the directions and you will love it....</li>
            <li> My lashes have never looked so full and sexy!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works perfectly - just follow the simple instructions!</li>
            <li> These are pretty good.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see the results!</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my lashes about them being so full!</li>
            <li> This product came quickly, and works amazingly.</li>
            <li> i loved it so much i well be using it all the time as apart of my daly rutined* love</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product and my great, long lashes!!</li>
            <li> This product was as expected and customer service is awesome.</li>
            <li> It makes my eyes look more open and beautiful.</li>
            <li> You are right!!</li>
            <li> Their delivery was super fast and their customer service is great as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> at first blush, I LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Lasts all day and washes off easy.</li>
            <li> It is really easy to apply and</li>
            <li> but the gel dries VERY quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to remove with make-up remover.</li>
            <li> I also like that it&#x27;s easy to build on -</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love the ease of having long beautiful lashes without the hasssle of glue.</li>
            <li> Washes off easily when needed too.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are more full and voluminous.</li>
            <li> (What can I say I love full volume lashes)&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are so easy to apply, are comfortable and easy to take off.</li>
            <li> Product works fine.</li>
            <li> THE FIBERS ARE BLACK... AND WORK PERFECT!</li>
            <li> It is so easy to apply and it looks fabulous after application.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have fine lashes and we were going to a  family wedding.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These really do make your lashes look better!</li>
            <li> As long as you use the gel coat before and after applying the fibers... you are good to go!  </li>
            <li> Maybe less elaborate packaging would make it more affordable, or maybe once you have the case it would be great to just buy the tubes by themselves.  </li>
            <li> but it plumps lashes nicely - didn&#x27;t notice much of a length improvement</li>
            <li> I really do enjoy these but one must take there time.......</li>
            <li> I enjoy using the 3D mascara.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> important to use an eyelash comb to avoid clumping.</li>
            <li> Cheap knock off of Younique 3D Fiber Lashes Mascara.</li>
            <li> It is EXTREMELY important to follow directions.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions (which were in English), and I had great results.</li>
            <li> I enjoy my 3 D lashes</li>
            <li> The tubes came in a clamshell like case which closes securely and the case was shrink wrap sealed</li>
            <li> Btw..it works wonderfully for half the price of Younique Fiber lashes!</li>
            <li> worth the prize me and my  teen age girls loved it!</li>
            <li> Application is quick and easy...</li>
            <li> It is super easy to use, and i am hooked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to apply and really does make your lashes appear longer.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful when applying so that none of the fibers get in your eyes, but I love love love this!</li>
            <li> Best mascara hands down!!</li>
            <li> When you follow the (very specific) instructions, this is an amazing product!</li>
            <li> I have also found, however that the original (younique 3d moodstruck mascara)</li>
            <li> Totally worth it tho!</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday and will buy more very soon, but this is not waterproof and if it were that would make them the best mascara of all time, so watch out if you cry.</li>
            <li> I bought this lash product and was pretty well satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> but then again shouldn&#x27;t products be eye friendly too?</li>
            <li> Worked exactly how i wanted them to :)</li>
            <li> as long as you read and follow the instructions and do one eye at a time it was great.</li>
            <li> I just tried for the first time and I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> Pretty sure this was a knock off.</li>
            <li> Clumps on so much and doesn&#x27;t change my eye lashes any more than a cheap mascara would.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to apply, and gives you long, gorgeous eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li> but if you like your mascara full and lashes fanned out then this might not be for you because the mascara makes your lashes thicker and longer.</li>
            <li> The instructions are clear to do one eye at a time (your own mascara, gel, fibers, gel)</li>
            <li> My lashes are full and look fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;STEPS</li>
            <li> Love it - make sure you only apply to outer lashes otherwise your eyes get irritated.</li>
            <li> And yes some fibers always fall onto my face during the application but a quick brush off with my powder brush</li>
            <li> THE PACKAGE CAME QUICK... AND I&#x27;LL</li>
            <li> Just found my new fav!!!!</li>
            <li> It takes more time than using normal mascara</li>
            <li> I tried them the first time 2 months ago and signed up immediately, because I knew these were fantastic and here to stay.</li>
            <li> After 1 application my lashes were Neary twice as long and stayed looking gorgeous all day and night.</li>
            <li> I even curl my eyelashes AFTER everything is good and dry and have no problems.</li>
            <li> both used them and they were easy to use and our lashes really showed up in the pictures.</li>
            <li> I have short, stubby lashes, and the fiber lashes give me more volume &amp; length!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertisement!</li>
            <li> That being said, my lashes are extremely fine and can&#x27;t hold much weight.</li>
            <li> Once you finish applying and you make sure no fibers are free floating, then your lashes last well for the rest of the day and stay in curled place.</li>
            <li> It does take some practice but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> should have known there is really nothing to really give you more lashes..</li>
            <li> Worth the money👍🏻</li>
            <li> Good product for the money spent.</li>
            <li> Great product takes a little but of practice to get it right.</li>
            <li> #34;I loved your eyes the other night.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply and makes a big difference!</li>
            <li> I have shorter/thinner lashes, so this really makes my lashes look full and lengthy.</li>
            <li> They last all day and washes off easy!</li>
            <li> Once I FINALLY got them all applied the way I liked, throughout the day my eyes were very irritated &amp; I kept getting stuff in them.</li>
            <li> This is not the most current product available for this particular mascara.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and looks natural.  </li>
            <li> it may take a few times to practice how to properly apply the fibers, but once you learn how to use it, your lashes will look awesome!!</li>
            <li> I keep a safety pin in the case to separate lashes on rare occasions to provide a natural and clean finish.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product will buy again when I run out definitely.</li>
            <li> I was using Younnique, however these 3D Fibers do the exact same thing for a much better price.</li>
            <li> Spend the $40 and get what really works!</li>
            <li> Other than that, LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Problems at first</li>
            <li> i love having big lashes and this fiber mascara does that!!!</li>
            <li> Much easier to use than I thought!  </li>
            <li> - but - personally - I THINK they look lovely</li>
            <li> I most likely never will.</li>
            <li> Get the REAL 3D Fiber Lashes from a Younique Presenter!  </li>
            <li> She says it does exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for gifts for several people and they love it as well.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> Also authentic younique is only sold by reps not on Amazon, eBay, ect.</li>
            <li> I tried the Younique product first.</li>
            <li> Another personal preference is, you can do the same steps to the top of your lashes so that they are sealed top and bottom.</li>
            <li> I have naturally very short and brittle lashes and most mascaras not exfoliate my lashes to the extent I would prefer.</li>
            <li> but first try . . .</li>
            <li> So then the first 45min your picking fibers out of your eye, or you cant see period.</li>
            <li> Today was the first day that I&#x27;ve used it...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried the other kind</li>
            <li> The first thing you do is use your favorite mascara first and let dry.</li>
            <li> I can definitely see the difference in how much fuller my lashes look, more so than any volumnizing mascara I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Great product I do recommend a eyelash comb because it&#x27;s thick and gets very globalized without a comb</li>
            <li> There are a couple other generics I saw that seem like they might be more worth trying.</li>
            <li> Lasts pretty much all day.</li>
            <li> If you have pretty straight lashes like I do don&#x27;t expect this product to change that.</li>
            <li> but this one just doesn&#x27;t do pretty much anything</li>
            <li> But Heather the amazon rep made my return simply and easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to remove with regular eye-makeup remover.</li>
            <li> (1) Make sure your mascara is dry.</li>
            <li> The 3D lashes came off easily at the end of the night with my regular Neutrogena makeup remover wipes.  </li>
            <li> I still prefer Youniques Moodstruck 3D Fiber Lashes because their product lengthens much more, but this a decent off brand if you already have long lashes and are looking for something to accentuate the lashes you already have.</li>
            <li> And finally, when removing the mascara in the shower, it comes off in huge flakes that fall into the eyes.</li>
            <li> As someone with the worlds shortest eyelashes I definitely noticed a huge improvement with 3d fiber lashes.</li>
            <li> It is okay, but nothing I expected.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> so I had to get something fast as I am going out of town and</li>
            <li> Very time consuming, sheds onto your face.  </li>
            <li> They do get much longer eyelash effect</li>
            <li> Just clumps together, don&#x27;t see much of a difference</li>
            <li> Really like it.  </li>
            <li> The tube indicated as A was really B and vice versa.  </li>
            <li> and then fiber  4-5 times can take up too much time.</li>
            <li> This mascara really works.  </li>
            <li> My eyes where also really itchy.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real.</li>
            <li> Not the real Younique, but reasonable.</li>
            <li> The fiber tube doesn&#x27;t have much in it at all.</li>
            <li> After 2 applications ( the second one lightly)</li>
            <li> I have very blond hair</li>
            <li> also, doesn&#x27;t really add much length.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> &quot; while I was getting him ready for school.    </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my lashes.</li>
            <li> The only thing I will most likely do in the future is get a good eyelash comb, my first eye was a little more \\&quot;clumpy\\&quot; than the second but</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the other Younique ladies were being rude in their responses, I think they may have felt that you really get what you pay for, and wanted you to have the best product and service.</li>
            <li> It is a simple process and is well worth it!</li>
            <li> Works better than other fiber mascaras that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I may LOVE it due to</li>
            <li> The formula was updated many months ago and no purchases of Younique products made from anyone other than a Younique presenter is valid.</li>
            <li> I had used a different brand of the fiber lashes and was satisfied with my first order but didn&#x27;t like the second order I received.  </li>
            <li> You do NOT have to put on a coat of your own mascara first, it is personal choice, our mascara &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; (wet) can be used as mascara any time without the fibers.</li>
            <li> really give me a full look compared to regular mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> cheaper seems to be emptier/ less product inside only good for fewer application than younique</li>
            <li> It is good for a few weeks before the mascara begins to get much thicker which results in a less full look.</li>
            <li> Flake free long lashes...</li>
            <li> The fibers are not as generously supplied as I had hoped, but it is better than average mascara.</li>
            <li> The gel should be put on just like you would a nice coat of mascara, and if you need to use a comb to separate your lashes to get the full dramatic look, I suggest you use a &amp;#34;metal&amp;#34; eye lash/</li>
            <li> It arrived very quick and as expected from description.</li>
            <li> I love a different brand and thought this would be a cheaper version of the same thing.  </li>
            <li> If both companies would ditch the hard case, they&#x27;d sell more!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend absolutely loves it, and now there isn&#x27;t a bunch of fake eye lashes lying around my apartment, worked great for both of us</li>
            <li> Save your money and spend it with a true Younique presenter who will ensure that you receive a NEW, current and unaltered product.</li>
            <li> If you follow the directions, you will have thick, very long beautiful lashes.  </li>
            <li> Long lush lashes Easy Removal.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I got this a little uncertain and no need I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> dry, clean</li>
            <li> Tedious application but looks great</li>
            <li> Considering I have only been using this product for 7 days, there really wasn&#x27;t that much practice!</li>
            <li> Went from none to full and long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never bought the younique brand, but if they all work like this then I&#x27;ll just stick to my normal one tube mascara.</li>
            <li> Applied one coat of transplanting gel on one eye (did not use any of my normal mascara).&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I do not use soap/water normally</li>
            <li> I highly recommend if you want super long lashes!</li>
            <li> The color is just right, so it last.</li>
            <li> Sharing a picture of the 3D fibers on left versus right eye without the 3D lash applied.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t full dry flakes, it was like the dust of them or something that kept getting into my eyes.</li>
            <li> I usually apply it twice with my normal mascara (Mary Kay Lash Love).</li>
            <li> Places it so it would blow my lashes up and gave them a quick blow dry.</li>
            <li> Super long lashes!!</li>
            <li> Two other store bought mascaras that are similar to this have worked better for me.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> my lashes were long and lush, not clumpy and very pretty.</li>
            <li> After applying 2 coats my lashes are still soft.!  </li>
            <li> Looked almost exactly the same as when I went to bed</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t dry out through the day, dries quickly so it doesn&#x27;t smudge, and it is completely mineral.</li>
            <li> The gel step of this product was very gloopy and hard to apply smoothly.</li>
            <li> This product lengthens your lashes - making them look natural.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin .</li>
            <li> So far i like it.</li>
            <li> I would rather pay $20 extra for the real deal</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product.  </li>
            <li> I am a complete noob at makeup and these were 10 times easier than applying falsies for me.</li>
            <li> Spend the extra $ and get the real stuff.</li>
            <li> When I really want to look prettier and younger I use my 3D Fiber Lashes.</li>
            <li> Bought for my 15yr old daughter.</li>
            <li> At 78 I may be too old to pull off the FAB LASHES.</li>
            <li> I loved it, but it was expensive.</li>
            <li> I normally have short, straight eyelashes and traditional mascara</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a typical user.</li>
            <li> It is fabulous, but a little on the flaky side after it&#x27;s on a couple of hours!</li>
            <li> Younique&#x27;s 3D Fiberlash Mascara is AMAZING but purchasing from this seller is not going to get you a new product, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> These are no better than a cheap mascara.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something like that, which I assume most buyers on here are, this is not a good alternative.</li>
            <li> I saw before my very eyes my lashes transform from skimpy to long, and fuller.</li>
            <li> I also got a little of the fiber in my eyes which is challenging after you&#x27;ve already spent time applying your eye make-up.</li>
            <li> The product goes on quickly and easily with very little (usually none) fallout.  </li>
            <li> Younique released a metal comb as part of it&#x27;s new fall product line last week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, it kind of flakes a lot which is very painful.</li>
            <li> Your tips for them was a major help.</li>
            <li> Last but not least it reasonably priced and long lasting.</li>
            <li> has only gone so far.  </li>
            <li> I actually fell asleep without removing this product and it was completely in place when I woke in the morning.</li>
            <li> You can barely see it on your eyes.</li>
            <li> My 7 yr old son actually said \\&quot;I like your eyelashes\\</li>
            <li> The instructions were clear and in English with a website for further information (which I have yet to look at)    </li>
            <li> It is irritating to pick the flakes off your makeup which then causes me to apply more makeup oppose to not having to do so prior to this purchase.</li>
            <li> Wish it worked a little better over all I can tell a little difference between just my regular mascara and th fiber mascara.</li>
            <li> you can go for a general look, or build on the product to go for a totally glamorous look!  </li>
            <li> Seeing how this version of 3D lashes was half as much as Younique, I ordered it.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really want to since this costs 1/3 less.  </li>
            <li> think it will take a few practice runs to get them exactly like I want them, but overall, I like a lot!</li>
            <li> y&#x27;all had a bad experience but urge you to please order directly from a younique rep even if it&#x27;s no me and try the authentic product!</li>
            <li> Pieces do fall down a little thru the day but not bad.</li>
            <li> I use it every day to make my casual look a bit more dressy.</li>
            <li> I wanted to see if it would be something easy to use since I do NOT enjoy applying makeup and usually go without (even though my teeny tiny lashes think I should always wear mascara).    </li>
            <li> It irritated my eyes and was very hard to clean off.</li>
            <li> I will update the review if I have any further experience (negative or positive) but for now it gets 5 stars from me.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting wear.  </li>
            <li> I feel like one order doesn&#x27;t last long though.</li>
            <li> There is nothing necessarily bad about it, it just doesn&#x27;t really do anything more than any other mascara.</li>
            <li> It seems a little dry and hard to get on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Not enough fibers  and very dry.</li>
            <li> Made my lashes sticky and clumpy all day long.</li>
            <li> and it made them look so long.</li>
            <li> Only one eye at a time, you apply the gel and while wet put on the fiber lash.</li>
            <li> It is up to you how long you want your lashes.</li>
            <li> I never had long lashes...</li>
            <li> this stuff makes your lashes look so long like they are miles long!</li>
            <li> Tried this brand because it was a little less expensive, and I&#x27;m highly pleased!</li>
            <li> With that said you have to be fast which is very messy!</li>
            <li> Makes mine a mile long!</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look really long!</li>
            <li> I get complimets all the time how long they look!</li>
            <li> After applying the gel, I would apply the fibers (dry) just to the tips of my lashes followed by a finishing coat of gel to hold fibers and this would create length and prevent any fibers from getting into my eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same as the Yonique, don&#x27;t waste your money on this and buy the actual stuff.</li>
            <li> I mean, there&#x27;s a very strong stale sulfur smell that comes from it when you&#x27;re applying it.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this product to see if it works the same as Younique Lushious Lashes as it&#x27;s half the price.</li>
            <li> but I was looking for something in brown or brownish black as I am blonde</li>
            <li> I bought this product in hopes that I could get the same volume and thickness as using the Younique fiber lashes (I just wanted to spend less money).</li>
            <li> If you just cake on your regular mascara with small clumps you will gain the same look.</li>
            <li> These left black circles under my eyes--&amp;#34;raccoon&amp;#34; eyes.</li>
            <li> When your lashes are wet you THEN apply the fibers (dry).</li>
            <li> but I won&#x27;t subject you to my big \\&quot;eye\\</li>
            <li> Gel seemed very dry</li>
            <li> (I ONLY put on the mascara/lashes not full eye makeup).  </li>
            <li> I did irritate my eyes a little if I didn&#x27;t apply enough of the gel.</li>
            <li> I have to keep checking to see if there&#x27;s anything under my eyes, even though I only put on a little at a time, like the instructions say.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same as the other 3D Fiber Lashes that I&#x27;ve bought from typical distributors.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything bad about it :)</li>
            <li> it does not really require a &amp;#34;redo&amp;#34; during the day.</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions carefully for maximum volume and length of your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Again, not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> I have very sparse and thin lashes and</li>
            <li> eye brow comb while your lashes are wet.</li>
            <li> Kinda messy but definitely does what it says.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a thick coat of fibers, and you won&#x27;t really see them going on because they are so small, but they will be adhering to your wet gel.</li>
            <li> A little common sense and careful application of the product provides glamours natural looking lashes.  </li>
            <li> I usually use Sheer Coverage or Younique.</li>
            <li> I have ZERO connection to younique as a company other than</li>
            <li> This one is no better than a regular cover girl mascara.</li>
            <li> Such a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I have not tried any other fiber lash product</li>
            <li> Big waste of money!</li>
            <li> This is a cheaper alternative to the other brand name 3d fiber lash mascara that other people are talking about.  </li>
            <li> plus its less expensive making looking fabulous a little cheaper!</li>
            <li> Also,  I noticed they also flaked off and left little flakes under your eyes after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> Made my lashes look all clumped together and cause imitation of it gets too close to waterline.</li>
            <li> for my first try, it was not that bad and my regular mascara has done this on occasion</li>
            <li> Mine has not been flaky or a mess in any other way.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it flakes</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Non irritating to my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I think the fiber wand had dried up... Not much length when applied,</li>
            <li> You should NOT put the fibers (dry) on starting at your eye lash line, as some of you may find this irritating to you eye.</li>
            <li> So both an up and a down to it.</li>
            <li> It does take some practice to get your technique down, so you don&#x27;t get that clumpy look.</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t fall down on your cheeks or in your eyes, and what gives you your length.</li>
            <li> Then, seal with another gel and repeat on the other eye!</li>
            <li> I wish it came in black/brown as well as black.</li>
            <li> and so the black is a little dark for me.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was that it stinks.</li>
            <li> I makes my eyelashes long and thick.  </li>
            <li> Thick and well, not natural looking.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look so thick and long!  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money!</li>
            <li> a little after you put it on.</li>
            <li> Then I wanted a little curl</li>
            <li> I have found that my eyes get a little irritated at the end of the day while wearing this</li>
            <li> It goes on a little clumpy</li>
            <li> just it burns a little if you miss and put it to close to eyelid</li>
            <li> The little fibers are messy and fall into the eye.</li>
            <li> I had serious issue with keeping the dry flakes out of my eyes while applying them.</li>
            <li> this was a waste of my time, money and energy.</li>
            <li> but you save a few dollars.</li>
            <li> I wear this product everyday.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I had no idea until I went into the bathroom a few hours after I got to work.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste $20.</li>
            <li> messy, a lot of time &amp;</li>
            <li> Both tubed totally dried up.</li>
            <li> Was dried out when I got it.</li>
            <li> but I noticed that there is small black stuff that falls off the fiber lashes and it looks like its smudged under the eye area.</li>
            <li> This is not easy to apply and the fibers fall into the eyes.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is just too much work, and it&#x27;s very difficult to not look like Tammy Faye Baker with spidery , clumpy lashes.</li>
            <li> I wear eyeliner and mascara every day but this stuff did not stop irritating my eyes all day long.</li>
            <li> I have very small eyes and tired of people asking me if I got enough sleep.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous after reading some of the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about this product however after a month of use I am still very disappointed.</li>
            <li> No I was not satisfied at al with this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an amateur ballroom dancer.</li>
            <li> it can&#x27;t get no better then this .ðŸ˜šðŸ˜š</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Even now I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m doing it correctly</li>
            <li> I usually wear one or two coats depending on where my day is going to take me.</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;m keeping it - have to give it another try</li>
            <li> I usually just use the gel .</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t waste my money!</li>
            <li> Not better than drug store mascara</li>
            <li> Extremely eye irritating if it happens to get in your eye.</li>
            <li> I have small thin lashes due to a illness , but when I applied the 3D LASH FIBER THEY EXTENDED DRAMATICALLY!!!</li>
            <li> I do not  need to reapply it; it lasts all day (or at least 17 hours).  </li>
            <li> A waste of money!!</li>
            <li> Nope, hated it, had flakes of fiber in my eyes from the first use.</li>
            <li> This one was actually less expensive too.  </li>
            <li> I tried the product from Lash Factory since it was less expensive.</li>
            <li> Not good at all.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t make my lashes all hard and clumpy!  </li>
            <li> never thought I could have this much volume without fake lashes!!!</li>
            <li> THE ABSOLUTE WORST MASCARA EVER....</li>
            <li> Has a irritating chemical in it.</li>
            <li> I think my lashes are just too thin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the beauty of false eyelashes without the hassle.</li>
            <li> I tried false eye lashes and didn&#x27;t like the heaviness of it and taking them off was like a nightmare.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use false eyelashes anymore for performance.  </li>
            <li> There were little bits of fuzz stuck on my lashes that looked weird and did not make the eyelashes look longer at all !</li>
            <li> Gives u thicker lashes but causes lashes to clump together also after a few minutes it dries and fibers begin to break off of lashes and fall into eyes causing painful irritation of the eyes would not recommend and will never buy this product again</li>
            <li> even though some people do, I do not use any other mascara as a base coat.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical</li>
            <li> Horrible!!!! avoid it and go with Younigue or Sheer Coverage.</li>
            <li> Also, the mascara would flake throughout the day, which is very annoying, especially for contact-wearers.</li>
            <li> The directions are written in the worst English I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> the results are mediocre.</li>
            <li> it had that weird chemical smell.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to apply this stuff without clumping.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nasty looking to have big balls of this stuff at the end of your lashes even when you follow instructions to the letter..</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because it is expensive.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about ordering but decided to go ahead...</li>
            <li> It hurt my eyes the entire time until I removed it, and it looked terrible with all the fibers that fell on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;ve done differently, but it&#x27;s terrible.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with that.</li>
            <li> But, I did not want them to look too fake.</li>
            <li> I even got asked if I was wearing false lashes!</li>
            <li> I have very thin lashes and the 3D fibers</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed!</li>
            <li> After purchasing and applying this mascara, people started asking me if I use fake lashes!</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable and somewhat painful.</li>
            <li> Really bad.</li>
            <li> So stop writing bad reviews because you are reps trying to get business.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clumps together so bad..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just bad news in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to replace the order, don&#x27;t believe I can! :(</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with your purchase.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible!</li>
            <li> This product is terrible.</li>
            <li> Product was AWFUL!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same as the Yonique, don&#x27;t waste your money on this and buy the actual stuff.</li>
            <li> The little fibers are messy and fall into the eye. Once you finish applying and you make sure no fibers are free floating, then your lashes last well for the rest of the day and stay in curled place. So both an up and a down to it.</li>
            <li> This stuff works!!! I highly recommend if you want super long lashes!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! Bought it last week from a Younigue representative at a local Mall in Orlando.  I was skeptical but I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  If you follow the directions, you will have thick, very long beautiful lashes.  I use my regular mascara underneath becuase it makes it very easy to take it off at night.  I will never use anything else again.  It does take some practice but it is worth it. Considering I have only been using this product for 7 days, there really wasn&#x27;t that much practice!</li>
            <li> I had serious issue with keeping the dry flakes out of my eyes while applying them. Obviously watery eyes doesn&#x27;t help the application process. It wasn&#x27;t full dry flakes, it was like the dust of them or something that kept getting into my eyes. Once I FINALLY got them all applied the way I liked, throughout the day my eyes were very irritated &amp; I kept getting stuff in them. Eventually they were all wiped away from all the tissue dabbing I had to do. Very disappointed in this product. I was so excited to see the results!</li>
            <li> I love how they made a lashes longer and fuller .</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! It does help to use a coat of mascara before 3d lash to help seperate lashes.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Younique 3D mascara, but it works for the most part. It is okay, but nothing I expected. Oh well</li>
            <li> Surprise - it works!  I put on mascara, then the gel, then the lashes, then the gel.  I do not  need to reapply it; it lasts all day (or at least 17 hours).  I have contact lenses, and I have not had a problem.</li>
            <li> Great product takes a little but of practice to get it right.</li>
            <li> These 3d fiber lashes are great.I love them.my lashes have never looked so good.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Non irritating to my sensitive eyes. Easy to use.  Definitely adds length to sparse lashes.  Long lasting wear.  I remove my mascara with coconut oil.  Beautiful package!  A little common sense and careful application of the product provides glamours natural looking lashes.  I keep a safety pin in the case to separate lashes on rare occasions to provide a natural and clean finish.  Last but not least it reasonably priced and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. The gel step of this product was very gloopy and hard to apply smoothly. The finished product was clumpy and not at all water resistant. I will definitely pay the extra dollars to return to the Younique brand.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product will buy again when I run out definitely.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great product. I love my lashes now!</li>
            <li> Took a while to get used to but it plumps lashes nicely - didn&#x27;t notice much of a length improvement</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d like this more. Made my lashes sticky and clumpy all day long.</li>
            <li> I switched from Youniqe 3d fiber lash to this brand and am much more pleased! plus its less expensive making looking fabulous a little cheaper! Very satisfied with this product and my great, long lashes!!</li>
            <li> Terrible. I usually use Sheer Coverage or Younique. Both of which are amazing and I have been using for over two years, but I ran out so I had to get something fast as I am going out of town and Younique and Sheer Covergae can&#x27;t get it too me before I leave. I ordered this product and it  clumps and comes in the most tacky, hideous silver snake skin case I have ever seen. I am embarrassed to be seen with it. Returning it as soon as I get the return label. Horrible!!!! avoid it and go with Younigue or Sheer Coverage. this was a waste of my time, money and energy. But Heather the amazon rep made my return simply and easy. she was a pleasure to deal with.</li>
            <li> I loved the product. I did irritate my eyes a little if I didn&#x27;t apply enough of the gel. It also works best if the fiber is applied to the ends of lashes only.</li>
            <li> Omg. this stuff makes your lashes look so long like they are miles long! Will be buying again when this expires or is gone.</li>
            <li> I love the lashes. I was using Younnique, however these 3D Fibers do the exact same thing for a much better price. I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> It does not do what they say it will</li>
            <li> This product was as expected and customer service is awesome.</li>
            <li> worth the prize me and my  teen age girls loved it!</li>
            <li> I am a cosmetologist and cosmetic artist, and I have found that all fiber mascara helps lengthen and add volume to your lashes since the tiny fibers are added to it. I have also found, however that the original (younique 3d moodstruck mascara) (I get mine from lashalert.com) are definitely the best. Younique&#x27;s are better because they don&#x27;t flake, don&#x27;t dry out through the day, dries quickly so it doesn&#x27;t smudge, and it is completely mineral. If you want longer thicker lashes use fiber mascara, and if you want the very best longer thicker lashed, use younique!</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this product to see if it works the same as Younique Lushious Lashes as it&#x27;s half the price. They don&#x27;t work PERIOD! I tried with and without underlying mascara and followed the directions to a T. If anything, they made my lashes look shorter. It seems like it&#x27;s the same process and ingredients but I guess you get what you pay for. Spend the $40 and get what really works!</li>
            <li> does a wonderful job love it ...will buy again</li>
            <li> This product worked great! I love that when I woke up the morning after using my eyes weren&#x27;t burning like with out products and it also didn&#x27;t turn flaky which was nice</li>
            <li> I can definitely see the difference in how much fuller my lashes look, more so than any volumnizing mascara I&#x27;ve tried.  I was hoping the 3D Fiber Lashes would also give some length to my lashes, but the fullness makes up for it. Lasts all day and washes off easy.</li>
            <li> No I was not satisfied at al with this product.  It does nto do what it says it does</li>
            <li> This product came quickly, and works amazingly. I recommend everyone try it</li>
            <li> I love my 3D Fiber lashes! My eyelashes are more full and voluminous. It&#x27;s the beauty of false eyelashes without the hassle.</li>
            <li> Very time consuming, sheds onto your face.  Not for me...</li>
            <li> This is totally identical to Younique but you save a few dollars. This stuff is just too much work, and it&#x27;s very difficult to not look like Tammy Faye Baker with spidery , clumpy lashes. I shouldn&#x27;t have to take a pin to separate my lashes. Yuk.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I makes my eyelashes long and thick.  It arrived very quick and as expected from description.</li>
            <li> Super long lashes!! Went from none to full and long. Awesome product! Pieces do fall down a little thru the day but not bad. Totally worth it tho!</li>
            <li> Wish it worked a little better over all I can tell a little difference between just my regular mascara and th fiber mascara.</li>
            <li> Love it - make sure you only apply to outer lashes otherwise your eyes get irritated. Great product!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara! It is really easy to apply and even though some people do, I do not use any other mascara as a base coat. After applying the gel, I would apply the fibers (dry) just to the tips of my lashes followed by a finishing coat of gel to hold fibers and this would create length and prevent any fibers from getting into my eyes. I would recommend this mascara to anyone and actually already have. I will definitely continue to order 3D Fiber Lashes from Lash Factory. Their delivery was super fast and their customer service is great as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*photos are 1 coat of each step (2 coats are even better!!!)</li>
            <li> Love it! They do get much longer eyelash effect but if you like your mascara full and lashes fanned out then this might not be for you because the mascara makes your lashes thicker and longer.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!  I bought this and showed it to a friend, and she showed it to several of her friends.  I will be reordering it!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me at all</li>
            <li> I get some many compliments on my eyes now. 3D fiber lashes are the best thing to come for woman on the go like myself. I touch my face a lot and my eyes are still perfect even if I go to sleep and wake up.</li>
            <li> I have been using the more expensive version of this mascara from Younique. Seeing how this version of 3D lashes was half as much as Younique, I ordered it. The first thing I noticed was that it stinks. Really bad. I mean, there&#x27;s a very strong stale sulfur smell that comes from it when you&#x27;re applying it. The application was just like Younique -- gel, flakes, gel. The fullness was not quite what I had come to expect from Younique. Also, the mascara would flake throughout the day, which is very annoying, especially for contact-wearers. And finally, when removing the mascara in the shower, it comes off in huge flakes that fall into the eyes. Very uncomfortable and somewhat painful. From now on, I am happy to pay a bit more from Younique.</li>
            <li> Love this product! The answer to a short lashed girls prayers!!!</li>
            <li> I love 3D lashes! These are pretty good. I see a big difference in the length and thickness of my lashes! The key is to separate your lashes with a brush!</li>
            <li> I was very excited about this product however after a month of use I am still very disappointed. Although the product was sealed the gel seemed to already have lash fibers in it. The instructions are clear to do one eye at a time (your own mascara, gel, fibers, gel) but the gel dries VERY quickly. With that said you have to be fast which is very messy! The fibers fall into your eye and on your cheekbone as well. I gave it 2 stars because I must admit that lashes do appear longer and thicker so technically it does what it says it will do. My advice is to check the mirror often as the fibers do fall onto the cheekbones during the duration of the time you wear it.</li>
            <li> Perfect color and depth!  Made my lashes pop! Huge fan!</li>
            <li> Love 3D Mascara. I wear it everyday and will buy more very soon, but this is not waterproof and if it were that would make them the best mascara of all time, so watch out if you cry.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! My eyes pop every time I put it on! This is now part of my every day staple. I don&#x27;t leave the house with out it on. I tried false eye lashes and didn&#x27;t like the heaviness of it and taking them off was like a nightmare. These fiber lashes is a safe alternative for your lashes. They last all day and washes off easy!</li>
            <li> These are no better than a cheap mascara. I was hoping to have found a healer alternative to Younique but did not find that here. I have ZERO connection to younique as a company other than that I have bought their mascara and love it. If you are looking for something like that, which I assume most buyers on here are, this is not a good alternative. There are a couple other generics I saw that seem like they might be more worth trying. This one is no better than a regular cover girl mascara. Not worth the money!</li>
            <li> I love this and to me it does not really require a &amp;#34;redo&amp;#34; during the day. The color is just right, so it last. Mine has not been flaky or a mess in any other way. It is a simple process and is well worth it! I read somewhere that it might get on your clothes and that has not happened. My daughter said &amp;#34;I loved your eyes the other night. What were you wearing?&amp;#34; When you kid notices, it is &amp;#34;eye&amp;#34; catching! Don&#x27;t miss out :)</li>
            <li> I love my lashes. I&#x27;m an amateur ballroom dancer. I don&#x27;t use false eyelashes anymore for performance.  These are so easy to apply, are comfortable and easy to take off. Great product.</li>
            <li> I only used it a couple times because the fiber mascara broke inside and nothing comes out. So I can&#x27;t use anymore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same as the other 3D Fiber Lashes that I&#x27;ve bought from typical distributors.</li>
            <li> Luv it can&#x27;t get no better then this .ðŸ˜šðŸ˜š</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the Younique brand, but I LOVE this cheaper version! I usually apply it twice with my normal mascara (Mary Kay Lash Love). I was a little nervous after reading some of the negative reviews. My guess is they didn&#x27;t apply it properly if it didn&#x27;t work for them. I have short, stubby lashes, and the fiber lashes give me more volume &amp; length! My only complaint is it flakes a little after you put it on. Other than that, LOVE it! And Love that it so cheaper than Younique!</li>
            <li> It dosen&#x27;t matter what you do, The fibers end up in your eyes &amp; on your cheeks under your eyes. Did not like.</li>
            <li> a lot more flakier than the younique brand  cheaper seems to be emptier/ less product inside only good for fewer application than younique</li>
            <li> What a waste of money! l thought l purchased the Younique products i wish l could return this Mascara!</li>
            <li> I thought that this was going to work just like the younique mascara, but this mascara didn&#x27;t work for me. Made my lashes look all clumped together and cause imitation of it gets too close to waterline. Plus the fibers kept falling off the brush.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never bought the younique brand, but if they all work like this then I&#x27;ll just stick to my normal one tube mascara.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure this stuff out.....ended up selling it to a friend</li>
            <li> This thing is so cool!!!</li>
            <li> This product works wonders! I get so many compliments on my lashes about them being so full! You have to be careful when applying so that none of the fibers get in your eyes, but I love love love this!</li>
            <li> Problems at first but now it works great!</li>
            <li> When you follow the (very specific) instructions, this is an amazing product! Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this lash product and was pretty well satisfied with it.  You have to follow the directions and work with it to even it out on your lashes.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I LOVEEEE MY 3D LASH FIBER mascara!! i odered it and it came on time and as shown! I have small thin lashes due to a illness , but when I applied the 3D LASH FIBER THEY EXTENDED DRAMATICALLY!!! A MUST BUY!</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased with this product. It does take some practice to get your technique down, so you don&#x27;t get that clumpy look. And yes some fibers always fall onto my face during the application but a quick brush off with my powder brush and I&#x27;m good to go. Make sure to &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; the deal with mascara so you don&#x27;t have fibers falling off all day. I wear this product everyday. It looks like I&#x27;m wearing falsies. There is no going back to regular mascara for me. I even curl my eyelashes AFTER everything is good and dry and have no problems.</li>
            <li> i love having big lashes and this fiber mascara does that!!!</li>
            <li> While not as good as the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; , it is still good. The tea fibers seem to be more sparce.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I feel like one order doesn&#x27;t last long though. It is good for a few weeks before the mascara begins to get much thicker which results in a less full look.</li>
            <li> Product works fine. Can get clumpy if you apply too much.&lt;br /&gt;  The directions are written in the worst English I&#x27;ve ever seen. It&#x27;s actually comical.</li>
            <li> These really do make your lashes look better! Love them.</li>
            <li> Great product! It does work used properly</li>
            <li> Just clumps together, don&#x27;t see much of a difference</li>
            <li> This product does what is says it will do. Follow the instructions carefully for maximum volume and length of your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever!!! This product lengthens your lashes - making them look natural.</li>
            <li> 3D Fiber mascara is the best product I have ever used on my lashes!</li>
            <li> Does not work, it just fell into my eyes. I through it in the garbage. I would not recommend it at all</li>
            <li> I really do enjoy these but one must take there time.......</li>
            <li> This product has been a great addition to my make-up collection. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go back to regular mascara again. Application is quick and easy...and well explained in the instructions. I like that it comes with a case so that both tubes are conveniently kept together. I have shorter/thinner lashes, so this really makes my lashes look full and lengthy. I only need to apply it in the morning, and it lasts all day. It&#x27;s also easy to remove with make-up remover. Great purchase, excellent price for the quality.</li>
            <li> Really like it.  Works better than other fiber mascaras that I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;m a exercise trainer/instructor and it holds up through my workouts.  I use one layer during day and looks great!</li>
            <li> I love fiber lash! It makes my eyes look more open and beautiful. It is super easy to use, and i am hooked. 😊👍Karen</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, it kind of flakes a lot which is very painful.</li>
            <li> Much easier to use than I thought!  The product goes on quickly and easily with very little (usually none) fallout.  I also like that it&#x27;s easy to build on - you can go for a general look, or build on the product to go for a totally glamorous look!  I wear contacts, and this product has not irritated my eyes at all - no reaction.  It&#x27;s also easy to remove with regular eye-makeup remover.</li>
            <li> flaked off and irritated my eyes</li>
            <li> no actual irritation but as the day goes on it is heavier than I am use to so it does bother me the longer I wear it.</li>
            <li> Can definitely see the difference when using regular mascara vs. 3D fiber lashes.  However, it does cause some irritation to my eyes when the tiny fibers fall off during the day.</li>
            <li> gave it away , the fibers do fall out during the day</li>
            <li> Youniques 3D fiber lash mascara is way better.</li>
            <li> The greatest mascara ever invented!! I love it, never thought I could have this much volume without fake lashes!!!</li>
            <li> The product came with instructions written only in Chinese.  The tube indicated as A was really B and vice versa.  Made for a lot of trial and error before you could use it correctly.  Even now I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m doing it correctly the results are mediocre.</li>
            <li> This is not easy to apply and the fibers fall into the eyes.  Some of them don&#x27;t stay put and irritate your eyes.  I would never use again.  I wear eyeliner and mascara every day but this stuff did not stop irritating my eyes all day long.</li>
            <li> I just ordered these and I&#x27;m in love they work great...i will be ordering some more as gifts for my friends...</li>
            <li> The fiber gets in  your eyes a lot and the mascara goes on clumpy. Two other store bought mascaras that are similar to this have worked better for me. I&#x27;m just not a fan.</li>
            <li> I have not had time to put the extra time into applying mascara in layers</li>
            <li> Nothing more than mascara</li>
            <li> Nope, hated it, had flakes of fiber in my eyes from the first use. I just threw it away. I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I like the mascara but I was looking for something in brown or brownish black as I am blonde and so the black is a little dark for me. Wish it came in both shades.  It is a very nice product though and makes your lashes look great.  Lasts pretty much all day.</li>
            <li> This product must have been shipped from China as when I opened the packaging it had that weird chemical smell.  Again, not what I expected.</li>
            <li> i loved it so much i well be using it all the time as apart of my daly rutined* love</li>
            <li> This item is just as describe. I love love love it. I no longer have to pay 60+ dollars every 3 weeks. I want to never run out of this product.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertisement!</li>
            <li> I have very short and sparse eye lashes so I thought this would be a great idea. You need to have time as you may need to apply many coats (4-5) to get the length you desire. As mentioned, I have sparse short lashes, so applying for 5 minutes a gel coat and then fiber  4-5 times can take up too much time. I also got a little of the fiber in my eyes which is challenging after you&#x27;ve already spent time applying your eye make-up.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the fiber lashes!! Your tips for them was a major help.</li>
            <li> hum - I think I do like it.  I may LOVE it due to - I always wear it.  I just think I&#x27;d feel better if someone would acknowledge my &amp;#34;longer lashes&amp;#34; - but - personally - I THINK they look lovely</li>
            <li> THE ABSOLUTE WORST MASCARA EVER....NEED TO RETURN IT AND GET MY MONEY BACK!  CLUMPY AND GASTLY!</li>
            <li> I enjoy using the 3D mascara.  It&#x27;s very easy to apply and really does make your lashes appear longer.</li>
            <li> I have never tried younique fiber lashes and after trying lash factory I most likely never will. I am completely satisfied with lash factory and it is cheaper than younique.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. Works as expected. Sharing a picture of the 3D fibers on left versus right eye without the 3D lash applied. You can definitely see the difference</li>
            <li> AWESOME!  THE FIBERS ARE BLACK... AND WORK PERFECT! THE PACKAGE CAME QUICK... AND I&#x27;LL BE BUYING THIS AGAIN!</li>
            <li> Great product, exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Not enough fibers  and very dry. I have had others that was better. Works ok in a pinch</li>
            <li> Flake free long lashes...I&#x27;m obsessed!</li>
            <li> I have been buying these and the divaderme lashes.. I love them. People that are commenting about the Younique 3D fiber lashes. . You are right!! These are not that product. So stop writing bad reviews because you are reps trying to get business. This product works for some..and people like me do not want to be sold Younique ..when I know I can buy it from a rep or the YOUNIQUE website..we want to hear if THIS product works! Btw..it works wonderfully for half the price of Younique Fiber lashes!</li>
            <li> Difficult to apply this stuff without clumping. Tried various amounts of each and used a tiny lash brush a LOT just to try and get some of it off my lashes and unclump it, all to no avail...it&#x27;s nasty looking to have big balls of this stuff at the end of your lashes even when you follow instructions to the letter..should have known there is really nothing to really give you more lashes..won&#x27;t buy again...ever.</li>
            <li> This mascara really works.  I gave it 4 stars because it is expensive.  Maybe less elaborate packaging would make it more affordable, or maybe once you have the case it would be great to just buy the tubes by themselves.  But, it does everything it says it will do if you follow the instructions.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product. It is so easy to apply and it looks fabulous after application. Just found my new fav!!!!</li>
            <li> This is not the most current product available for this particular mascara. The formula was updated many months ago and no purchases of Younique products made from anyone other than a Younique presenter is valid. Save your money and spend it with a true Younique presenter who will ensure that you receive a NEW, current and unaltered product. Younique&#x27;s 3D Fiberlash Mascara is AMAZING but purchasing from this seller is not going to get you a new product, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> As someone with the worlds shortest eyelashes I definitely noticed a huge improvement with 3d fiber lashes. important to use an eyelash comb to avoid clumping.</li>
            <li> Pretty good! Wish they made water proof!</li>
            <li> Gives u thicker lashes but causes lashes to clump together also after a few minutes it dries and fibers begin to break off of lashes and fall into eyes causing painful irritation of the eyes would not recommend and will never buy this product again</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin . My eyes where literally burning , but then again shouldn&#x27;t products be eye friendly too? My eyes where also really itchy. Has a irritating chemical in it.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible! It looks nothing like the before/after. Clumps on so much and doesn&#x27;t change my eye lashes any more than a cheap mascara would. I suggest Benefit&#x27;s They&#x27;re Real. LOVE that mascara.</li>
            <li> Makes mine a mile long! Easy to use and works perfectly - just follow the simple instructions! :) LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> The price was cheaper than anyone else, but the quality is not the best.</li>
            <li> Best thing that has ever happened for women who have very short eyelashes....i tried the most expensive primers under my mascara and did not come close to getting the results like 3 D lashes.....I Absolutely Love this Product</li>
            <li> I used it maybe 3-4 times &amp; the brush tip fell off &amp; is stuck in the tube. I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to replace the order, don&#x27;t believe I can! :(</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Great on time delivery.</li>
            <li> It flakes. I have to keep checking to see if there&#x27;s anything under my eyes, even though I only put on a little at a time, like the instructions say. Eyelashes do look longer though</li>
            <li> I bought this product in hopes that I could get the same volume and thickness as using the Younique fiber lashes (I just wanted to spend less money). There is nothing necessarily bad about it, it just doesn&#x27;t really do anything more than any other mascara.</li>
            <li> After you apply this product the fibers flake off continuously. Such a waste of money! If you just cake on your regular mascara with small clumps you will gain the same look.</li>
            <li> LOVE MY LASHES WITH THIS FIBER MASCARA</li>
            <li> The product is okay but I noticed that there is small black stuff that falls off the fiber lashes and it looks like its smudged under the eye area. Will try another brand to see if there is a difference.  My co-worker bought a different brand and she doesn&#x27;t have the same problem like I had.</li>
            <li> This is the second brand i have tried. So far i like it. Just took some time to work with it.</li>
            <li> Worked as it said but irritated my eyes a bit.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not the real Younique, but reasonable.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not Younique quality, but will do in a pinch.  The fibers are not as generously supplied as I had hoped, but it is better than average mascara.</li>
            <li> These left black circles under my eyes--&amp;#34;raccoon&amp;#34; eyes. I had no idea until I went into the bathroom a few hours after I got to work. I was so embarrassed!</li>
            <li> Worked exactly how i wanted them to :)</li>
            <li> Great for bolder look.</li>
            <li> This mascara works good for the price but yonique fiber lash is definitely better ! I would rather pay $20 extra for the real deal</li>
            <li> Amazing! Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Best mascara for volume and length!  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Great product!! Love the ease of having long beautiful lashes without the hasssle of glue. I use it every day to make my casual look a bit more dressy. Worth the money👍🏻</li>
            <li> was everything like advertised</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this product I got many compliments on my eyelashes. I even got asked if I was wearing false lashes! Don&#x27;t apply too close to your lash line or the fibers will get it in your eyes.</li>
            <li> Get the REAL 3D Fiber Lashes from a Younique Presenter!  They&#x27;re amazing!  www.youniqueproducts.com/sarahkabbe</li>
            <li> I applied the gel before and after applying the fibers and my mascara still flakes. It is irritating to pick the flakes off your makeup which then causes me to apply more makeup oppose to not having to do so prior to this purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this product! My eyelashes have never looked so sexy and fulk</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.I will be ordering it again from you.I am very pleased. I&#x27;m not having any problems putting it on.</li>
            <li> Product was AWFUL! The lash fiber looked like fuzz from a sweatshirt.  I returned my order. If you&#x27;re looking for longer/fuller lashes, by the product from Younique!</li>
            <li> If you have pretty straight lashes like I do don&#x27;t expect this product to change that. I have not tried any other fiber lash product but this one just doesn&#x27;t do pretty much anything and if it does expect the fibers to be all around your eyes making it seem like you don&#x27;t pluck your eyebrows. Don&#x27;t waste $20.</li>
            <li> I had used a different brand of the fiber lashes and was satisfied with my first order but didn&#x27;t like the second order I received.  I decided to try this one and love it. Easy to apply and looks natural.  This one was actually less expensive too.  I will definitely be ordering this one again.</li>
            <li> Just received my shipment and am extremely satisfied. I was skeptical about ordering but decided to go ahead...excellent choice. My lashes are full and look fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;STEPS FOLLOWED:&lt;br /&gt;1. Started with dry, clean lashes.&lt;br /&gt;2. Applied one coat of transplanting gel on one eye (did not use any of my normal mascara).&lt;br /&gt;3. Applied one coat of fibers beginning midway on my lashes to the tips.&lt;br /&gt;4. Applied transplanting gel.&lt;br /&gt;5. Applied fibers...then gel again.&lt;br /&gt;6. One more application of fibers and gel to seal. (What can I say I love full volume lashes)&lt;br /&gt;7. Then I wanted a little curl so I grabbed the blow dryer. Turned on medium heat on lowest setting. Places it so it would blow my lashes up and gave them a quick blow dry. The lashes curled up nicely. LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a note I had no fibers fall on my face or in my eyes. The trick is to do one eye at a time. I did all my steps on one eye then went and did the next.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product.  The fibers fall off your lashes onto your cheeks.  And this continues the entire time this product is on your lashes.  It also gets in your eyes.  You could never use this and wear contacts.  It hurt my eyes the entire time until I removed it, and it looked terrible with all the fibers that fell on my cheeks.  Big waste of money!</li>
            <li> Awesome product... works great.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference. Gel seemed very dry</li>
            <li> yuk. messy, a lot of time &amp; if you have good lashed already a waist of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it 1 star because it was shipped on time as promised</li>
            <li> love it i have no lashes with this product have great lashes</li>
            <li> Idk after a while my lashes fell just as if I had only my regular mascara on</li>
            <li> It was just ok. Some of the fibers tend to fall off my eyelashes and end up on my cheeks. That being said, my lashes are extremely fine and can&#x27;t hold much weight.</li>
            <li> To be honest I don&#x27;t notice a difference  I feel regualr mascara does just as well.  Maybe its me I dont know. I can say it does stay on better but my lashes do not look as good as the pictures show they will look</li>
            <li> I got this a little uncertain and no need I LOVE it. as long as you read and follow the instructions and do one eye at a time it was great. I am a complete noob at makeup and these were 10 times easier than applying falsies for me.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply and makes a big difference!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it does make my lashes look longer. it may take a few times to practice how to properly apply the fibers, but once you learn how to use it, your lashes will look awesome!!</li>
            <li> Love it. Works great and the price is good.</li>
            <li> It is fabulous, but a little on the flaky side after it&#x27;s on a couple of hours!</li>
            <li> Wife bought this item. She says it does exactly what it promises. She is very pleased.</li>
            <li> Cheap knock off of Younique 3D Fiber Lashes Mascara. Spend the extra $ and get the real stuff. Your lashes and eyes will thank you.</li>
            <li> Product flaked off throughout the day and got into my eyes.  I returned it.</li>
            <li> Wow! Tried this brand because it was a little less expensive, and I&#x27;m highly pleased! Lashes look great! Not clumpy like others have said!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!! BOUGHT 3 OF THEM/FROM SAME SELLER!! WILL BUY MORE!</li>
            <li> Love this product will buy again. Long lush lashes Easy Removal.</li>
            <li> Love this!  It was recommended on a fashion blog so I tried it out!  By the end of my day my eyelashes still looked amazing. I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I told everyone about it.  I purchased it for gifts for several people and they love it as well. If I could only have one piece of make-up this would be it.</li>
            <li> Love this product,  thank you</li>
            <li> As long as you use the gel coat before and after applying the fibers... you are good to go!  I cannot tell you what a difference this makes in my eyes.  They pop!</li>
            <li> Fantastic! My sister loves it!</li>
            <li> This is the best ever.I have very small eyes and tired of people asking me if I got enough sleep. 3d fiber lashes definitely opens up my eyes.</li>
            <li> These are great! I won&#x27;t need to buy latisse ever again.</li>
            <li> It was ok but I didn&#x27;t see where it made my lashes any different when I use primer. Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> Love this and makes my lashes look longer</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff! Don&#x27;t go a day without it on, even if I don&#x27;t have time for makeup this is a must.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara!  It&#x27;s so easy to apply, and gives you long, gorgeous eyelashes.  I&#x27;ll always buy this.</li>
            <li> They told me if I posted a pic I get another one free! So here it is. Love this stuff! People complain it gets in your eyes. I don&#x27;t have that problem because I don&#x27;t touch my lashes after they are set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked on this mascara.  I&#x27;ve bought it two times and about to buy it for the third time.  I normally have short, straight eyelashes and traditional mascara has only gone so far.  I curl my lashes, apply one coat of my regular mascara, then I apply the gel mascara and immediately apply the fibers and finish off with another coat of the gel mascara.  Sometimes I will do a second application of the gel mascara and the fibers.  I have found that my eyes get a little irritated at the end of the day while wearing this so I use baby oil to remove it once I am home-I wouldn&#x27;t recommend sleeping with this on.  Also, try not to apply it too close to your lash line.  This is a cheaper alternative to the other brand name 3d fiber lash mascara that other people are talking about.  I&#x27;ve never tried the other kind and I don&#x27;t really want to since this costs 1/3 less.  I wish it came in black/brown as well as black.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. Works great! Washes off easily when needed too.</li>
            <li> this product does fill the lashes however the fibers tend to fall off in your eyes and cheeks.</li>
            <li> Good product for the money spent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing. It works wonders! Buy this!!!!</li>
            <li> When I really want to look prettier and younger I use my 3D Fiber Lashes. I love this product. Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;  Roxanna Fuller</li>
            <li> this mascara does NOT do what it says. It irritated my eyes and was very hard to clean off. There were little bits of fuzz stuck on my lashes that looked weird and did not make the eyelashes look longer at all !</li>
            <li> Those of you saying the directions oh came in Chinese.... You DiD NOT receive authentic younique products! I am a younique presenter and none of our products come with chinese instruction! Also authentic younique is only sold by reps not on Amazon, eBay, ect. I&#x27;m sorry y&#x27;all had a bad experience but urge you to please order directly from a younique rep even if it&#x27;s no me and try the authentic product! Shanna Cloud</li>
            <li> Tedious application but looks great</li>
            <li> I like it.  It seems a little dry and hard to get on smoothly.  It goes on a little clumpy</li>
            <li> I have heard all good things about this product but I personally could not make the results happen for me on my eyes!</li>
            <li> So clumpy.  Buy the slightly more expensive product.  I love a different brand and thought this would be a cheaper version of the same thing.  I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;ve done differently, but it&#x27;s terrible. I actually think I might have to just throw it away.</li>
            <li> Loved it. I have really short lashes and it made them look so long. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> It did what it said it would do. I&#x27;m getting the length and thickness that I wanted. Just keep applying the steps until you achieve your desired length. I&#x27;ve never tried Younique before but to me, this is just as good and cheaper. Can&#x27;t go wrong with that.</li>
            <li> I tried the Younique product first. I loved it, but it was expensive. I tried the product from Lash Factory since it was less expensive. There&#x27;s plenty of gel but it&#x27;s globby.The fiber tube doesn&#x27;t have much in it at all. I&#x27;m stuck with a lot of gel and no fibers. Very disappointed. I will not purchase it again. I will gladly pay more for Younique. If both companies would ditch the hard case, they&#x27;d sell more!</li>
            <li> I am a lover of beautiful, full eyelashes. I have never been able to put bought lashes on nor have I had the desire to do so. The people I have seen with them, look like lashes that used to be on my dolls! Thick and well, not natural looking. So, I started looking at Younique Moodstruck 3D Fiber Lashes. On Amazon, they cost over $50 yet you can purchase them from the site for $29 and from a distributor for the same price. So, I thought, I will try the generic brand - which is the 3ED Fiber Lashes. They are absolutely amazing! I saw before my very eyes my lashes transform from skimpy to long, and fuller. Had I repeated the process, I could have had thicker lashes. But, I did not want them to look too fake. Also, I wear contacts and one user mentioned they would not be good for contact wearers - not a problem for me! Another user wrote throughout the day, they were falling off and she would have them lying around her eye. Never for me! It is EXTREMELY important to follow directions. (1) Make sure your mascara is dry. The first thing you do is use your favorite mascara first and let dry. (2) Only one eye at a time, you apply the gel and while wet put on the fiber lash. (3) Then, seal with another gel and repeat on the other eye! This is my experience and there is no guarantee the same effect will be for everyone. However, try it and see, perhaps once you do you might want to opt for the more expensive brand. But for me, I think this will work just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for reading my review…...</li>
            <li> This products does what it says it does. It takes more time than using normal mascara but you do get more volume and length. Follow instructions carefully for complete satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Love this! My lashes have never looked so full and sexy!</li>
            <li> These make my eyelashes look like falsies and I love it.  I have very sparse and thin lashes and this product is amazing!</li>
            <li> Works great! Makes my lashes look really long!</li>
            <li> I am a Younique Presenter, and I think I can explain why some of you have thrown your 3D away or may be having issues with it. The directions you received are not correct. Beginning with only do ONE EYE at a time. This is very important, you must have the 2 products work correctly together. You do NOT have to put on a coat of your own mascara first, it is personal choice, our mascara &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; (wet) can be used as mascara any time without the fibers. The gel should be put on just like you would a nice coat of mascara, and if you need to use a comb to separate your lashes to get the full dramatic look, I suggest you use a &amp;#34;metal&amp;#34; eye lash/eye brow comb while your lashes are wet. Younique released a metal comb as part of it&#x27;s new fall product line last week. When your lashes are wet you THEN apply the fibers (dry). You should NOT put the fibers (dry) on starting at your eye lash line, as some of you may find this irritating to you eye. It is NOT an allergic reaction, it is just a tiny fiber is in your eye, similar it could irritate it the same as an eye lash would. You are trying to create length and some want thickness. So start where you need the length the most, 1/2 way or 1/3 of the way from your eye lash line. You don&#x27;t need a thick coat of fibers, and you won&#x27;t really see them going on because they are so small, but they will be adhering to your wet gel. Next you seal the fibers in with a coat of gel from eye lash line to the tips of your lashes. That is what holds all the fibers in place so they don&#x27;t fall down on your cheeks or in your eyes, and what gives you your length. Another personal preference is, you can do the same steps to the top of your lashes so that they are sealed top and bottom. I usually wear one or two coats depending on where my day is going to take me. Some put on 3-4, it is an individual thing. It is up to you how long you want your lashes. I have yet to wear fibers on my bottom lashes because the gel alone does a wonderful jobby itself. I have went a couple of days at a time with my lashes on with no problem, no one knew the difference, I never had smudging, smearing or flaking, even after a shower or exercise. I tried them the first time 2 months ago and signed up immediately, because I knew these were fantastic and here to stay. I hope I answered your questions. I don&#x27;t think the other Younique ladies were being rude in their responses, I think they may have felt that you really get what you pay for, and wanted you to have the best product and service.</li>
            <li> this product thickens my lashes as well as lengthening</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  My lashes were not any longer.  If you are going to spend the money, I&#x27;d get the Younique brand.  It seems to work better.</li>
            <li> 😃 I just tried for the first time and I&#x27;m pleased. I have very thin lashes and the 3D fibers really give me a full look compared to regular mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it will take a few practice runs to get them exactly like I want them, but overall, I like a lot!</li>
            <li> Bought for my 15yr old daughter. She Loves the lashes!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I can&#x27;t say anything bad about it :)</li>
            <li> Both tubed totally dried up.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> I must admit I was a bit nervous about using this product but I prepared a bit by watching YouTube videos before it arrived and I am beyond pleased. It was very easy to apply and i was thrilled with the results. After 2 applications ( the second one lightly) my lashes were long and lush, not clumpy and very pretty. I actually fell asleep without removing this product and it was completely in place when I woke in the morning. I love it!!</li>
            <li> I have naturally very short and brittle lashes and most mascaras not exfoliate my lashes to the extent I would prefer. After purchasing and applying this mascara, people started asking me if I use fake lashes! It lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t run all over my face! I&#x27;m more than happy with this product. I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I love the 3D lash mascara!! It makes my lashes look so thick and long!  And it doesn&#x27;t make my lashes all hard and clumpy!  After applying 2 coats my lashes are still soft.!  This is the best mascara I&#x27;v ever used!!</li>
            <li> OMG works wonderfully. Best purchase I ever made. Definitely does what it is supposed to do and provides the pop I&#x27;m looking for to my eyelashes. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with your purchase.</li>
            <li> I think the fiber wand had dried up... Not much length when applied,</li>
            <li> Not good at all. You can barely see it on your eyes.</li>
            <li> Need a color in brown. I have very blond hair and it look harsh-but a great product.</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;m keeping it - have to give it another try but first try . . . eh . . not so good.</li>
            <li> I love it just it burns a little if you miss and put it to close to eyelid but I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a typical user. At 78 I may be too old to pull off the FAB LASHES. I usually just use the gel .</li>
            <li> A waste of money!! The fibers fall into your eyes not on your face! So then the first 45min your picking fibers out of your eye, or you cant see period.It&#x27;s clumps together so bad..you get more on your eyelid then eyelashes, then since its waterproof it will not come off! You can get the same look with regular mascara and a bunch of coats.thank god this was a gift and I didn&#x27;t waste my money!</li>
            <li> Amazing! After 1 application my lashes were Neary twice as long and stayed looking gorgeous all day and night. No smudges or flakes. I suggest a bit of coconut oil for removal.</li>
            <li> Best mascara hands down!! I get complimets all the time how long they look!</li>
            <li> Was dried out when I got it.</li>
            <li> irritates my eyes.  also, doesn&#x27;t really add much length.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for thickening lashes more than it is for lengthening. I still prefer Youniques Moodstruck 3D Fiber Lashes because their product lengthens much more, but this a decent off brand if you already have long lashes and are looking for something to accentuate the lashes you already have.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend absolutely loves it, and now there isn&#x27;t a bunch of fake eye lashes lying around my apartment, worked great for both of us</li>
            <li> Pretty sure this was a knock off. Extremely eye irritating if it happens to get in your eye.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I followed the directions (which were in English), and I had great results. I never had long lashes...but I do now!  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS. Will never use anything else, ever!</li>
            <li> Lovvvee it thinking about doing a YouTube review</li>
            <li> I enjoy my 3 D lashes</li>
            <li> Great product I do recommend a eyelash comb because it&#x27;s thick and gets very globalized without a comb</li>
            <li> So I JUST got this last night and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.  I wanted to see if it would be something easy to use since I do NOT enjoy applying makeup and usually go without (even though my teeny tiny lashes think I should always wear mascara).    The tubes came in a clamshell like case which closes securely and the case was shrink wrap sealed which is a nice touch.  The instructions were clear and in English with a website for further information (which I have yet to look at)    I started with curling my lashes and then put on a light coat of my own mascara.  I then followed the steps of applying the gel and then the fibers...at first blush, I LOVE this stuff! I did one eye at a time to see the difference and took some pics but I won&#x27;t subject you to my big \\&quot;eye\\&quot; shots LOL but the difference is SUBSTANTIAL! There was no shedding of the fibers on my face and once the gel was applied a second time to lock in the fibers they were there to stay. The only thing I will most likely do in the future is get a good eyelash comb, my first eye was a little more \\&quot;clumpy\\&quot; than the second but for my first try, it was not that bad and my regular mascara has done this on occasion so it was more a learning curve than prosuct issue.    I purposely did my lashes at night because I wanted to see what it would do overnight. I wear contact lenses and if I wear my mascara to bed it&#x27;s just bad news in the morning.  I also wanted to see (as a lens wearer) if this would irritate my eyes at all. The result this morning? Looked almost exactly the same as when I went to bed (I ONLY put on the mascara/lashes not full eye makeup).  My eyes are not red or irritated and my lashes still look awesome.  My 7 yr old son actually said \\&quot;I like your eyelashes\\&quot; while I was getting him ready for school.    I will update the review if I have any further experience (negative or positive) but for now it gets 5 stars from me.  I don&#x27;t know how easily it washes off as I am still wearing it and ain&#x27;t taking it offtil tonight!    Update 10/24: The 3D lashes came off easily at the end of the night with my regular Neutrogena makeup remover wipes.  I do not use soap/water normally so I didn&#x27;t try that method but one wipe took all the product off without any loss of eyelashes (always a concern for people with sparse lashes to begin with) Big Win with this product!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my lashes. Not better than drug store mascara</li>
            <li> They worked ok.. I think my lashes are just too thin. It definitely elongated the lashes I did have. Also,  I noticed they also flaked off and left little flakes under your eyes after a few hours.  Putting a final coat of regular mascara seemed to help.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine wearing mascara without using Fiber Lashes!!!  I LOVE it!!!</li>
            <li> My lashes look amazing!</li>
            <li> Kinda messy but definitely does what it says. My lashe&#x27;s looked longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> The 3D Fiber Lashes worked great. My daughter and I have fine lashes and we were going to a  family wedding.&lt;br /&gt;We both used them and they were easy to use and our lashes really showed up in the pictures.</li>
            <li> Today was the first day that I&#x27;ve used it...it is AWESOME....apply just like the directions and you will love it....it is fabulous!!!</li>
            <li> Love it  - will buy again!!</li>
