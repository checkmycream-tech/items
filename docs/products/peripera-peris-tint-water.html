            <li>and I heard that it is as good as benefit tint.</li>
            <li>Good for tween daughter as lipstick alternative.</li>
            <li>so I came across lip tint and thought this would be good for now.</li>
            <li>and I thought lip tint would be good .</li>
            <li>The color that it provides is beautiful but the taste is overwhelming.</li>
            <li>The color is super great!</li>
            <li>The packaging is really cute and the color is just perfect, very happy with it :)the only con would be that it doesnt have a very pleasant taste</li>

            <li>i really love this tint!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>The tint smells really nice.</li>
            <li>I have darker skin, so I was kind of nervous to buy this.</li>
            <li>This is a nice tint, cheaper than the poise tint from benefit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice product if you do not mind any of this.</li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>Honestly...</li>
            <li>It was a nice idea</li>
            <li>The color is nice and pigmented as well.</li>
            <li>I do recommend this product to anyone looking for a cheaper and effective lip/cheek stain</li>
            <li>This tint gives very strong color</li>
            <li>Really nice, I like the effect it has, makes my lips look naturally more coloured instead of coated with something.</li>
            <li>Love the color and so easy to apply!</li>
            <li>Super pigmented and lasts forever!!</li>
            <li>Definitely highly highly recommended this beautiful lip to those girls to tried to find out nature lips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on this when I wear it</li>
            <li>and it Is the perfect shade of red!</li>
            <li>Just pat it into your lips for more control.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Packaging is adorable.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t see the magic at all.</li>
            <li>I gave Peripera a chance because I saw an interesting review.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s ok though.  </li>
            <li>But I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed overall though.</li>
            <li>I love this lip tint.</li>
            <li>My favorite lip stain at the moment .</li>
            <li>But I think that is because my lips are generally more pigmented by it</li>
            <li>a lot more watery than I thought it would</li>
            <li>but it looks cute.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>so I was glad when it was a prefect</li>
            <li>If it didnt contain any alcohol I would love this, but since it does I wont recommend it to anybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The gels are much better.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>It dries to having no texture, just lovely, flattering color.</li>
            <li>The product is lovely.  </li>
            <li>Cute packing.</li>
            <li>But I would say benefit do much better than this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute a container  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s more of a watery consistency</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>Oh well still love it</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Very build-able and works great for gradient effect.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>It is better then benetint, stainiac, stain dragon and a million others i have tried.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Be sure to always follow up with a gloss...</li>
            <li>Like most tints, it can be drying so jus moisturize before/after application</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this lip tint.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>MY DAUGHTER LOVE THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li>Love this tint as a cheaper alternative to benetint.</li>
            <li>I love this stain.</li>
            <li>but it stays on most of the day.</li>
            <li>like I said for the price I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find anything else better.</li>
            <li>Im glad I took a chance</li>
            <li>I think this product is meant for achieving the ombr√© lip, which is popular in S. Korea, and would probably work best in conjunction with other K-beauty products.</li>
            <li>but with a bit of lipstick and a dab of the liptint, my lips look lush and gorgeous!</li>
            <li>Over all it came fast, well packaged, and the item itself is amazing!</li>
            <li>It stays, tastes good, and I really like it!</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect color, not too pink and not too orange.  </li>
            <li>Really pretty and ALMOST natural :D</li>
            <li>The color stains a bright cherry red, but dries really nice.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>it is too moist and easily erasable from the lips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a simple lip stain that arrives in cute packaging for a great price</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too sure about buying this online especially since the colors can vary greatly from product  photos.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I bought so amazing Korea product.</li>
            <li>it also tends to emphasize fine lines on your lips.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s just fine.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to be easy to put on honestly, but it really is water.</li>
            <li>think if you are very fair this might give your lips or cheeks a little pinched look, like a healthy flushed skin look  from heat or running etc.  </li>
            <li>but this product has a light weight feel to it</li>
            <li>(ya know, &amp;#34;its so smooth</li>
            <li>I bought that because it is cheap</li>
            <li>Its a gorgeous natural color.</li>
            <li>Really nice red, suitable for a night out</li>
            <li>It has a very watery consistency and is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This stuff is unique.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cute, every time I pull it out of my purse, someone wants to steal it from me!</li>
            <li>This is really lovely on and exactly what I look for in a lip stain.</li>
            <li>Love it so much!</li>
            <li>The only problem is that it needs to be reapplied, but I don&#x27;t mind doing that because its so nice!</li>
            <li>I really love stain because it makes you look alive and healthy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-coloring is more strong and vivid</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cute and very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;Repurchase?</li>
            <li>I rate this a five because it got here fast, it passed the drinking and eating test, stayed on for hours, and to top it all off</li>
            <li>It gives a pretty berry color and it is easy to spread.</li>
            <li>Got it early, love the color, and definitely worth it, in the future I will be trying more colors, thank you!!</li>
            <li>Bought it in cherry and it absorbed very quickly and left a nice stain.</li>
            <li>When I put a moisturizer over the color, the color came off fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>So you have to dap it quickly.</li>
            <li>To prevent that, spread/blend the product quickly and evenly, perhaps using it in conjunction with a chapstick.</li>
            <li>, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS OUTSTANDING SELLER AND PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t last as long as I wanted, but I may re-purchase more colors anyway since the formula is so beautiful.</li>
            <li>It does apply a tiny bit uneven on the lips, but if you top it with some gloss or chap stick its perfect.</li>
            <li>Very pretty color and presentation.  </li>
            <li>, the color wasn&#x27;t as strong but it was still very visible on my lips.</li>
            <li>good to apply to dry lips as it just goes in the cracks</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>While it isn&#x27;t as vibrant as a lipstick or highly pigmented gloss, it still does a very good job--and isn&#x27;t sticky like the latter would be.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend getting a pinker color for a more natural look.&lt;br</li>
            <li>To top it off, it fades into a more natural pink which is better than any lipstick I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I actually really liked the product  , my only 2 complaints is that it&#x27;s&lt;</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I like lip stains to look natural, like my lips but better.</li>
            <li>It tastes faintly bitter, so it prevents me from licking my lips, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>Also, be careful when you put it on and do not put to much, because if you put to much it can go inside your mouth and your teeth will look like it has blood lol and</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a good stain that will last through the day but is light enough not to look like i was in a slap fight.</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited to find something comparable to Benetint and at a completely reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>super long lasting, strong build able pigment!</li>
            <li>It honestly looks like you have been bleeding all day and have dry lips.</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised when this shade of red looked good on me.</li>
            <li>It took two and a half weeks to arrive from Korea to my location (USA, West Coast), which was much faster than the estimated arrival date, which was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>Pretty colours.</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve given it a higher rating if it didn&#x27;t feather out quite a bit</li>
            <li>I got the cherry red and apply some with the brush and spread with my finger then apply Chapstick on top since it can be a bit drying.</li>
            <li>pretty on the lips and lasts all day till you wash it off.</li>
            <li>Absolute fav!</li>
            <li>I love lip tints and have tried numerous brands...</li>
            <li>and this was my first Peripera</li>
            <li>Shipment is fast!  </li>
            <li>Make sure you lips are soft and moisten if you live in drier places like I do.</li>
            <li>Light coverage, doesn&#x27;t really give a pop of color and because it&#x27;s watery, it tends to disappear off your top lip due to gravity.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a nice dark shade of red and it lovely for the time it does stay on.</li>
            <li>Your lips need to be soft, but clean, so that the tint water can soak in.  </li>
            <li>But on my more tanned medium skin tone it looked strange.  </li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s suggested that you make sure your lips aren&#x27;t too dry and is well moisturized before applying this tint or the stain will bring out any cracks.</li>
            <li>This is easily corrected with a red lip pencil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been a lipstick fan, but stains work perfect for me because I like a little color on my lips as long as it&#x27;s natural looking.</li>
            <li>These tints impart a fresh, soft flush of color to lips that really lasts.  </li>
            <li>color is really stay at the lips.</li>
            <li>even whole night.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cherry colored.</li>
            <li>I still recommend it, it smells fruity, doesn&#x27;t have much of a taste?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pigmented, so you don&#x27;t need to use too much.</li>
            <li>The texture is also very watery instead of gel-like.</li>
            <li>but If you mix it with a pinkish lipgloss it blends really well</li>
            <li>But even so, it still shows really well when I put it on.</li>
            <li>Very cherry like color.</li>
            <li>It is a very watery liquid and colors your lip in the way that your tongue gets colored when you eat a popsicle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though this one is much cheaper, I don&#x27;t like the smell and the color</li>
            <li>All in all I really like it.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really like lipstick</li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Make me look much whiter too.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to use too much.</li>
            <li>but it doesnt really bother me.</li>
            <li>No sticky feeling and very watery.</li>
            <li>I really want the orange one now.</li>
            <li>, looks natural!!!</li>
            <li>It adds a very natural and pretty flush to my cheeks and lips.</li>
            <li>The color was much more vibrant than expected</li>
            <li>I apply occasionally, it depends if you drink much or eat, or maybe sweat , i apply two times only, but my sister need to apply more time.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I only bought it because I thought it was cool that amazon had korean cosmetic products even if they aren&#x27;t high end</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nonetheless, it&#x27;s decent for the price.</li>
            <li>Lighter than the pictures, but it&#x27;s quite a decent lip stain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very vivid and pigmented.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smaller but it looks exactly like the picture!</li>
            <li>Very cute jar, but it comes out very wet and doesn&#x27;t stay on very long</li>
            <li>I plan on buying a few more.  </li>
            <li>I put it on and went about my day normally.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute but doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li>If you want a more dramatic shade then simply apply more coats.  </li>
            <li>It even came with free samples of other products .</li>
            <li>The color instantly turns like a hot pinkish color - light pink .</li>
            <li>but somedays I want to look lively</li>
            <li>It appears this shade is still trendy in Korea, as I&#x27;ve seen girls (on TV, youtube, etc) with pale skin still sporting a red lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Otherwise, just evenly spread the product on your lips).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got cherry red, and it&#x27;s exactly that.</li>
            <li>but I have dry lips and my top lip will not hold the color very long because of it.</li>
            <li>I need to reapply every few hours, but it&#x27;s so easy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really cute look, the only down side is that it goes away after a couple of hours</li>
            <li>(the Amazon price is half the price this product is sold at in Forever 21 or Urban Outfitters).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peripera is a trendy, low cost brand</li>
            <li>If you want a light application (fainter color) then apply a little, sparingly, and rub your lips together.  </li>
            <li>just seems a little light for my skin color</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last as long as some other stains like it, but it goes well, and after applying with the applicator and my finger, it leaves a nice, berry stain.</li>
            <li>But the sad thing about this is that the liquid tends to spread around VERY easily the first coulple of seconds when you apply it.</li>
            <li>It came in really early and well packaged</li>
            <li>My lips are naturally darker and overpigmented because of years of chapped lips</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the staying power of this lip stain.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had much luck with red shades (or lip stains for that matter)</li>
            <li>But it probably depends on the amount of color you naturally have in your lips.</li>
            <li>The tint doesin&#x27;t stain my upper lip that much...</li>
            <li>Also, It colors my lower lip really well, but not my upper lip even after exfoliating.</li>
            <li>Wears well and fades naturally.</li>
            <li>It leaves a nice natural color on your lips for a few hours if your careful (not eating/drinking).</li>
            <li>Will last for a super long time.</li>
            <li>small, easy to carry around&lt;</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re older, this color might be too candy red for you</li>
            <li>This seems to go on a dark cherry red with my complexion but apparently soaks in quickly and leaves a mauve like color on my lips that last for hours, even if you drink your coffee ; ).  </li>
            <li>Not as pretty as what I expected.</li>
            <li>, the color is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>It dried quickly and had a matte finish.</li>
            <li>Because the tint is very pigmented and liquidy though, im hoping it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>I can see this whole bottle lasting me a long time.  </li>
            <li>It will bleed off your lips and stain your face if you are not careful when applying.</li>
            <li>the product is too wet, and when i dab my mouth, the whole color comes off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only natural for any type of lip stain.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t last very long at all (about three hours) and as it fades away, it starts looking like you&#x27;ve had too much kool-aid</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it on my lips but more as a cheek stain and the other ones I usually get from Ulta are $30.</li>
            <li>It your lips are dry, it might show the dry skins and the wrinkles really well, or the color will not be as evenly disperse as you wanted it to.</li>
            <li>I have dry lips naturally and it wasn&#x27;t at all drying.</li>
            <li>The tint lasts only a couple hours on my lips, but this has been the case with various lip products I have tried in general.</li>
            <li>It was a little dry but after putting a little chapstick it feels better.</li>
            <li>So I use tiny miniscule dots on my lips to give my lips a slight flush of color (this product is very buildable).</li>
            <li>A little too much</li>
            <li>It fades a little as you go about your day, but it really can&#x27;t be helped if you&#x27;re are eating or drinking things.</li>

            <li> The color is gorgeous and leaves your lips tinted for a good 5 hours.</li>
            <li> and I heard that it is as good as benefit tint.</li>
            <li> Good for tween daughter as lipstick alternative.</li>
            <li> so I came across lip tint and thought this would be good for now.</li>
            <li> and I thought lip tint would be good .</li>
            <li> The color that it provides is beautiful but the taste is overwhelming.</li>
            <li> The color is super great!</li>
            <li> The packaging is really cute and the color is just perfect, very happy with it :)the only con would be that it doesnt have a very pleasant taste</li>
            <li> They sure were happy with the product</li>
            <li> I love the cute packaging, the applicator wand works perfect for me, the cherry color really pops and looks great on my lips, AND it lasts all day at work!</li>
            <li> Love how you can build up the color on this lip stain!</li>
            <li> The packaging is so cute!  </li>

            <li> i really love this tint!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> The tint smells really nice.</li>
            <li> I have darker skin, so I was kind of nervous to buy this.</li>
            <li> This is a nice tint, cheaper than the poise tint from benefit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product if you do not mind any of this.</li>
            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> Honestly...</li>
            <li> It was a nice idea</li>
            <li> The color is nice and pigmented as well.</li>
            <li> I do recommend this product to anyone looking for a cheaper and effective lip/cheek stain</li>
            <li> This tint gives very strong color</li>
            <li> Really nice, I like the effect it has, makes my lips look naturally more coloured instead of coated with something.</li>
            <li> Love the color and so easy to apply!</li>
            <li> Super pigmented and lasts forever!!</li>
            <li> Definitely highly highly recommended this beautiful lip to those girls to tried to find out nature lips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on this when I wear it</li>
            <li> and it Is the perfect shade of red!</li>
            <li> Just pat it into your lips for more control.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Packaging is adorable.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t see the magic at all.</li>
            <li> I gave Peripera a chance because I saw an interesting review.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s ok though.  </li>
            <li> But I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed overall though.</li>
            <li> I love this lip tint.</li>
            <li> My favorite lip stain at the moment .</li>
            <li> But I think that is because my lips are generally more pigmented by it</li>
            <li> a lot more watery than I thought it would</li>
            <li> but it looks cute.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> so I was glad when it was a prefect</li>
            <li> If it didnt contain any alcohol I would love this, but since it does I wont recommend it to anybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The gels are much better.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> It dries to having no texture, just lovely, flattering color.</li>
            <li> The product is lovely.  </li>
            <li> Cute packing.</li>
            <li> But I would say benefit do much better than this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute a container  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s more of a watery consistency</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> Oh well still love it</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Very build-able and works great for gradient effect.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> It is better then benetint, stainiac, stain dragon and a million others i have tried.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Be sure to always follow up with a gloss...</li>
            <li> Like most tints, it can be drying so jus moisturize before/after application</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this lip tint.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> MY DAUGHTER LOVE THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Love this tint as a cheaper alternative to benetint.</li>
            <li> I love this stain.</li>
            <li> but it stays on most of the day.</li>
            <li> like I said for the price I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find anything else better.</li>
            <li> Im glad I took a chance</li>
            <li> I think this product is meant for achieving the ombr√© lip, which is popular in S. Korea, and would probably work best in conjunction with other K-beauty products.</li>
            <li> but with a bit of lipstick and a dab of the liptint, my lips look lush and gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Over all it came fast, well packaged, and the item itself is amazing!</li>
            <li> It stays, tastes good, and I really like it!</li>
            <li> Pretty good.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect color, not too pink and not too orange.  </li>
            <li> Really pretty and ALMOST natural :D</li>
            <li> The color stains a bright cherry red, but dries really nice.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> it is too moist and easily erasable from the lips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a simple lip stain that arrives in cute packaging for a great price</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure about buying this online especially since the colors can vary greatly from product  photos.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I bought so amazing Korea product.</li>
            <li> it also tends to emphasize fine lines on your lips.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s just fine.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be easy to put on honestly, but it really is water.</li>
            <li> think if you are very fair this might give your lips or cheeks a little pinched look, like a healthy flushed skin look  from heat or running etc.  </li>
            <li> but this product has a light weight feel to it</li>
            <li> (ya know, &amp;#34;its so smooth</li>
            <li> I bought that because it is cheap</li>
            <li> Its a gorgeous natural color.</li>
            <li> Really nice red, suitable for a night out</li>
            <li> It has a very watery consistency and is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This stuff is unique.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cute, every time I pull it out of my purse, someone wants to steal it from me!</li>
            <li> This is really lovely on and exactly what I look for in a lip stain.</li>
            <li> Love it so much!</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it needs to be reapplied, but I don&#x27;t mind doing that because its so nice!</li>
            <li> I really love stain because it makes you look alive and healthy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-coloring is more strong and vivid</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cute and very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;Repurchase?</li>
            <li> I rate this a five because it got here fast, it passed the drinking and eating test, stayed on for hours, and to top it all off</li>
            <li> It gives a pretty berry color and it is easy to spread.</li>
            <li> Got it early, love the color, and definitely worth it, in the future I will be trying more colors, thank you!!</li>
            <li> Bought it in cherry and it absorbed very quickly and left a nice stain.</li>
            <li> When I put a moisturizer over the color, the color came off fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> So you have to dap it quickly.</li>
            <li> To prevent that, spread/blend the product quickly and evenly, perhaps using it in conjunction with a chapstick.</li>
            <li> , I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS OUTSTANDING SELLER AND PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last as long as I wanted, but I may re-purchase more colors anyway since the formula is so beautiful.</li>
            <li> It does apply a tiny bit uneven on the lips, but if you top it with some gloss or chap stick its perfect.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color and presentation.  </li>
            <li> , the color wasn&#x27;t as strong but it was still very visible on my lips.</li>
            <li> good to apply to dry lips as it just goes in the cracks</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> While it isn&#x27;t as vibrant as a lipstick or highly pigmented gloss, it still does a very good job--and isn&#x27;t sticky like the latter would be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend getting a pinker color for a more natural look.&lt;br</li>
            <li> To top it off, it fades into a more natural pink which is better than any lipstick I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I actually really liked the product  , my only 2 complaints is that it&#x27;s&lt;</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I like lip stains to look natural, like my lips but better.</li>
            <li> It tastes faintly bitter, so it prevents me from licking my lips, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> Also, be careful when you put it on and do not put to much, because if you put to much it can go inside your mouth and your teeth will look like it has blood lol and</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a good stain that will last through the day but is light enough not to look like i was in a slap fight.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to find something comparable to Benetint and at a completely reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> super long lasting, strong build able pigment!</li>
            <li> It honestly looks like you have been bleeding all day and have dry lips.</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised when this shade of red looked good on me.</li>
            <li> It took two and a half weeks to arrive from Korea to my location (USA, West Coast), which was much faster than the estimated arrival date, which was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> Pretty colours.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given it a higher rating if it didn&#x27;t feather out quite a bit</li>
            <li> I got the cherry red and apply some with the brush and spread with my finger then apply Chapstick on top since it can be a bit drying.</li>
            <li> pretty on the lips and lasts all day till you wash it off.</li>
            <li> Absolute fav!</li>
            <li> I love lip tints and have tried numerous brands...</li>
            <li> and this was my first Peripera</li>
            <li> Shipment is fast!  </li>
            <li> Make sure you lips are soft and moisten if you live in drier places like I do.</li>
            <li> Light coverage, doesn&#x27;t really give a pop of color and because it&#x27;s watery, it tends to disappear off your top lip due to gravity.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a nice dark shade of red and it lovely for the time it does stay on.</li>
            <li> Your lips need to be soft, but clean, so that the tint water can soak in.  </li>
            <li> But on my more tanned medium skin tone it looked strange.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s suggested that you make sure your lips aren&#x27;t too dry and is well moisturized before applying this tint or the stain will bring out any cracks.</li>
            <li> This is easily corrected with a red lip pencil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a lipstick fan, but stains work perfect for me because I like a little color on my lips as long as it&#x27;s natural looking.</li>
            <li> These tints impart a fresh, soft flush of color to lips that really lasts.  </li>
            <li> color is really stay at the lips.</li>
            <li> even whole night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cherry colored.</li>
            <li> I still recommend it, it smells fruity, doesn&#x27;t have much of a taste?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pigmented, so you don&#x27;t need to use too much.</li>
            <li> The texture is also very watery instead of gel-like.</li>
            <li> but If you mix it with a pinkish lipgloss it blends really well</li>
            <li> But even so, it still shows really well when I put it on.</li>
            <li> Very cherry like color.</li>
            <li> It is a very watery liquid and colors your lip in the way that your tongue gets colored when you eat a popsicle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though this one is much cheaper, I don&#x27;t like the smell and the color</li>
            <li> All in all I really like it.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really like lipstick</li>
            <li> very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Make me look much whiter too.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to use too much.</li>
            <li> but it doesnt really bother me.</li>
            <li> No sticky feeling and very watery.</li>
            <li> I really want the orange one now.</li>
            <li> , looks natural!!!</li>
            <li> It adds a very natural and pretty flush to my cheeks and lips.</li>
            <li> The color was much more vibrant than expected</li>
            <li> I apply occasionally, it depends if you drink much or eat, or maybe sweat , i apply two times only, but my sister need to apply more time.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I only bought it because I thought it was cool that amazon had korean cosmetic products even if they aren&#x27;t high end</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nonetheless, it&#x27;s decent for the price.</li>
            <li> Lighter than the pictures, but it&#x27;s quite a decent lip stain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very vivid and pigmented.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller but it looks exactly like the picture!</li>
            <li> Very cute jar, but it comes out very wet and doesn&#x27;t stay on very long</li>
            <li> I plan on buying a few more.  </li>
            <li> I put it on and went about my day normally.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute but doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> If you want a more dramatic shade then simply apply more coats.  </li>
            <li> It even came with free samples of other products .</li>
            <li> The color instantly turns like a hot pinkish color - light pink .</li>
            <li> but somedays I want to look lively</li>
            <li> It appears this shade is still trendy in Korea, as I&#x27;ve seen girls (on TV, youtube, etc) with pale skin still sporting a red lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Otherwise, just evenly spread the product on your lips).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got cherry red, and it&#x27;s exactly that.</li>
            <li> but I have dry lips and my top lip will not hold the color very long because of it.</li>
            <li> I need to reapply every few hours, but it&#x27;s so easy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really cute look, the only down side is that it goes away after a couple of hours</li>
            <li> (the Amazon price is half the price this product is sold at in Forever 21 or Urban Outfitters).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peripera is a trendy, low cost brand</li>
            <li> If you want a light application (fainter color) then apply a little, sparingly, and rub your lips together.  </li>
            <li> just seems a little light for my skin color</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as some other stains like it, but it goes well, and after applying with the applicator and my finger, it leaves a nice, berry stain.</li>
            <li> But the sad thing about this is that the liquid tends to spread around VERY easily the first coulple of seconds when you apply it.</li>
            <li> It came in really early and well packaged</li>
            <li> My lips are naturally darker and overpigmented because of years of chapped lips</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the staying power of this lip stain.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had much luck with red shades (or lip stains for that matter)</li>
            <li> But it probably depends on the amount of color you naturally have in your lips.</li>
            <li> The tint doesin&#x27;t stain my upper lip that much...</li>
            <li> Also, It colors my lower lip really well, but not my upper lip even after exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Wears well and fades naturally.</li>
            <li> It leaves a nice natural color on your lips for a few hours if your careful (not eating/drinking).</li>
            <li> Will last for a super long time.</li>
            <li> small, easy to carry around&lt;</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re older, this color might be too candy red for you</li>
            <li> This seems to go on a dark cherry red with my complexion but apparently soaks in quickly and leaves a mauve like color on my lips that last for hours, even if you drink your coffee ; ).  </li>
            <li> Not as pretty as what I expected.</li>
            <li> , the color is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> It dried quickly and had a matte finish.</li>
            <li> Because the tint is very pigmented and liquidy though, im hoping it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I can see this whole bottle lasting me a long time.  </li>
            <li> It will bleed off your lips and stain your face if you are not careful when applying.</li>
            <li> the product is too wet, and when i dab my mouth, the whole color comes off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only natural for any type of lip stain.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t last very long at all (about three hours) and as it fades away, it starts looking like you&#x27;ve had too much kool-aid</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it on my lips but more as a cheek stain and the other ones I usually get from Ulta are $30.</li>
            <li> It your lips are dry, it might show the dry skins and the wrinkles really well, or the color will not be as evenly disperse as you wanted it to.</li>
            <li> I have dry lips naturally and it wasn&#x27;t at all drying.</li>
            <li> The tint lasts only a couple hours on my lips, but this has been the case with various lip products I have tried in general.</li>
            <li> It was a little dry but after putting a little chapstick it feels better.</li>
            <li> So I use tiny miniscule dots on my lips to give my lips a slight flush of color (this product is very buildable).</li>
            <li> A little too much</li>
            <li> It fades a little as you go about your day, but it really can&#x27;t be helped if you&#x27;re are eating or drinking things.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as I hoped.  </li>
            <li> One thing that bothered me about it though is that it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> since it is tint water it will surely last for a long time.</li>
            <li> It can last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have a yellow undertone, I bought this because I have very long days..</li>
            <li> For me, it was very red and looked dry.</li>
            <li> darker;which I fixed by adding 4 drops of black ink into</li>
            <li> I could smell it immediately upon application and about 10 mins later my lips were dry and peeling!</li>
            <li> I do not find it drying, but I prefer to put a little clear lip balm on my lips for a bit of shine.  </li>
            <li> The pigment lasts just as long as Benetint.  </li>
            <li> It took a long time to arrive.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like it and take long time to receive</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last like other stains I have.</li>
            <li> but one problem is if not apply the lip gloss , it gone be so dry to dieeeeeee.</li>
            <li> but once it dry it leaves the tint look.</li>
            <li> Make my lip dry.</li>
            <li> If you apply the lip stain and notice dry flaky bits, you can rinse your lips and rub off the flaky bits and reapply the lip stain.</li>
            <li> but if you figured out how to not make it dry them out</li>
            <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this shade again (too red for me), but I&#x27;d like to try the other shades, like pink juice or orange</li>
            <li> A little drop goes a long way so if you do use it as a cheek stain you only need the tiniest drop</li>
            <li> have very dry flaky lips, and I didn&#x27;t find it drying.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about buying liptints because I tried my friend&#x27;s (cheap) liptint</li>
            <li> Just a dab on the center of the lips  and it will spread to fill in.</li>
            <li> but...it&#x27;s not much of a stain.  </li>
            <li> Came faster than expected.</li>
            <li> The product is a tinted liquid, so be careful not to tip it over because it may spill.</li>
            <li> It does not taste bitter, which I like.</li>
            <li> Also, be careful as it can get on your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Days when I do put it on , I put altitude then get a piece of tissue paper - wet it - then take off alittle of the lip tint.</li>
            <li> you can spill it if you aren&#x27;t careful and that you need to figure out how to apply it.</li>
            <li> This tint is so bitter that I never use it.</li>
            <li> Not very long-lasting</li>
            <li> Even if I wore this everyday, this bottle will probably last me years</li>
            <li> Other then that it has a lot of product and came on expected date.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> , you need to be careful when applying, because you can it on your teeth and removing that is a nightmare!</li>
            <li> I plan on buying other colors.</li>
            <li> Other than that I like this product a lot.</li>
            <li> I knew it would be a small tint, however its veryyy tiny.</li>
            <li> Other than this</li>
            <li> buy in other colors.</li>
            <li> This items wasn&#x27;t what I expected!</li>
            <li> The product makes your lips look pretty, but you have to use lip balm before using it otherwise your lips will dry up like crazy.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the time waiting for the package.</li>
            <li> It took a few tries to figure out how I want it to apply...</li>
            <li> it just runs down onto my teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Could go down on the price...</li>
            <li> I usually massage some lipbalm into mine since my lips dry</li>
            <li> where ever you want it to be and PRESS your lips together and rub them together slightly.</li>
            <li> It has a slight cherry scent to it there is a tone of it</li>
            <li> so less amount&lt;br /&gt;-since</li>
            <li> I thought cherry juice was a little bit lighter but seems like it was a little dark .</li>
            <li> For this reason I keep it in its&#x27; box when I put it in my purse for work, as a little added protection.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You just put a little on</li>
            <li> Bought a few of these for Xmas gifts.</li>
            <li> I am in my forties and don&#x27;t like that  heavy lipstick look during the day at my age.  </li>
            <li> Its small</li>
            <li> I ordered this and was not really sure what to expect.  </li>
            <li> At least not that I noticed.</li>
            <li> and it comes with a sponge applicator, not the silly brushes other products have.</li>
            <li> Item very bad only water and not fixed</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s not good).</li>
            <li> but it happend to be poorly packaged.</li>
            <li> I did try it on my lips and it dried them out really badly</li>
            <li> and then it&#x27;s difficult to take it off.</li>
            <li> The disappointing factor is that is contains parabans but there is a longer list of bad ingredients in the pricier version.</li>
            <li> I would give 4 stars for the product, but I had to return it because it was expired. :(</li>
            <li> and it is a water base.</li>
            <li> And do not let it go in your move, because the taste is horrible.</li>
            <li> The taste is awful</li>

            <li> color is really stay at the lips. even whole night. but one problem is if not apply the lip gloss , it gone be so dry to dieeeeeee. if use lip balm, the the color with comes off with your lip skin</li>
            <li> Love the color and so easy to apply!</li>
            <li> I would give 4 stars for the product, but I had to return it because it was expired. :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cherry colored.</li>
            <li> It came in really early and well packaged i love it!! And it came with 2little samples of another product of theirs. Over all it came fast, well packaged, and the item itself is amazing! I reccomend this to anyone!!</li>
            <li> Bought a few of these for Xmas gifts. They sure were happy with the product</li>
            <li> Pretty colours. Bought these for my nieces and they loved it</li>
            <li> Made my lips dry.&lt;br /&gt;Red is very red. Makes you look like you have a koolaid stain on your lips. I&#x27;d recommend getting a pinker color for a more natural look.&lt;br /&gt;Staying power isn&#x27;t very good. Lasts around 2 hours on me.&lt;br /&gt;Also, you need to be careful when applying, because you can it on your teeth and removing that is a nightmare!</li>
            <li> Love how you can build up the color on this lip stain! I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on this when I wear it and it Is the perfect shade of red!</li>
            <li> This stuff is unique.  It is a very nice silky stain.  I plan on buying other colors.</li>
            <li> It was a little dry but after putting a little chapstick it feels better. Other than that I like this product a lot.</li>
            <li> Really nice, I like the effect it has, makes my lips look naturally more coloured instead of coated with something. It&#x27;s a really cute look, the only down side is that it goes away after a couple of hours so you&#x27;ll need to reapply it regularly. I still recommend it, it smells fruity, doesn&#x27;t have much of a taste? At least not that I noticed.</li>
            <li> I like it alot! I bought #1 cherry juice.The tint smells really nice. The color stains a bright cherry red, but dries really nice. It&#x27;s pigmented, so you don&#x27;t need to use too much. The texture is also very watery instead of gel-like.</li>
            <li> Longest lasting stain I have. Better than benetint!! Just pat it into your lips for more control.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. Just a dab on the center of the lips  and it will spread to fill in. A little too much and you end up with a mouthfu.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is adorable.</li>
            <li> It leaves a nice natural color on your lips for a few hours if your careful (not eating/drinking). I was pretty excited to find something comparable to Benetint and at a completely reasonable price.  The pigment lasts just as long as Benetint.  The disappointing factor is that is contains parabans but there is a longer list of bad ingredients in the pricier version. Not excusing, just saying....</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about buying liptints because I tried my friend&#x27;s (cheap) liptint and I didn&#x27;t see the magic at all. I gave Peripera a chance because I saw an interesting review. I definitely do not regret this purchase it at all. My lips are naturally darker and overpigmented because of years of chapped lips but with a bit of lipstick and a dab of the liptint, my lips look lush and gorgeous! To top it off, it fades into a more natural pink which is better than any lipstick I&#x27;ve ever used. However, it&#x27;s suggested that you make sure your lips aren&#x27;t too dry and is well moisturized before applying this tint or the stain will bring out any cracks. I&#x27;m definitely going to stock up on this in the future. :)</li>
            <li> I have a yellow undertone, I bought this because I have very long days..I am in my forties and don&#x27;t like that  heavy lipstick look during the day at my age.  This seems to go on a dark cherry red with my complexion but apparently soaks in quickly and leaves a mauve like color on my lips that last for hours, even if you drink your coffee ; ).  I plan on buying a few more.  Happy with this product indeed.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I bought so amazing Korea product. I just surprise by this nature beautiful color. Definitely highly highly recommended this beautiful lip to those girls to tried to find out nature lips.</li>
            <li> The packaging is so cute!  I love it...but...it&#x27;s not much of a stain.  It doesn&#x27;t last as long as I hoped.  That&#x27;s ok though.  It&#x27;s so cute, every time I pull it out of my purse, someone wants to steal it from me!</li>
            <li> I have darker skin, so I was kind of nervous to buy this. But I absolutely love it. The color is gorgeous and leaves your lips tinted for a good 5 hours. The only issue I have that it gets on your teeth and then it&#x27;s difficult to take it off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also wanted to try a Korea brand lip tint and I finally received this one I ordered! I&#x27;m still a noob to it but this product has a light weight feel to it and it is a water base. Easy to apply. Love it! It even came with free samples of other products .</li>
            <li> I apply occasionally, it depends if you drink much or eat, or maybe sweat , i apply two times only, but my sister need to apply more time. i like it, the texture and how the lips looks is awesome.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the staying power of this lip stain. I put it on and went about my day normally. I ate, drank, and even took a nap and it didn&#x27;t come off or smear, the color wasn&#x27;t as strong but it was still very visible on my lips. It dried quickly and had a matte finish. I have dry lips naturally and it wasn&#x27;t at all drying. I would&#x27;ve given it a higher rating if it didn&#x27;t feather out quite a bit so I think I might try a nude lip liner it also tends to emphasize fine lines on your lips. I am very impressed overall though.</li>
            <li> I love this lip tint. When I put it on it sometimes makes me feel like a vampire lol it sort of looks like blood when u put it on ur lips but If you mix it with a pinkish lipgloss it blends really well</li>
            <li> My favorite lip stain at the moment . (: I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> The color is darker than the picture. But I think that is because my lips are generally more pigmented by it self already. But even so, it still shows really well when I put it on. Very cherry like color. Make sure you lips are soft and moisten if you live in drier places like I do. It your lips are dry, it might show the dry skins and the wrinkles really well, or the color will not be as evenly disperse as you wanted it to. This is a nice tint, cheaper than the poise tint from benefit. Works the same.</li>
            <li> a lot more watery than I thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;not good to apply to dry lips as it just goes in the cracks</li>
            <li> This is a perfect color, not too pink and not too orange.  It adds a very natural and pretty flush to my cheeks and lips.</li>
            <li> I knew it would be a small tint, however its veryyy tiny. Because the tint is very pigmented and liquidy though, im hoping it will last a long time. It only takes me to dab 1 or 2 times on my lips for it to the job so yes. Its small but it looks cute. The color is very red and cherry-like as described.!</li>
            <li> It honestly looks like you have been bleeding all day and have dry lips. Other then that it has a lot of product and came on expected date.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfect! The color is great, and it stays for a good amount of time. The packaging is incredible, and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I love this tint!!! Like a lot! It has a very watery consistency and is very easy to apply. I think it lasts about 4-5 hours on me but that&#x27;s just fine. It looks N A T U R A L on me too. I love it.</li>
            <li> The product makes your lips look pretty, but you have to use lip balm before using it otherwise your lips will dry up like crazy. And do not let it go in your move, because the taste is horrible. Also, be careful when you put it on and do not put to much, because if you put to much it can go inside your mouth and your teeth will look like it has blood lol and let&#x27;s not forget the taste. It&#x27;s a nice product if you do not mind any of this.</li>
            <li> Im african-american (think of MAC&#x27;s shade NC42) and I was pleasantly surprised when this shade of red looked good on me. I haven&#x27;t had much luck with red shades (or lip stains for that matter) so I was glad when it was a prefect fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this stuff may contain some alcohol. I could smell it immediately upon application and about 10 mins later my lips were dry and peeling! So this was definitely a no-go for me. If it didnt contain any alcohol I would love this, but since it does I wont recommend it to anybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I thought the name &amp;#34;Tint Water&amp;#34; was just a marketing gimmick to make you buy it (ya know, &amp;#34;its so smooth it feels like water on your lips!&amp;#34;, that sorta thang) but this is actually a water-y, liquid-y based lip product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last like other stains I have. The gels are much better. It will bleed off your lips and stain your face if you are not careful when applying. If you have any wrinkles around your mouth, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Will last for a super long time. I got the cherry red and apply some with the brush and spread with my finger then apply Chapstick on top since it can be a bit drying. But color does not come off when kissing the skin. Great price also! Came faster than expected.</li>
            <li> Got it early, love the color, and definitely worth it, in the future I will be trying more colors, thank you!!</li>
            <li> Product is awesome and stays on.  Only complaint is the time waiting for the package.</li>
            <li> Very cute jar, but it comes out very wet and doesn&#x27;t stay on very long, it&#x27;s a nice dark shade of red and it lovely for the time it does stay on.</li>
            <li> This is really lovely on and exactly what I look for in a lip stain. It dries to having no texture, just lovely, flattering color. It didn&#x27;t last as long as I wanted, but I may re-purchase more colors anyway since the formula is so beautiful.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and was not really sure what to expect.  The tint water is in a bottle similar to a nail polish bottle (glass).  For this reason I keep it in its&#x27; box when I put it in my purse for work, as a little added protection.  The product is lovely.  Your lips need to be soft, but clean, so that the tint water can soak in.  If you want a light application (fainter color) then apply a little, sparingly, and rub your lips together.  If you want a more dramatic shade then simply apply more coats.  I do not find it drying, but I prefer to put a little clear lip balm on my lips for a bit of shine.  If you have a problem with feathering then you may want to use a lip pencil, but I have not needed to.  I need to reapply every few hours, but it&#x27;s so easy.  The color is a reddish pink, it is darker, but not dissimilar to my natural lip color.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Its very good for those who don&#x27;t like the thickness of a gloss or lipstick. It just needs to be re applied as much as a regular lip stick. But it is a very nice color.</li>
            <li> Cute packing. The product is a tinted liquid, so be careful not to tip it over because it may spill. Light coverage, doesn&#x27;t really give a pop of color and because it&#x27;s watery, it tends to disappear off your top lip due to gravity. I think this product is meant for achieving the ombr√© lip, which is popular in S. Korea, and would probably work best in conjunction with other K-beauty products. If not used to using some Korean beauty products, I would recommend viewing tips and tutorials on how best to use this product.</li>
            <li> But it probably depends on the amount of color you naturally have in your lips. For me, it was very red and looked dry. When I put a moisturizer over the color, the color came off fairly quickly. It took a long time to arrive.</li>
            <li> I am a medium complexion and this did nor work for me at all.  It is a very watery liquid and colors your lip in the way that your tongue gets colored when you eat a popsicle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you are very fair this might give your lips or cheeks a little pinched look, like a healthy flushed skin look  from heat or running etc.  But on my more tanned medium skin tone it looked strange.  Like I had accidentally gotten something reddish all over my mouth while eating or something.</li>
            <li> I bought that because it is cheap and I heard that it is as good as benefit tint. But I would say benefit do much better than this.Though this one is much cheaper, I don&#x27;t like the smell and the color looks unnatural.</li>
            <li> Really nice red, suitable for a night out and when you want to pop out from the crowd. It does not taste bitter, which I like. I deduct one star because it dries my lips and the if you don&#x27;t notice, your lips will look like it&#x27;s bleeding @@</li>
            <li> I liked it. I was so happy when it arrived but it happend to be poorly packaged. The box it came in was ripped and when I saw the product itself and I thought it was sooooo cute! It&#x27;s smaller but it looks exactly like the picture! The tint is literally liquid! But the sad thing about this is that the liquid tends to spread around VERY easily the first coulple of seconds when you apply it. The tint doesin&#x27;t stain my upper lip that much... Anyway, when the tint spreads around you can taste the tint. (It&#x27;s not good). Other than this it&#x27;s cute and very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;Repurchase? Honestly... No.</li>
            <li> pretty on the lips and lasts all day till you wash it off.</li>
            <li> I like this.  It&#x27;s cute but doesn&#x27;t last long.  Also, be careful as it can get on your teeth.  Good for tween daughter as lipstick alternative.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute a container  and it&#x27;s more of a watery consistency but once it dry it leaves the tint look.</li>
            <li> Like the color. It is o.k</li>
            <li> Thought it would take forever to get, but it didn&#x27;t. Used alone it gives almost a two tone lip color because on my lips it dyes the middle a deeper shade than the outer parts. This is easily corrected with a red lip pencil. All in all I really like it.</li>
            <li> I am 17 and I don&#x27;t really like lipstick so I came across lip tint and thought this would be good for now. I&#x27;m not a big fan of lipstick or Lip tint rather I like just putting on Carmex but somedays I want to look lively and I thought lip tint would be good . I thought cherry juice was a little bit lighter but seems like it was a little dark . Not like a red red color .  But I still like it . Days when I do put it on , I put altitude then get a piece of tissue paper - wet it - then take off alittle of the lip tint. The color instantly turns like a hot pinkish color - light pink . Really pretty and ALMOST natural :D love it</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be easy to put on honestly, but it really is water. It took a few tries to figure out how I want it to apply...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just put a little on where ever you want it to be and PRESS your lips together and rub them together slightly. I usually massage some lipbalm into mine since my lips dry very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the product but I wish it could apply like a stick or something but it does look very good. You can layer to get a stronger red if you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con about is it you can spill it if you aren&#x27;t careful and that you need to figure out how to apply it. It lasts awhile but I have dry lips and my top lip will not hold the color very long because of it. Oh well still love it</li>
            <li> Love it so much! I got it before the date it said it was going to be here so that&#x27;s a plus. I rate this a five because it got here fast, it passed the drinking and eating test, stayed on for hours, and to top it all off it looked great c: ~Crystal</li>
            <li> This is an amazing products, it has great color and staying power. I would totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t stay. It was a nice idea but it&#x27;s like having kool aid on your lips.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  It stays, tastes good, and I really like it! While it isn&#x27;t as vibrant as a lipstick or highly pigmented gloss, it still does a very good job--and isn&#x27;t sticky like the latter would be.</li>
            <li> This tint is so bitter that I never use it. The color that it provides is beautiful but the taste is overwhelming.</li>
            <li> The color is super great! Love it. Very build-able and works great for gradient effect. Make me look much whiter too. One thing that bothered me about it though is that it doesn&#x27;t last long. Especially, if you drink or eat. Also, It colors my lower lip really well, but not my upper lip even after exfoliating. it just runs down onto my teeth. So you have to dap it quickly.</li>
            <li> i love it. the color is perfect for me :)&lt;br /&gt;I buy in other colors. I like the ink for lips.</li>
            <li> Super pigmented and lasts forever!! Absolute fav!</li>
            <li> I really love stain because it makes you look alive and healthy. I have been searching for a good stain that will last through the day but is light enough not to look like i was in a slap fight. This stuff is GREAT. It is better then benetint, stainiac, stain dragon and a million others i have tried. It does apply a tiny bit uneven on the lips, but if you top it with some gloss or chap stick its perfect. I love this stuff. It has a slight cherry scent to it there is a tone of it and it comes with a sponge applicator, not the silly brushes other products have. I ordered another bottle already for back up. Love it.</li>
            <li> For my preference, I like that the texture is watery. The color is nice and pigmented as well. The tint lasts only a couple hours on my lips, but this has been the case with various lip products I have tried in general.</li>
            <li> These tints impart a fresh, soft flush of color to lips that really lasts.  My quest for the perfect lip tint is over!  Yay!</li>
            <li> This tint gives very strong color so I just have to apply a hint of it. I always have to use my lip balm with it, however, because it dries my lips.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I only bought it because I thought it was cool that amazon had korean cosmetic products even if they aren&#x27;t high end (think of maybelline or nyx?).&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t last very long at all (about three hours) and as it fades away, it starts looking like you&#x27;ve had too much kool-aid juice.&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, it&#x27;s decent for the price. Personally would not recommend to a friend or buy it for myself again.</li>
            <li> Lighter than the pictures, but it&#x27;s quite a decent lip stain.</li>
            <li> the product is too wet, and when i dab my mouth, the whole color comes off. it is not a tint-ter as described. it is too moist and easily erasable from the lips.</li>
            <li> It has a beautiful color, you can either make the trademark &amp;#34;gradient lips&amp;#34; or just fully color your lips with it and since it is tint water it will surely last for a long time. Will purchase again when I run out of it!</li>
            <li> Be sure to always follow up with a gloss... otherwise, it&#x27;s chapped lips like you&#x27;ve never seen!  However, will buy from again and recommend to friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could go down on the price... the shipping/handing fees are the killer.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color and presentation.  Not very long-lasting but you can always re-apply...specially because you do get a LOT of product! loved it!</li>
            <li> You can use this alone or with a lip concealer. The color looks very red so you don&#x27;t have to use too much. It can last a long time. The juice is not sticky.</li>
            <li> I love it! super long lasting, strong build able pigment! Like most tints, it can be drying so jus moisturize before/after application</li>
            <li> I actually really liked the product  , my only 2 complaints is that it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;A.not darker;which I fixed by adding 4 drops of black ink into&lt;br /&gt;B. It gets all over thr front of your teeth when applying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B is the only reason I&#x27;m giving this 4 out of 5. I do recommend this product to anyone looking for a cheaper and effective lip/cheek stain</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this lip tint. I love the cute packaging, the applicator wand works perfect for me, the cherry color really pops and looks great on my lips, AND it lasts all day at work! I&#x27;ve never been a lipstick fan, but stains work perfect for me because I like a little color on my lips as long as it&#x27;s natural looking. This is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> The item arrived one week before it was supposed! The packaging is really cute and the color is just perfect, very happy with it :)the only con would be that it doesnt have a very pleasant taste but it doesnt really bother me.</li>
            <li> Item very bad only water and not fixed i don&#x27;t like it and take long time to receive i don&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> I love lip tints and have tried numerous brands... Benetint, Etude House, Cynthia Rowley, Toly Moly, etc and this was my first Peripera and I love it. Bought it in cherry and it absorbed very quickly and left a nice stain. No sticky feeling and very watery. I love it and I think I&#x27;ll be getting the rest of the colors. Wears well and fades naturally. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great product! Shipment is fast!  I like this lip tint, looks natural!!!</li>
            <li> This items wasn&#x27;t what I expected! I knew that it was watery and I didn&#x27;t care cause I&#x27;ve used lip tint like it, but this one doesn&#x27;t tint lips as well as others. It has a great smell and the package is very cute but I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s worth the price. My lip tint out of food coloring lasted waaaay longer than this.</li>
            <li> MY DAUGHTER LOVE THE PRODUCT, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS OUTSTANDING SELLER AND PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Compared to Benefit Cha Cha tint/Benetint/Posietint&lt;br /&gt;-cheaper&lt;br /&gt;-peachy scented&lt;br /&gt;-coloring is more strong and vivid&lt;br /&gt;-smaller bottle, so less amount&lt;br /&gt;-since small, easy to carry around&lt;br /&gt;-the applying tip is cushioned not a brush</li>
            <li> I like the color of Tint Water, and the product arrived on time. Pretty good.</li>
            <li> The color was much more vibrant than expected but I love it! A little goes a long way. It fades a little as you go about your day, but it really can&#x27;t be helped if you&#x27;re are eating or drinking things. It&#x27;s only natural for any type of lip stain.</li>
            <li> Not as pretty as what I expected. Make my lip dry.</li>
            <li> It took two and a half weeks to arrive from Korea to my location (USA, West Coast), which was much faster than the estimated arrival date, which was a pleasant surprise. It&#x27;s just a simple lip stain that arrives in cute packaging for a great price (the Amazon price is half the price this product is sold at in Forever 21 or Urban Outfitters).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peripera is a trendy, low cost brand so I&#x27;d recommend it for teens/college students. This water tint is perfect for creating that ombre look that was popular in Korea. (It&#x27;s watery so you can sort of let the color drip to the bottom of your upper lip, or let the liquid pool on the inside of your bottom lip if you want. Otherwise, just evenly spread the product on your lips).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got cherry red, and it&#x27;s exactly that. It makes your lips look like you&#x27;ve just eaten a red popsicle. If you&#x27;re older, this color might be too candy red for you (it can make you look like a vampire lol). It&#x27;s very vivid and pigmented. It appears this shade is still trendy in Korea, as I&#x27;ve seen girls (on TV, youtube, etc) with pale skin still sporting a red lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I like lip stains to look natural, like my lips but better. So I use tiny miniscule dots on my lips to give my lips a slight flush of color (this product is very buildable). A little goes a long way. Even if I wore this everyday, this bottle will probably last me years lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry flaky lips, and I didn&#x27;t find it drying. And the stain lasts forever. I apply a chapstick with SPF (Kiss My Face Sport Lip Balm SPF 30) over it. It tastes faintly bitter, so it prevents me from licking my lips, which is a good thing. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this shade again (too red for me), but I&#x27;d like to try the other shades, like pink juice or orange juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extra notes: Lip stains are like a dye, so the dye can settle in lip lines. To prevent that, spread/blend the product quickly and evenly, perhaps using it in conjunction with a chapstick. If you apply the lip stain and notice dry flaky bits, you can rinse your lips and rub off the flaky bits and reapply the lip stain.</li>
            <li> Love this tint as a cheaper alternative to benetint. Its a gorgeous natural color. The only problem is that it needs to be reapplied, but I don&#x27;t mind doing that because its so nice!</li>
            <li> I use this on my cheek and lips.  A tiny bit is all I need.  I can see this whole bottle lasting me a long time.  It gives a pretty berry color and it is easy to spread.</li>
            <li> I like it just seems a little light for my skin color</li>
            <li> I love this stain. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as some other stains like it, but it goes well, and after applying with the applicator and my finger, it leaves a nice, berry stain. I really want the orange one now.</li>
            <li> For the price this can&#x27;t be beat. I didn&#x27;t use it on my lips but more as a cheek stain and the other ones I usually get from Ulta are $30. I did try it on my lips and it dried them out really badly but if you figured out how to not make it dry them out it&#x27;d be a great color on your lips as well. A little drop goes a long way so if you do use it as a cheek stain you only need the tiniest drop but it stays on most of the day. It will be perfect in the summer!&lt;br /&gt;Overall like I said for the price I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find anything else better. It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and I&#x27;ve used it every day since it showed up. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> The taste is awful lol don&#x27;t get it in your mouth. But it leaves a beautifully bright stain on your lips.</li>
            <li> Great lip tint!  I wasn&#x27;t too sure about buying this online especially since the colors can vary greatly from product  photos. Im glad I took a chance, the color is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> i really love this tint! &amp;#60;3</li>
