            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>but it did not trim well, as it kind of catches as you cut.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li>You better be able to figure how to use it because the instructions may as well be non-existent.  </li>
            <li>delivered very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Satisfied completely!!</li>
            <li>this trimmer will pay for itself the very first time it is used.  </li>
            <li>The one I ordered last year was much better.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t have to see the barber as much and save some money.  </li>
            <li>trims very well after replacing the factory blades with quality stainless steel blades.</li>
            <li>the adjustment dial is a real plus too.  </li>
            <li>I had to stop and clean the blades several times.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive (direct from China perhaps?), but arrived sooner than predicted.</li>

            <li> using this I can keep my thick hair thinned out between hair cuts.  Saves me money by not going as often.</li>
            <li> Threw it away after one attempt to trim my neck.  Awful.</li>
            <li> The Trimmer Comb was delivered on time. I used the comb and it works to my satisfaction. Now I don&#x27;t have to see the barber as much and save some money.  Jimbo</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive (direct from China perhaps?), but arrived sooner than predicted. It functions well and is adjustable. I gave it the highest rating because does what it is supposed to do at very low cost.</li>
            <li> work great for trimming my horses mane and tail</li>
            <li> Bought it for the wife, and se says it works great. She had another brand but you couldn&#x27;t change the blades.</li>
            <li> works well ... good product ... good service ...</li>
            <li> Did. Not know when I ordered it that it came from Hong Kong by slow boat (about a month).  That&#x27;s OK but it did not trim well, as it kind of catches as you cut.</li>
            <li> delivered very quickly.  trims very well after replacing the factory blades with quality stainless steel blades. the adjustment dial is a real plus too.  this trimmer will pay for itself the very first time it is used.  i intend to visit the barber about one-third as often as i used to.</li>
            <li> You better be able to figure how to use it because the instructions may as well be non-existent.  No problems else wise..</li>
            <li> love this it does a great job!</li>
            <li> There are no instructions on how to use or care for this.  I have no idea what to do with it.</li>
            <li> I used it to comb my dog ,expected blade to be sharper ,hardly any any results will use it and maybe learn the technique.</li>
            <li> The product arrived as advertised and on time.</li>
            <li> Someone said this had no way to change blades.  They must have been unable to read.  I like the adjustable blade feature.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this product again. I have two dogs with long hair and it simply didn&#x27;t cut the hair. I had to stop and clean the blades several times.</li>
            <li> Great. Kept me out of the Solon for an extra wheel</li>
            <li> This was a little different than what I had used in the past, but it did the job.  Satisfied completely!!</li>
            <li> The one I ordered last year was much better. I&#x27;m in my Florida home and didn&#x27;t bring it with me.</li>
            <li> A bit &amp;#34;flimsy&amp;#34; for the price.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works well between hair cuts.</li>
            <li> Great tool. Keeps me from going to the salon so often. Good price.</li>
