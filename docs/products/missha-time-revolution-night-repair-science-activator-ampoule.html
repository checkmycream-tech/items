            <li>Best product I&#x27;ve bought ever in my Korean skin care regiment.</li>
            <li>This worked great</li>
            <li>Not as great as I thought it would be but is moisturizing.</li>
            <li>ANR cannot win LOL.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>This is a great value.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product consistency: very nice.</li>
            <li>My skin looked nearly perfect before, so this was a huge shock.</li>
            <li>I am Korean-American, have fair skin and lots of freckles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good night cream</li>
            <li>You can tell its packed full of good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs: perfectly!</li>
            <li>Love this night time serum!</li>
            <li>sure to drink lots of water too, as it will help with skin texture and elasticity!</li>
            <li>Will probably purchase again if i didnt love exploring korean skincare products!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing</li>
            <li>It feels so nice on my face.</li>
            <li>and my skin is loving it.  </li>
            <li>I am not kidding you, the longer I use this accompanied by the Time Revolution Essence, my under eyes are continually looking better and better!</li>
            <li>any more acne&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I love the smoothness of my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a skin care geek and this is my all time favorite serum.</li>
            <li>My favorite ampuole.</li>
            <li>A good and economical replacement to Estee Lauder nightime repair serum.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Healthy night mousturizer&lt;br /&gt;Missha</li>
            <li>I do have to apply a cream on top to seal in all the moisture.</li>
            <li>I love the texture of this ampoule.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed the most results using this almost immediately.</li>
            <li>I soooo wanted to love this product after reading all the rave reviews about it.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Great for my sensitive</li>
            <li>Love the rich and moisturizing texture of the ampoule.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told that Missha was a good brand to start when new to Korean skin care products.</li>
            <li>Works great on fine lines and overall texture.</li>
            <li>Glides on smoothly and does not feel sticky.</li>
            <li>My skin feels really smooth.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any real benefits beyond some hydration, but it feels nice, doesn&#x27;t break me out, and it&#x27;s a generous size.</li>
            <li>I think its definitely important as part of not just a Missha Time Revolution routine but</li>
            <li>It feels so light.</li>
            <li>After using it for the first day, my skin was already noticeably clearer and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Banila Clean it Zero cleansing Balm&lt;br</li>
            <li>This serum, colloquially known as the &amp;#34;Longer Name&amp;#34; ampoule, is nothing special.</li>
            <li>I love it sooo much.</li>
            <li>so its a bit thicker (probably coz its jam packed full of goodness!)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does absorb quickly into my skin and does not have any smell to it at all.</li>
            <li>aside from one on my forehead, so I think this just isn&#x27;t what I need right now.</li>
            <li>Love love love and will never go back to other ampoules.</li>
            <li>This ampoule has a lot of good ingredients, but I&#x27;m just not seeing the same benefits as when I use other, more targeted ampoules.</li>
            <li>Love this product and will definitely be buying it again when I run out.</li>
            <li>I would recommend getting samples of this first on EBay and seeing how it reacts with your skin.</li>
            <li>I have dry somewhat sensitive skin and this works great so far!</li>
            <li>I use this product before the bed and it makes my skin look healthy and glow all day long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and haven&#x27;t seen any miraculous changes, but my skin seems to be turning over more quickly and some acne scarring is fading a bit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that cheap, but one bottle lasts me several months!</li>
            <li>I see improvement to the texture of my skin and it feels really moisturized.</li>
            <li>This advice was very helpful for me.</li>
            <li>I really like this serum.</li>
            <li>It works for me really well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 35 with oily skin that easily dehydrates, large pores, redness and PIH, closed comedones, and an acne flare-up that was triggered by weight loss.</li>
            <li>I am on my second bottle and while I do enjoy using this product at night, Missha has stated that the retinol in this product is 0.0004, barely any to make a difference, so while I do enjoy using it on my face, I do not think it will help that much in the long run</li>
            <li>I highly recomend.</li>
            <li>Not thick like a serum supposed to be.</li>
            <li>and I noticed my skin looked much better within a few days.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin type with no drying/oily issues after application.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft in the morning!</li>
            <li>The product does its job without going so far as to bleach my skin.  </li>
            <li>I would buy it again from this supplier of I cannot get it directly from Missha.</li>
            <li>But then again I am in my early 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li>The thin skin appears thicker, the lines are so much less and the skin is beautiful.</li>
            <li>Love this product, so little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Unlike the more expensive versions, it doesn&#x27;t contain any acne triggers and has less, more naturally derived ingredients.</li>
            <li>It felt ok the first few days of using it, but then I started getting small spots on my face - not a big deal but certainly the opposite of what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>The Missha Ampoule contains Bifida Ferment Lysate, an ingredient found in many other skincare products (including the expensive Est√©e Lauder Advanced Night Repair) which is proven to improve skin elasticity and minimize signs of aging.</li>
            <li>but I expected too much from it after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>Thick but absorbs easily and the thinkness is actually very different from any product ive ever tried.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> like the results so far,but need to continue use longer to give you a definitive</li>
            <li> I received this week ago. Normally, I dont write reviews on products skin products because I like to wait a few months see results but so far this along with a few other Japanese and Korean products has already caused a noticeable change in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin: combination but acne prone. Some dullness and spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product consistency: very nice. Thick but absorbs easily and the thinkness is actually very different from any product ive ever tried. You can tell its packed full of good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs: perfectly! I am the type of person who despises those products that just sit on the skin and cause stickiness. This one doesnt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acne: It has not blogged my pores or caused any more acne&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: My skin is actually glowing and my pores look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 5 stars. Will update if there are any adverse affects eventually!</li>
            <li> Love this night time serum! Glides on smoothly and does not feel sticky. My skin feels really smooth. Not sure if it is doing anything else, but I love the smoothness of my face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any noticeable improvements to my skin.  Also, I had to give away my bottle because it caused my skin to break out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a skin care geek and this is my all time favorite serum. Whenever I stop using it my skin looks dull and less moisturized. It does not cause any breakouts or irritation for me and I credit this with filling in some minor eye wrinkles. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and I plan to keep repurchasing. It&#x27;s not that cheap, but one bottle lasts me several months!</li>
            <li> My favorite ampuole. I wouldn&#x27;t be without it. Calms and softens my skin like nothing else. Works great on fine lines and overall texture.</li>
            <li> Love love love and will never go back to other ampoules. This worked great and I noticed my skin looked much better within a few days.</li>
            <li> I am not kidding you, the longer I use this accompanied by the Time Revolution Essence, my under eyes are continually looking better and better! The thin skin appears thicker, the lines are so much less and the skin is beautiful. My eye cream hasn&#x27;t arrived yet so I have been using these under my eyes as well as my face and I am so happy with the results.!</li>
            <li> I love it sooo much. It feels so nice on my face.</li>
            <li> This serum, colloquially known as the &amp;#34;Longer Name&amp;#34; ampoule, is nothing special. I haven&#x27;t seen any real benefits beyond some hydration, but it feels nice, doesn&#x27;t break me out, and it&#x27;s a generous size. I&#x27;ll finish off the bottle, but it&#x27;s definitely not a re-purchase. I&#x27;m 35 with oily skin that easily dehydrates, large pores, redness and PIH, closed comedones, and an acne flare-up that was triggered by weight loss. I use AHA and BHA to exfoliate and treat the pores and comedones, so I look for soothing products that won&#x27;t further exacerbate the acne. This ampoule has a lot of good ingredients, but I&#x27;m just not seeing the same benefits as when I use other, more targeted ampoules. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles (yet...) aside from one on my forehead, so I think this just isn&#x27;t what I need right now.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft in the morning! It feels great!&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to drink lots of water too, as it will help with skin texture and elasticity!</li>
            <li> Love the rich and moisturizing texture of the ampoule. I have dry somewhat sensitive skin and this works great so far! Alittle goes a long way too. Will probably purchase again if i didnt love exploring korean skincare products!</li>
            <li> A good and economical replacement to Estee Lauder nightime repair serum.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use this product before the bed and it makes my skin look healthy and glow all day long.</li>
            <li> Not as great as I thought it would be but is moisturizing. Havent seen a lot of whitening effect.</li>
            <li> Very thick and moisturizing! Great for my sensitive</li>
            <li> Coming from across the world and with standard shipping, I expected this to arrive a little less than a month later, yet it arrived in about one week! I have been using this product for about a week and my skin is loving it.  I use it only at night so I can keep the product longer, but my skin has noticeably cleared up.  Love this product and will definitely be buying it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s doing anything for my face. It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks using this product. It has a sticky feeling. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
            <li> I take skin care seriously and have just adopted a 9 step Korean beauty regime.  I have been using this item in concert with others, but feel that it has improved my skin condition.  I use it day and night even though it is labeled as a night cream.  I have normal skin type with no drying/oily issues after application.  Just a few drops will work so this bottle should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My regime:&lt;br /&gt;Banila Clean it Zero cleansing Balm&lt;br /&gt;Skinfood Egg White Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Benton Aloe Toner&lt;br /&gt;Missha Essence Mist&lt;br /&gt;Missha Time Revolution Night Repair&lt;br /&gt;Mizon Snail Mucus Eye cream&lt;br /&gt;Caudalie Poly-Phenol Eye mousturizer&lt;br /&gt;Bee Healthy night mousturizer&lt;br /&gt;Missha Sun Milk SPF 50</li>
            <li> I tried both Missha and Estee ANR! ANR cannot win LOL. Missha even contains &amp;#34;Niacinamide&amp;#34; which brightens your skin tone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 6 months and it&#x27;s great. I see improvement to the texture of my skin and it feels really moisturized. I do have to apply a cream on top to seal in all the moisture. Someone mentioned the stickiness but once I apply the cream I don&#x27;t even notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told that Missha was a good brand to start when new to Korean skin care products. This advice was very helpful for me. I hope this helps you out too.</li>
            <li> I thought the Korean skincare routine was just hype. But now that I exclusively use Korean skincare products, my skin has gotten clearer, lighter, the crepe-iness on my forehead has practically disappeared. I am 41 and soon to turn 42 and I now have no wrinkles. I am Korean-American, have fair skin and lots of freckles.</li>
            <li> This is a great value. The Missha Ampoule contains Bifida Ferment Lysate, an ingredient found in many other skincare products (including the expensive Est√©e Lauder Advanced Night Repair) which is proven to improve skin elasticity and minimize signs of aging. Unlike the more expensive versions, it doesn&#x27;t contain any acne triggers and has less, more naturally derived ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of this ampoule. I am on my second bottle and while I do enjoy using this product at night, Missha has stated that the retinol in this product is 0.0004, barely any to make a difference, so while I do enjoy using it on my face, I do not think it will help that much in the long run and I will have to switch products.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and haven&#x27;t seen any miraculous changes, but my skin seems to be turning over more quickly and some acne scarring is fading a bit. It&#x27;s moisturizing, but not greasy.</li>
            <li> My skin has been glowing since using this!! I highly recomend. I cant wait to continue using this.</li>
            <li> The product does its job without going so far as to bleach my skin.  When I use this after a toner, I notice that it halts hyper pigmentation.  Blemishes do not seem to go as dark as they normally would, which means that the lighten up faster.  I would buy it again from this supplier of I cannot get it directly from Missha.</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve bought ever in my Korean skin care regiment. This product is amazing and I&#x27;ve noticed the most results using this almost immediately. After using it for the first day, my skin was already noticeably clearer and healthy looking. Love it!</li>
            <li> My skin LOVES this stuff! I think its definitely important as part of not just a Missha Time Revolution routine but any other skin regimen brand you may have. Definitely essential. The texture goes on smooth but not like typical essence (which is usually watery)..it has a consistency like a serum so its a bit thicker (probably coz its jam packed full of goodness!)&lt;br /&gt;I use this and wake up the next day and my skin glows. It works for me really well. I hope it works for you!</li>
            <li> I soooo wanted to love this product after reading all the rave reviews about it. It is very thick, so a little does go a long way, so with the price you are certainly getting your money&#x27;s worth. It felt ok the first few days of using it, but then I started getting small spots on my face - not a big deal but certainly the opposite of what I was expecting. I washed my face tonight and I look like a pimply teenager! My skin looked nearly perfect before, so this was a huge shock. I would recommend getting samples of this first on EBay and seeing how it reacts with your skin. Giving away my bottle...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every night for about 3 weeks and haven&#x27;t seen any drastic changes. It does absorb quickly into my skin and does not have any smell to it at all. It&#x27;s a good night cream I guess but I expected too much from it after reading the reviews. But then again I am in my early 20&#x27;s so that might have to do with why I don&#x27;t see any changes.</li>
            <li> Love this. It feels so light. Not thick like a serum supposed to be.</li>
            <li> Love this product, so little goes a long way.</li>
