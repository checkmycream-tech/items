            <li> What many physical therapists use. great product</li>
            <li> Great overall experience!</li>
            <li> This item was stolen in transit to the post office. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else for my clients. (Massage Therapist)</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  It helps alleviate my pain.</li>
            <li> Great massage cream for soft tissue work!!</li>
            <li> I went for a professional massage and noticed the masseuse was using this product.  Ordered it on Amazon and love it.  It&#x27;s lasted us for ages and is not at all greasy.</li>
            <li> easy to refill and cap flips open easily.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m working on my coworkers buying it for themselves&lt;br /&gt;.... .... ...</li>
            <li> Such a durable cream that gives a great glide!</li>
            <li> the best massage product for deep tissue or swedish, in my humble opinion</li>
            <li> Excellent product. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Made my nands feel better</li>
            <li> Love this cream!  I have been using it for 9 years and it is still great!</li>
            <li> I have heard that Arnica helps with vericose veins... so I decided to find something online. This cream regardless of it&#x27;s properties is a great massaging cream. I use it every day on my legs and massage in the places where my veins are. It&#x27;s nice and creamy and not oily but definitely moisturizes as well. It&#x27;s a nice big tube too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a massage therapist since 2004 and have used this product for years. It is a very good product however when I ordered this product I got it out of the package and it was the product package but it was not the product inside. It Wade a lotion not a cream and the smell was terrible. If u find this product it is a great product but this product is not what it is supposed to be</li>
            <li> Great massage lotion with healing properties</li>
            <li> With the cream carrier easier to use than the Arnicare Gel.  I will reserve judgment on effectiveness pending more experience. We can expect to see more combinations using arnica.</li>
            <li> This creme was O.K. for sore mucles.  I eneded up ordering multiple cremes and discovered some I preferred much better than this one.  It&#x27;s certainly O.K. if you don&#x27;t have anything else.  Goes on fine anbd is quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li> I usually order it in the gallon size and fill the tubes myself. If you haven&#x27;t worked with this before it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> Seller gave prompt service. I love this massage cream, I haven&#x27;t found anything better!</li>
            <li> Great for all around modality massage</li>
            <li> Great cream, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  It is very soothing for sore achey bruises and muscles.  Does not stain.  It is easy to work with and has a pleasant, light fragrance.</li>
