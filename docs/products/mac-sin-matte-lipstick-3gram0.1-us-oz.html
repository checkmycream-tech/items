            <li> People reviewing saying the lipstick is dry or doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly: I always apply a thin amount of Chapstick before I apply my lipstick...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it at all, It can&#x27;t be used, It is so so so dry.</li>
            <li> This is not the color I expected.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s not as creamy as I expected</li>
            <li> im a dark skin african americain idian and black and</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just a little bit harder to apply.</li>
            <li> This is the lipstick to use if you want the dark vampy look.</li>
            <li> The dark color suits any skin tone.</li>
            <li> False advertisement</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t like it at all, It can&#x27;t be used, It is so so so dry. I am really disappointed.</li>

            <li> I LOVE M.A.C. Lipsticks!  This color, perfect!</li>
            <li> Is very pretty but a little darker than i thought</li>
            <li> I was expecting something lighter like real deep purple.</li>
            <li> person is enjoying the item</li>
            <li> This is not the color I expected.</li>
            <li> Love the color! Good shipping time as well.</li>
            <li> Nice choice, lipstick shade in person is the same as picture</li>
            <li> Very well pigmented and matte. The dark color suits any skin tone. People reviewing saying the lipstick is dry or doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly: I always apply a thin amount of Chapstick before I apply my lipstick... I never have had that problem as well</li>
            <li> everything you think it is..awesome!!! I get soo many compliments. Looks great on all skin tones.</li>
            <li> Love this color i did double coats its a matt lipstick and im a dark skin african americain idian and black and this color is just gorge</li>
            <li> Loved it no complaints</li>
            <li> I love this color! Just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Strong pigment and long lasting</li>
            <li> Love love love this color :)</li>
            <li> I have SIN by MAC and the color on this picture is not the right color. SIN is a brown color not a plum color. False advertisement</li>
            <li> Again.  It is MAC.  High quality and perfect.</li>
            <li> This lipstick looks great it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s not as creamy as I expected and it&#x27;s just a little bit harder to apply. Also when I apply it it&#x27;s kind of blotchy but I think it&#x27;s because I never put on lip liner. Overall I love this color!</li>
            <li> Definitely my fav so far love the way it compliments my skin tone. Already have tons og compliments!</li>
