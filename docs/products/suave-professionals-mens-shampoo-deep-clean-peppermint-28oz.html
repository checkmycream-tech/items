            <li>It is nice to have it shipped automatically</li>
            <li>Nice mint scent, cleans hair without drying.</li>
            <li>However, if you use some conditioner (any kind) that should fix the problem.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo, my hair is nice and soft and the shampoo smells good.</li>
            <li>This stuff works just as well as the name brand top of the line products for men.</li>

            <li>It lather up perfectly and it really deep cleans the hair.</li>
            <li>I was looking for more of a peppermint smell.</li>
            <li>it smells very nice and cleans my hair very well every time.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty good too.</li>
            <li>Good price, same good Suave quality.</li>
            <li>Does NOT smell like peppermint, it smells like a clean scent, but not peppermint at all!</li>
            <li>i use this every couple of days and so far i&#x27;m happy every time.</li>
            <li>whatever perfume they use to make this stuff is way to strong.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this shampoo, it smells great, cleans well and has a low price.  </li>
            <li>cheap</li>
            <li>This is my go to cheap shampoo.  </li>
            <li>My hair gets greasy and this really cuts through that leaving a nice clean feeling.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the great low price!</li>
            <li>It gets my hair and scalp clean without any residue.</li>
            <li>What can I say, it clean hair and seems to do so well.  </li>
            <li>love this shampoo for my husband, only kind he likes using on a daily basis, and the price with the extra savings I got was great!</li>
            <li>The really low price was good.</li>
            <li>Not bad for price.</li>
            <li>Nice masculine fragrance, mild dandruff-eliminating capability.  </li>
            <li>It also tingles a little bit which feels good on my scalp!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say if the tingling is good or bad, but it feels good so 5 stars!</li>
            <li>It gets everything right out</li>
            <li>I bought this because I like another shampoo that is $20 more, but this one is just a basic shampoo.  </li>
            <li>With the salon brands you are usually hit with a clean refreshing smell as your shampooing, you don&#x27;t get that from this product, but you do get your hair clean, which I guess is the point.</li>
            <li>I would call it a clean smell ... far from peppermint.</li>
            <li>I feel it does as good as Salon brands I have used in the past (Crew, Redkin).  </li>
            <li>A good product, sometimes hard to find.  </li>
            <li>I gave this 5/5 because it really does what it says…</li>
            <li>Also, there&#x27;s no peppermint scent that I could detect, not that that really matters.  </li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>2 stars for the clean smell and price, a big jug.</li>
            <li>This specific shampoo is especially good if you are someone who has thick hair and uses a lot of styling products on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Leaves a nice clean smell behind!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really have the peppermint smell to me, especially after showering.</li>
            <li>I love this as a cleansing shampoo because I am a daily heavy user of leave in conditioners.  </li>
            <li>No other shampoo can do that for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one to care about the brand of shampoo or conditioner that I use generally speaking</li>
            <li>Exactly the same in terms of quality as other shampoos three times the price.</li>
            <li>Since this is a &amp;#34;deep clean&amp;#34; shampoo, I did notice that it can dry out the hair a little bit, even though it&#x27;s fine to use this on a daily basis.</li>

            <li> This size should last me a real long time!</li>
            <li> At amazon&#x27;s price and size of the bottle it lasts for a long time.</li>

            <li> Seems a bit watered down though from what I recall a couple of years back.  </li>

            <li> one less thing for me to pick up at the store.</li>
            <li> This suave also dried up my hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think your getting peppermint because this hardly even smells like peppermint.  </li>

            <li> love this shampoo for my husband, only kind he likes using on a daily basis, and the price with the extra savings I got was great!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to get this product because of the word peppermint, however I like the smell. I would call it a clean smell ... far from peppermint.</li>
            <li> It smells soooooooooooooooooo good. Leaves a nice clean smell behind! Not bad for price. It is well worth the great low price! Soooooooooovlove it!</li>
            <li> This stuff works just as well as the name brand top of the line products for men. Lasts forever as well.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shampoo, it smells great, cleans well and has a low price.  It is nice to have it shipped automatically so he never runs out!  one less thing for me to pick up at the store.</li>
            <li> This is so good for the price you&#x27;re paying. Smells delicious, works great. My fianc&amp;eacute; loves it and we&#x27;ll be buying it from now on.</li>
            <li> I love this as a cleansing shampoo because I am a daily heavy user of leave in conditioners.  This item works extremely well to remove build up.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> cheap and you can tell. whatever perfume they use to make this stuff is way to strong. you come out of the shower smelling like you just went through the makeup section at macys.</li>
            <li> Got this for a great price with the coupon.  It seems to lather real good!  Don&#x27;t think your getting peppermint because this hardly even smells like peppermint.  This size should last me a real long time!</li>
            <li> I was hoping the peppermint scent would be stronger.  It&#x27;s not.  It also doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of tingle or scent after using.</li>
            <li> Bought this at walmart for like $3! Rip off if you buy it here online. Does NOT smell like peppermint, it smells like a clean scent, but not peppermint at all! Does not leave a tingling sensation as i hoped for, head and shoulders mint leaves a coo, tingling sensation! This suave also dried up my hair. 2 stars for the clean smell and price, a big jug.</li>
            <li> My husband won&#x27;t use anything else. Exactly the same in terms of quality as other shampoos three times the price. Nice mint scent, cleans hair without drying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to care about the brand of shampoo or conditioner that I use generally speaking but I love the peppermint smell of this shampoo. It also tingles a little bit which feels good on my scalp! I can&#x27;t say if the tingling is good or bad, but it feels good so 5 stars!</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a great minty scent and is also great at moisturizing my hair. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is simply a great, great, shampoo! This is definitely my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; shampoo, and I have been using this for a very long time now. It lather up perfectly and it really deep cleans the hair. This specific shampoo is especially good if you are someone who has thick hair and uses a lot of styling products on a daily basis. It gets everything right out and you will have no remaining residue. Since this is a &amp;#34;deep clean&amp;#34; shampoo, I did notice that it can dry out the hair a little bit, even though it&#x27;s fine to use this on a daily basis. However, if you use some conditioner (any kind) that should fix the problem. The smell is pretty good too. It doesn&#x27;t have a fruity smell or anything like that. The mint smell is there, but it&#x27;s not very strong (as other people have mentioned in other reviews). Overall, I would say this is one of the best shampoos I have used (for the price) and it just works perfectly every time! I use this shampoo over the much more expensive ones, because the more expensive ones don&#x27;t work as well for me. I gave this 5/5 because it really does what it says…</li>
            <li> I was expecting a much stronger scent from the peppermint - hardly notice it at all. Does its job though.</li>
            <li> This is my go to cheap shampoo.  I feel it does as good as Salon brands I have used in the past (Crew, Redkin).  The only difference I notice is the lack of fragrance.  With the salon brands you are usually hit with a clean refreshing smell as your shampooing, you don&#x27;t get that from this product, but you do get your hair clean, which I guess is the point.</li>
            <li> It does not smell like peppermint at all.  I bought this because I like another shampoo that is $20 more, but this one is just a basic shampoo.  Do not buy it if you like the smell of peppermint.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, my hair is nice and soft and the shampoo smells good. I would buy this stuff again, it actually works!</li>
            <li> Nice masculine fragrance, mild dandruff-eliminating capability.  We also use it on the dog.  I&#x27;m sorry it&#x27;s no longer offered on Subscribe And Save.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really have the peppermint smell to me, especially after showering. The longevity isn&#x27;t anything to run home about, but the smell could be improved.</li>
            <li> Good price, same good Suave quality. I was looking for more of a peppermint smell. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> A good product, sometimes hard to find.  Seems a bit watered down though from what I recall a couple of years back.  Also, there&#x27;s no peppermint scent that I could detect, not that that really matters.  It gets my hair and scalp clean without any residue.</li>
            <li> I will keep it simple. If you are a guy like me who just wants to clean your hair and scalp with the least amount of hassle and for the least amount of money, this is the product. My hair gets greasy and this really cuts through that leaving a nice clean feeling. No other shampoo can do that for the price. It&#x27;s my go to shampoo!</li>
            <li> What can I say, it clean hair and seems to do so well.  Plus it&#x27;s very inexpensive.  Smells good too.</li>
            <li> Smells good but doesn&#x27;t feel like a quality shampoo.  I will probably move it to the guest shower.  They compare themselves to American Crew...not the same.  The really low price was good.</li>
            <li> i use this every couple of days and so far i&#x27;m happy every time. it smells very nice and cleans my hair very well every time.</li>
            <li> Love the way it cleans but the smell is the best part.  this also works great for a all over body wash.  At amazon&#x27;s price and size of the bottle it lasts for a long time.</li>
