            <li>I absolutely adore these gel eyeliners!!!</li>
            <li>This is a good product for a very fair price and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>The brush has a fine tip that lets you apply it right</li>
            <li>When I wore it, it went on great and smoothly, but after just a half hour, it already went into my crease and smudged.</li>
            <li>I love it the black smears but the blue is great!</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Just right amount of gloss with ease of application.</li>
            <li>It does not have the right consistency to get on the brush or your face.  </li>
            <li>Love the color, just enough shimmer to make the eyes pop....</li>
            <li>I bought this item because I love cream eyeliner, and my favorite one by Smashbox brand is considerably more expensive.</li>
            <li>This item goes on smoothly and the color is deep and true.</li>
            <li>The amount of product you get is also generous, a real value!</li>
            <li>Pretty color though.</li>
            <li>but it is pretty.  </li>
            <li>Really like it!</li>
            <li>This is not quite the color shown on the screen - it is more of an ice blue, but I still like the color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>;)sablemist</li>
            <li>It is easy to put on as much or as little as you like and the color is very true to the picture.</li>
            <li>correct this by just not using too much in the first place.</li>
            <li>This was not as intense a color as I wanted</li>
            <li>/&gt;Who wants to arrive on their vacation with raccoon eyes?</li>
            <li>I expected more.  </li>
            <li>and it is very</li>
            <li>It really does ( i have a droopy eyelid and it rubs and smudges it)</li>
            <li>This particular color is so flattering as well.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s with all these high reviews on this product - are they bogus?  </li>
            <li>In the pot it looks like a rich dark colour, but in use it seems like it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of pigment.  </li>
            <li>I recently splurged on my old favorite, the smashbox cream eyeliner...and guess what, it let me down (don&#x27;t know, maybe they changed the formula?)</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly, rich color and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Please Keep These Colors Alive...</li>
            <li>would rather spend $20.00 on liner that actually stays on for an entire day, even on very humid days, swimming or traveling.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I was definitely pleasantly surprised and would not hesitate to order other colors.</li>
            <li> It defines as well as black, but the blue offers and whitening and brightening affect to the eye.</li>
            <li> The gel itself is creamy and takes a bit to dry.</li>
            <li> but it comes off when wet.</li>
            <li> not exactly what i was expecting with the brush</li>
            <li> Navy or Midnight Blue is so hard to find in liner or mascara...</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;glitter\\&quot; of if is hard to get off, and a thick line, leaves you cleaning your upper eyelid constantly.</li>
            <li> Slight shimmer...not metallic.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of this.</li>
            <li> A little hard to get to stick to the brush</li>
            <li> The product was not old or defective in that way, it&#x27;s just a very poor cream eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> Keep in mind, that if you layer it too thickly, you may experience a transfer of color onto your lid....</li>
            <li> It is not waterproof - unless they mean for immediate run - it doesn&#x27;t do that -</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to find a brush thin enough for the line</li>
            <li> also the aplicator brush doesn&#x27;t make as thin of a line as I like.</li>
            <li> The brush is a weird shape, elongated not angled, so doesn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately it smears and you need to reapply it two to three times in a day</li>
            <li> is not waterproof, is not smudgeproof, and it runs :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I reallly like this product, the effect is between eyeliner and shadow.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for a very fair price and will last a long time. I&#x27;m not a big gel fan but this is better than others I have tried. Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Love the color, just enough shimmer to make the eyes pop....go&#x27;s on smooth. You do need to let it set up about 30 to 40 seconds......</li>
            <li> It applies with ease, but I made the assumption that it would \\&quot;dry\\&quot; no it doesn&#x27;t, and therefore smears all over.  The \\&quot;glitter\\&quot; of if is hard to get off, and a thick line, leaves you cleaning your upper eyelid constantly.</li>
            <li> Nice eyeliner very easy to go on and has a soft look.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because I love cream eyeliner, and my favorite one by Smashbox brand is considerably more expensive. This item goes on smoothly and the color is deep and true. It allows for blending for about a minute or two before it begins to set-up to a finish. Keep in mind, that if you layer it too thickly, you may experience a transfer of color onto your lid....correct this by just not using too much in the first place. I recently splurged on my old favorite, the smashbox cream eyeliner...and guess what, it let me down (don&#x27;t know, maybe they changed the formula?) but I&#x27;m back to my Starry brand....its better! The amount of product you get is also generous, a real value! This particular color is so flattering as well. It defines as well as black, but the blue offers and whitening and brightening affect to the eye. Slight shimmer...not metallic.</li>
            <li> The brush it comes with is a handy but not necessarily the best to grab lots of color. The gel itself is creamy and takes a bit to dry. If you don&#x27;t let it sit enough, it&#x27;ll smear some. Pretty color though.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is great.  It is easy to put on as much or as little as you like and the color is very true to the picture.</li>
            <li> Just right amount of gloss with ease of application. I like it !</li>
            <li> I like it better than a pencil or crayon.  It is easy to apply and the color is great.</li>
            <li> This was not as intense a color as I wanted but it is pretty.  It is not, however, indelible or waterproof and on a warm day I can certainly see how it may pose a problem.</li>
            <li> Lovely color. I will reorder again.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this eyeliner. Goes on smoothly, rich color and long lasting. Great price was a bonus.</li>
            <li> I love it the black smears but the blue is great!</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and lasts all day or evening. I was definitely pleasantly surprised and would not hesitate to order other colors. It&#x27;s really beautiful!</li>
            <li> I liked it a lot I use this brand for all my colored eyeliners</li>
            <li> is not waterproof, is not smudgeproof, and it runs :( When I wore it, it went on great and smoothly, but after just a half hour, it already went into my crease and smudged. I don&#x27;t think I would be back.</li>
            <li> I love the color of this eye liner. It is very difficult to find a brush thin enough for the line I want.&lt;br /&gt;I do not know why it is called waterproof. It smudges on a humid day never mind wearing it on the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not purchase this again. I bought it in (2) colors. I am glad it was cheap, which proves, you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;I would rather spend $20.00 on liner that actually stays on for an entire day, even on very humid days, swimming or traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who wants to arrive on their vacation with raccoon eyes? I fell asleep on the plane and woke up looking like Tammy Faye!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s with all these high reviews on this product - are they bogus?  I just got this in the mail, tried it once, and immediately threw it out.  The product was not old or defective in that way, it&#x27;s just a very poor cream eyeliner.  It does not have the right consistency to get on the brush or your face.  In the pot it looks like a rich dark colour, but in use it seems like it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of pigment.  Not that sparkly or shimmery.  The brush is a weird shape, elongated not angled, so doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I used my own.  I expected more.  Waste of money.  e.l.f. is much better in this price point.</li>
            <li> Beautiful blue color and easy to use, but it makes my eyes tear.</li>
            <li> not exactly what i was expecting with the brush but i do like it and im definitely pleased with the color!</li>
            <li> I have blond hair and the blue eyeliner is great. Goes on smooth and stay&#x27;s all day. The brush has a fine tip that lets you apply it right where you want it. You can go bold or very fine whatever look you are looking for.</li>
            <li> Really like it! Brush allows for a nice thin line...and the color is perfect&#x27;</li>
            <li> The Starry Eyeliner gels are excellent; I have four colors now. The midnight sky is beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;I have hazel eyes and it is very complementary.&lt;br /&gt;The gel liner glides on easily and is easy to work with.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. I had been told to try eyeliner gel instead of liquid or pencil, because I had been told you have much more control over gel. Now that I&#x27;ve tried it, I feel like my pencils can&#x27;t compare! This is a great brand, too. Easy to work with and not cakey at all. I wish all of my liners were gel.</li>
            <li> This is not quite the color shown on the screen - it is more of an ice blue, but I still like the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator is to die for.  It applies smooth and evenly.  It is not waterproof - unless they mean for immediate run - it doesn&#x27;t do that - but it comes off when wet.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of this. A co worker suggested this to me becasue she said it was good and didn&#x27;t smudge when on. It really does ( i have a droopy eyelid and it rubs and smudges it) also the aplicator brush doesn&#x27;t make as thin of a line as I like.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore these gel eyeliners!!! Navy or Midnight Blue is so hard to find in liner or mascara...Please Keep These Colors Alive...;)sablemist</li>
            <li> Color great but unfortunately it smears and you need to reapply it two to three times in a day</li>
            <li> A little hard to get to stick to the brush but it does stay on all day once you apply it</li>
