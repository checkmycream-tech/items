            <li>I love having this shampoo in my \\&quot;hair arsenal.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I LOVE ANYTHING PAUL MITCHELL</li>
            <li>i love the scent of this shampoo, kinda coconut-y beach-y scent.</li>
            <li>A great clarifying shampoo and gentle.</li>
            <li>I am going to buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li>So I bought this shampoo on Amazon, and I&#x27;m very glad it really did a nice job.</li>
            <li>This stuff made my hair feel really clean and smelled really nice.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>My scalp feels clean again!</li>
            <li>Followed up with my normal conditioner and my hair was good to go.</li>
            <li>and it was fine.</li>
            <li>It really worked well to get all of the chlorine out; I&#x27;m glad we bought it!</li>
            <li>It has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hear feeling smooth and, to me, healthier.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t particularly enjoy the smell of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Neutrogena version as well as the Apple-Vinegar clarifying from Fekkai (which smells fantastic)</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is very gentle and I had to check the label to make sure this was clarifying.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m excited</li>
            <li>I use alot of hairspray on my hair and it takes all the build up hair sprays and shampoos out of my hair and makes it sqeaky clean.</li>
            <li>but it did feel really clean after.  </li>
            <li>This is by far my Favorite clarifying shampoo!</li>
            <li>I just used it and soaked my hair 3 times and each time the water was full of debris etc.</li>
            <li>overall, it&#x27;s a good, salon quality product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>It smells clean and fresh, and my hair is absolutely clean when I&#x27;ve finished.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much smoke stains your hair!!</li>
            <li>Great to get rid of the chlorine after the pool, and mild enough to be used daily</li>
            <li>This is a good product to keep around the house in case you, or your hairdresser, put something on your hair which weights it down.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This doesn&#x27;t have to be an everyday shampoo, but it is perfect for those days when you feel your hair needs a bit of extra attention.</li>
            <li>but my tangles are still very much a problem...not an well rounded solution which means I need to get another shampoo to make my hair soft strong and shinny.</li>
            <li>If this stuff works, I will be back for more-</li>
            <li>This one suds on the first go-around.</li>
            <li>Hair much improved!</li>
            <li>\\&quot;I want to die peacefully in my sleep, like my grandfather.</li>
            <li>however i am going to use the whole bottle and see!</li>
            <li>and I wash it twice after swimming laps, but it&#x27;s better than regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>I swim 3 days a week and this stuff really works!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Since this isnt tear free I use her regular shampoo first and then use this on just her ends.</li>
            <li>Gets my hair very clean and helped remove Kool-Aid dye (Purple, put on my grey hair for halloween.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to use every now and then: daily use might dry it out and make it too brittle.</li>
            <li>You can tell the hair is very clean but the hair still doesn&#x27;t have that dry, brittle feel to it</li>
            <li>Also good for the hard water at home.</li>
            <li>very disapointed.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t help but wonder if this isn&#x27;t the real deal.</li>
            <li>cause it will be very drying</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t use it too much</li>
            <li>Really gets the chlorine out.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It is safe for everyday use except color treated hair.</li>
            <li>This helps return my hair to normal.</li>
            <li>I wanted something that would not wash out my color and was not very heavy to deep clean my hair with, and Paul Mitchell won me over with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Us grey haired ladies or men need a little bit of lightening to keep your color nice and not dull or yellowed by the sun!!</li>
            <li>, it makes your hair super dry with excess use.</li>
            <li>I recommend keeping it around and only using it when you notice buildup or need your hair to be extra squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>Clear all the product for my appointment.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old has been going through an oily hair phase.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>As natural blondes my daughter and I used to use Nexus Aloe Rid, but with it no longer being made I tried Paul Mitchell&#x27;s clarifying shampoo three.</li>
            <li>I bleached my hair and after going in the pool a few times this summer my hair was bright green.</li>
            <li>you normally use another shampoo such as Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Awapuhi Shampoo or Shampoo One and on certain days you feel build-up or as though your scalp may be a little dirty, this is the perfect shampoo to get rid of build-up without stripping your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You only have to use very little, one bottle lasts forever, and it does remove build-up and leaves hair feeling very light and bouncy (after conditioning).</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin \\&quot;Barbie\\</li>
            <li>The suds that were rinsing out of my hair were yellow and my blonde hair looked so much brighter</li>
            <li>Do not recommend as I turned a really vivid teal that was essentially permanent!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not entirely able to clean the chlorine out of my hair</li>
            <li>My old clarifying shampoo performed differently by having to apply it twice to get sudsy.  </li>
            <li>I was not only ecstatic that it took the green out of our hair from swimming, that we use it once a week to continue a clean blonde look.</li>
            <li>It keeps my white hair from turning yellow and it not harsh.</li>
            <li>I am African American and an old hairstylist of mine used to use this on me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a younger black girl and my hair can be pretty obnoxious when it comes to taming it</li>
            <li>I am not sure what is going on when I use this shampoo, but to me it actually feels like this shampoo is pulling impurities out of my hair and adds a mild cooling effect.  </li>
            <li>This clarifying shampoo was the first one I tried that stripped out the grease but didn&#x27;t leave my hair completely dried out and straw</li>
            <li>It is also useful for using once or twice weekly to take out hair product residues that aren&#x27;t removed by ordinary shampoo.  </li>

            <li> I have tried deep clarifying treatments and a different brand by ion after I washed her hair in Dawn dish soap and it still looked flat and oily.  </li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell products are usually quite decent</li>
            <li> Bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Her hair was nearly neon green from exposure</li>
            <li> so the bottle should go a long way.</li>
            <li> This got the chlorine out of my hair and didn&#x27;t dry my hair out or break it off or anything.</li>
            <li> I bought this to combat the hard water of New Jersey and that it does.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if everyone who uses it gets this same feeling, but I definitely felt it.  </li>
            <li> Just after having my second baby, hormonal changes in my skin left my hair unbelievably oily and greasy.  </li>
            <li> And my hair became very dry and  fuzzy.</li>
            <li> i have really hard water and its helping a little bit but not as much as i wanted it too.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo has helped clear my hair of all the hard water particles while maintaining my color.</li>
            <li> A few months later, I had a problem with conditioner building up, and once again Paul Mitchell Clarifying Shampoo came to the rescue.  </li>
            <li> I bought this and expected it to work</li>
            <li> Took the green out my daughter&#x27;s blonde hair...</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve found them to be harsh, leaving the hair feeling dry, rough and tangled although it does feel cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The quantity is not exactly as stated.</li>
            <li> The scent is perfumey in a generic, uninspired, and \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; sort of way-- not particularly clean or invigorating.</li>
            <li> I use it every other wash and my hair has never been healthier!</li>
            <li> I received a half bottle of shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I usually follow with Paul Mitchell&#x27;s The Rinse, because it&#x27;s extremely lightweight and won&#x27;t undo what the shampoo just did.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> Save your money this stuff won&#x27;t help if your looking to get that yucky green out of your hair.</li>
            <li> I was told it would help with the residue on the bottom of my hair from the green dye I put in.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday</li>
            <li> But that is a small complaint and may just me a matter of opinion --</li>
            <li> I have had locks for 7 years and began to experience serious build up issues.</li>
            <li> I have very hard water at my home</li>
            <li> and angry.</li>
            <li> I get horrible build up in my thick hair and this took out every thing!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>

            <li> I have had locks for 7 years and began to experience serious build up issues. This stuff works. I just used it and soaked my hair 3 times and each time the water was full of debris etc. and I wash my hair weekly. If this stuff works, I will be back for more-but I&#x27;m excited bc the smell is gone now!</li>
            <li> My old clarifying shampoo performed differently by having to apply it twice to get sudsy.  This one suds on the first go-around. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s doing its job.  I use it once a week because I have white hair and it helps keep it white.</li>
            <li> This shampoo worked as soon as we let it sit in my daughters hair for a while. Her hair was nearly neon green from exposure so it was a relief that the product worked.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what is going on when I use this shampoo, but to me it actually feels like this shampoo is pulling impurities out of my hair and adds a mild cooling effect.  I am not sure if everyone who uses it gets this same feeling, but I definitely felt it.  Leaves my hear feeling smooth and, to me, healthier.</li>
            <li> I use this after swimming and it seems to get the chlorine smell from my hair.</li>
            <li> Helps with my chlorine hair! Also good for the hard water at home. Hair much improved!</li>
            <li> Its the BEST product.</li>
            <li> I have very hard water at my home and I have dyed my hair blonde. This shampoo has helped clear my hair of all the hard water particles while maintaining my color. I use it every other wash and my hair has never been healthier!</li>
            <li> excellent cleaning power - removes days of hairspray buildup!</li>
            <li> If you have an oily scalp, Paul Mitchell Shampoo Three will remove the excess oil while restoring balance to your hair. It also works great on my fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you normally use another shampoo such as Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Awapuhi Shampoo or Shampoo One and on certain days you feel build-up or as though your scalp may be a little dirty, this is the perfect shampoo to get rid of build-up without stripping your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an oily scalp, which translates to oily hair. After I use Paul Mitchell Shampoo Three, the excess oil is removed. My scalp feels clean again! You can then follow with your favorite Paul Mitchell conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t have to be an everyday shampoo, but it is perfect for those days when you feel your hair needs a bit of extra attention. I love having this shampoo in my \\&quot;hair arsenal.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; \\&quot;I want to die peacefully in my sleep, like my grandfather. Not screaming like the passengers in his cab.\\&quot; &lt;&lt;</li>
            <li> I bought this to combat the hard water of New Jersey and that it does. It leaves my hair feeling very clean. It&#x27;s not the best clarifying shampoo I have ever used, but for the price it works well. I also don&#x27;t particularly enjoy the smell of this shampoo. The scent is perfumey in a generic, uninspired, and \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; sort of way-- not particularly clean or invigorating. But that is a small complaint and may just me a matter of opinion -- overall, it&#x27;s a good, salon quality product.</li>
            <li> the shampoo works well for swimmers.  Buyer beware, this is shampoo number three.  Not three bottles of shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing I have used it for years.I use alot of hairspray on my hair and it takes all the build up hair sprays and shampoos out of my hair and makes it sqeaky clean.</li>
            <li> this was not paul mitchell clarifying shampoo. very disapointed. and angry. dont buy. why are there so many words required all i have to say is it was fake</li>
            <li> Liked it better than the Axe shampoo!</li>
            <li> Very good shampoo and smells clean</li>
            <li> I LOVE ANYTHING PAUL MITCHELL BECAUSE HE MAKES A GOOD PRODUCT AND HE DOESN&#x27;T TEST ON ANIMALS!  I ADMIRE HIM FOR THINKING OF THE WELFARE OF ANIMALS!</li>
            <li> My 5 year old has been going through an oily hair phase. I have tried deep clarifying treatments and a different brand by ion after I washed her hair in Dawn dish soap and it still looked flat and oily.  This has been such a blessing without making her hair feel like straw and also giving it life, body, and bounce and the oiliness is gone.  It is safe for everyday use except color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Great at removing chlorine after swimming. It keeps my white hair from turning yellow and it not harsh. My hair likes it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who was having issues with oily hair, probably because she wasn&#x27;t rinsing her hair out well enough. This does great for her.. isn&#x27;t over drying.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great as first step shampoo.  I am African American and an old hairstylist of mine used to use this on me.  Nice price also.</li>
            <li> This seemed to do it. My daughter is 4 and swims every day. Her hair has become CRUSTY! It&#x27;s so gross. Since this isnt tear free I use her regular shampoo first and then use this on just her ends. It has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> works well for getting chlorine and just regular buildup out of your hair.  i have really hard water and its helping a little bit but not as much as i wanted it too.  however i am going to use the whole bottle and see!</li>
            <li> Washes out hair color.</li>
            <li> Just after having my second baby, hormonal changes in my skin left my hair unbelievably oily and greasy.  It was a daily battle with my hair and the hottest water I could stand to make my hair presentable every day.  This clarifying shampoo was the first one I tried that stripped out the grease but didn&#x27;t leave my hair completely dried out and straw like.  A few months later, I had a problem with conditioner building up, and once again Paul Mitchell Clarifying Shampoo came to the rescue.  I recommend keeping it around and only using it when you notice buildup or need your hair to be extra squeaky clean.  It&#x27;s good to use every now and then: daily use might dry it out and make it too brittle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not entirely able to clean the chlorine out of my hair and I wash it twice after swimming laps, but it&#x27;s better than regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> very pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li> This is by far my Favorite clarifying shampoo! I myself and a swimmer and this truly helps remove the chlorine and impurities from my hair!! Defiantly recommend buying!!!</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin \\&quot;Barbie\\&quot; hair that rapidly accumulates oil and product residue. I wanted something that would not wash out my color and was not very heavy to deep clean my hair with, and Paul Mitchell won me over with this shampoo. It smells clean and fresh, and my hair is absolutely clean when I&#x27;ve finished. I usually follow with Paul Mitchell&#x27;s The Rinse, because it&#x27;s extremely lightweight and won&#x27;t undo what the shampoo just did.   Great product.</li>
            <li> I never wrote a review before but I felt compelled to do so for this product. I bleached my hair and after going in the pool a few times this summer my hair was bright green. I bought this and expected it to work but it didn&#x27;t do anything. Paul Mitchell products are usually quite decent so I can&#x27;t help but wonder if this isn&#x27;t the real deal. Save your money this stuff won&#x27;t help if your looking to get that yucky green out of your hair.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent cleansing shampoo.  I&#x27;ve tried the Neutrogena version as well as the Apple-Vinegar clarifying from Fekkai (which smells fantastic) but I&#x27;ve found them to be harsh, leaving the hair feeling dry, rough and tangled although it does feel cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very gentle and I had to check the label to make sure this was clarifying.  You can tell the hair is very clean but the hair still doesn&#x27;t have that dry, brittle feel to it afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little pricey but I only use it once in awhile for residue removal purposes so the bottle should go a long way.</li>
            <li> This is a good product to keep around the house in case you, or your hairdresser, put something on your hair which weights it down.</li>
            <li> I was told it would help with the residue on the bottom of my hair from the green dye I put in. The dye is gone but my tangles are still very much a problem...not an well rounded solution which means I need to get another shampoo to make my hair soft strong and shinny.</li>
            <li> I work in a bar that allows smoking and I sometimes smoke myself whenever I drink. My boyfriend is alway complaining about the cigarette smell in my hair even after a shower. This does the trick! The suds that were rinsing out of my hair were yellow and my blonde hair looked so much brighter I didn&#x27;t realize how much smoke stains your hair!!</li>
            <li> Great to get rid of the chlorine after the pool, and mild enough to be used daily</li>
            <li> Took the green out my daughter&#x27;s blonde hair...</li>
            <li> I use mousse and leave-conditioner so I must clarify once in a while. You only have to use very little, one bottle lasts forever, and it does remove build-up and leaves hair feeling very light and bouncy (after conditioning).</li>
            <li> Great for getting the chlorine out of my hair!  I swim 3 days a week and this stuff really works!</li>
            <li> This does not compare to Pantene&#x27;s Clarifying shampoo.  Even Pantene&#x27;s revamp of their clarifying shampoo leaves your hair greasy and sticky along the hairline</li>
            <li> i love the scent of this shampoo, kinda coconut-y beach-y scent. Works great, i use it once a month or so to remove haircare product build up.</li>
            <li> A great clarifying shampoo and gentle. Does not fade hair color.</li>
            <li> I begin to swim this spring. Everytime after I shower I still can smell chlorine on my hair. And my hair became very dry and  fuzzy. Evenmore, some hairs are split, which made me so depressed, cuz I just have short hair, just reach to my shoulder. So I bought this shampoo on Amazon, and I&#x27;m very glad it really did a nice job. I didn&#x27;t smell chlorine anymore after using it, and my hair are smoother than before.</li>
            <li> It was suggested in a magazine that you should use a clarifying shampoo a week before getting color, I was told this was good and it&#x27;s true. Clear all the product for my appointment.</li>
            <li> Did a lot of swimming during my vacation. I&#x27;m a younger black girl and my hair can be pretty obnoxious when it comes to taming it so I dread washing my hair. This got the chlorine out of my hair and didn&#x27;t dry my hair out or break it off or anything. Followed up with my normal conditioner and my hair was good to go. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> took the chlorine out of my hair</li>
            <li> This shampoo is really nice for stripping chlorine out of your hair. It is also useful for using once or twice weekly to take out hair product residues that aren&#x27;t removed by ordinary shampoo.  It isn&#x27;t meant to be a daily shampoo.</li>
            <li> Used this after my wedding to get all the product out.  Had to shampoo twice but it did feel really clean after.  I have sensitive skin and it was fine.</li>
            <li> This stuff made my hair feel really clean and smelled really nice. I am going to buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. My daughters and I are big swimmers so we use this about once every 2 to 3 weeks to keep the bushland chlorine out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday cause it will be very drying so I only use it 2 times a week....Us grey haired ladies or men need a little bit of lightening to keep your color nice and not dull or yellowed by the sun!!</li>
            <li> The shampoo had leaked all over the box it was shipped in.  I received a half bottle of shampoo.  I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I needed. I get horrible build up in my thick hair and this took out every thing! But don&#x27;t use it too much, it makes your hair super dry with excess use.</li>
            <li> I used this but should have waited , white vinegar did the same job.  its not a bad product, works great!</li>
            <li> The quantity is not exactly as stated.</li>
            <li> This helps return my hair to normal.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo a couple times a week after swimming. Really gets the chlorine out. I use it with regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> As natural blondes my daughter and I used to use Nexus Aloe Rid, but with it no longer being made I tried Paul Mitchell&#x27;s clarifying shampoo three. I was not only ecstatic that it took the green out of our hair from swimming, that we use it once a week to continue a clean blonde look.</li>
            <li> This chelating shampoo removes the chlorine from my hair after swimming. I only need to use it about once a week.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo on the advice of a stylist who noticed all the chlorine in my daughter&#x27;s hair since taking swimming lessons all summer.  It really worked well to get all of the chlorine out; I&#x27;m glad we bought it!</li>
