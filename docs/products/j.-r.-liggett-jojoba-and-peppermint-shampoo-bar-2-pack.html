            <li>Best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>This is the best shampoo I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Amazing!!</li>
            <li>After I used it I was very pleased!</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Great for travel since it will not leak in your toiletry bag.</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>The bar lasts a good while also.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this soap for years and love it - it&#x27;s also great for travel - no pesky bottles for shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I really love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>Great seller, super product!</li>
            <li>Nice smell.</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t believe the changes to my hair in that time.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but was delighted by this bar.</li>
            <li>I still use a very light conditioner on my ends, but I&#x27;d say that most people will not even need one.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It has made my hair look so healthy.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it for that purpose too.</li>
            <li>My face is clearer for sure.</li>
            <li>I love J.R. Liggett Shampoo bars.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very happy that I made the transition.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo bar.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this.</li>
            <li>So easy and leaves my hair looking and feeling smooth and healthy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m making a concerted effort to use more environmentally friendly products, reduce plastic use, and minimize exposure to chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I feel so much more clean after using bar shampoo than I ever did with liquid.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my face,  I ahve found it to work better than soaps at getting it clean and not drying the skin out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Hair is frizz free.</li>
            <li>For now I will stick with my chemical filled Suave.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time and immediately ordered more.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>I make sure to rinse completely, but the waxiness prevails more often than not.</li>
            <li>but it has proved itself worthy of my extended continued use.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product, but you have to make a commitment to stay away from commercial shampoos as much as possible.  </li>
            <li>Because of my fine hair and oily scalp, I was really nervous to go the \\&quot;no-poo\\&quot; route.  </li>
            <li>But this will never be as economical as a bottle of shampoo.</li>
            <li>I did rinse with a cup of warm water with a teaspoon of  apple cider vinegar as a final rinse.  </li>
            <li>I apply the bar directly to my hair along my part and around the hairline where I have the most oil.    </li>
            <li>and I rarely have issues with frizzy hair or flyaways.  </li>
            <li>This is easily remedied by using an apple cider vinegar rinse or using a shower head that filters the water, such as the Culligan model that is available quite inexpensively from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I use 2 Tbsp of ACV in 8oz of water with a few drops of rose oil to cover up the strong vinegar smell.  </li>
            <li>Interesting shampoo without sulfa and regular shampoo chemicals.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I tried bar shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair is also much tamer with the right amount of body.</li>
            <li>The Jojoba &amp; Peppermint shampoo bar leaves your hair soft and your scalp clean.</li>
            <li>Because my hair is very fine I usually use mousse or other products, with this shampoo I didn&#x27;t use conditioner or mousse and was very pleased with result.</li>
            <li>Works well and smells very nice.e</li>
            <li>So much so that after shampooing in the morning, my hair would begin to look greasy by the end of the work day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this works too well at preventing much flaking of the scalp, but it&#x27;s still good old Liggett&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of lather but left my hair squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>This was my first all natural shampoo bar.</li>
            <li>is the second scent I&#x27;ve tried and definitely like it more than the unscented.</li>
            <li>This shampoo bar cleanses the hair gently, and without stripping the natural oils.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also read that shampoo bars result in less hair loss (as they&#x27;re more gentle), and I have definitely noticed this as well.  </li>
            <li>Leaves it very soft.</li>
            <li>They are one of the only shampoos I can use due to my skin sensitivity to many ingredients.</li>
            <li>As I previously mentioned, my hair was fine and oily before.  </li>
            <li>It smells really good, lasts a long time and seriously reduces your plastic use, which everyone should be worried about.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft and bouncy, seemed really clean and not weighted down.  </li>
            <li>How my life would have been different in high school with this product!</li>
            <li>My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this soft in 20 years.</li>
            <li>I have been using J.R. Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bars (this and the Coconut Argan) for nearly a year now.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s soft and silky and sometimes it leaves it waxy and stringy.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and thicker than ever.</li>
            <li>My first interaction with solid shampoos was from Lush, so I thought that this shampoo bar would be a similar product.  </li>
            <li>The actual shampoo left my healthy hair a strange mixture of dry and oily.  </li>
            <li>I was uber skeptical about bar shampoo, but I love this so much.</li>
            <li>It left my hair very soft without using conditioner.</li>
            <li>It works really well and lathers great, and my scalp doesn&#x27;t have horrifying deserts of dryness hanging out under my hair anymore.</li>

            <li> I need no conditioner and my hair is far less frizzy than with regular commercial shampoos.</li>
            <li> And they last forever, even with long hair!</li>
            <li> Definitely not going back to conventional shampoo.    </li>
            <li> I have only used regular shampoo during my hair cuts in the last year, and I notice that my hair becomes oilier again in the few days afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Even my husband had really rough hair, but after a few uses it is really soft!</li>
            <li> One note is that if you have hard water, as I do, the minerals will interfere with the performance of the soap (part of the reason why commercial shampoos were originally developed) and leave a dulling buildup on your hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> The trick would be to keep it dry between showers.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry it out at all</li>
            <li> Like the other J.R. Liggett&#x27;s products, it doesn&#x27;t leave a scent at all.</li>
            <li> Now, I can wash my hair every other day without having that matted down oily look.  </li>
            <li> At first, it&#x27;s a little difficult to get used to.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it lasts as long as a 24 ounce bottle of shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the bar since about Christmas, and I&#x27;m still in the adjustment phase where my hair feels slightly oily.  </li>
            <li> When I received this I was disappointed at first because it was so small (about half the size of a regular bar of soap).</li>
            <li> Just wish it were a little</li>
            <li> I have very thick oily hair but short.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never buy any other shampoo!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that&#x27;s part of the problem, and likely why my hair is so oily to begin with.  </li>
            <li> I tried so hard to be a fan, but it&#x27;s so inconsistent how it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li> Two circles around my head is plenty of lather, the bar lasts me about 3 months of everyday use!!</li>
            <li> No more dandruff!  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical (and a little weirded out) by the idea of a shampoo bar, but after just one week, I&#x27;ve noticed quite a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> The peppermint smell is very subtle, which I like.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> However, if I put my hair up it doesn&#x27;t look oily at all; in fact it&#x27;s shiny, and those annoying flyaways are almost non-existent!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used! I feel so much more clean after using bar shampoo than I ever did with liquid. I tried the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; method and oh my, hell no. I had my reservations concerning bar shampoo but it has proved itself worthy of my extended continued use.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;m not sure it lasts as long as a 24 ounce bottle of shampoo. The trick would be to keep it dry between showers. But it definitely gets your hair cleaner than regular shampoos. Leaves it very soft. I have very thick oily hair but short. I also use it on my face,  I ahve found it to work better than soaps at getting it clean and not drying the skin out.</li>
            <li> Great seller, super product!</li>
            <li> This was my first all natural shampoo bar. It has made my hair look so healthy. I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this works too well at preventing much flaking of the scalp, but it&#x27;s still good old Liggett&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The Jojoba &amp; Peppermint shampoo bar leaves your hair soft and your scalp clean. Like the other J.R. Liggett&#x27;s products, it doesn&#x27;t leave a scent at all. The bar lasts about a month with one person daily shampooing.</li>
            <li> My first interaction with solid shampoos was from Lush, so I thought that this shampoo bar would be a similar product.  I was wrong.  This shampoo does not have any smell at all even though I purchased the Jojoba and Peppermint variety.  The actual shampoo left my healthy hair a strange mixture of dry and oily.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical (and a little weirded out) by the idea of a shampoo bar, but after just one week, I&#x27;ve noticed quite a difference in my hair. I bought this because my hair has thinned over years of using shampoos with sulfates. My hair is now noticeably thicker and shinier. I still use a very light conditioner on my ends, but I&#x27;d say that most people will not even need one. Even my husband had really rough hair, but after a few uses it is really soft!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for years and love it - it&#x27;s also great for travel - no pesky bottles for shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Interesting shampoo without sulfa and regular shampoo chemicals. Works well and smells very nice.e</li>
            <li> Works great. Nice smell. Makes my hair feel squeaky clean. The bar lasts a good while also. But this will never be as economical as a bottle of shampoo. Great for travel since it will not leak in your toiletry bag.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I tried bar shampoo. I can go longer between washes and my hair is manageable. The only issue is it stripped some of the color from my hair.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! I&#x27;ll never buy any other shampoo!! Two circles around my head is plenty of lather, the bar lasts me about 3 months of everyday use!!</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time and immediately ordered more.  My hair was soft and bouncy, seemed really clean and not weighted down.  Because my hair is very fine I usually use mousse or other products, with this shampoo I didn&#x27;t use conditioner or mousse and was very pleased with result.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I need no conditioner and my hair is far less frizzy than with regular commercial shampoos. My hair is also much tamer with the right amount of body. I can now wake up and just run my fingers through my hair and be out the door. How my life would have been different in high school with this product!</li>
            <li> I was uber skeptical about bar shampoo, but I love this so much. It works really well and lathers great, and my scalp doesn&#x27;t have horrifying deserts of dryness hanging out under my hair anymore. It smells really good, lasts a long time and seriously reduces your plastic use, which everyone should be worried about. Awesomesauce.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this bar. My hair feels healthier and fuller. It doesn&#x27;t dry it out at all and I&#x27;ve begun to just use it for my face while I shampoo and I love it for that purpose too. My face is clearer for sure. Just wish it were a little cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second scent I&#x27;ve tried and definitely like it more than the unscented.</li>
            <li> When I received this I was disappointed at first because it was so small (about half the size of a regular bar of soap). After I used it I was very pleased! It left my hair very soft without using conditioner. I did rinse with a cup of warm water with a teaspoon of  apple cider vinegar as a final rinse.  I have very long hair and I think this will probably give me about 20 or 30 shampoos per bar. I only rubbed it into my scalp and let it wash through the rest of my hair as I rinsed. It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of lather but left my hair squeaky clean. My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this soft in 20 years. Great product</li>
            <li> I love J.R. Liggett Shampoo bars. They are one of the only shampoos I can use due to my skin sensitivity to many ingredients. And they last forever, even with long hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m making a concerted effort to use more environmentally friendly products, reduce plastic use, and minimize exposure to chemicals.  Because of my fine hair and oily scalp, I was really nervous to go the \\&quot;no-poo\\&quot; route.  In researching options, I came across this family of shampoo bars.  What a find!    At first, it&#x27;s a little difficult to get used to.  Traditional shampoo creates a lot of suds, which makes you feel like you&#x27;re really deep cleaning your hair.  Unfortunately, that&#x27;s part of the problem, and likely why my hair is so oily to begin with.  I apply the bar directly to my hair along my part and around the hairline where I have the most oil.    The peppermint smell is very subtle, which I like.  This shampoo bar cleanses the hair gently, and without stripping the natural oils.  I&#x27;ve been using the bar since about Christmas, and I&#x27;m still in the adjustment phase where my hair feels slightly oily.  However, if I put my hair up it doesn&#x27;t look oily at all; in fact it&#x27;s shiny, and those annoying flyaways are almost non-existent!  I&#x27;ve also read that shampoo bars result in less hair loss (as they&#x27;re more gentle), and I have definitely noticed this as well.  It&#x27;s fantastic.  My hair is already shinier and thicker than it has ever been, and I can&#x27;t wait to see how it looks after I fully adjust!    One note is that if you have hard water, as I do, the minerals will interfere with the performance of the soap (part of the reason why commercial shampoos were originally developed) and leave a dulling buildup on your hair.  This is easily remedied by using an apple cider vinegar rinse or using a shower head that filters the water, such as the Culligan model that is available quite inexpensively from Amazon.  I use 2 Tbsp of ACV in 8oz of water with a few drops of rose oil to cover up the strong vinegar smell.  Definitely not going back to conventional shampoo.    UPDATE - 1 Year Later:  I have been using J.R. Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bars (this and the Coconut Argan) for nearly a year now.  I honestly can&#x27;t believe the changes to my hair in that time.  As I previously mentioned, my hair was fine and oily before.  So much so that after shampooing in the morning, my hair would begin to look greasy by the end of the work day.  Now, I can wash my hair every other day without having that matted down oily look.  My hair is definitely thicker and I rarely have issues with frizzy hair or flyaways.  This is a wonderful product, but you have to make a commitment to stay away from commercial shampoos as much as possible.  I have only used regular shampoo during my hair cuts in the last year, and I notice that my hair becomes oilier again in the few days afterwards.  Overall, I am very happy that I made the transition.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo bar. So easy and leaves my hair looking and feeling smooth and healthy</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used.  No more dandruff!  Hair is frizz free.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this. I tried so hard to be a fan, but it&#x27;s so inconsistent how it leaves my hair. Sometimes it&#x27;s soft and silky and sometimes it leaves it waxy and stringy. I make sure to rinse completely, but the waxiness prevails more often than not. For now I will stick with my chemical filled Suave.</li>
            <li> I really love this shampoo! It makes my hair soft and thicker than ever. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but was delighted by this bar.</li>
