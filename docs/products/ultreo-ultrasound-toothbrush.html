    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is an excellent electric toothbrush, but after the manufacturer&#x27;s bankruptcy the shortage of replacement brush heads has quintupled their price.  </li>
            <li>Best toothbrush</li>
            <li>The best feature to the toothbrush is the timer.  </li>
            <li>I cannot begin to explain how happy I am to be using this toothbrush again!  </li>
            <li>If you consider buying this brush (the best choice</li>
            <li>Best yet...</li>
            <li>It was, and still is, an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had excellent oral hygiene</li>
            <li>I have had all the best over the years.</li>
            <li>Very impressed.</li>
            <li>Its works GREAT!!!  </li>
            <li>It does an excellent job of giving your teeth a thorough cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Before I go all out and say this is the best toothbrush on earth</li>
            <li>Best way to find out what works best for you is to try them all out</li>
            <li>Best way to find out what works best for you is to try them all out</li>
            <li>Happy brushing!</li>
            <li>As a dental hygienist, I cannot express how great the Ultreo is!!</li>
            <li>I wanted the best toothbrush on the market, so I bought and compared both the Sonicare DiamondClean and Ultreo; both were found out about through word of mouth.</li>
            <li>But...I LOVE IT!!!      </li>
            <li>Good job P&amp;G!  </li>
            <li>have my teeth looked and felt this good!</li>
            <li>(so no complaints--daily use for 1500 days is good by me!).  </li>
            <li>Even if I ever forget to brush them, my teeth stay and feel great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with my Ultreo.</li>
            <li>And the head is supposed to be replaced at 3 month intervals, at great cost.  </li>
            <li>and it works great.</li>
            <li>After using this for 2 weeks I am happy with results</li>
            <li>It took about two or three days to get used to this toothbrush, but since then it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li>However, if you are looking for an electric toothbrush and can afford this one, the Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush is a great choice for you.</li>
            <li>if that what it takes to keep my teeth, it is a price I am happy to pay.</li>
            <li>The bristle design makes it ideal to get in between teeth and do a good scrubbing job.  </li>
            <li>It also vibrates a lot, which doesn&#x27;t feel great in my hand or mouth.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve said all that, lol, to say this:&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worked great - then died.  </li>
            <li>My plan was to buy additional units in case it happened again - figuring they perhaps don&#x27;t have a great business model or something despite a great product.  </li>
            <li>This is great news.</li>
            <li>I use this great toothbrush once a day.    </li>
            <li>If you never used any kind of electronic brushing device, Ultreo would be an excellent choice.</li>
            <li>All great stuff.</li>
            <li>It is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Everything was great until - you guessed it, the toothbrush refused to charge.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this unit, and it worked great... for about 9 months.  </li>
            <li>- It&#x27;s a great product, with some quality control issues.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m SO happy to share with you all how happy I&#x27;ve been.  </li>
            <li>Ultreo Ultrasound works very effectively.</li>
            <li>I was not always successful.  </li>
            <li>Love the design - best way to describe it is that if Apple were to make a toothbrush, this would be it.</li>
            <li>A superb and unique product!  </li>
            <li>It did seem to do a good job of getting a cleaner brushing.    </li>
            <li>I loved it dearly.  </li>
            <li>So the two weeks of use is probably a good length of time to become accustomed to it.      </li>
            <li>The Ultreo is the best toothbrush available.</li>
            <li>I Loved this product.</li>
            <li>is it doing a good job.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s a charge for a good while.</li>
            <li>I thought I was doing a good job of brushing with it, and do not have a history of dental problems.  </li>
            <li>I obtained an Ultreo from my dentist who did some restorative work on my teeth - loved it.   </li>
            <li>Both are good, but don&#x27;t match the Ultreo.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, you&#x27;ll also see good results with an Oral B or a Sonic Care.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, you&#x27;ll also see good results with an Oral B or a Sonic Care.</li>
            <li>But I noticed what a good job</li>
            <li>It got my teeth sparkling clean, and my dental hygienist was thoroughly impressed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the brush ever since and have been exceptionally</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>This seems to be a very top of the line toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because this is a really good and effective toothbrush</li>
            <li>The Ultreo seems to do a very nice job of cleaning teeth and helping to keep gums healthy.  </li>
            <li>The Ultreo seems to do a very nice job of cleaning teeth and helping to keep gums healthy.  </li>
            <li>I stored the Ultreo (battery went dead)in hopes that the company might return...and am glad I did!  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>I love this brush!  </li>
            <li>Pretty impressive</li>
            <li>I am sure you will like it if you get one, just dont get too attached!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>find that the best combo is to use the Ultreo as my \\&quot;main\\&quot; toothbrush, but every so often use the Oral-B to make sure that all areas are getting clean.</li>
            <li>I find that the best combo is to use the Ultreo as my \\&quot;main\\&quot; toothbrush, but every so often use the Oral-B to make sure that all areas are getting clean.</li>
            <li>It does an amazing job of cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li>really liked this toothbrush even though I thought it was too</li>
            <li>I have an Ultreo and really liked this toothbrush, however the company went out of business some time ago.</li>
            <li>I liked the concept, of electronic brushing, but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never used an ultrasound toothbrush -- or an electric one of any kind, for that matter.</li>
            <li>The charging stand, power cord, and a rather nice travel case.</li>
            <li>This brush changed my opinion about my own teeth...</li>
            <li>Do the math, you&#x27;re going to cough up $92 for replacement heads per year, not including tax or S&amp;H.  Nice try, Ultreo.</li>
            <li>Also, the timer on the toothbrush is nice if you&#x27;ve never used a toothbrush with a timer before.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Sonic which was good, but I REALLY love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I just couldn&#x27;t see the improvement over using my sonicare.</li>
            <li>Two weeks after receiving the Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush, I can honestly feel and see a difference with my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The bottom line is where it counts, though, and I was impressed with how much cleaner my teeth feel after using this brush compared to my manual brushes.  </li>
            <li>it comes with a nice travel case.  </li>
            <li>Nice travel case to go with it    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a longtime Sonicare user, and would honestly recommend Sonicare over Ultreo anytime.</li>
            <li>but I was told that my 30 day satisfaction guarantee was expired, so I was on my own.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t get the nice \\&quot;clean\\</li>
            <li>He&#x27;ll think it&#x27;s a toothbrush, but in reality, it&#x27;s a bright, confident smile and great dental health for years to come.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using the toothbrush is very easy.</li>
            <li>Ultreo was the latest and greatest and despite the relatively high cost I took the plunge.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best toothbrush that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;The company has been sold and they are making product again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>however more than compensates for that because the Ultreo is dramatically more gentle than the sonicare, while still providing excellent plaque and stain removal.  </li>
            <li>I had been shopping around for a brush for a while, tried my boyfriend&#x27;s sonicare and liked it, but didn&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best choice if you have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best choice if you have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>My opinion is that this is a very nice toothbrush that makes my teeth feel clean and my gums feels healthy.  </li>
            <li>This seems like a good brush for those who don&#x27;t like the intensity of a Sonicare but still want clean teeth.</li>
            <li>This seems like a good brush for those who don&#x27;t like the intensity of a Sonicare but still want clean teeth.</li>
            <li>I normally floss after brushing and I have found that the Ultreo does a very good job of cleaning between my teeth as well.  </li>
            <li>The first time I went to the dentist after switching to the Ultreo, the hygenist told me what a great job I was doing with my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I liked mine so much, my husband had to get his own!</li>
            <li>brush itself feels well made and fits nicely in the hand and makes for easy manipulation inside the mouth.  </li>
            <li>as most dental hygienist do, but even with my home care regiman I got tremendous results with tea stain removal and the \\&quot;just out of the dental chair\\&quot; feeling of clean!!!</li>
            <li>If you buy this, you can&#x27;t get any more replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li>So, much as I love this toothbrush, I&#x27;d advise against buying it unless you can afford to stock up on brush heads at $112 each.    </li>
            <li>Ask your dentist to make sure).</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be able to find replacement heads, there won&#x27;t be a warranty</li>
            <li>but of course I try my best to remember since tooth problems are the last thing I am waiting for!</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I immediately called and was able to replace the handle and buy more brush heads.  </li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>after that I used Phillips Sonicare (with built-in in the handle replaceable toothpaste tubes) - feels much better than Braun&#x27;s Oral-B, but had no effect on my teeth either.</li>
            <li>even if your teeth are much better than mine) - buy it together with some water picking device -</li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush believing it was better then</li>
            <li>Preset for 2 minute brushes, there is an alert that sounds every 30 seconds--which I love.  </li>
            <li>I had been a sonicare user since it came on the market more than a decade ago.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Ultreo for over a year and am highly satisfied with its performance.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>I used a Sonicare for 4 years before Ultreo and was pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I think the Ultreo is even better</li>
            <li>A manual brush or device may work better to brush the tongue for breath.</li>
            <li>But I do notice the experience gets better ever day.</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist recommended and the toothbrush using ultrasound works better in cleaning the teeth, or the teeth feel cleaner, in comparison to my electric rotating head toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Initial opinion of the Ultreo is excellent.  </li>
            <li>Easier on the gums, better vs tartar.</li>
            <li>I used the Ultreo and was just amazed how much better it cleaned.</li>
            <li>- it cleaned my items faster and so much better than the others</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s the replacement costs that matter more.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s the replacement costs that matter more.</li>
            <li>more of a chime than a beep -- it helps me be sure I&#x27;m doing a thorough job</li>
            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>P&amp;G. It is interesting to see how it goes.</li>
            <li>This is one area where Sonicare has an advantage because replacement heads for a comparable model come in a 3 pack for about $5 more.  </li>
            <li>This is one area where Sonicare has an advantage because replacement heads for a comparable model come in a 3 pack for about $5 more.  </li>
            <li>But it is important that you use the toothbrush correctly in order for it to work effectively.  </li>
            <li>Better gums</li>
            <li>Better breath&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>notice that there is an Ultreo costing $10.00 more than this model.  </li>
            <li>they do seem more reflective.</li>
            <li>but I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Love the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Love the timer as I&#x27;m brushing.  </li>
            <li>I went from a manual tooth brush to the Ultreo and absolty love it.  </li>
            <li>which is more what I was used to.  </li>
            <li>It relies more on the &#x27;sonic&#x27; waves for cleaning...</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Chuck says, you might have to charge more than 24 hours;</li>
            <li>I considered investing in the sonicare flexcare and then read some comparisons which said they are comparable, or that Ultreo is slightly better.  </li>
            <li>and I love the way my teeth feel afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the product</li>
            <li>Better than sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I love my Ultreo.  </li>
            <li>What I like about it the most:    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Sonic Care for many years and have always been satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I used Oral-B Vitality, Philips Sonicare FlexCare and finally Ultreo; and BELIEVE me this is undoubtedly the best solution out there.</li>
            <li>That makes it worthwhile for me.    </li>
            <li>but I still perfered spending 2 minutes bottom an 2 minutes on top.  </li>
            <li>This brush runs for 1:20 minutes each time, my sonicare runs for more than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Battery life is good, and it&#x27;s easy to clean (and keep clean).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line - any electric toothbrush will usually be a better choice than a manual one.</li>
            <li>any electric toothbrush will usually be a better choice than a manual one.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s hoping they become more affordable in the future.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have always been satisfied with its performance, so</li>
            <li>On the whole, I&#x27;m quite happy with this device.</li>
            <li>It felt like I needed more \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; from the Ultreo in its brushing.</li>
            <li>This is an attractive product with good potential.</li>
            <li>much as I love my Ultreo, I just can&#x27;t justify paying for it again at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been keeping it to myself so that I could get replacement brushes without competition, and now that&#x27;s not a problem :-)</li>
            <li>This brush gets your teeth very clean</li>
            <li>it is very comfortable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>, she must be getting a pretty good cut</li>
            <li>This was a pretty good product when you adjusted to the correct method of using it.  </li>
            <li>The vibrations produced are pleasant and when there is some water in the mouth - recommended by the instructions - the bubbles form really well</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great buy and it looks artsy while comes with a nice travel case.</li>
            <li>The Ultreo is great, far better than the Sonicare I had been using.</li>
            <li>My teeth are Dentist clean!  </li>
            <li>The results are great, it really does remove stains, and leaves the mouth feeling so clean.  </li>
            <li>However, my teeth feel cleaner and more plaque free with the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Best news that I&#x27;ve heard in a very long time!!  </li>
            <li>If anyone is looking for new technology with amazing results, this brush is the one!</li>
            <li>( so did my dentist ) and even bought one (at full price!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not been to my dentist yet to confirm if any health improvements, but the claim that teeth feel super-clean is true!</li>
            <li>This Ultreo Ultrasound toothbrush has been my first experience with an electric toothbrush, but so far it has been very pleasant.</li>
            <li>The Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush is supposed to be the latest and greatest new technology as far as electric toothbrushes go.</li>
            <li>However, Ultreo is still a good brush for those with more sensitive gums</li>
            <li>However, Ultreo is still a good brush for those with more sensitive gums</li>
            <li>But with Sonicare, I feel the teeth is more clean with the touch of my tounge.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle and hold</li>
            <li>The brush head pops off easily</li>
            <li>, the aching went away, and I got more used to clean</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend the Ultreo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems funny to think that something as basic as a toothbrush could benefit as much from technology, but the Ultreo Ultrasound is an excellent example of technology being put to good use.  </li>
            <li>I would anticipate very good results for long term dental use.</li>
            <li>The bristle sweeps do a great job of getting my teeth super clean that they don&#x27;t feel \\&quot;furry\\&quot; even after the whole day.</li>
            <li>This is probably true with most powered toothbrushes, but you do not want to hit your teeth or gums with anything but the bristles.  </li>
            <li>First is the price - kind of steep.</li>
            <li>I used Sonicare for years and liked it, but I LOVE my new Ultreo!</li>
            <li>Now, after having used the Ultreo product, I realize that although the Oral B brush felt like it was doing a good cleaning job, it may not have been as thorough as this new Ultreo brush.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this brush and it does the work that my sonicare can&#x27;t do, in half the time.</li>
            <li>If you can swing the cost, the Ultreo is a fine choice.</li>
            <li>If you can swing the cost, the Ultreo is a fine choice.</li>
            <li>I have found that this gives me a much more disciplined routine to brushing my teeth and ensures that I spend adequate time on all of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I am one of those people that if I don&#x27;t stay on top of my brushing and flossing, tartar builds up rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Ultreo gives you both a quick reference sheet and a more detailed user manual.  </li>
            <li>He was one of the experimental users of the Ultreo and with flossing and brushing was able to put his gums back in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>(someone commented their dentists had confirmed that.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>The Ultreo was a fabulous toothbrush for the almost four months it worked.  </li>
            <li>I have since bought a much cheaper and equally nice Oral B Pulsonic.</li>
            <li>use of the Ultreo continues to keep my teeth free of plaque, stain and tartar.  </li>
            <li>However, if you are looking for an electric toothbrush and can afford this one, the Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush is a great choice for you.rush heads, which I believe are supposed to last around 6 months or so.</li>
            <li>But honestly, I just didn&#x27;t feel this was working very well for me.</li>
            <li>The Ultreo arcade style tune is more fun while the Sonicare just gives a beep.    </li>
            <li>I like the reminder, and the beeping sound every 30 seconds is not annoying --</li>
            <li>In addition it is available in PDF format from the Ultreo web site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After each brushing, the teeth are smooth and slippery as if polished.</li>
            <li>The replacement heads aren&#x27;t cheap either.</li>
            <li>I called the company (before they went out of business), and they replaced it, free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>This is actually a good thing since most bathrooms have some water present.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is also a display that lets you know when the unit is charging or fully charged, and on of the more attractive (minimal footprint) charger bases that I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li>I am a Sonicare user for more than 10 years (yes, that is right).</li>
            <li>toothbrush makes brushing my teeth more fun and interesting, and it gives my teeth that \\&quot;right after a dental appointment\\&quot; clean feeling.</li>
            <li>My sense is this is a very powerful</li>
            <li>It has resolved my brushing compulsion, by delivering a smooth and ultra fast cleansing that is coupled with pleasant tingling sensations around the gums that equate in my opinion to gentle massages.</li>
            <li>Who ever thought one could get excited about brushing their teeth?  </li>
            <li>one thing that could be significantly improved is the brush itself.  </li>
            <li>I did not notice any significant difference in the cleanliness of my teeth from using the Ultreo over the Oral B.  </li>
            <li>In my many years as an Amazon customer, this is the first item I have ever returned -- I am not one of those super-critical types.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like it, and it&#x27;s not an abrasive cleaning tool...</li>
            <li>maybe they are getting better - my first was purchased at about $200 in 2007.  </li>
            <li>The ultreo does not eliminate the plaque buildup, but it significantly reduces it.</li>
            <li>but I am willing to give it a try again because this brush is much better than my sonicare.</li>
            <li>is especially challenging - it can be done, but you have to contort a bit, and there&#x27;s usually some drooling involved.</li>
            <li>the front teeth is especially challenging - it can be done, but you have to contort a bit, and there&#x27;s usually some drooling involved.</li>
            <li>This is a review on the original Ultreo units.  </li>
            <li>In the three or four weeks since I received it, I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference in the whiteness of my teeth and the clean feel of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>and I can hear the squeaky clean of my teeth.</li>
            <li>The feeling of my inner lower teeth mimics that of professional cleaning from a dentist, very impressive.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean after using, and my dentist has seen a change in my teeth during my yearly visits.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The oral care and others do not get my teeth completely clean</li>
            <li>That lick your teeth clean feeling you get at the dentist can be achieved with this ultrasound oral care product.  </li>
            <li>I suffer from gum disease and am therefore hypervigilant about keeping my teeth scrupulously clean.</li>
            <li>The ultrasound energy then transforms the liquid into \\&quot;micro-bubbles\\&quot; which \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; your teeth clean.</li>
            <li>The fewer bristles on an ultreo make it a gentler way to clean your teeth as it uses liquid as the scrubbing medium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The clean feeling lasts longer after brushing.</li>
            <li>if I&#x27;ve chewed alot of gum, or my teeth are feeling particulary in need of a deeper clean.  </li>
            <li>it seems the ultrasonic waves get to all the stuff that needs to be gotten, and my teeth feel really clean.    </li>
            <li>However - they always tell me my teeth are really clean</li>
            <li>clean</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t use ultreo now I feel like my teeth aren&#x27;t clean.  </li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt this clean.</li>
            <li>are AMAZINGLLY clean teeth.  </li>
            <li>While sonicare also has this feature, I find that the Ultreo is easier to hear and is a pleasant reminder to move on to the next area of my mouth.    </li>
            <li>I have found this toothbrush can easily hold a charge for a full week worth of brushing.</li>
            <li>Nice build quality, feels good in the hand, takes up very little counter space.</li>
            <li>First and most importantly, the ultrasound action makes for a far more effective cleaning.  </li>
            <li>We used to be able to buy replacement brushes reasonably priced every 3-6 months.</li>
            <li>Ultreo keeps me brushing for the full recommended two minutes.</li>
            <li>Before using this they say to charge the toothbrush for a full 24 hours.</li>
            <li>The head is designed nicely and curves around each tooth while ultrasound action does its work.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is good alternative to the sonicare line</li>
            <li>I have to admit that this is the most unusual aspect to the Ultreo.</li>
            <li>It took about 18 hours for my unit to reach a full</li>
            <li>But this does not seem to be true.  </li>
            <li>At my last cleaning, the hygienist remarked about what a good job I was doing</li>
            <li>Not since I was sweet sixteen</li>
            <li>My last two visits have been good</li>
            <li>Both do an excellent job, and get your teeth a lot cleaner than a manual toothbrush (at least for me).</li>
            <li>If the manufacturer can also give more information on how ultrasound technology is better in comparison with other technologies it would help convince users to pay more for the Ultreo.</li>
            <li>Now I know - they my be white and clean and leave an absolute feeling of joy every morning and</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine with a nice standard \\&quot;move the brush yourself\\&quot; appliance, but with new-fangled electrics etc.</li>
            <li>Well it made my mouth very fresh and clean feeling the first week</li>
            <li>* Clean and fresh feeling after brushing    </li>
            <li>The Ultreo arcade style tune is more fun while the Sonicare just gives a beep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Both have good design elements but Sonicare has a slight edge over Ultreo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I literally look forward to brushing and find myself brushing 4 to 5 times daily instead of 3 -- because when I&#x27;m done my gums feel good and my teeth feel fresh and clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not charge quickly.</li>
            <li>Contacted MFRer - Chuck got involved &amp; was super helpful, by email.  </li>
            <li>If you are lucky, you may find some brush heads for sale at your dentists office-</li>
            <li>Sonicare never gave such a superb cleaning experience and thus I chose the Ultreo as my next gen toothbrush.</li>
            <li>They said they may be seeing that for people with highly stain-prone teeth, the Ultreo loosens some of of the stain a bit better than Sonicare.    </li>
            <li>It tingles when you use it right, and if you surround the head with liquid, it really does do a better job.  </li>
            <li>I have normal, healthy</li>
            <li>I really do love my new Ultreo.  </li>
            <li>The units manufactured by the new Ultreo may not have this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased an Ultreo way back when they first came out, and I loved it!  </li>
            <li>If the manufacturer can also give more information on how ultrasound technology is better in comparison with other technologies it would help convince users to pay more for the Ultreo.cy to apply too much pressure on the brush which reduces its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Firstly, I didn&#x27;t notice a significant improvement in the whiteness of my teeth over my Oral B.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s an investment I&#x27;m willing to make!</li>
            <li>Okay, I was tripping on paying this much money for a toothbrush, but, after reading all the positive reviews I had to try it.</li>
            <li>From the first time I used it, my teeth felt so clean.  </li>
            <li>I felt how clean my teeth bacame in the first day.</li>
            <li>I have noticed at the very first use (after a full 24h of battery charge, as recommended) that the cleaning performance is vastly superior, in half of the time.</li>
            <li>The 2nd/3rd time onwards, I can feel that it is doing its job very well and felt comfortable using it.    </li>
            <li>You use a tiny bit of toothpaste (also contributes to reduced drooling) and yet your teeth still feel amazing.  </li>
            <li>I found replacement brushes on drugstore.com for $35--not cheap, but not a rip-off either.  </li>
            <li>I used a Sonicare for 6 years and this is far better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ever bought, and well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t enjoyed brushing my teeth in my whole life as much as I do now.</li>
            <li>I must also add that I use gel toothpaste, since the instructions are clear that it makes more bubbles.    </li>
            <li>Might be worth it just for that.  </li>
            <li>for the last three years, and really liked it.  </li>
            <li>problem with many power toothbrushes is that you run the risk of wearing away the enamel over time, by adhering to the old \\&quot;brush for five minutes\\&quot; mantra that we were taught as children.  </li>
            <li>It makes me think all the cleaning action is done by the good old bristles.    </li>
            <li>Is it worth it?  </li>
            <li>When first set up, it takes 24 hours for the lights on the toothbrush display to stop flashing indicating a full battery charge.</li>
            <li>I find myself brushing more frequently and for longer periods of time.  </li>
            <li>Over two weeks of use, all my stains were gone and my mouth felt fresh as just after a dentist cleaning.    </li>
            <li>Is it worth the money?</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s well worth the time and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s well worth the time and money.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use it over my other brush but will watch for one with a better ability to reach all the areas of the teeth better.</li>
            <li>While the vibration was a bit unnerving at first, I quickly adapted.  </li>
            <li>It is much more efficient to clean your mouth in 4 quadrants, spending 30 seconds on each quadrant for two minutes total.  </li>
            <li>This is a worth spending if you really want to keep your teeth clean, and you have problem with cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li>Ultreo comes with some charge right out of the box.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The speed is just right</li>
            <li>I was right....</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the right price as I recall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive gums and the brush irritated them a bit more than I would like.</li>
            <li>The all-around clean feeling after brushing.  </li>
            <li>It really makes your teeth sqeeky clean.    </li>
            <li>Your brush will need to be charged for 24 hours to have a full charge, but I was able to use my brush after only eight hours of charging.  </li>
            <li>my dental hygienist aways comments on how clean my teeth are and that she didn&#x27;t have much in the way of tartar or plaque to remove.</li>
            <li>It is as gentle as can be on the gums while still getting your teeth clean.</li>
            <li>Great little toothbrush!</li>
            <li>I certainly hope that&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>Another nice feature of the Ultreo is the brush head is easy to remove, and doesn&#x27;t collect the messy gunk between/beneath the connection of the brush head to the handle that occured with my sonicare.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Other strong positives (in addition to the gentle approach to the gums) is that it really does help whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li>Despite having a nice grip, a nice travel case, and a handy adapter for overseas travel (no need for a transformer), the brush head is larger than sonicare and has an odd rubber piece in the middle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always surprised to see how fast the two minutes go by, I enjoy brushing my teeth for once and the clean feeling lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, not messy, and makes my teeth feel like I just came from the dentist.</li>
            <li>Both have good design elements but Sonicare has a slight edge over Ultreo.    </li>
            <li>The Ultreo seems to yield good results with much less stress on my gums.  </li>
            <li>I contact Chuck, who had been a super help as the Ultreo boss ... very responsive.  </li>
            <li>When you get the hang of it, the toothbrush is easy to use and clear instructions are provided.</li>
            <li>For one thing, I would have liked it if the Ultreo had come with two toothbrush heads (as the Sonicare does) instead of just one, so my wife wouldn&#x27;t presumably need to purchase a whole second unit so she could use this too.</li>
            <li>and when I heard that was happening, I bought an extra unit right away, and as many brushes as I could find.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush seems to work fine and if used as directed will not only clean your teeth but also protect your gums.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m pretty good at brushing my teeth with one of those old-fashioned toothbrushes that require a slight arm motion and don&#x27;t include batteries.  </li>
            <li>The Ultreo is a sensational unit and does an amazing job - but sadly it is truly an orphan brand now - Ultreo went under in the early part of 2009- thus if you DO by this, do understand that there is no warranty,and the once easy to find brush heads are gone from the retail market.    </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve made the world worse for consumers by killing off a good new technology instead of fighting to own it for the betterment of your customers.  </li>
            <li>My roommate is a devoted Sonicare user, but for some reason I&#x27;ve always been fine doing things the old fashioned way.</li>
            <li>I just had gum surgery and wanted something that would really keep my teeth clean but be gentle on my gums....</li>
            <li>The brush head is not as large as my normal tooth brush but doesn&#x27;t fit well in my mouth.</li>
            <li>My husband and I have used many different types of teeth cleaning devices.</li>
            <li>I see from the reviews that many people are having similar problems.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to the Sonicare, although I did think the Ultreo did a marginally better job.</li>
            <li>Based only on how my mouth feels, the Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush does a fabulous job!</li>
            <li>If you have never used an electronic toothbrush before, there are some things you need to be aware of.  </li>
            <li>After charging it, I wanted to get the maximum effect, so I used the baking power toothpaste for the first time...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>The first thing I should say is that it does make my teeth feel cleaner</li>
            <li>It seems to do exactly that from my perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t really \\&quot;brush\\&quot; like you do with a normal toothbrush, but rather lightly rub the bristles against your teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(The recommended order is outside bottom, inside bottom, outside top, inside top.)</li>
            <li>I used some red disclosing dye to try and figure out if perhaps the ultreo was doing a better job than I gave it credit for.</li>
            <li>had bought a Phillips Sonicare on the recommendation of my dental hygienist a month before Ultreo, so I was able to compare these toothbrushes for several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can feel it at work from the first time you put it in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s an issue, don&#x27;t spend the bucks for a unit like this in the first place.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s an investment I&#x27;m willing to make!se by someone else in the household.    </li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s an issue, don&#x27;t spend the bucks for a unit like this in the first place.  </li>
            <li>There is an indicator on the brush to tell you when it needs to be recharged, but I&#x27;ve had mine for about 3 weeks and charged it the first day and then unplugged it</li>
            <li>I became interested after my dentist mentioned the product.</li>
            <li>pretty sight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is the oddest feeling using the Ultreo toothbrush for the first time.</li>
            <li>I am hooked and I would recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s interested.  </li>
            <li>I was using an Oral B electric toothbrush prior to using Ultreo, and I was satisfied with the feeling I got from that.  </li>
            <li>I was still skeptical but took the plunge because of the great savings through amazon-- $86 with shipping!    </li>
            <li>The unit is similar to the Sonic products, but did seem to work faster and better.  </li>
            <li>---the stronger you make them in fact, the more likely they are to damage your mucous membranes than they are to remove a biofilm, thats a fact.  </li>
            <li>I got my first Ultreo in 2007 and just had to replace it this year in 2013.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now an avid fan.</li>
            <li>At first I was leery of this product.  </li>
            <li>The smaller head is a lot more maneuverable for me.</li>
            <li>The smaller head is a lot more maneuverable for me.</li>
            <li>The Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush was my first experience using an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The place where the head attaches to the unit body vibrates, and thus makes more noise, than seems necessary.</li>
            <li>Upon going back to the Sonicare, I was able to get things under control.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, into my first year, the toothbrush died on me.  </li>
            <li>Finally, the company was brought back to life, and I was able to purchase more brush heads.  </li>
            <li>The first brush died after 4-5 years, as battery-operated-anything are wont to do</li>
            <li>HALLELUJAH I discover they&#x27;re back in business (and have been for more than a year, it seems).  </li>
            <li>At my 6-month cleaning last week, my hygienist was very excited about the difference.  </li>
            <li>My dog (Waddles) had never previously taken an issue with my tooth cleaning routine so some sort of sound must be coming from this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>By the second usage though, I got the hang of it and my teeth felt very clean.</li>
            <li>The users manual has good detail about how to position the brush against your teeth and how much (or in this case little) pressure to apply when brushing.  </li>
            <li>It might be well worth it to buy a new system for the elusive brush heads!      </li>
            <li>It actually surprised me how clean my teeth feel when I&#x27;m done brushing.  </li>
            <li>So far my teeth are literally squeaky clean after every brushing.  </li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re like a good friend of mine that&#x27;s been using the same toothbrush for years, you&#x27;re probably not going to spend ten bucks on a \\&quot;throwaway\\&quot; electric toothbrush anyway, let alone one in this price range.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m more of a green guy, not that it&#x27;s that important.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Oral B Sonic Complete (my favorite and a real bargain at less than fifty dollars many places) and the SonicCare Elite.</li>
            <li>In essence ultrasound is not a complete solution but a better one than what our sonic toothbrushes will do.  </li>
            <li>It was a bit strange for me at first, and I didn&#x27;t feel I had done a good job cleaning my teeth with it, following up with brushing the old-fashioned way for safety&#x27;s sake.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is now packed away in a drawer for the next time I need to clean the grout in my tile (maybe the jackhammer will be useful then).</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is now packed away in a drawer for the next time I need to clean the grout in my tile (maybe the jackhammer will be useful then).</li>
            <li>It happened on about my third full charge of the device, so I&#x27;m pretty sure it is not the battery -- and if it is that would be a big reason not to buy this, since the battery is not replaceable.</li>
            <li>I waited awhile before posting this review to let my feelings sink in, but I&#x27;ve got to say that while this toothbrush was a new and exciting experience, I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ll use it every day.</li>
            <li>I bought my ultreo toothbrush from another source for less, and I have been totally thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li>Never really was able to be consistent with an electric brush or waterpic, because of tooth sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>So my ex sister in law is a dental hygienist, and HIGHLY recommended the Ultreo to me many years ago--at least six years ago, maybe as many as 7 or 8.</li>
            <li>Some people claimed that it was too large and bulky/heavy.</li>
            <li>The Ultreo brush looks good and feels great in the hand, the charger is also nifty - a round doughnut like shaped disc that you slide base of the brush into making charging very easy and convenient.</li>
            <li>I am a complete novice with regard to electric toothbrushes; this is my very first one.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they are no longer manufacturing this product, but we were desparate for new brushes and paid more that I remember for the last ones we found on line.</li>
            <li>It gets my teeth clean , but I don&#x27;t get that same WOW clean feeling</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re selling you the device for way too much money and then the device nags you after three months to buy a new replacement head for a whooping $23!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved this toothbrush since the very first day I got it a few years back.  </li>
            <li>They do feel amazingly clean after using it, and pretty much all the time for the last 3 weeks since I started using it.  </li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s teeth are very close together</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not cleaning my teeth very well.</li>
            <li>It works well, is just as comfortable as the Sonicare, and is very similar in design.  </li>
            <li>I am also getting over a month per charge, which is fantastic, especially for travel!        </li>
            <li>Overall, I enjoy using Ultreo and find myself bushing longer.</li>
            <li>I am not convinced that the ultrasound block embedded into the bristles adds much to the brush, although it appears to add a lot to the price of replacement brush heads.  </li>
            <li>so my whole family could use the brush.  </li>
            <li>not so much this brush.</li>
            <li>Fortunately they are back in business and supplying brush heads.</li>
            <li>and you can really see the difference.</li>
            <li>I am very dissatisfied, and not to mention a replacement brush head is about 30 dollars?</li>
            <li>very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided to try out the Ultreo and see if the Ultrasound thing was just a gimmick or if it really worked.  </li>
            <li>It also helps a lot when every 30+ seconds the brush is programmed to emit a sound to let me know  when to move to the next area that needs brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fact, I was nervous that it wasn&#x27;t cleaning my teeth very well at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another important thing to remember is that the Ultreo actually does the brushing motion for you.</li>
            <li>What is unusual about that?</li>
            <li>You can also change the speed from Max to Gentle, a feature not found on the Ultreo because it never gets as intense as the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: While I really did like the Ultreo it turned out that after about two months it wasn&#x27;t working for me anymore.  </li>
            <li>While I really did like the Ultreo it turned out that after about two months it wasn&#x27;t working for me anymore.  </li>
            <li>The brush is gentle on the gums.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t feel my teeth is any cleaner than the cleaning with Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Because of the ultrasound waveguide and the sonic bristles, all you need to do is gently run the Ultreo over your teeth and gums and it does all the work.  </li>
            <li>It feels like your whole jaw is vibrating</li>
            <li>toothbrush works very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks Ultreo</li>
            <li>I wanted to give myself a chance to really get to know the results before I settled on my opinion.  </li>
            <li>The Ultreo holds a great charge--I&#x27;ve left if off the charger for as much as 2 days--and it brushed no different than if it&#x27;d charged all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very helpful - turns out</li>
            <li>Very helpful.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush worked very well.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my teeth feeling so much cleaner than my Sonicare ever did.</li>
            <li>I was very concerned in the beginning.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Spending so much</li>
            <li>in all, this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>It is gentle but it packs the proof in cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Economic benefits:  </li>
            <li>My instincts tell me my teeth and gums will be improved at my next visit however, because they look and feel fantastic.</li>
            <li>think so, but \\&quot;better\\&quot; is a very subjective term.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been brushing my teeth with this brush for a few months now, however I can&#x27;t find anything spectacular to warrant the price.    </li>
            <li>Having received my Ultreo a few days ago, I can honestly say I really like using it</li>
            <li>I went from a manual brush to the Ultreo, although I did own a Sonicare a few years ago.  </li>
            <li>The brush comes with some handy features and stuff, like a travel container and the necessary recharger, and a helpful beeping to let you know when to move on to a different area of your mouth.</li>
            <li>My favorite brush is the Oral B Sonic Complete for its low price and reliability (the handset still works after 3 years).    </li>
            <li>And since I have a smaller mouth, the option of a smaller toothbrush head would have been nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>Your teeth REALLY do feel better than using a sonicare or other power brush.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>This is so gentle, my teeth feel so clean, and I have actually noticed that they are whiter.  </li>
            <li>The instructions say to replace the brush head every 3 months - you might be able to extend that a bit by alternating with another system every other day.    </li>
            <li>Is it better than the other electric toothbrushes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The Ultreo is straightforward and simple.</li>
            <li>Call me old-fashioned, but I feel as though actual bristles need to move over my teeth in order for them to get clean.     </li>
            <li>When I was initially using the Ultreo, I was concerned that this lack of \\&quot;force\\&quot; meant my teeth would not be as clean.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re glossy and white, and feel like I&#x27;ve just let the dentist office clean.  </li>
            <li>Even later in the day, my teeth still feel clean.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite features is a little sound the brush makes every 30 seconds to remind you to switch to a different part of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>me there is a very noticeable difference in the results from my Ultreo as compared to my Sonic (a previous favorite that I dragged around the world).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>Overall, I would not recommend anyone who currently has a good \\&quot;quality\\&quot; electric toothbrush spend the money to \\&quot;upgrade&#x27; to the Ultreo, however if you&#x27;re still using a manual toothbrush for some reason, you should definitely consider electric.</li>
            <li>With relief I packaged it back up and returned to my tried and true sonicare.</li>
            <li>If it is used as recommended, the brushing cycle is a full two minutes which is longer than I routinely brushed my teeth before getting the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I&#x27;m a real stickler when it comes to teeth, but ever since I&#x27;ve started paying more attention to my teeth cleaning routine, I&#x27;ve been spending a whole lot less time and money at the dentist!</li>
            <li>Yes, I&#x27;m a real stickler when it comes to teeth, but ever since I&#x27;ve started paying more attention to my teeth cleaning routine, I&#x27;ve been spending a whole lot less time and money at the dentist!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually had several people comment on how great my teeth look...and that thrills me!!&lt;br /&gt;After the first few days of brushing twice a day, for the alloted 2 min.</li>
            <li>Prior to using this brand I got to experience the new Sonicare brush, and even thought the other one has many more features and settings, the results are almost the same.</li>
            <li>Really too bad, as this was the best toothbrush I ever used.  </li>
            <li>I want them CLEAN, sparkly and fresh all the time, thus I brush several times a day, and periodically use white treatments.  </li>
            <li>, I felt it a bit odd because of the ultrasound vibrations and was not too sure if it would do its job.  </li>
            <li>Keeps tarter away better and has less splatter than the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>This package includes the main bushing unit, one brush head, the charging ring/base, power supply, carrying case for the brush and head, and instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While it did do a good job, I don&#x27;t feel it was worth the price, or the incredibly expensive cost of the brush heads.  </li>
            <li>That allows you to divide your mouth in to quarters to make sure that you give the proper amount of attention to your entire set of teeth and not just your favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When this one dies, I&#x27;ll most likely go back to Sonicare.</li>
            <li>There is also a \\&quot;quick tips\\&quot; sheet that covers some of this same information.  </li>
            <li>I personally believe that they&#x27;ll last longer and this time frame is more of a marketing scheme).  </li>
            <li>I got this toothbrush because at my last dental visit a couple of months ago the dentist said I would be needing an ultrasound cleaning next time if I didnt get to flossing more.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed that the trick is to keep as much fluid as possible around the brush head while in use, it works much better, which makes sense.</li>
            <li>While an electric toothbrush isn&#x27;t the most considerate way to brush your teeth should someone be sleeping outside the bathroom door, the \\&quot;brush a different set of teeth now\\&quot; alert bell could be a little more discrete.    </li>
            <li>But this one is different, the very first time I used it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this appliance a month ago with high hopes.</li>
            <li>For now, I think I&#x27;ll probably use this brush once a day for the supposed ultrasound benefits it offers, but use my other brush once a day as well, to make sure I get as thorough a brushing as I was before.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the toothbrush but disappointed that I probably won&#x27;t be able to get the replacement heads unless they get a lot more affordable, and I feel I have to deduct at least one star for that.</li>
            <li>Certainly, the cost of dental care can far exceed the cost of the Ultreo.  </li>
            <li>Certainly, the cost of dental care can far exceed the cost of the Ultreo.  </li>
            <li>My teeth did not feel any cleaner than with a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with a $3 &#x60;normal&#x27; toothbrush and leave the headaches to someone else.ill</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with a $3 &#x60;normal&#x27; toothbrush and leave the headaches to someone else.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Ultreo long enough to learn that it will hold a charge for more than two weeks with normal use.</li>
            <li>Since the bristles are higher than the waveguide in the middle, there is a tendency to apply too much pressure on the brush which reduces its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>The brush turns off after 2 minutes (though if you want to brush longer you can turn it back on again for 2 more minutes or for however long you want to continue).  </li>
            <li>I wanted to use this product for a few weeks before reviewing it so I could develop a good opinion on how the Ultreo does the job over the long term.  </li>
            <li>but it does make my mouth feel cleaner than normal brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>More staining has been removed in a few weeks than ever has from a visit to a dental</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Ultreo for a few weeks now and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I normally brush longer than two minutes, so I have to stop and turn the brush on again.    </li>
            <li>because if it actually did what it claimed beyond leaving your breath minty fresh, we would be going to dentists every 5 years instead of twice to four times a year.</li>
            <li>If you can live with the ongoing cost and the change to your brushing routine, I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you can live with the ongoing cost and the change to your brushing routine, I highly recommend it.    </li>
            <li>However, at this point, my initial impression is very positive.</li>
            <li>I would love a plastic slip cover for when the brush is not in use; we can argue about whether it would actually prevent any other bathroom germs, but it would certainly keep my cats from licking my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>another win for the &#x27;poor&#x27; corporation that puts food on your family, in your teeth and needs protection from rogue startups that threaten to undermine them entirely with the new use of a proven technology - real ultrasound.  </li>
            <li>Even the hard to get at spots feel as clean and smooth as they do when I leave the dentist&#x27;s office after a professional cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the first few days, my teeth ached, they were so clean.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without this toothbrush</li>
            <li>This is a new product and time will tell the tale.</li>
            <li>with all these disadvantages, how did I become a convert to the new Ultreo?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Chuck sent me a new one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finding a new brand.  </li>
            <li>(just ordered new ones).</li>
            <li>Ultreo&#x27;s customer service is good and they have replaced these handsets, but a generic cover letter from the CEO (included with one of the replacement handsets) alluded that there was a design flaw in some or all of the handsets and that they&#x27;d had a high rate of failure.</li>
            <li>With minimal effort on my part the bristles take over and hum their way across my enamels, leaving them feeling clean and tingly.  </li>
            <li>You know the old razors and blades scheme, especially if you own a computer printer: They sell you the device for cheap, and then make you buy expensive replacement parts (blades, ink, toner) way too often and for way too much money.  </li>
            <li>However, if you are looking for a very high-end tooth brush search no further!you are looking for a very high-end tooth brush search no further!</li>
            <li>It gives me a beep sound signaling to change the teeth \\&quot;quadrant\\&quot; to be brushed next.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are a few things about this that are less than ideal, which is why I only gave it four stars.</li>
            <li>It comes down to a matter of preference, but the Ultreo worked out fine for me.</li>
            <li>The rough vibration of those cheap little electrics doesn&#x27;t even come close to the tingly smooth feeling operation of an Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The instructions recommend charging for 24 hours prior to first use.</li>
            <li>Far messier than a normal tooth brush.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Design and Ergonomics:&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare wins this one as it is lighter, has a thin tapered flex design which feels more natural.</li>
            <li>This is pretty simple.  </li>
            <li>Coming from a manual toothbrush, this was a pretty big change for me.  </li>
            <li>However, I think the gap is pretty big between the Ultreo Ultrasonic and the Philips Sonicare.</li>
            <li>After my first use, my bite felt different.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to go through periodontal surgery but at one point in my life my gum pockets were pretty deep</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>it did the first time I used it, and every time I&#x27;ve used it since I have been similarly impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other devices out there, but this one just simply rocks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I simply hit the start button again, and brush until I feel my teeth are as clean as they can possibly get.  </li>
            <li>However, I noticed that when I brushed with the Ultreo as per the instructions keeping lots of fluid in my mouth my teeth felt so clean I&#x27;d forget to brush for a couple of days.</li>
            <li>It provided a clean that I could not get with the other sonic toothbrush</li>
            <li>The brush head has very few brushes, i was amazed i thought i would actually be able to brush my teeth with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe this was a problem with the old units and the new units don&#x27;t have this issue, but it is something to keep in mind, should you decide to purchase this</li>
            <li>But the long term cost of using the Ultreo needs to be taken into account when deciding if the Ultreo is right for you.</li>
            <li>We have used a Sonicare brush for the past 6 years and the Ultreo is far better.</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;m totally willing to convert to it completely, except that there is no way I will be paying the current price for the replacement heads.</li>
            <li>The confidence that the up and down brushing method is better than scraping back and forth</li>
            <li>I offer this background as proof that I am more than a little interested in any new innovations that might help me do the teeth-cleaning job a little better and with less abrasion to my tooth enamel and (exposed!)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Given the cost of extra brush heads, I might suggest that you buy the [[ASIN:B000X624U0 Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush - Extra Brush Head Special - Dental Professional Model]].  </li>
            <li>It is difficult to get in onto the back of the teeth in any consistent manner to do a good brushing.  </li>
            <li>Now I have only half of the ring of bristles touching the teeth.</li>
            <li>More than anything, you have to remember to do as little as possible.</li>
            <li>actually didn&#x27;t like the ultreo as much as sonicare off the bat because it had such a large brush head.</li>
            <li>No, it&#x27;s not like getting a whitening treatment, but I&#x27;ve noticed a clear difference that I did not get with the Oral B (even when using their polishing head).</li>
            <li>Amazon offers the replacement brush heads, so are obtainable.</li>

            <li>It took me a couple of days to get used to it, but very soon I realized that my teeth felt cleaner than they had since my last visit to the dentist.</li>
            <li>, maybe I am just over sensitive to having a jackhammer in my mouth.</li>
            <li>This is NO commercial - I&#x27;m 100% real and this brush is has done it.</li>
            <li>So much for getting my money back or getting a replacement.  </li>
            <li>However, as a dentist, I was intrigued by Ultreo&#x27;s incorporation of an ultrasound element into a toothbrush, coupling \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; bristle action with ultrasound energy.  </li>
            <li>This power toothbrush works with a sonic bristle action that is combined with what is called ultrasound waveguide technology.</li>
            <li>It is still manual in terms of brushing action.  </li>

            <li>So far I have not found a way to change this.  </li>
            <li>I get my teeth professionally cleaned 4 x a year.    </li>
            <li>I must say that I have mildly surprised by the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>Without metal-on-metal contact electricity can not pass directly from one source to another.</li>
            <li>- My gums being sensitive, prefer the Ultreo which massages them with the microbubbles.</li>
            <li>This creates a foaming, cleaning action analogous to an ultrasonic jewelry cleaner.  </li>
            <li>The information is clear and concise.  </li>
            <li>The feeling I get from Ultreo, however, is a whole different experience.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I have been using this product since last winter, and we are both very satisified with it.  </li>
            <li>They literally look polished, like after a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I understand that there were several legal issues regarding the technology that was used.      </li>
            <li>So while their teeth are rotting in their skulls at least their pits smell fantastic!      </li>
            <li>You can get it directly from the company for $149 (with about $11 in shipping).  </li>
            <li>I first tried an electric tooth about 3 years back - I used it for 4 weeks with the batteries and later on just used it as a normal toothbrush.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this brush for a few weeks (long enough to get a handle on the technique of using an electric brush), I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with its operation.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are no longer sensitive and my gums are no longer irritated from overly aggressive brushing.</li>
            <li>The 1-877-4-ULTREO help desk clarified that this is the ultra-sound frequency generator that provides the cleaning action.</li>
            <li>The sonic action in the bristles is just a non-performer.</li>
            <li>I used it for 6 months and got very dissapointed for such a costly loss.</li>
            <li>Rest assured that this is a real review from a person who actually is using the Ultreo</li>
            <li>Ultreo solves this problem completely.</li>
            <li>Stick with a tried-and-true brand like Sonicare or Oral B Sonic Complete.</li>
            <li>It leaves my teeth feeling like I have just had a professional cleaning by a dental hygenist.  </li>
            <li>I called the company, and since the toothbrush was now out of service, they offered to sell me some old stock units for $60.  </li>
            <li>It was more expensive to buy from Amazon, but was well worth it.</li>
            <li>Overall, I highly reccomend this toothbrush to anyone switching to a new electric toothbrush or just switching from a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It happened on about my third full charge of the device, so I&#x27;m pretty sure it is not the battery -- and if it is that would be a big reason not to buy this, since the battery is not replaceable.admit that I&#x27;m curious now about other related toothbrush products, but I expect to be using this one for a very long time.    </li>
            <li>I am disappointed to see so many negative reviews because it is bankrupt vs the quality of the product but than a good warning about warranty is useful.    </li>
            <li>I noticed my teeth are squeaky clean and are brighter after the few times I have used it.</li>
            <li>And, I&#x27;ve noticed too that the high-frequency vibrating dislodges many tiny bits of food and snacks often hidden away between my back teeth.    </li>
            <li>A search on 10/13/2009 of the web sites of the two main local newspapers that cover the manufacturer&#x27;s region --</li>
            <li>the last 15 days of usage, (mornings with Sonicare, evenings with Ultreo first week and flip order next week)</li>
            <li>In the last 15 days of usage, (mornings with Sonicare, evenings with Ultreo first week and flip order next week)</li>
            <li>However, I think the gap is pretty big between the Ultreo Ultrasonic and the Philips Sonicare.yday, but I do get the occasional reminder.  </li>
            <li>One morning, I even forgot to brush because my teeth still felt clean from the previous night!</li>
            <li>and hopefully they see fit to sell some replacement heads for less than they are currently asking.</li>
            <li>but very little pressure is needed during brushing, and overall it leaves the teeth feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>I would say, though, that for the price, I&#x27;m not sure if this brush really beats a conventional one with more bristles</li>
            <li>It takes a few days to get the feel of how to use this true ultrasound electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>That makes it easy to maneuver in your mouth and get into those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>It still vibrates but not nearly with the same intensity as before -- and it feels more or less just like I&#x27;m brushing my teeth manually.  </li>
            <li>It still vibrates but not nearly with the same intensity as before -- and it feels more or less just like I&#x27;m brushing my teeth manually.  </li>
            <li>There are times I wish it didn&#x27;t turn off automatically because I&#x27;d like to continue brushing another 20 seconds, but not enough to start a new two minute cycle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I had only had my new toothbrush a week.</li>
            <li>it sets a new standard of oral hygiene.</li>
            <li>My teeth are white and I&#x27;m having a real (almost physical) pleasure looking at my teeth after brushing.</li>
            <li>The head is too big and the bristles don&#x27;t seem to move fast enough.</li>
            <li>DiamondClean comes with all sorts of bells and whistles that don&#x27;t really matter like a charging glass, charging travel case, multiple cleaning levels (which are gimiky in my opinion), and an extra brush head.</li>
            <li>The major difference between this brush and my \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; model is the noise and the pressure of the brush on your teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>This Ultreo Ultrasound toothbrush is my first electric toothbrush, so I can&#x27;t compare it to any of the other leading brands.  </li>
            <li>I brushed with my old sonicare flexcare just to confirm my suspicion on it feeling cleaner!  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, this results in such a gentle motion that I still have food stuck between my teeth after brushing, something that wasn&#x27;t true of Sonicare!!</li>
            <li>The Ultreo not only has a timer that shuts the brush down at the two minute mark, it also has a ring tone-type sound that marks each 30 second interval.  </li>
            <li>Better than rotary oralB even, which is very hard to beat.  </li>
            <li>There are a few little nice additions, too, such as the velcro strap on the power cord to bundle the cord if it&#x27;s too long and a small plastic cover that snaps onto the top of the brush to protect the bristles when not in use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If used correctly (you don&#x27;t brush hard at all, and do light circles over the surfaces of your teeth)</li>
            <li>Somehow I find it hard to keep the bristles of the Ultreo positioned comfortably on  my teeth.</li>
            <li>do the work\\&quot; by applying only light pressure and moving the brush in small circles.  </li>
            <li>4 stars only, however, as I am also surprised at the cost of the replacement brush heads.  </li>
            <li>This is a big plus for people who are concerned about gum recession, or who were bothered by sonicare&#x27;s \\&quot;tickling\\&quot; action.    </li>
            <li>apparently, they are no longer being manufactured.  </li>
            <li>Apparently as of today, their voicemail says the company is out of business.</li>
            <li>My dentist said to be careful about applying too much pressure with any electric toothbrush as I do with manual brush (thus the sensitivity).  </li>
            <li>When I go to floss, no residue is apparent-</li>
            <li>For price sensitive customer&#x27;s, I would give it a 3 out of possible 5 rating.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a slanted head like my old manual, so it takes some adjusting before you feel like its actually getting your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Funny thing is that the manual toothbrush I used to use had about the same size head, so when I got the Sonicare I had to get used to their smaller head, but with Ultreo, the big head is back.    </li>
            <li>Honestly, there is nothing difficult you put your toothpaste on the brush, turn the unit on and then stick it into your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the long term cost of using the Ultreo needs to be taken into account when deciding if the Ultreo is right for you.aying that if you are true to your teeth they won&#x27;t be false to you.  </li>
            <li>They said they don&#x27;t see real difference between the efficacy of this brush over other sonic brushes.</li>
            <li>Dental hygiene is one of the few health sciences where the practitioners, insurers and consumers tend to agree that proactive maintenance is the best way to avoid expensive repair work down the road.  </li>

            <li>such a combination (I use water pick on mornings only) completely changed my tooth&#x27; (gums) look a feel.</li>
            <li>The bristles do not provide scrubbing action, rather they only contain the fluid (paste and saliva)</li>
            <li>I am coming from a traditional toothbrush and this product is so far above</li>
            <li>Nothing major, but enough to feel some discomfort.</li>
            <li>--it&#x27;s not very effective for brushing a tongue, and it can be easy to miss spots on your teeth and notice plaque after you&#x27;re done brushing, which generally doesn&#x27;t happen when I use my conventional brush.  </li>
            <li>However, ultrasound is a new twist; the bush doesn&#x27;t move with the old up and down motion -</li>
            <li>I switched to the ultra soft head which helped a lot, but still there&#x27;s some minor</li>
            <li>I must admit the first time I used it was not a comfortable experience.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The toothbrush mounts in a little \\&quot;O\\&quot; ring connected to a plug and charges up fairly quickly -- and, as it turns out, runs for weeks on a single charge.  </li>
            <li>Sonicare brush heads are available for less than half the cost of Ultreo brush heads.</li>
            <li>Sonicare brush heads are available for less than half the cost of Ultreo brush heads.</li>
            <li>Ultreo really needs to bring down the cost of the replacement brush</li>
            <li>Ultreo really needs to bring down the cost of the replacement brush heads.    </li>
            <li>brushing session lasts exactly two minutes, and the brush gives a little indication tone every 30 seconds when it&#x27;s on -- giving you 30 seconds to brush each of the regions of your teeth, which I find to be about enough time to cover every side of every tooth about 3 times.  </li>
            <li>I agree with a previous poster that some of these reviews seem very suspect.</li>
            <li>The cleaning action from this technology does not cause any physical wear on the enamel and consequently, there is no reason for use of this product to cause any sensitivity over the long run.</li>
            <li>There is an old saying that if you are true to your teeth they won&#x27;t be false to you.  </li>
            <li>The sensitivity generated on certain teeth took a few brushings to go</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This is an excellent electric toothbrush, but after the manufacturer&#x27;s bankruptcy the shortage of replacement brush heads has quintupled their price.  </li>
            <li> Best toothbrush</li>
            <li> The best feature to the toothbrush is the timer.  </li>
            <li> I cannot begin to explain how happy I am to be using this toothbrush again!  </li>
            <li> If you consider buying this brush (the best choice</li>
            <li> Best yet...</li>
            <li> It was, and still is, an excellent product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had excellent oral hygiene</li>
            <li> I have had all the best over the years.</li>
            <li> Very impressed.</li>
            <li> Its works GREAT!!!  </li>
            <li> It does an excellent job of giving your teeth a thorough cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Before I go all out and say this is the best toothbrush on earth</li>
            <li> Best way to find out what works best for you is to try them all out</li>
            <li> Best way to find out what works best for you is to try them all out</li>
            <li> Happy brushing!</li>
            <li> As a dental hygienist, I cannot express how great the Ultreo is!!</li>
            <li> I wanted the best toothbrush on the market, so I bought and compared both the Sonicare DiamondClean and Ultreo; both were found out about through word of mouth.</li>
            <li> But...I LOVE IT!!!      </li>
            <li> Good job P&amp;G!  </li>
            <li> have my teeth looked and felt this good!</li>
            <li> (so no complaints--daily use for 1500 days is good by me!).  </li>
            <li> Even if I ever forget to brush them, my teeth stay and feel great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my Ultreo.</li>
            <li> And the head is supposed to be replaced at 3 month intervals, at great cost.  </li>
            <li> and it works great.</li>
            <li> After using this for 2 weeks I am happy with results</li>
            <li> It took about two or three days to get used to this toothbrush, but since then it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li> However, if you are looking for an electric toothbrush and can afford this one, the Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush is a great choice for you.</li>
            <li> if that what it takes to keep my teeth, it is a price I am happy to pay.</li>
            <li> The bristle design makes it ideal to get in between teeth and do a good scrubbing job.  </li>
            <li> It also vibrates a lot, which doesn&#x27;t feel great in my hand or mouth.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve said all that, lol, to say this:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worked great - then died.  </li>
            <li> My plan was to buy additional units in case it happened again - figuring they perhaps don&#x27;t have a great business model or something despite a great product.  </li>
            <li> This is great news.</li>
            <li> I use this great toothbrush once a day.    </li>
            <li> If you never used any kind of electronic brushing device, Ultreo would be an excellent choice.</li>
            <li> All great stuff.</li>
            <li> It is a great product.  </li>
            <li> Everything was great until - you guessed it, the toothbrush refused to charge.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this unit, and it worked great... for about 9 months.  </li>
            <li> - It&#x27;s a great product, with some quality control issues.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m SO happy to share with you all how happy I&#x27;ve been.  </li>
            <li> Ultreo Ultrasound works very effectively.</li>
            <li> I was not always successful.  </li>
            <li> Love the design - best way to describe it is that if Apple were to make a toothbrush, this would be it.</li>
            <li> A superb and unique product!  </li>
            <li> It did seem to do a good job of getting a cleaner brushing.    </li>
            <li> I loved it dearly.  </li>
            <li> So the two weeks of use is probably a good length of time to become accustomed to it.      </li>
            <li> The Ultreo is the best toothbrush available.</li>
            <li> I Loved this product.</li>
            <li> is it doing a good job.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s a charge for a good while.</li>
            <li> I thought I was doing a good job of brushing with it, and do not have a history of dental problems.  </li>
            <li> I obtained an Ultreo from my dentist who did some restorative work on my teeth - loved it.   </li>
            <li> Both are good, but don&#x27;t match the Ultreo.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, you&#x27;ll also see good results with an Oral B or a Sonic Care.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, you&#x27;ll also see good results with an Oral B or a Sonic Care.</li>
            <li> But I noticed what a good job</li>
            <li> It got my teeth sparkling clean, and my dental hygienist was thoroughly impressed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the brush ever since and have been exceptionally</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a very top of the line toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame because this is a really good and effective toothbrush</li>
            <li> The Ultreo seems to do a very nice job of cleaning teeth and helping to keep gums healthy.  </li>

            <li> I stored the Ultreo (battery went dead)in hopes that the company might return...and am glad I did!  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> I love this brush!  </li>
            <li> Pretty impressive</li>
            <li> I am sure you will like it if you get one, just dont get too attached!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> find that the best combo is to use the Ultreo as my \\&quot;main\\&quot; toothbrush, but every so often use the Oral-B to make sure that all areas are getting clean.</li>

            <li> It does an amazing job of cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li> really liked this toothbrush even though I thought it was too</li>
            <li> I have an Ultreo and really liked this toothbrush, however the company went out of business some time ago.</li>
            <li> I liked the concept, of electronic brushing, but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never used an ultrasound toothbrush -- or an electric one of any kind, for that matter.</li>
            <li> The charging stand, power cord, and a rather nice travel case.</li>
            <li> This brush changed my opinion about my own teeth...</li>
            <li> Do the math, you&#x27;re going to cough up $92 for replacement heads per year, not including tax or S&amp;H.  Nice try, Ultreo.</li>
            <li> Also, the timer on the toothbrush is nice if you&#x27;ve never used a toothbrush with a timer before.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Sonic which was good, but I REALLY love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I just couldn&#x27;t see the improvement over using my sonicare.</li>
            <li> Two weeks after receiving the Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush, I can honestly feel and see a difference with my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The bottom line is where it counts, though, and I was impressed with how much cleaner my teeth feel after using this brush compared to my manual brushes.  </li>
            <li> it comes with a nice travel case.  </li>
            <li> Nice travel case to go with it    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a longtime Sonicare user, and would honestly recommend Sonicare over Ultreo anytime.</li>
            <li> but I was told that my 30 day satisfaction guarantee was expired, so I was on my own.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get the nice \\&quot;clean\\</li>
            <li> He&#x27;ll think it&#x27;s a toothbrush, but in reality, it&#x27;s a bright, confident smile and great dental health for years to come.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using the toothbrush is very easy.</li>
            <li> Ultreo was the latest and greatest and despite the relatively high cost I took the plunge.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best toothbrush that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;The company has been sold and they are making product again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> however more than compensates for that because the Ultreo is dramatically more gentle than the sonicare, while still providing excellent plaque and stain removal.  </li>
            <li> I had been shopping around for a brush for a while, tried my boyfriend&#x27;s sonicare and liked it, but didn&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best choice if you have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best choice if you have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> My opinion is that this is a very nice toothbrush that makes my teeth feel clean and my gums feels healthy.  </li>
            <li> This seems like a good brush for those who don&#x27;t like the intensity of a Sonicare but still want clean teeth.</li>
            <li> This seems like a good brush for those who don&#x27;t like the intensity of a Sonicare but still want clean teeth.</li>
            <li> I normally floss after brushing and I have found that the Ultreo does a very good job of cleaning between my teeth as well.  </li>
            <li> The first time I went to the dentist after switching to the Ultreo, the hygenist told me what a great job I was doing with my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I liked mine so much, my husband had to get his own!</li>
            <li> brush itself feels well made and fits nicely in the hand and makes for easy manipulation inside the mouth.  </li>
            <li> as most dental hygienist do, but even with my home care regiman I got tremendous results with tea stain removal and the \\&quot;just out of the dental chair\\&quot; feeling of clean!!!</li>
            <li> If you buy this, you can&#x27;t get any more replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> So, much as I love this toothbrush, I&#x27;d advise against buying it unless you can afford to stock up on brush heads at $112 each.    </li>
            <li> Ask your dentist to make sure).</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be able to find replacement heads, there won&#x27;t be a warranty</li>
            <li> but of course I try my best to remember since tooth problems are the last thing I am waiting for!</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I immediately called and was able to replace the handle and buy more brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> after that I used Phillips Sonicare (with built-in in the handle replaceable toothpaste tubes) - feels much better than Braun&#x27;s Oral-B, but had no effect on my teeth either.</li>
            <li> even if your teeth are much better than mine) - buy it together with some water picking device -</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush believing it was better then</li>
            <li> Preset for 2 minute brushes, there is an alert that sounds every 30 seconds--which I love.  </li>
            <li> I had been a sonicare user since it came on the market more than a decade ago.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Ultreo for over a year and am highly satisfied with its performance.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this is a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li> I used a Sonicare for 4 years before Ultreo and was pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> I think the Ultreo is even better</li>
            <li> A manual brush or device may work better to brush the tongue for breath.</li>
            <li> But I do notice the experience gets better ever day.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended and the toothbrush using ultrasound works better in cleaning the teeth, or the teeth feel cleaner, in comparison to my electric rotating head toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Initial opinion of the Ultreo is excellent.  </li>
            <li> Easier on the gums, better vs tartar.</li>
            <li> I used the Ultreo and was just amazed how much better it cleaned.</li>
            <li> - it cleaned my items faster and so much better than the others</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s the replacement costs that matter more.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s the replacement costs that matter more.</li>
            <li> more of a chime than a beep -- it helps me be sure I&#x27;m doing a thorough job</li>
            <li> OK.</li>
            <li> P&amp;G. It is interesting to see how it goes.</li>
            <li> This is one area where Sonicare has an advantage because replacement heads for a comparable model come in a 3 pack for about $5 more.  </li>
            <li> This is one area where Sonicare has an advantage because replacement heads for a comparable model come in a 3 pack for about $5 more.  </li>
            <li> But it is important that you use the toothbrush correctly in order for it to work effectively.  </li>
            <li> Better gums</li>
            <li> Better breath&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> notice that there is an Ultreo costing $10.00 more than this model.  </li>
            <li> they do seem more reflective.</li>
            <li> but I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Love the timer as I&#x27;m brushing.  </li>
            <li> I went from a manual tooth brush to the Ultreo and absolty love it.  </li>
            <li> which is more what I was used to.  </li>
            <li> It relies more on the &#x27;sonic&#x27; waves for cleaning...</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Chuck says, you might have to charge more than 24 hours;</li>
            <li> I considered investing in the sonicare flexcare and then read some comparisons which said they are comparable, or that Ultreo is slightly better.  </li>
            <li> and I love the way my teeth feel afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the product</li>
            <li> Better than sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I love my Ultreo.  </li>
            <li> What I like about it the most:    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonic Care for many years and have always been satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I used Oral-B Vitality, Philips Sonicare FlexCare and finally Ultreo; and BELIEVE me this is undoubtedly the best solution out there.</li>
            <li> That makes it worthwhile for me.    </li>
            <li> but I still perfered spending 2 minutes bottom an 2 minutes on top.  </li>
            <li> This brush runs for 1:20 minutes each time, my sonicare runs for more than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Battery life is good, and it&#x27;s easy to clean (and keep clean).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line - any electric toothbrush will usually be a better choice than a manual one.</li>
            <li> any electric toothbrush will usually be a better choice than a manual one.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s hoping they become more affordable in the future.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have always been satisfied with its performance, so</li>
            <li> On the whole, I&#x27;m quite happy with this device.</li>
            <li> It felt like I needed more \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; from the Ultreo in its brushing.</li>
            <li> This is an attractive product with good potential.</li>
            <li> much as I love my Ultreo, I just can&#x27;t justify paying for it again at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been keeping it to myself so that I could get replacement brushes without competition, and now that&#x27;s not a problem :-)</li>
            <li> This brush gets your teeth very clean</li>
            <li> it is very comfortable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> , she must be getting a pretty good cut</li>
            <li> This was a pretty good product when you adjusted to the correct method of using it.  </li>
            <li> The vibrations produced are pleasant and when there is some water in the mouth - recommended by the instructions - the bubbles form really well</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great buy and it looks artsy while comes with a nice travel case.</li>
            <li> The Ultreo is great, far better than the Sonicare I had been using.</li>
            <li> My teeth are Dentist clean!  </li>
            <li> The results are great, it really does remove stains, and leaves the mouth feeling so clean.  </li>
            <li> However, my teeth feel cleaner and more plaque free with the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Best news that I&#x27;ve heard in a very long time!!  </li>
            <li> If anyone is looking for new technology with amazing results, this brush is the one!</li>
            <li> ( so did my dentist ) and even bought one (at full price!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not been to my dentist yet to confirm if any health improvements, but the claim that teeth feel super-clean is true!</li>
            <li> This Ultreo Ultrasound toothbrush has been my first experience with an electric toothbrush, but so far it has been very pleasant.</li>
            <li> The Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush is supposed to be the latest and greatest new technology as far as electric toothbrushes go.</li>
            <li> However, Ultreo is still a good brush for those with more sensitive gums</li>
            <li> However, Ultreo is still a good brush for those with more sensitive gums</li>
            <li> But with Sonicare, I feel the teeth is more clean with the touch of my tounge.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle and hold</li>
            <li> The brush head pops off easily</li>
            <li> , the aching went away, and I got more used to clean</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend the Ultreo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems funny to think that something as basic as a toothbrush could benefit as much from technology, but the Ultreo Ultrasound is an excellent example of technology being put to good use.  </li>
            <li> I would anticipate very good results for long term dental use.</li>
            <li> The bristle sweeps do a great job of getting my teeth super clean that they don&#x27;t feel \\&quot;furry\\&quot; even after the whole day.</li>
            <li> This is probably true with most powered toothbrushes, but you do not want to hit your teeth or gums with anything but the bristles.  </li>
            <li> First is the price - kind of steep.</li>
            <li> I used Sonicare for years and liked it, but I LOVE my new Ultreo!</li>
            <li> Now, after having used the Ultreo product, I realize that although the Oral B brush felt like it was doing a good cleaning job, it may not have been as thorough as this new Ultreo brush.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this brush and it does the work that my sonicare can&#x27;t do, in half the time.</li>
            <li> If you can swing the cost, the Ultreo is a fine choice.</li>
            <li> If you can swing the cost, the Ultreo is a fine choice.</li>
            <li> I have found that this gives me a much more disciplined routine to brushing my teeth and ensures that I spend adequate time on all of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I am one of those people that if I don&#x27;t stay on top of my brushing and flossing, tartar builds up rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Ultreo gives you both a quick reference sheet and a more detailed user manual.  </li>
            <li> He was one of the experimental users of the Ultreo and with flossing and brushing was able to put his gums back in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> (someone commented their dentists had confirmed that.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy.</li>
            <li> The Ultreo was a fabulous toothbrush for the almost four months it worked.  </li>
            <li> I have since bought a much cheaper and equally nice Oral B Pulsonic.</li>
            <li> use of the Ultreo continues to keep my teeth free of plaque, stain and tartar.  </li>
            <li> However, if you are looking for an electric toothbrush and can afford this one, the Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush is a great choice for you.rush heads, which I believe are supposed to last around 6 months or so.</li>
            <li> But honestly, I just didn&#x27;t feel this was working very well for me.</li>
            <li> The Ultreo arcade style tune is more fun while the Sonicare just gives a beep.    </li>
            <li> I like the reminder, and the beeping sound every 30 seconds is not annoying --</li>
            <li> In addition it is available in PDF format from the Ultreo web site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After each brushing, the teeth are smooth and slippery as if polished.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads aren&#x27;t cheap either.</li>
            <li> I called the company (before they went out of business), and they replaced it, free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> This is actually a good thing since most bathrooms have some water present.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is also a display that lets you know when the unit is charging or fully charged, and on of the more attractive (minimal footprint) charger bases that I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li> I am a Sonicare user for more than 10 years (yes, that is right).</li>
            <li> toothbrush makes brushing my teeth more fun and interesting, and it gives my teeth that \\&quot;right after a dental appointment\\&quot; clean feeling.</li>
            <li> My sense is this is a very powerful</li>
            <li> It has resolved my brushing compulsion, by delivering a smooth and ultra fast cleansing that is coupled with pleasant tingling sensations around the gums that equate in my opinion to gentle massages.</li>
            <li> Who ever thought one could get excited about brushing their teeth?  </li>
            <li> one thing that could be significantly improved is the brush itself.  </li>
            <li> I did not notice any significant difference in the cleanliness of my teeth from using the Ultreo over the Oral B.  </li>
            <li> In my many years as an Amazon customer, this is the first item I have ever returned -- I am not one of those super-critical types.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like it, and it&#x27;s not an abrasive cleaning tool...</li>
            <li> maybe they are getting better - my first was purchased at about $200 in 2007.  </li>
            <li> The ultreo does not eliminate the plaque buildup, but it significantly reduces it.</li>
            <li> but I am willing to give it a try again because this brush is much better than my sonicare.</li>
            <li> is especially challenging - it can be done, but you have to contort a bit, and there&#x27;s usually some drooling involved.</li>
            <li> the front teeth is especially challenging - it can be done, but you have to contort a bit, and there&#x27;s usually some drooling involved.</li>
            <li> This is a review on the original Ultreo units.  </li>
            <li> In the three or four weeks since I received it, I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference in the whiteness of my teeth and the clean feel of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> and I can hear the squeaky clean of my teeth.</li>
            <li> The feeling of my inner lower teeth mimics that of professional cleaning from a dentist, very impressive.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean after using, and my dentist has seen a change in my teeth during my yearly visits.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The oral care and others do not get my teeth completely clean</li>
            <li> That lick your teeth clean feeling you get at the dentist can be achieved with this ultrasound oral care product.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from gum disease and am therefore hypervigilant about keeping my teeth scrupulously clean.</li>
            <li> The ultrasound energy then transforms the liquid into \\&quot;micro-bubbles\\&quot; which \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> The fewer bristles on an ultreo make it a gentler way to clean your teeth as it uses liquid as the scrubbing medium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The clean feeling lasts longer after brushing.</li>
            <li> if I&#x27;ve chewed alot of gum, or my teeth are feeling particulary in need of a deeper clean.  </li>
            <li> it seems the ultrasonic waves get to all the stuff that needs to be gotten, and my teeth feel really clean.    </li>
            <li> However - they always tell me my teeth are really clean</li>
            <li> clean</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use ultreo now I feel like my teeth aren&#x27;t clean.  </li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt this clean.</li>
            <li> are AMAZINGLLY clean teeth.  </li>
            <li> While sonicare also has this feature, I find that the Ultreo is easier to hear and is a pleasant reminder to move on to the next area of my mouth.    </li>
            <li> I have found this toothbrush can easily hold a charge for a full week worth of brushing.</li>
            <li> Nice build quality, feels good in the hand, takes up very little counter space.</li>
            <li> First and most importantly, the ultrasound action makes for a far more effective cleaning.  </li>
            <li> We used to be able to buy replacement brushes reasonably priced every 3-6 months.</li>
            <li> Ultreo keeps me brushing for the full recommended two minutes.</li>
            <li> Before using this they say to charge the toothbrush for a full 24 hours.</li>
            <li> The head is designed nicely and curves around each tooth while ultrasound action does its work.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is good alternative to the sonicare line</li>
            <li> I have to admit that this is the most unusual aspect to the Ultreo.</li>
            <li> It took about 18 hours for my unit to reach a full</li>
            <li> But this does not seem to be true.  </li>
            <li> At my last cleaning, the hygienist remarked about what a good job I was doing</li>
            <li> Not since I was sweet sixteen</li>
            <li> My last two visits have been good</li>
            <li> Both do an excellent job, and get your teeth a lot cleaner than a manual toothbrush (at least for me).</li>
            <li> If the manufacturer can also give more information on how ultrasound technology is better in comparison with other technologies it would help convince users to pay more for the Ultreo.</li>
            <li> Now I know - they my be white and clean and leave an absolute feeling of joy every morning and</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fine with a nice standard \\&quot;move the brush yourself\\&quot; appliance, but with new-fangled electrics etc.</li>
            <li> Well it made my mouth very fresh and clean feeling the first week</li>
            <li> * Clean and fresh feeling after brushing    </li>
            <li> The Ultreo arcade style tune is more fun while the Sonicare just gives a beep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Both have good design elements but Sonicare has a slight edge over Ultreo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I literally look forward to brushing and find myself brushing 4 to 5 times daily instead of 3 -- because when I&#x27;m done my gums feel good and my teeth feel fresh and clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not charge quickly.</li>
            <li> Contacted MFRer - Chuck got involved &amp; was super helpful, by email.  </li>
            <li> If you are lucky, you may find some brush heads for sale at your dentists office-</li>
            <li> Sonicare never gave such a superb cleaning experience and thus I chose the Ultreo as my next gen toothbrush.</li>
            <li> They said they may be seeing that for people with highly stain-prone teeth, the Ultreo loosens some of of the stain a bit better than Sonicare.    </li>
            <li> It tingles when you use it right, and if you surround the head with liquid, it really does do a better job.  </li>
            <li> I have normal, healthy</li>
            <li> I really do love my new Ultreo.  </li>
            <li> The units manufactured by the new Ultreo may not have this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased an Ultreo way back when they first came out, and I loved it!  </li>
            <li> If the manufacturer can also give more information on how ultrasound technology is better in comparison with other technologies it would help convince users to pay more for the Ultreo.cy to apply too much pressure on the brush which reduces its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I didn&#x27;t notice a significant improvement in the whiteness of my teeth over my Oral B.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s an investment I&#x27;m willing to make!</li>
            <li> Okay, I was tripping on paying this much money for a toothbrush, but, after reading all the positive reviews I had to try it.</li>
            <li> From the first time I used it, my teeth felt so clean.  </li>
            <li> I felt how clean my teeth bacame in the first day.</li>
            <li> I have noticed at the very first use (after a full 24h of battery charge, as recommended) that the cleaning performance is vastly superior, in half of the time.</li>
            <li> The 2nd/3rd time onwards, I can feel that it is doing its job very well and felt comfortable using it.    </li>
            <li> You use a tiny bit of toothpaste (also contributes to reduced drooling) and yet your teeth still feel amazing.  </li>
            <li> I found replacement brushes on drugstore.com for $35--not cheap, but not a rip-off either.  </li>
            <li> I used a Sonicare for 6 years and this is far better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever bought, and well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t enjoyed brushing my teeth in my whole life as much as I do now.</li>
            <li> I must also add that I use gel toothpaste, since the instructions are clear that it makes more bubbles.    </li>
            <li> Might be worth it just for that.  </li>
            <li> for the last three years, and really liked it.  </li>
            <li> problem with many power toothbrushes is that you run the risk of wearing away the enamel over time, by adhering to the old \\&quot;brush for five minutes\\&quot; mantra that we were taught as children.  </li>
            <li> It makes me think all the cleaning action is done by the good old bristles.    </li>
            <li> Is it worth it?  </li>
            <li> When first set up, it takes 24 hours for the lights on the toothbrush display to stop flashing indicating a full battery charge.</li>
            <li> I find myself brushing more frequently and for longer periods of time.  </li>
            <li> Over two weeks of use, all my stains were gone and my mouth felt fresh as just after a dentist cleaning.    </li>
            <li> Is it worth the money?</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s well worth the time and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s well worth the time and money.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use it over my other brush but will watch for one with a better ability to reach all the areas of the teeth better.</li>
            <li> While the vibration was a bit unnerving at first, I quickly adapted.  </li>
            <li> It is much more efficient to clean your mouth in 4 quadrants, spending 30 seconds on each quadrant for two minutes total.  </li>
            <li> This is a worth spending if you really want to keep your teeth clean, and you have problem with cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li> Ultreo comes with some charge right out of the box.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The speed is just right</li>
            <li> I was right....</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the right price as I recall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive gums and the brush irritated them a bit more than I would like.</li>
            <li> The all-around clean feeling after brushing.  </li>
            <li> It really makes your teeth sqeeky clean.    </li>
            <li> Your brush will need to be charged for 24 hours to have a full charge, but I was able to use my brush after only eight hours of charging.  </li>
            <li> my dental hygienist aways comments on how clean my teeth are and that she didn&#x27;t have much in the way of tartar or plaque to remove.</li>
            <li> It is as gentle as can be on the gums while still getting your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Great little toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I certainly hope that&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> Another nice feature of the Ultreo is the brush head is easy to remove, and doesn&#x27;t collect the messy gunk between/beneath the connection of the brush head to the handle that occured with my sonicare.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Other strong positives (in addition to the gentle approach to the gums) is that it really does help whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li> Despite having a nice grip, a nice travel case, and a handy adapter for overseas travel (no need for a transformer), the brush head is larger than sonicare and has an odd rubber piece in the middle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always surprised to see how fast the two minutes go by, I enjoy brushing my teeth for once and the clean feeling lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, not messy, and makes my teeth feel like I just came from the dentist.</li>
            <li> Both have good design elements but Sonicare has a slight edge over Ultreo.    </li>
            <li> The Ultreo seems to yield good results with much less stress on my gums.  </li>
            <li> I contact Chuck, who had been a super help as the Ultreo boss ... very responsive.  </li>
            <li> When you get the hang of it, the toothbrush is easy to use and clear instructions are provided.</li>
            <li> For one thing, I would have liked it if the Ultreo had come with two toothbrush heads (as the Sonicare does) instead of just one, so my wife wouldn&#x27;t presumably need to purchase a whole second unit so she could use this too.</li>
            <li> and when I heard that was happening, I bought an extra unit right away, and as many brushes as I could find.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush seems to work fine and if used as directed will not only clean your teeth but also protect your gums.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m pretty good at brushing my teeth with one of those old-fashioned toothbrushes that require a slight arm motion and don&#x27;t include batteries.  </li>
            <li> The Ultreo is a sensational unit and does an amazing job - but sadly it is truly an orphan brand now - Ultreo went under in the early part of 2009- thus if you DO by this, do understand that there is no warranty,and the once easy to find brush heads are gone from the retail market.    </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve made the world worse for consumers by killing off a good new technology instead of fighting to own it for the betterment of your customers.  </li>
            <li> My roommate is a devoted Sonicare user, but for some reason I&#x27;ve always been fine doing things the old fashioned way.</li>
            <li> I just had gum surgery and wanted something that would really keep my teeth clean but be gentle on my gums....</li>
            <li> The brush head is not as large as my normal tooth brush but doesn&#x27;t fit well in my mouth.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have used many different types of teeth cleaning devices.</li>
            <li> I see from the reviews that many people are having similar problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to the Sonicare, although I did think the Ultreo did a marginally better job.</li>
            <li> Based only on how my mouth feels, the Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush does a fabulous job!</li>
            <li> If you have never used an electronic toothbrush before, there are some things you need to be aware of.  </li>
            <li> After charging it, I wanted to get the maximum effect, so I used the baking power toothpaste for the first time...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> The first thing I should say is that it does make my teeth feel cleaner</li>
            <li> It seems to do exactly that from my perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t really \\&quot;brush\\&quot; like you do with a normal toothbrush, but rather lightly rub the bristles against your teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (The recommended order is outside bottom, inside bottom, outside top, inside top.)</li>
            <li> I used some red disclosing dye to try and figure out if perhaps the ultreo was doing a better job than I gave it credit for.</li>
            <li> had bought a Phillips Sonicare on the recommendation of my dental hygienist a month before Ultreo, so I was able to compare these toothbrushes for several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can feel it at work from the first time you put it in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s an issue, don&#x27;t spend the bucks for a unit like this in the first place.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s an investment I&#x27;m willing to make!se by someone else in the household.    </li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s an issue, don&#x27;t spend the bucks for a unit like this in the first place.  </li>
            <li> There is an indicator on the brush to tell you when it needs to be recharged, but I&#x27;ve had mine for about 3 weeks and charged it the first day and then unplugged it</li>
            <li> I became interested after my dentist mentioned the product.</li>
            <li> pretty sight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is the oddest feeling using the Ultreo toothbrush for the first time.</li>
            <li> I am hooked and I would recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s interested.  </li>
            <li> I was using an Oral B electric toothbrush prior to using Ultreo, and I was satisfied with the feeling I got from that.  </li>
            <li> I was still skeptical but took the plunge because of the great savings through amazon-- $86 with shipping!    </li>
            <li> The unit is similar to the Sonic products, but did seem to work faster and better.  </li>
            <li> ---the stronger you make them in fact, the more likely they are to damage your mucous membranes than they are to remove a biofilm, thats a fact.  </li>
            <li> I got my first Ultreo in 2007 and just had to replace it this year in 2013.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now an avid fan.</li>
            <li> At first I was leery of this product.  </li>
            <li> The smaller head is a lot more maneuverable for me.</li>
            <li> The smaller head is a lot more maneuverable for me.</li>
            <li> The Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush was my first experience using an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The place where the head attaches to the unit body vibrates, and thus makes more noise, than seems necessary.</li>
            <li> Upon going back to the Sonicare, I was able to get things under control.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, into my first year, the toothbrush died on me.  </li>
            <li> Finally, the company was brought back to life, and I was able to purchase more brush heads.  </li>
            <li> The first brush died after 4-5 years, as battery-operated-anything are wont to do</li>
            <li> HALLELUJAH I discover they&#x27;re back in business (and have been for more than a year, it seems).  </li>
            <li> At my 6-month cleaning last week, my hygienist was very excited about the difference.  </li>
            <li> My dog (Waddles) had never previously taken an issue with my tooth cleaning routine so some sort of sound must be coming from this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> By the second usage though, I got the hang of it and my teeth felt very clean.</li>
            <li> The users manual has good detail about how to position the brush against your teeth and how much (or in this case little) pressure to apply when brushing.  </li>
            <li> It might be well worth it to buy a new system for the elusive brush heads!      </li>
            <li> It actually surprised me how clean my teeth feel when I&#x27;m done brushing.  </li>
            <li> So far my teeth are literally squeaky clean after every brushing.  </li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re like a good friend of mine that&#x27;s been using the same toothbrush for years, you&#x27;re probably not going to spend ten bucks on a \\&quot;throwaway\\&quot; electric toothbrush anyway, let alone one in this price range.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m more of a green guy, not that it&#x27;s that important.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Oral B Sonic Complete (my favorite and a real bargain at less than fifty dollars many places) and the SonicCare Elite.</li>
            <li> In essence ultrasound is not a complete solution but a better one than what our sonic toothbrushes will do.  </li>
            <li> It was a bit strange for me at first, and I didn&#x27;t feel I had done a good job cleaning my teeth with it, following up with brushing the old-fashioned way for safety&#x27;s sake.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is now packed away in a drawer for the next time I need to clean the grout in my tile (maybe the jackhammer will be useful then).</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is now packed away in a drawer for the next time I need to clean the grout in my tile (maybe the jackhammer will be useful then).</li>
            <li> It happened on about my third full charge of the device, so I&#x27;m pretty sure it is not the battery -- and if it is that would be a big reason not to buy this, since the battery is not replaceable.</li>
            <li> I waited awhile before posting this review to let my feelings sink in, but I&#x27;ve got to say that while this toothbrush was a new and exciting experience, I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ll use it every day.</li>
            <li> I bought my ultreo toothbrush from another source for less, and I have been totally thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li> Never really was able to be consistent with an electric brush or waterpic, because of tooth sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> So my ex sister in law is a dental hygienist, and HIGHLY recommended the Ultreo to me many years ago--at least six years ago, maybe as many as 7 or 8.</li>
            <li> Some people claimed that it was too large and bulky/heavy.</li>
            <li> The Ultreo brush looks good and feels great in the hand, the charger is also nifty - a round doughnut like shaped disc that you slide base of the brush into making charging very easy and convenient.</li>
            <li> I am a complete novice with regard to electric toothbrushes; this is my very first one.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they are no longer manufacturing this product, but we were desparate for new brushes and paid more that I remember for the last ones we found on line.</li>
            <li> It gets my teeth clean , but I don&#x27;t get that same WOW clean feeling</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re selling you the device for way too much money and then the device nags you after three months to buy a new replacement head for a whooping $23!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this toothbrush since the very first day I got it a few years back.  </li>
            <li> They do feel amazingly clean after using it, and pretty much all the time for the last 3 weeks since I started using it.  </li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s teeth are very close together</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not cleaning my teeth very well.</li>
            <li> It works well, is just as comfortable as the Sonicare, and is very similar in design.  </li>
            <li> I am also getting over a month per charge, which is fantastic, especially for travel!        </li>
            <li> Overall, I enjoy using Ultreo and find myself bushing longer.</li>
            <li> I am not convinced that the ultrasound block embedded into the bristles adds much to the brush, although it appears to add a lot to the price of replacement brush heads.  </li>
            <li> so my whole family could use the brush.  </li>
            <li> not so much this brush.</li>
            <li> Fortunately they are back in business and supplying brush heads.</li>
            <li> and you can really see the difference.</li>
            <li> I am very dissatisfied, and not to mention a replacement brush head is about 30 dollars?</li>
            <li> very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to try out the Ultreo and see if the Ultrasound thing was just a gimmick or if it really worked.  </li>
            <li> It also helps a lot when every 30+ seconds the brush is programmed to emit a sound to let me know  when to move to the next area that needs brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact, I was nervous that it wasn&#x27;t cleaning my teeth very well at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another important thing to remember is that the Ultreo actually does the brushing motion for you.</li>
            <li> What is unusual about that?</li>
            <li> You can also change the speed from Max to Gentle, a feature not found on the Ultreo because it never gets as intense as the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: While I really did like the Ultreo it turned out that after about two months it wasn&#x27;t working for me anymore.  </li>
            <li> While I really did like the Ultreo it turned out that after about two months it wasn&#x27;t working for me anymore.  </li>
            <li> The brush is gentle on the gums.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t feel my teeth is any cleaner than the cleaning with Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Because of the ultrasound waveguide and the sonic bristles, all you need to do is gently run the Ultreo over your teeth and gums and it does all the work.  </li>
            <li> It feels like your whole jaw is vibrating</li>
            <li> toothbrush works very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks Ultreo</li>
            <li> I wanted to give myself a chance to really get to know the results before I settled on my opinion.  </li>
            <li> The Ultreo holds a great charge--I&#x27;ve left if off the charger for as much as 2 days--and it brushed no different than if it&#x27;d charged all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very helpful - turns out</li>
            <li> Very helpful.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush worked very well.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my teeth feeling so much cleaner than my Sonicare ever did.</li>
            <li> I was very concerned in the beginning.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Spending so much</li>
            <li> in all, this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> It is gentle but it packs the proof in cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Economic benefits:  </li>
            <li> My instincts tell me my teeth and gums will be improved at my next visit however, because they look and feel fantastic.</li>
            <li> think so, but \\&quot;better\\&quot; is a very subjective term.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been brushing my teeth with this brush for a few months now, however I can&#x27;t find anything spectacular to warrant the price.    </li>
            <li> Having received my Ultreo a few days ago, I can honestly say I really like using it</li>
            <li> I went from a manual brush to the Ultreo, although I did own a Sonicare a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> The brush comes with some handy features and stuff, like a travel container and the necessary recharger, and a helpful beeping to let you know when to move on to a different area of your mouth.</li>
            <li> My favorite brush is the Oral B Sonic Complete for its low price and reliability (the handset still works after 3 years).    </li>
            <li> And since I have a smaller mouth, the option of a smaller toothbrush head would have been nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> Your teeth REALLY do feel better than using a sonicare or other power brush.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> This is so gentle, my teeth feel so clean, and I have actually noticed that they are whiter.  </li>
            <li> The instructions say to replace the brush head every 3 months - you might be able to extend that a bit by alternating with another system every other day.    </li>
            <li> Is it better than the other electric toothbrushes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The Ultreo is straightforward and simple.</li>
            <li> Call me old-fashioned, but I feel as though actual bristles need to move over my teeth in order for them to get clean.     </li>
            <li> When I was initially using the Ultreo, I was concerned that this lack of \\&quot;force\\&quot; meant my teeth would not be as clean.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re glossy and white, and feel like I&#x27;ve just let the dentist office clean.  </li>
            <li> Even later in the day, my teeth still feel clean.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite features is a little sound the brush makes every 30 seconds to remind you to switch to a different part of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> me there is a very noticeable difference in the results from my Ultreo as compared to my Sonic (a previous favorite that I dragged around the world).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> Overall, I would not recommend anyone who currently has a good \\&quot;quality\\&quot; electric toothbrush spend the money to \\&quot;upgrade&#x27; to the Ultreo, however if you&#x27;re still using a manual toothbrush for some reason, you should definitely consider electric.</li>
            <li> With relief I packaged it back up and returned to my tried and true sonicare.</li>
            <li> If it is used as recommended, the brushing cycle is a full two minutes which is longer than I routinely brushed my teeth before getting the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;m a real stickler when it comes to teeth, but ever since I&#x27;ve started paying more attention to my teeth cleaning routine, I&#x27;ve been spending a whole lot less time and money at the dentist!</li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;m a real stickler when it comes to teeth, but ever since I&#x27;ve started paying more attention to my teeth cleaning routine, I&#x27;ve been spending a whole lot less time and money at the dentist!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually had several people comment on how great my teeth look...and that thrills me!!&lt;br /&gt;After the first few days of brushing twice a day, for the alloted 2 min.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this brand I got to experience the new Sonicare brush, and even thought the other one has many more features and settings, the results are almost the same.</li>
            <li> Really too bad, as this was the best toothbrush I ever used.  </li>
            <li> I want them CLEAN, sparkly and fresh all the time, thus I brush several times a day, and periodically use white treatments.  </li>
            <li> , I felt it a bit odd because of the ultrasound vibrations and was not too sure if it would do its job.  </li>
            <li> Keeps tarter away better and has less splatter than the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> This package includes the main bushing unit, one brush head, the charging ring/base, power supply, carrying case for the brush and head, and instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While it did do a good job, I don&#x27;t feel it was worth the price, or the incredibly expensive cost of the brush heads.  </li>
            <li> That allows you to divide your mouth in to quarters to make sure that you give the proper amount of attention to your entire set of teeth and not just your favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When this one dies, I&#x27;ll most likely go back to Sonicare.</li>
            <li> There is also a \\&quot;quick tips\\&quot; sheet that covers some of this same information.  </li>
            <li> I personally believe that they&#x27;ll last longer and this time frame is more of a marketing scheme).  </li>
            <li> I got this toothbrush because at my last dental visit a couple of months ago the dentist said I would be needing an ultrasound cleaning next time if I didnt get to flossing more.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that the trick is to keep as much fluid as possible around the brush head while in use, it works much better, which makes sense.</li>
            <li> While an electric toothbrush isn&#x27;t the most considerate way to brush your teeth should someone be sleeping outside the bathroom door, the \\&quot;brush a different set of teeth now\\&quot; alert bell could be a little more discrete.    </li>
            <li> But this one is different, the very first time I used it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this appliance a month ago with high hopes.</li>
            <li> For now, I think I&#x27;ll probably use this brush once a day for the supposed ultrasound benefits it offers, but use my other brush once a day as well, to make sure I get as thorough a brushing as I was before.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the toothbrush but disappointed that I probably won&#x27;t be able to get the replacement heads unless they get a lot more affordable, and I feel I have to deduct at least one star for that.</li>
            <li> Certainly, the cost of dental care can far exceed the cost of the Ultreo.  </li>
            <li> Certainly, the cost of dental care can far exceed the cost of the Ultreo.  </li>
            <li> My teeth did not feel any cleaner than with a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with a $3 &#x60;normal&#x27; toothbrush and leave the headaches to someone else.ill</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with a $3 &#x60;normal&#x27; toothbrush and leave the headaches to someone else.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Ultreo long enough to learn that it will hold a charge for more than two weeks with normal use.</li>
            <li> Since the bristles are higher than the waveguide in the middle, there is a tendency to apply too much pressure on the brush which reduces its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> The brush turns off after 2 minutes (though if you want to brush longer you can turn it back on again for 2 more minutes or for however long you want to continue).  </li>
            <li> I wanted to use this product for a few weeks before reviewing it so I could develop a good opinion on how the Ultreo does the job over the long term.  </li>
            <li> but it does make my mouth feel cleaner than normal brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> More staining has been removed in a few weeks than ever has from a visit to a dental</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Ultreo for a few weeks now and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I normally brush longer than two minutes, so I have to stop and turn the brush on again.    </li>
            <li> because if it actually did what it claimed beyond leaving your breath minty fresh, we would be going to dentists every 5 years instead of twice to four times a year.</li>
            <li> If you can live with the ongoing cost and the change to your brushing routine, I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you can live with the ongoing cost and the change to your brushing routine, I highly recommend it.    </li>
            <li> However, at this point, my initial impression is very positive.</li>
            <li> I would love a plastic slip cover for when the brush is not in use; we can argue about whether it would actually prevent any other bathroom germs, but it would certainly keep my cats from licking my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> another win for the &#x27;poor&#x27; corporation that puts food on your family, in your teeth and needs protection from rogue startups that threaten to undermine them entirely with the new use of a proven technology - real ultrasound.  </li>
            <li> Even the hard to get at spots feel as clean and smooth as they do when I leave the dentist&#x27;s office after a professional cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the first few days, my teeth ached, they were so clean.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without this toothbrush</li>
            <li> This is a new product and time will tell the tale.</li>
            <li> with all these disadvantages, how did I become a convert to the new Ultreo?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Chuck sent me a new one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding a new brand.  </li>
            <li> (just ordered new ones).</li>
            <li> Ultreo&#x27;s customer service is good and they have replaced these handsets, but a generic cover letter from the CEO (included with one of the replacement handsets) alluded that there was a design flaw in some or all of the handsets and that they&#x27;d had a high rate of failure.</li>
            <li> With minimal effort on my part the bristles take over and hum their way across my enamels, leaving them feeling clean and tingly.  </li>
            <li> You know the old razors and blades scheme, especially if you own a computer printer: They sell you the device for cheap, and then make you buy expensive replacement parts (blades, ink, toner) way too often and for way too much money.  </li>
            <li> However, if you are looking for a very high-end tooth brush search no further!you are looking for a very high-end tooth brush search no further!</li>
            <li> It gives me a beep sound signaling to change the teeth \\&quot;quadrant\\&quot; to be brushed next.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a few things about this that are less than ideal, which is why I only gave it four stars.</li>
            <li> It comes down to a matter of preference, but the Ultreo worked out fine for me.</li>
            <li> The rough vibration of those cheap little electrics doesn&#x27;t even come close to the tingly smooth feeling operation of an Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The instructions recommend charging for 24 hours prior to first use.</li>
            <li> Far messier than a normal tooth brush.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Design and Ergonomics:&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare wins this one as it is lighter, has a thin tapered flex design which feels more natural.</li>
            <li> This is pretty simple.  </li>
            <li> Coming from a manual toothbrush, this was a pretty big change for me.  </li>
            <li> However, I think the gap is pretty big between the Ultreo Ultrasonic and the Philips Sonicare.</li>
            <li> After my first use, my bite felt different.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to go through periodontal surgery but at one point in my life my gum pockets were pretty deep</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> it did the first time I used it, and every time I&#x27;ve used it since I have been similarly impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other devices out there, but this one just simply rocks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I simply hit the start button again, and brush until I feel my teeth are as clean as they can possibly get.  </li>
            <li> However, I noticed that when I brushed with the Ultreo as per the instructions keeping lots of fluid in my mouth my teeth felt so clean I&#x27;d forget to brush for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> It provided a clean that I could not get with the other sonic toothbrush</li>
            <li> The brush head has very few brushes, i was amazed i thought i would actually be able to brush my teeth with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe this was a problem with the old units and the new units don&#x27;t have this issue, but it is something to keep in mind, should you decide to purchase this</li>
            <li> But the long term cost of using the Ultreo needs to be taken into account when deciding if the Ultreo is right for you.</li>
            <li> We have used a Sonicare brush for the past 6 years and the Ultreo is far better.</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;m totally willing to convert to it completely, except that there is no way I will be paying the current price for the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> The confidence that the up and down brushing method is better than scraping back and forth</li>
            <li> I offer this background as proof that I am more than a little interested in any new innovations that might help me do the teeth-cleaning job a little better and with less abrasion to my tooth enamel and (exposed!)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Given the cost of extra brush heads, I might suggest that you buy the [[ASIN:B000X624U0 Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush - Extra Brush Head Special - Dental Professional Model]].  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to get in onto the back of the teeth in any consistent manner to do a good brushing.  </li>
            <li> Now I have only half of the ring of bristles touching the teeth.</li>
            <li> More than anything, you have to remember to do as little as possible.</li>
            <li> actually didn&#x27;t like the ultreo as much as sonicare off the bat because it had such a large brush head.</li>
            <li> No, it&#x27;s not like getting a whitening treatment, but I&#x27;ve noticed a clear difference that I did not get with the Oral B (even when using their polishing head).</li>
            <li> Amazon offers the replacement brush heads, so are obtainable.</li>
            <li> B00132FUNG Waterpik Sensonic Professional Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li> It took me a couple of days to get used to it, but very soon I realized that my teeth felt cleaner than they had since my last visit to the dentist.</li>
            <li> , maybe I am just over sensitive to having a jackhammer in my mouth.</li>
            <li> This is NO commercial - I&#x27;m 100% real and this brush is has done it.</li>
            <li> So much for getting my money back or getting a replacement.  </li>
            <li> However, as a dentist, I was intrigued by Ultreo&#x27;s incorporation of an ultrasound element into a toothbrush, coupling \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; bristle action with ultrasound energy.  </li>
            <li> This power toothbrush works with a sonic bristle action that is combined with what is called ultrasound waveguide technology.</li>
            <li> It is still manual in terms of brushing action.  </li>
            <li> B000QEG41Y Braun D25526 Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 Power Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li> So far I have not found a way to change this.  </li>
            <li> I get my teeth professionally cleaned 4 x a year.    </li>
            <li> I must say that I have mildly surprised by the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> Without metal-on-metal contact electricity can not pass directly from one source to another.</li>
            <li> - My gums being sensitive, prefer the Ultreo which massages them with the microbubbles.</li>
            <li> This creates a foaming, cleaning action analogous to an ultrasonic jewelry cleaner.  </li>
            <li> The information is clear and concise.  </li>
            <li> The feeling I get from Ultreo, however, is a whole different experience.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this product since last winter, and we are both very satisified with it.  </li>
            <li> They literally look polished, like after a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I understand that there were several legal issues regarding the technology that was used.      </li>
            <li> So while their teeth are rotting in their skulls at least their pits smell fantastic!      </li>
            <li> You can get it directly from the company for $149 (with about $11 in shipping).  </li>
            <li> I first tried an electric tooth about 3 years back - I used it for 4 weeks with the batteries and later on just used it as a normal toothbrush.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this brush for a few weeks (long enough to get a handle on the technique of using an electric brush), I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with its operation.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are no longer sensitive and my gums are no longer irritated from overly aggressive brushing.</li>
            <li> The 1-877-4-ULTREO help desk clarified that this is the ultra-sound frequency generator that provides the cleaning action.</li>
            <li> The sonic action in the bristles is just a non-performer.</li>
            <li> I used it for 6 months and got very dissapointed for such a costly loss.</li>
            <li> Rest assured that this is a real review from a person who actually is using the Ultreo</li>
            <li> Ultreo solves this problem completely.</li>
            <li> Stick with a tried-and-true brand like Sonicare or Oral B Sonic Complete.</li>
            <li> It leaves my teeth feeling like I have just had a professional cleaning by a dental hygenist.  </li>
            <li> I called the company, and since the toothbrush was now out of service, they offered to sell me some old stock units for $60.  </li>
            <li> It was more expensive to buy from Amazon, but was well worth it.</li>
            <li> Overall, I highly reccomend this toothbrush to anyone switching to a new electric toothbrush or just switching from a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It happened on about my third full charge of the device, so I&#x27;m pretty sure it is not the battery -- and if it is that would be a big reason not to buy this, since the battery is not replaceable.admit that I&#x27;m curious now about other related toothbrush products, but I expect to be using this one for a very long time.    </li>
            <li> I am disappointed to see so many negative reviews because it is bankrupt vs the quality of the product but than a good warning about warranty is useful.    </li>
            <li> I noticed my teeth are squeaky clean and are brighter after the few times I have used it.</li>
            <li> And, I&#x27;ve noticed too that the high-frequency vibrating dislodges many tiny bits of food and snacks often hidden away between my back teeth.    </li>
            <li> A search on 10/13/2009 of the web sites of the two main local newspapers that cover the manufacturer&#x27;s region --</li>
            <li> the last 15 days of usage, (mornings with Sonicare, evenings with Ultreo first week and flip order next week)</li>
            <li> In the last 15 days of usage, (mornings with Sonicare, evenings with Ultreo first week and flip order next week)</li>
            <li> However, I think the gap is pretty big between the Ultreo Ultrasonic and the Philips Sonicare.yday, but I do get the occasional reminder.  </li>
            <li> One morning, I even forgot to brush because my teeth still felt clean from the previous night!</li>
            <li> and hopefully they see fit to sell some replacement heads for less than they are currently asking.</li>
            <li> but very little pressure is needed during brushing, and overall it leaves the teeth feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> I would say, though, that for the price, I&#x27;m not sure if this brush really beats a conventional one with more bristles</li>
            <li> It takes a few days to get the feel of how to use this true ultrasound electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> That makes it easy to maneuver in your mouth and get into those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> It still vibrates but not nearly with the same intensity as before -- and it feels more or less just like I&#x27;m brushing my teeth manually.  </li>
            <li> It still vibrates but not nearly with the same intensity as before -- and it feels more or less just like I&#x27;m brushing my teeth manually.  </li>
            <li> There are times I wish it didn&#x27;t turn off automatically because I&#x27;d like to continue brushing another 20 seconds, but not enough to start a new two minute cycle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I had only had my new toothbrush a week.</li>
            <li> it sets a new standard of oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> My teeth are white and I&#x27;m having a real (almost physical) pleasure looking at my teeth after brushing.</li>
            <li> The head is too big and the bristles don&#x27;t seem to move fast enough.</li>
            <li> DiamondClean comes with all sorts of bells and whistles that don&#x27;t really matter like a charging glass, charging travel case, multiple cleaning levels (which are gimiky in my opinion), and an extra brush head.</li>
            <li> The major difference between this brush and my \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; model is the noise and the pressure of the brush on your teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> This Ultreo Ultrasound toothbrush is my first electric toothbrush, so I can&#x27;t compare it to any of the other leading brands.  </li>
            <li> I brushed with my old sonicare flexcare just to confirm my suspicion on it feeling cleaner!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this results in such a gentle motion that I still have food stuck between my teeth after brushing, something that wasn&#x27;t true of Sonicare!!</li>
            <li> The Ultreo not only has a timer that shuts the brush down at the two minute mark, it also has a ring tone-type sound that marks each 30 second interval.  </li>
            <li> Better than rotary oralB even, which is very hard to beat.  </li>
            <li> There are a few little nice additions, too, such as the velcro strap on the power cord to bundle the cord if it&#x27;s too long and a small plastic cover that snaps onto the top of the brush to protect the bristles when not in use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If used correctly (you don&#x27;t brush hard at all, and do light circles over the surfaces of your teeth)</li>
            <li> Somehow I find it hard to keep the bristles of the Ultreo positioned comfortably on  my teeth.</li>
            <li> do the work\\&quot; by applying only light pressure and moving the brush in small circles.  </li>
            <li> 4 stars only, however, as I am also surprised at the cost of the replacement brush heads.  </li>
            <li> This is a big plus for people who are concerned about gum recession, or who were bothered by sonicare&#x27;s \\&quot;tickling\\&quot; action.    </li>
            <li> apparently, they are no longer being manufactured.  </li>
            <li> Apparently as of today, their voicemail says the company is out of business.</li>
            <li> My dentist said to be careful about applying too much pressure with any electric toothbrush as I do with manual brush (thus the sensitivity).  </li>
            <li> When I go to floss, no residue is apparent-</li>
            <li> For price sensitive customer&#x27;s, I would give it a 3 out of possible 5 rating.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a slanted head like my old manual, so it takes some adjusting before you feel like its actually getting your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Funny thing is that the manual toothbrush I used to use had about the same size head, so when I got the Sonicare I had to get used to their smaller head, but with Ultreo, the big head is back.    </li>
            <li> Honestly, there is nothing difficult you put your toothpaste on the brush, turn the unit on and then stick it into your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the long term cost of using the Ultreo needs to be taken into account when deciding if the Ultreo is right for you.aying that if you are true to your teeth they won&#x27;t be false to you.  </li>
            <li> They said they don&#x27;t see real difference between the efficacy of this brush over other sonic brushes.</li>
            <li> Dental hygiene is one of the few health sciences where the practitioners, insurers and consumers tend to agree that proactive maintenance is the best way to avoid expensive repair work down the road.  </li>
            <li> Dental hygiene is one of the few health sciences where the practitioners, insurers and consumers tend to agree that proactive maintenance is the best way to avoid expensive repair work down the road.  </li>
            <li> such a combination (I use water pick on mornings only) completely changed my tooth&#x27; (gums) look a feel.</li>
            <li> The bristles do not provide scrubbing action, rather they only contain the fluid (paste and saliva)</li>
            <li> I am coming from a traditional toothbrush and this product is so far above</li>
            <li> Nothing major, but enough to feel some discomfort.</li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s not very effective for brushing a tongue, and it can be easy to miss spots on your teeth and notice plaque after you&#x27;re done brushing, which generally doesn&#x27;t happen when I use my conventional brush.  </li>
            <li> However, ultrasound is a new twist; the bush doesn&#x27;t move with the old up and down motion -</li>
            <li> I switched to the ultra soft head which helped a lot, but still there&#x27;s some minor</li>
            <li> I must admit the first time I used it was not a comfortable experience.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The toothbrush mounts in a little \\&quot;O\\&quot; ring connected to a plug and charges up fairly quickly -- and, as it turns out, runs for weeks on a single charge.  </li>
            <li> Sonicare brush heads are available for less than half the cost of Ultreo brush heads.</li>
            <li> Sonicare brush heads are available for less than half the cost of Ultreo brush heads.</li>
            <li> Ultreo really needs to bring down the cost of the replacement brush</li>
            <li> Ultreo really needs to bring down the cost of the replacement brush heads.    </li>
            <li> brushing session lasts exactly two minutes, and the brush gives a little indication tone every 30 seconds when it&#x27;s on -- giving you 30 seconds to brush each of the regions of your teeth, which I find to be about enough time to cover every side of every tooth about 3 times.  </li>
            <li> I agree with a previous poster that some of these reviews seem very suspect.</li>
            <li> The cleaning action from this technology does not cause any physical wear on the enamel and consequently, there is no reason for use of this product to cause any sensitivity over the long run.</li>
            <li> There is an old saying that if you are true to your teeth they won&#x27;t be false to you.  </li>
            <li> The sensitivity generated on certain teeth took a few brushings to go</li>
            <li> but I am not a dentist nor do I have any other professional training such that I could make an opinion that they are actually cleaner.  </li>
            <li> The Ultreo creates what the manufacturer calls microbubbles from the toothpaste so you need less than you would normally use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty old-fashioned, and I thought having an electric machine in my mouth would remind me too much of a visit to the dentist, and there are few things in life I hate more.</li>
            <li> The head is so big that only a small area of brush contacts the teeth at any time, and the results are very inferior to hand brushing, or using a  Sonicare or Braun electric brush.  </li>
            <li> This is not painful or unpleasant, just very unusual.</li>
            <li> I tended to be a bit hard on my teeth and gums when brushing manually, so at first I had to think about it to keep from mashing it into my teeth because it doesn&#x27;t feel the same.  </li>
            <li> In the end, i am happy with a new sonicare always have been, don&#x27;t waste the money on this piece of crap.</li>
            <li> That will at least save you some bucks on the first extra head, either as a replacement or for use by someone else in the household.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah</li>
            <li> I seriously rave about this toothbrush to people - so if you can swing the price - it is definitely worth it -</li>
            <li> The handle is long and it is not possible to get all the bristles in contact with the back of my front teeth.</li>
            <li> No telling how long my third handset will last before dying like the others.    </li>
            <li> these last two objections, especially, are fairly minor.</li>
            <li> Previously I had brushed my teeth these zones prior to owning this toothbrush:  upper and lower outer together, lower inner, upper inner, lower tops, and upper tops.  </li>
            <li> but so far I&#x27;ve been looking forward to using the Ultreo every morning despite this minor challenge, and I have been told by other electric brush users that this is something that you get used to and isn&#x27;t a problem after a while.</li>
            <li> It helps ensure you brush long enough (2 minutes.)  </li>
            <li> There are also a variety of other instructions such as not using it like a &#x60;normal&#x27; toothbrush, don&#x27;t let the wave guide touch your teeth, and a variety of other things.</li>
            <li> The only caveat I&#x27;ll throw in here is that while my hygienist has been recommending an ultrasonic toothbrush for a long time, she hasn&#x27;t seen my teeth since I started using this one.  </li>
            <li> I have had the Sonic toothbrush for nearly fifteen years and not to knock the Sonic, but the Ultreo beats it hands down.  </li>
            <li> I was also heartened to read a few reviews which described the Ultreo as having a \\&quot;light touch\\&quot; and not allowing for too hard brushing by virtue of the design and the ultrasonic technology, which supported my theory based on the description of the design and technology.  </li>
            <li> Also, far less prone to grunge build up in the head and handle.</li>
            <li> Also, it comes with a travel case that makes transporting the brush a bit easier (as long as you&#x27;re not traveling long enough to need the charger).  </li>
            <li> One thing that really drives me nuts is that about twenty-five percent of the time toothpaste tends to run down the handle and splatter down the front of my shirt...</li>
            <li> As much as I like the Ultreo so far, I&#x27;m not sure I want to spend 23 dollars every few months on my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Well after the first replacement, i decided ill use the money for the new sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This past year when I bought myself a new one - I could only get it on Ebay - company was still out of business - but now they seem to be going again</li>
            <li> The brush head is fine, the battery is fully charged, but something inside its body went wrong.</li>
            <li> I have tried other more expensive toothbrushes</li>
            <li> Since it does not move the brush head could be offset, smaller, the shaft set at an angle or any of a host of other choices to allow easier access to the back side of the front teeth.  </li>
            <li> However, since I started using Ultreo, I haven&#x27;t used a white treatment, have brushed twice a day, and am extremely please with the way my teeth look and feel.  </li>
            <li> the center of the toothbrush is largely taken up with a large orange rubber thing which I guess is the transducer (I am not an engineer, sorry) for the ultrasound waves.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product compared to the Sonicare  which I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I hated my own smile&#x27;s view during last 15 years - yellow, dirty with spots of different colors; I had to visit my dental hygienists every 3 month with no hope for better, a week after cleaning - the same ugly smile.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to rave about a toothbrush, but I really do like this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> However, when asked his overall opinion after a little more than a week of use (twice a day) he said \\&quot;I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> The success of a product is dependent to some extent on it not being cost prohibitive...; and at the cost of the toothbrush itself coupled with the price of the replacement heads, more wary consumers may find this product downright scary.    </li>
            <li> I usually keep the toothbrush in the charger so battery life isn&#x27;t a problem, but for the last week or so I&#x27;ve been using it without charging and so far it has been going</li>
            <li> The instructions do mention that you should give a few weeks for the  brush to feel natural.  </li>
            <li> I found with the old round power brush and my manual brush</li>
            <li> I spent several minutes trying to figure out how to plug the unit into the charger since there was no male/female socket of any type.  </li>
            <li> so you know how long you are supposed to brush.</li>
            <li> Yes it takes a long time but</li>
            <li> The ultrasound energy must travel through a medium and therefore you are required to keep the brush wet  and have enough liquid in your mouth.</li>
            <li> * Induction charging - Means there is no direct electric contacts for charging -</li>
            <li> but YOU pay in the long term.    </li>
            <li> The brush heads are a bit spendy, but I suspect they would actually last longer than the recommended 3 months since you are not really smashing the bristles into your teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that they can be a bit rough on the gums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s normal for electric toothbrushes though.</li>
            <li> I do feel a slight buzzing from time to time when I brush one of my crowns that has a collar that is very near the gum line, but other than that,  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a plain old brusher at heart.</li>
            <li> Used the item for past ten years and it works as stated and no other toothbrush on the market does what this one does.</li>
            <li> Ultreo Ultrasound is very different than other electric toothbrushes that I have seen.</li>
            <li> The travel case is a little larger than I&#x27;d like, but it&#x27;s sleek enough that I&#x27;ll probably take the darn thing with me when I travel;</li>
            <li> The toothbrush head on this toothbrush is not all bristles--there is an orange, rubbery, rectangular \\&quot;ultrasound emitter\\&quot; in the middle, which is what sets this toothbrush apart from other electrics (and, I assume, justifies the sketchy price of the replacement</li>
            <li> Thinking back to how my dentist pushed Ultreo at me, I realize now he made a commission on every sale, so he&#x27;s not exactly a disinterested party in this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap, but the replacement heads are not that expensive and, in the long run, I&#x27;m sure it will pay for itself in lower dental bills.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not wake the neighbors loud, but it is loud enough to be annoying first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> Without the Sonicare here to compare it to, this review will be limited to my comparisons with manual brushing.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit that I&#x27;m curious now about other related toothbrush products, but I expect to be using this one for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long it takes to charge completely, but it takes about a half hour to charge up enough to use.  </li>
            <li> Excessive vibration and loud noises coming from the handle</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive teeth and the vibrations seemed excessive.</li>
            <li> The rubber means less bristles and less cleaning action on your teeth.     </li>
            <li> I have tried draining it and recharging it several times and the charge lasts less than 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> This Ultreo brush is extremely quiet and brushes with much less force than the Oral B.  </li>
            <li> I was used to my previous brushing implement, Sonicare; Ultreo is a different experience.    </li>
            <li> This toothbrush requires you to slow down and guide the head of the brush gently around your teeth.  </li>
            <li> The sensation is similar to a little mini-jackhammer that has been turned loose in your mouth.</li>
            <li> simply because frequent muscle aches and unpleasant memories of bleeding always courted this exercise (you know how sometimes the mistake you made in the store by grabbing the Medium vs. Soft brush makes you regret your choice later to a point of self hatred).  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s now very limited lifespan.       </li>
            <li> Prior to using the Ultreo, the closest I&#x27;d come to trying an electric toothbrush was a little AA battery powered stocking stuffer.  </li>
            <li> This waveguide is not actually supposed to make contact with your teeth, but accomplishing a thorough brushing without making contact takes a little practice.      </li>
            <li> I wish the size of brush was a little bit smaller.</li>
            <li> Product was victim of a throw away society!</li>
            <li> As a result, I keep my mouth open fairly wide to avoid this, but this makes brushing a little bit messier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a result, I keep my mouth open fairly wide to avoid this, but this makes brushing a little bit messier.    </li>
            <li> These microbubbles supposedly get between your teeth and help clear out plaque from hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li> I have bad gums and so I thought Ultreo would be better than Sonicare.</li>
            <li> My teeth are somewhat yellow and it has made them noticeably brighter after just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> The second thing about these brushes is that they are messy.  </li>
            <li> Ultreo has overcome this problem with the introduction of a \\&quot;wave guide\\&quot;, an orange, dome-shaped polymeric element inserted into the center of the brush head.  </li>
            <li> The center area of the toothbrush is a</li>
            <li> Ultreo has a rubber band like center called the \\&quot;waveguide\\&quot; and a circle of bristles around it.</li>
            <li> Both Ultreo and Sonicare shut off after 2 mins and play a tune after each 30 sec so you can switch quadrants.</li>
            <li> Both Ultreo and Sonicare shut off after 2 mins and play a tune after each 30 sec so you can switch quadrants.</li>
            <li> Brushhead is too wide for me.</li>
            <li> Maybe you already know, P&amp;G filed a lawsuit against the alleged bogus ultrasound cleaning claim by Ultreo.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t happen everyday, but I do get the occasional reminder.  </li>
            <li> I wasted over $100 on this, and now it&#x27;s back to Sonicare.</li>
            <li> It has been used for about 45 sec twice a day, although the recommended use is 2 min twice a day.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush and I am appalled that up to this point I was actually brushing manually....  </li>
            <li> So if you had trouble with the old rotary toothbrush as I did a few years ago and want to give a power brush another chance, this may be the one for you.</li>
            <li> Because my gum is not strong enough to use this three times a day.</li>
            <li> This head actually seems to contain very few bristles, with the focal point of the head being the \\&quot;ultrasonic waveguide\\&quot; - a spinning rubbery wheel at the center of the head.  </li>
            <li> It in fact blasts away the buildups that are still somewhat soft, and I have noticed the spaces between my inside lower teeth slowly getting bigger, meaning that there is some harder build up there that is being slowly removed at every brushing session.</li>
            <li> I have hit my upper teeth with the back of the brush head while working on my lower teeth, and it is not a pleasant experience.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, I have a Sonicare that has been working for years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m jealous of from the other brand.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a weird feeling at first, but you get used to it</li>
            <li> However it turned out I was not able to find the brush heads in my local Target and when I found them on-line they were pricy.</li>
            <li> I do look forward to seeing the results of long-term use, although I have to agree with other reviewers who complain about the price of the replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> The replacement heads are pretty expensive</li>
            <li> The down-side of this engineering breakthrough is that the wave guide, though relatively small, dictates that the width of the Ultreo brush head is wider than the current sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Other than this annoyance</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical of the claims that Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbursh can give you that dentist chair feeling.</li>
            <li> I suspect that regular use of the Ultreo will pay for itself over time by just avoiding more expensive (and uncomfortable) procedures in the dentist&#x27;s chair.  </li>
            <li> I suspect that regular use of the Ultreo will pay for itself over time by just avoiding more expensive (and uncomfortable) procedures in the dentist&#x27;s chair.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea what causes this and have no idea whether this happens to other Ultreos.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea what causes this and have no idea whether this happens to other Ultreos.  </li>
            <li> I am anxious to see how my teeth appear over the next 2 to 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> other drawback in my opinion is the cost of replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> The other drawback in my opinion is the cost of replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it actually does that</li>
            <li> and I did hesitate due to the cost of the unit and the cost of the replacement brushes.  </li>
            <li> The customer service was extremely helpful and replaced my handle without a hassle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had that happen with any other toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this claimed &#x27;ultra-sound&#x27; brush, but after my first month of use</li>
            <li> My dentist of the past ten years raved about Ultreo, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> and I believe it is due to the ultreo.  </li>
            <li> (you can check out my other reviews to see that I&#x27;ve been posting them for a while).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> There seem to be very few actual bristles --</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product, but buyers should know that the manufacturer went out of business and this is no longer being produced, meaning of course, that a warranty replacement will be impossible, and replacement heads will soon be unavailable.  </li>
            <li> Admittedly - I am not great at keeping up with my dental hygiene - I usually brush once a day and am pretty hit or miss with flossing.</li>
            <li> I do agree that this product is a bit on the pricey side, but if it helps me avoid costly and painful dental work in the future, it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> Also, the brush head is a bit on the large side, which makes it tough to get into the nooks and crannies as well as a smaller head as found on the Oral B. Getting behind the front teeth</li>
            <li> The toothpaste gets stuck around the base of the \\&quot;ultrasound thing\\&quot; (very technical term, I know) and is a pain to clean.  </li>
            <li> I had to keep my mouth closed tightly to keep all the liquid generated by the brush from running down my chin.  </li>
            <li> Also, I had a hard time getting my toothpaste to stay put on the teeny tiny head.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the replacement heads have no distinctions (like a color ring) to tell them apart.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush lasts for at least 6 months with my moderate use.  </li>
            <li> Usually I have moderate plaque buildup, and this time it was very slight.  </li>
            <li> ; since they recommend we replace every 3 months I hope they will come down in price soon.      </li>
            <li> The Ultreo does have a &#x27;two-player&#x27; mode, so I hope this is corrected down the line.</li>
            <li> Based on a comparison of the two, I would bump this down to a three star review.  </li>
            <li> Based on a comparison of the two, I would bump this down to a three star review.  </li>
            <li> The price has come down so</li>
            <li> * Charge indicator - tells you when the charge is down, even though the manuals asks you to keep it charged continually    </li>
            <li> Takes a couple of uses to get the hang of it, but once you get the technique down, the process is easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles, which are rather firm, are vibrating at ultrasonic speed and do not rotate or oscillate as other brands do.  </li>
            <li> how much less plaque I had on all my teeth.     </li>
            <li> It has a sturdy plastic case and when I travel it typically runs for five to six days without charging.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all changed within less than two months.</li>
            <li> BATTERY LIFE IS LESS THAN 1 YRS...</li>
            <li> You can buy this for a lot less now bc</li>
            <li> The only drawback I can think of (the reason for the 4-star rating) is that the toothbrush is quite expensive and so are the replacement brush heads, which I believe are supposed to last around 6 months or so.</li>
            <li> It is also less \\&quot;bendy\\&quot; than the Sonicare which slightly limits its maneuverability.</li>
            <li> It is also less \\&quot;bendy\\&quot; than the Sonicare which slightly limits its maneuverability.</li>
            <li> After less than one year of use, the unit no longer holds a charge.  </li>
            <li> Each day when removing it for cleaning I wonder if this is the day it will snap in half.</li>
            <li> Still, even using just half the bristles my teeth feel cleaner than they ever have.</li>
            <li> that is less abrasive.  </li>
            <li> If you are serious about your dental health, you should definitely consider the Ultreo.</li>
            <li> I agree with a previous reviewer that even the packaging (ala Apple) is an experience in quality.    </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the initial purchase does not include an extra brush head.</li>
            <li> Seems a bit odd</li>
            <li> For those with limited bathroom space it can take up a little space but is actually small for an ultrasound unit.  </li>
            <li> The brush head fits tightly onto the handle.</li>
            <li> Also, I typically have very sensitive teeth which makes the cleaning extremely uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> When the rechargeable batteries finally failed I decided to shop for a new electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I like the narrow stem; I think it results in less toothpaste drooling.  </li>
            <li> little bit of a disclaimer here.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to, but after a couple of brushings, you&#x27;ll get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I have used other electric toothbrushes in the past and could not get used to the noise or the splatter.  </li>
            <li> Every thirty seconds the toothbrush does a little jingle that tells you to switch brushing locations.</li>
            <li> The Ultreo makes little noise while operating.</li>
            <li> It comes packaged with a little brush cap to keep germs off.  </li>
            <li> What people don&#x27;t know is that dental calculus is a biofilm and needs either to be physically touched to be removed, blasted of the surface by something like electrical charge or ultrasound...and that traditional chemicals alone just aren&#x27;t sufficient</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve visited my hygienist every few months since then, and she feels that my teeth have been cleaner since I switched to the Ultreo.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this a few weeks ago and can see that my teeth are whiter already.  </li>
            <li> There is also a battery light and a replace brush head indicator at the bottom of the base unit.</li>
            <li> I saw these advertised at my dentist&#x27;s office a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> After having used this brush for a few months, I have had the opportunity to compare this brush against the Philips Sonicare FlexCare R910 toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> After having used this brush for a few months, I have had the opportunity to compare this brush against the Philips Sonicare FlexCare R910 toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> At any rate, Proctor and Gamble sued the Ultreo company dead because it worked so well it would have put their toothpaste / surfactant monopoly out of business.  </li>
            <li> But do want to say a few things.</li>
            <li> One thing to note is the company seems to come and go - a few years ago</li>
            <li> But dont waste your money on this overrated toothbrush...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an Oral B electric toothbrush for a few years.</li>
            <li> Despite the few negatives, I&#x27;d give it 4.75 stars.</li>
            <li> Despite the few negatives, I&#x27;d give it 4.75 stars.</li>
            <li> The Ultreo Web site has no credible scientific studies corroborating its claimed benefits.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have now abandoned it in favor of my old toothbrush, a Sonicare.</li>
            <li> The charger base is tiny, and doesn&#x27;t take much of a footprint on your bathroom counter.   </li>
            <li> Very little toothpaste is required also which has led to less expense, this could be offset when I go to replace the head</li>
            <li> For the past year, I have used an Oral B spin brush purchased at a discount store for less than $15.  </li>
            <li> I think the head is too big and therefore a bit sloppy.</li>
            <li> One of them starting rattling before ceasing to work; the other one sprang a micro-leak somewhere and allowed moisture to enter the internals, causing it the handset to fail prematurely.</li>
            <li> Previous attempts to do this had failed because the ultrasound energy wasn&#x27;t focused close enough to the teeth.      </li>
            <li> I can see why P&amp;G is suing Ultreo this thing uses so little toothpaste that P&amp;G&#x27;s earnings will be effected!</li>
            <li> the toothbrush takes up VERY little space on my bathroom counter...where space is at a premium.  </li>
            <li> NEVER BUY ANYTHING ELSE FROM ULTREO OR ANY OTHER ONE-DAY-BUSINESSES!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having used electric toothbrushes in the past, I thought I knew what do expect with this product.</li>
            <li> Ultreo Replacement Ultrasound Brush Head Consider the total cost of ownership before purchasing this product.ads for the toothbrush are extremely difficult to find.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after 6 weeks it only improved to feeling like I was brushing with a tennis racket.    </li>
            <li> There is also a small set of instructions that are included.</li>
            <li> But trying to justify the initial price, as well as the overly expensive replacement heads just can&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> But trying to justify the initial price, as well as the overly expensive replacement heads just can&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> And the charger is small anyway, so it is not a problem to pack.</li>
            <li> Gone are the days when I had to expose my gums and teeth to tedious horizontal and excruciating vertical brush strokes for a duration that seemed to last eternity</li>
            <li> I often use my Sonicare and Braun to do some household cleaning of small items.</li>
            <li> When I heard about the ultreo ultrasound toothbrush, I was anxious to try it.</li>
            <li> I have a relatively small mouth.</li>
            <li> charger for the Ultreo is small and works by induction so it fits even on a small sink</li>
            <li> This might be a problem for someone with a small mouth.</li>
            <li> Going to the dentist usually feels like a confessional.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll keep buying the replacement heads (it says every 3 months, but</li>
            <li> The brush head is too small and ineffective.</li>
            <li> &quot; feeling I usually get with my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> She usually berates me for neglecting them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve burned through 3 Ultreo handsets in the past 8 months.</li>
            <li> The Ultreo is no better than its competitors.</li>
            <li> : Unfortunately I had to return this toothbrush because something got loose inside after a few days of use, and the vibrations are no longer being transferred to the brush head.</li>
            <li> There is an LED display ath the base of the handle that tells you when the batteries are running low (if you don&#x27;t keep it charging constantly).  </li>
            <li> Overall, I find ultreo does a worse cleaning compared to Sonicare and is an overall bad value for the money.</li>
            <li> At least they allow you to return the item even after 11 months of use if your not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Tartar  has decreased dramatically and pockets in gums were reduced in half.</li>
            <li> The whole brushing experience becomes very awkward.    </li>
            <li> Hard to find item from bankrupt company.</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush is NOT for people who brush hard.</li>
            <li> But it is hard overlook</li>
            <li> the company went out of business, and the brush heads became hard to get, unless you wanted to spend a premium on them.  </li>
            <li> One they are awkward, at least initially.  </li>
            <li> I am a fanatic about my teeth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s noisier and harsher, but since I&#x27;m a brushing fanatic, my gums have toughened up and it didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> The brown staining along my lower gums is slowly disappearing.</li>
            <li> The build quality and materials appear to be top-rate, but a 66% failure handset failure rate (my experience) says a lot about this first-generation product.</li>
            <li> Plaque built up on my teeth while using the Ultreo and the situation was getting worse, not better.</li>
            <li> Sorry, Chuck, you let me down.</li>
            <li> The rubber in the middle is awkward and I&#x27;m confused on where it&#x27;s supposed to touch.</li>
            <li> Two of these have failed after less than 3 months use.</li>
            <li> It is thin and hard to grip.</li>
            <li> this is an expensive bathroom appliance (Anything thing that costs over $150 moves into the \\&quot;Appliance\\&quot; category for me) and the replacement heads are not cheap.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve expected this toothbrush to be on a cutting edge</li>
            <li> It was not a pleasant experience at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really no better than anything else I&#x27;ve used and the replacement heads are REALLY expensive.  </li>
            <li> I charged it for over a week and the so-called \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; vibrations are still weak.</li>
            <li> But when you consider the cost of a dentist, you might want, at the very least, to give Ultreo a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can expect approximately three months of use between replacements.</li>
            <li> The ultrasound block does rattle on teeth occasionally which is annoying.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the company was forced out of business by Sonicare.</li>
            <li> THEY WILL STAND BEHIND THE PRODUCT FOR 2 YRS.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell if it is worse, either.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush comes with a charging base that you plug in to a standard outlet.  </li>
            <li> Alas, even were that to happen, you are just buying time..    </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Ultreo is clumsy to use</li>

            <li> All the promises they give about whitening your teeth is false.</li>
            <li> Ultreo confused, but dentist said another customer had two fail on him.  </li>
            <li> The reach is very bad, impacting all molar teeth especially in the lower jaw.</li>
            <li> Out of the box:  You get the base, the charger, one brush head, a travel pack, and a little plastic brush head cover.    </li>
            <li> Replacement heads for the toothbrush are extremely difficult to find.</li>
            <li> My Ultreo unit failed after 9 months.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> i began to be skeptical.</li>
            <li> we are sorry</li>
            <li> When you have a brush head that is dominated by rubber that is not supposed to touch your teeth, i think something is wrong.</li>

            <li> no improvements will be made which is quite disappointing for oral health.</li>

            <li> /&gt;The package includes the toothbrush base and the replaceable brush head.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why Proctor and Gamble make crap products,</li>
            <li> The charger base is compact and the charger cord can be disconnected from the base, allowing you to use the base just as a stand when you aren&#x27;t charging the handle.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed that is discontinued according to my efforts to reorder refill brushes and this appliance.</li>
            <li> WRONG!!!</li>
            <li> However, at $22.99, they are outrageously expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, please note that the replacement heads have shot up in price from an already outrageous $25 to $60+.</li>

            <li> My husband and I have used many different types of teeth cleaning devices. My Hygenist was always scraping and pulling at the plaque on the inside botton of my mouth. After using the Ultreo for 6 months, I had my scheduled cleaning and she could not believe how much less plaque I had on all my teeth.     My husband&#x27;s teeth are very close together and he needs to floss then brush and rinse with mouth wash. His gums were in bad condition and he was to have a lot of repair work scheduled including a bone graft etc. He was one of the experimental users of the Ultreo and with flossing and brushing was able to put his gums back in excellent condition. He does not need the repair work done now.    We used to be able to buy replacement brushes reasonably priced every 3-6 months. I don&#x27;t know if they are no longer manufacturing this product, but we were desparate for new brushes and paid more that I remember for the last ones we found on line. We are so afraid that soon there won&#x27;t be any to buy.</li>
            <li> WHY IS THIS STILL BEING SOLD?????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked this toothbrush even though I thought it was too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Bought mine in July 08 for [...]. Another $20 or so every 3 months for replacement brushes. But then it starts to *CRAP OUT* after 9 months. Excessive vibration and loud noises coming from the handle and it&#x27;s not cleaning my teeth very well. I see from the reviews that many people are having similar problems. Now I see they&#x27;ve gone out of business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMAZON SHOULD NOT BE SELLING THIS ANYMORE.</li>
            <li> Ultreo went out of business. If you buy this, you can&#x27;t get any more replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent electric toothbrush, but after the manufacturer&#x27;s bankruptcy the shortage of replacement brush heads has quintupled their price.  If you use two brush heads a year, as I have, it&#x27;s going to cost you $225 per year to operate your $72 toothbrush.    Two years ago, on my dentist&#x27;s recommendation, I upgraded from a Sonicare to the Ultreo.  I&#x27;ve visited my hygienist every few months since then, and she feels that my teeth have been cleaner since I switched to the Ultreo.  It works well, is just as comfortable as the Sonicare, and is very similar in design.  It has a sturdy plastic case and when I travel it typically runs for five to six days without charging.  It reminds me to change brush heads about twice a year.      There&#x27;s a big problem:  The manufacturer went bankrupt in February, 2009.*  The resulting scarcity of replacement brush heads has quintupled their price, from $23 to $112.  My hygienist fears that the brush-head supply will run out if no investors step in and revive the company.    So, much as I love this toothbrush, I&#x27;d advise against buying it unless you can afford to stock up on brush heads at $112 each.    [...].  A search on 10/13/2009 of the web sites of the two main local newspapers that cover the manufacturer&#x27;s region -- The Seattle Times and the Seattle P-I -- turned up no articles suggesting that the manufacturer was back in business.</li>
            <li> I bought my ultreo toothbrush from another source for less, and I have been totally thrilled with it.  I used a Sonicare for 6 years and this is far better.  If used correctly (you don&#x27;t brush hard at all, and do light circles over the surfaces of your teeth) you will have teeth that feel as though you left the hygienist&#x27;s polishing chair.  My teeth are somewhat yellow and it has made them noticeably brighter after just a few weeks.  Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever bought, and well worth the money.  I am also getting over a month per charge, which is fantastic, especially for travel!        Tip:  I have found that with this toothbrush I only need to use it once per day (someone commented their dentists had confirmed that.  Ask your dentist to make sure).</li>
            <li> I have bought two of the bases for the Ultreo.  Both of them died within 6 months.  On the other hand, I have a Sonicare that has been working for years.  I&#x27;m going back to the Sonicare, although I did think the Ultreo did a marginally better job.</li>
            <li> I have an Ultreo and really liked this toothbrush, however the company went out of business some time ago. You won&#x27;t be able to find replacement heads, there won&#x27;t be a warranty and you are just going to have to buy another toothbrush once the heads wear out.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this brand I got to experience the new Sonicare brush, and even thought the other one has many more features and settings, the results are almost the same. The only thing I wish this came with was a brush head sanitizer, that&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;m jealous of from the other brand.    The Ultreo brush looks good and feels great in the hand, the charger is also nifty - a round doughnut like shaped disc that you slide base of the brush into making charging very easy and convenient. There is a short melody that signals every 30 seconds to switch brushing for another quadrant of the mouth. The vibrations produced are pleasant and when there is some water in the mouth - recommended by the instructions - the bubbles form really well and I can hear the squeaky clean of my teeth. I haven&#x27;t enjoyed brushing my teeth in my whole life as much as I do now. The feeling of my inner lower teeth mimics that of professional cleaning from a dentist, very impressive. I must also add that I use gel toothpaste, since the instructions are clear that it makes more bubbles.    Overall this is a great buy and it looks artsy while comes with a nice travel case. I&#x27;m always surprised to see how fast the two minutes go by, I enjoy brushing my teeth for once and the clean feeling lasts all day. Even if I ever forget to brush them, my teeth stay and feel great but of course I try my best to remember since tooth problems are the last thing I am waiting for! I can&#x27;t see myself using a manual toothbrush ever, to me that would be downgrading my health and the results are not the same. I have been officially spoiled by Ultreo.        - Kasia S.</li>
            <li> Based only on how my mouth feels, the Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush does a fabulous job! Even the hard to get at spots feel as clean and smooth as they do when I leave the dentist&#x27;s office after a professional cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ultreo comes with some charge right out of the box. The instructions recommend charging for 24 hours prior to first use. This package includes the main bushing unit, one brush head, the charging ring/base, power supply, carrying case for the brush and head, and instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used electric toothbrushes in the past, I thought I knew what do expect with this product. However, ultrasound is a new twist; the bush doesn&#x27;t move with the old up and down motion - it vibrates and hums as you move it. It&#x27;s a weird feeling at first, but you get used to it quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ultreo keeps me brushing for the full recommended two minutes. The instructions recommend dividing your mouth into four quadrants for brushing. There is a tone every 30 seconds to alert you it&#x27;s time to move on to the next quadrant. After two minutes the brush turns itself off. There are times I wish it didn&#x27;t turn off automatically because I&#x27;d like to continue brushing another 20 seconds, but not enough to start a new two minute cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base unit will indicate when the brush head needs to be replaced. You can expect approximately three months of use between replacements. While I haven&#x27;t done an extensive local search for the brush heads, I did not find them at my local Target. Amazon offers the replacement brush heads, so are obtainable. However, at $22.99, they are outrageously expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next visit to the dentist is four months away, so I can only judge this by how my mouth feels. Overall, I enjoy using Ultreo and find myself bushing longer. After two weeks with the Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush my teeth feel great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: As of March 2009 the company has gone out of business. Replacement heads for the toothbrush are extremely difficult to find. Although Amazon carries them, the cost is over $60.

            <li> My roommate is a devoted Sonicare user, but for some reason I&#x27;ve always been fine doing things the old fashioned way. Still, I couldn&#x27;t pass up the opportunity to try out the Ultreo. My results were mixed. I have pretty sensitive gums and the brush irritated them a bit more than I would like. This could be a function of never having used an electric toothbrush, or it could be the Ultreo. Second, it&#x27;s not nearly as quiet as my roommate&#x27;s toothbrush. It&#x27;s not wake the neighbors loud, but it is loud enough to be annoying first thing in the morning. Also, I had a hard time getting my toothpaste to stay put on the teeny tiny head. Again, this could be a lack of experience or a function of the toothbrush itself. Regardless, the brushing experience wasn&#x27;t bad. I waited awhile before posting this review to let my feelings sink in, but I&#x27;ve got to say that while this toothbrush was a new and exciting experience, I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ll use it every day. I&#x27;m just a plain old brusher at heart.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few weeks ago and can see that my teeth are whiter already.  My mouth also feels cleaner that it did with my Sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> If you have never used an electronic toothbrush before, there are some things you need to be aware of.  One they are awkward, at least initially.  When I started using this toothbrush it felt like I was trying to brush with a 2x4.  The instructions do mention that you should give a few weeks for the  brush to feel natural.  Unfortunately, after 6 weeks it only improved to feeling like I was brushing with a tennis racket.    The second thing about these brushes is that they are messy.  Far messier than a normal tooth brush.    I am not convinced that the ultrasound block embedded into the bristles adds much to the brush, although it appears to add a lot to the price of replacement brush heads.  I was hoping to get multiple heads so my whole family could use the brush.  However it turned out I was not able to find the brush heads in my local Target and when I found them on-line they were pricy. The ultrasound block does rattle on teeth occasionally which is annoying.  I wish you could buy a cheaper head without the ultrasound generator.    The best feature to the toothbrush is the timer.  It helps ensure you brush long enough (2 minutes.)  Might be worth it just for that.  It did seem to do a good job of getting a cleaner brushing.    I liked the concept, of electronic brushing, but not so much this brush. I have since gotten [[ASIN:B00132FUNG Waterpik Sensonic Professional Toothbrush]] and I am happier with it for ergonomics and price/availability of replacement parts.</li>
            <li> My Ultreo unit failed after 9 months. It has a 2 year warranty. I tried to contact the manufacturer multiple times by phone and email but they did not reply. I contacted the dentist who sold it to me and was told they had gone out of business! The dentist will not honor the warranty. BEWARE! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT OR YOU MAY BE SORRY!!</li>
            <li> Okay, I was tripping on paying this much money for a toothbrush, but, after reading all the positive reviews I had to try it. After charging it, I wanted to get the maximum effect, so I used the baking power toothpaste for the first time... WOW!!! It felt like I just came from the dentist. Buy it... you won&#x27;t regret it...     Len S.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush. My teeth feel so clean after using, and my dentist has seen a change in my teeth during my yearly visits. Unfortunately, the company was forced out of business by Sonicare. It was more expensive to buy from Amazon, but was well worth it. Couldn&#x27;t live without this toothbrush</li>
            <li> My brush heads are starting to wear out since Ultreo went bankrupt two years ago. Fortunately they are back in business and supplying brush heads. Go to their website and sign up for info. There is also a tollfree number to call them. ultreo.com</li>
            <li> This company has gone out of business and you cannot get replacement heads, or if you can find them, they are $70 each, making this toothbrush worthless. If the toothbrush does not work or breaks, you are out of luck.  Amazon should remove this from their stock.  Buy the Sonicare instead.</li>
            <li> Best news that I&#x27;ve heard in a very long time!!  I&#x27;ve loved this toothbrush since the very first day I got it a few years back.  Was so disappointed to hear that the company went belly up.  I have tried other more expensive toothbrushes and they just don&#x27;t get the results that the Ultreo did.  I stored the Ultreo (battery went dead)in hopes that the company might return...and am glad I did!  When I saw online that they were back in business (Dec. &#x27;10) I immediately called and was able to replace the handle and buy more brush heads.  I cannot begin to explain how happy I am to be using this toothbrush again!  Who ever thought one could get excited about brushing their teeth?  Every time I brush I feel the same as if I just had a cleaning at my Dentist&#x27;s office.  I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never used an ultrasound toothbrush -- or an electric one of any kind, for that matter. I&#x27;m pretty old-fashioned, and I thought having an electric machine in my mouth would remind me too much of a visit to the dentist, and there are few things in life I hate more. But Amazon Vine offered me the opportunity to check this out, and I thought, Why not?     Well, I&#x27;m glad I did. It took me a couple of days to get used to it, but very soon I realized that my teeth felt cleaner than they had since my last visit to the dentist. I think they look whiter too, but since I&#x27;ve only tried this for four days, that might just be wishful thinking. I do look forward to seeing the results of long-term use, although I have to agree with other reviewers who complain about the price of the replacement heads.  As much as I like the Ultreo so far, I&#x27;m not sure I want to spend 23 dollars every few months on my toothbrush.  Lower the price of the replacement heads, Ultreo, and I&#x27;ll throw in another star.</li>
            <li> The Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush is supposed to be the latest and greatest new technology as far as electric toothbrushes go. However, my experience with this toothbrush leaves a lot to be desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, when opening the package there are several things included. The charging stand, power cord, and a rather nice travel case. There is also a small set of instructions that are included. Before using this they say to charge the toothbrush for a full 24 hours. There are also a variety of other instructions such as not using it like a &#x60;normal&#x27; toothbrush, don&#x27;t let the wave guide touch your teeth, and a variety of other things. I only state these so that people know I read the instructions before using it, and I did follow them during my one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit of a disclaimer here. I only used this toothbrush once (you&#x27;ll see why in a moment) but another member of my family used it for over a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the first use I put a small &#x60;pea&#x27; size dab of tooth paste (gel) (per the instructions) on the toothbrush head. Turned it and proceeded to try and brush my teeth. I don&#x27;t believe the wave guide touched my teeth, I didn&#x27;t push, I followed the directions. Yet, it felt as though I had a jackhammer in my mouth. It was not a pleasant experience at all. In fact, after two minutes of brushing (the brush shuts off after two minutes) I had a headache which I believe was caused by said toothbrush. My teeth did not feel any cleaner than with a normal toothbrush. The only difference was I had a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, another family member decided to try it out. He did not encounter the headache, maybe I am just over sensitive to having a jackhammer in my mouth. However, when asked his overall opinion after a little more than a week of use (twice a day) he said \\&quot;I&#x27;m not impressed. If it was $50 I wouldn&#x27;t buy one.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not question other reviewers, but based on my experience with this product I am not impressed at all, it was simply a miserable experience and not one I will be trying again. This toothbrush is now packed away in a drawer for the next time I need to clean the grout in my tile (maybe the jackhammer will be useful then). It does have solid construction, and fits well in my hand. But trying to justify the initial price, as well as the overly expensive replacement heads just can&#x27;t happen. I&#x27;ll stick with a $3 &#x60;normal&#x27; toothbrush and leave the headaches to someone else.ill be trying again.

I&#x27;ll stick with a $3 &#x60;normal&#x27; toothbrush and leave the headaches to someone else.</li>
            <li> I like:   The all-around clean feeling after brushing.  The confidence that the up and down brushing method is better than scraping back and forth I&#x27;ve been doing manually.    I don&#x27;t like:  The toothpaste gets stuck around the base of the \\&quot;ultrasound thing\\&quot; (very technical term, I know) and is a pain to clean.  While an electric toothbrush isn&#x27;t the most considerate way to brush your teeth should someone be sleeping outside the bathroom door, the \\&quot;brush a different set of teeth now\\&quot; alert bell could be a little more discrete.    There is no cover for the brush head.  I would love a plastic slip cover for when the brush is not in use; we can argue about whether it would actually prevent any other bathroom germs, but it would certainly keep my cats from licking my toothbrush.  :)  The replacement heads are pretty expensive (about $23 each at the time I&#x27;m writing this); since they recommend we replace every 3 months I hope they will come down in price soon.      FOR ME the likes outweigh the dislikes.  I&#x27;m happy with my Ultreo.</li>
            <li> This brush changed my opinion about my own teeth... Now I know - they my be white and clean and leave an absolute feeling of joy every morning and evening I&#x27;m looking in mirror after brushing. I hated my own smile&#x27;s view during last 15 years - yellow, dirty with spots of different colors; I had to visit my dental hygienists every 3 month with no hope for better, a week after cleaning - the same ugly smile. It&#x27;s all changed within less than two months. My teeth are white and I&#x27;m having a real (almost physical) pleasure looking at my teeth after brushing. This is NO commercial - I&#x27;m 100% real and this brush is has done it. Yes, I&#x27;ve used Braun&#x27;s 3D excel (Oral B) for 2 years with no effect and after that I used Phillips Sonicare (with built-in in the handle replaceable toothpaste tubes) - feels much better than Braun&#x27;s Oral-B, but had no effect on my teeth either. If you consider buying this brush (the best choice even if your teeth are much better than mine) - buy it together with some water picking device - such a combination (I use water pick on mornings only) completely changed my tooth&#x27; (gums) look a feel. Enjoy.</li>
            <li> We have been using our [[ASIN:B000V4O1UA Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush]] for about a month now and you can really see the difference. Our teeth are visibly whiter and feel cleaner. Even along the gum line you can see a noticeable difference.     It isn&#x27;t like a standard electronic toothbrush in that the bristles don&#x27;t rotate - you still have to brush your teeth (not just move the brush around in your mouth) while the Ultreo pulses. It takes a little getting used to, but after a couple of brushings, you&#x27;ll get the hang of it. My only complaint is that the replacement heads have no distinctions (like a color ring) to tell them apart. The Ultreo does have a &#x27;two-player&#x27; mode, so I hope this is corrected down the line.</li>
            <li> The Ultreo was a fabulous toothbrush for the almost four months it worked.  I loved it dearly.  One day it suddenly stopped working correctly.  I tried to contact the company, only to realize they had went BANKRUPT the month before.  So much for getting my money back or getting a replacement.  I have since bought a much cheaper and equally nice Oral B Pulsonic. I ran over my Ultreo, might as well get a last thrill out of it.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush outshines all of the others on the market.  We have used a Sonicare brush for the past 6 years and the Ultreo is far better.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush believing it was better then any sonicare i had. I was wrong. After the faith in it had subsided and i began to notice its promise of whiter teeth had yet to happen i began to be skeptical. The toothbrush has weaker technology compared to any sonicare made recently. The power in the toothbrush lowers over time (i have owned this toothbrush for 7 months). I am very dissatisfied, and not to mention a replacement brush head is about 30 dollars? Well after the first replacement, i decided ill use the money for the new sonicare toothbrush. At least they allow you to return the item even after 11 months of use if your not satisfied. Ultreo said \\&quot;we can&#x27;t grant you credit we are sorry but may we help you with your experience?\\&quot;????????????????? I called to tell them how dissatisfied no you cant help me. The brush head has very few brushes, i was amazed i thought i would actually be able to brush my teeth with it. When you have a brush head that is dominated by rubber that is not supposed to touch your teeth, i think something is wrong. In the end, i am happy with a new sonicare always have been, don&#x27;t waste the money on this piece of crap.</li>
            <li> ULTREO COMPANY IS OUT OF BUSINESS. ALL ULTERO MFGR. WARRANTIES ARE VOID.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. BATTERY LIFE IS LESS THAN 1 YRS...FACTORY WARRANTY STATES THEY WILL STAND BEHIND THE PRODUCT FOR 2 YRS. WRONG!!!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!  I started using the Ultreo immediately after my last dental cleaning six months ago.  At my 6-month cleaning last week, my hygienist was very excited about the difference.  Usually I have moderate plaque buildup, and this time it was very slight.  Also, I typically have very sensitive teeth which makes the cleaning extremely uncomfortable.  The Ultreo has desensitized my teeth, and the cleaning was painfree.  I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for 10 years.  I&#x27;ll never go back.  The Ultreo is a terrific toothbrush.</li>
            <li> You know the old razors and blades scheme, especially if you own a computer printer: They sell you the device for cheap, and then make you buy expensive replacement parts (blades, ink, toner) way too often and for way too much money.  It looks like Ultreo is taking it to the next level:  They&#x27;re selling you the device for way too much money and then the device nags you after three months to buy a new replacement head for a whooping $23!!  Do the math, you&#x27;re going to cough up $92 for replacement heads per year, not including tax or S&amp;H.  Nice try, Ultreo.</li>
            <li> I am a complete novice with regard to electric toothbrushes; this is my very first one.  While the vibration was a bit unnerving at first, I quickly adapted.  Preset for 2 minute brushes, there is an alert that sounds every 30 seconds--which I love.  The reality is, that my teeth have NEVER been this clean--barring a visit to the dentist.  And the cleanliness seems to last longer..or is that just my imagination?  Best yet...the toothbrush takes up VERY little space on my bathroom counter...where space is at a premium.  I love this toothbrush and I am appalled that up to this point I was actually brushing manually....  4 stars only, however, as I am also surprised at the cost of the replacement brush heads.  Being the novice that I am..I didn&#x27;t know to be appalled until I did some price comparison.  The success of a product is dependent to some extent on it not being cost prohibitive...; and at the cost of the toothbrush itself coupled with the price of the replacement heads, more wary consumers may find this product downright scary.    But...I LOVE IT!!!      DYB</li>
            <li> This is an inferior electric toothbrush.  The head is so big that only a small area of brush contacts the teeth at any time, and the results are very inferior to hand brushing, or using a  Sonicare or Braun electric brush.  And the head is supposed to be replaced at 3 month intervals, at great cost.  I would never recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best toothbrush that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;The company has been sold and they are making product again.&lt;br /&gt;The tip gets where others do not.&lt;br /&gt;The speed is just right the Sonic care rattles my teeth, I just can not stand it.&lt;br /&gt;The oral care and others do not get my teeth completely clean</li>
            <li> I had been a sonicare user since it came on the market more than a decade ago.  It was, and still is, an excellent product.  However, as a dentist, I was intrigued by Ultreo&#x27;s incorporation of an ultrasound element into a toothbrush, coupling \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; bristle action with ultrasound energy.  Previous attempts to do this had failed because the ultrasound energy wasn&#x27;t focused close enough to the teeth.      Ultreo has overcome this problem with the introduction of a \\&quot;wave guide\\&quot;, an orange, dome-shaped polymeric element inserted into the center of the brush head.  The wave guide transmits ultrasound waves to the bristletips from an ultrasound transducer element buried in the bristleplate of the brush head.      The down-side of this engineering breakthrough is that the wave guide, though relatively small, dictates that the width of the Ultreo brush head is wider than the current sonicare.  The up-side however more than compensates for that because the Ultreo is dramatically more gentle than the sonicare, while still providing excellent plaque and stain removal.  This is a big plus for people who are concerned about gum recession, or who were bothered by sonicare&#x27;s \\&quot;tickling\\&quot; action.    I&#x27;ve always had excellent oral hygiene and I&#x27;ve found use of the Ultreo continues to keep my teeth free of plaque, stain and tartar.  One of the electronic features is an audible beep that occurs every 30 seconds during its two-minute brushing cycle.  While sonicare also has this feature, I find that the Ultreo is easier to hear and is a pleasant reminder to move on to the next area of my mouth.    I&#x27;ve used the Ultreo for over a year and am highly satisfied with its performance.  It is a quality product with several technology features than enhance my \\&quot;user satisfaction\\&quot;.  The charger base is compact and the charger cord can be disconnected from the base, allowing you to use the base just as a stand when you aren&#x27;t charging the handle.  The charger is designed to allow use in Europe andother parts of the world that use a different line voltage than the US.  There is an LED display ath the base of the handle that tells you when the batteries are running low (if you don&#x27;t keep it charging constantly).  This LED also indicates when the brush is charging and when the batteries are fully charged.    Another nice feature of the Ultreo is the brush head is easy to remove, and doesn&#x27;t collect the messy gunk between/beneath the connection of the brush head to the handle that occured with my sonicare.  Overall, this is a wonderful product.  It doesn&#x27;t eliminate the need to floss daily, but perhaps is a step in that direction.</li>
            <li> Hard to find item from bankrupt company. Used the item for past ten years and it works as stated and no other toothbrush on the market does what this one does.Product was victim of a throw away society!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been brushing my teeth with this brush for a few months now, however I can&#x27;t find anything spectacular to warrant the price.    Observations:  The brush makes a pitched vibrating noise when in use.  The carrying case could have been designed smaller.  Replacement heads are over $20.  This electric toothbrush is NOT for people who brush hard.</li>
            <li> I used a Sonicare for 4 years before Ultreo and was pleased with the results.  I think the Ultreo is even better and my teeth are noticably whiter. It really makes your teeth sqeeky clean.    My only concern is that the Ultreo will be as durable as the Sonicare.  Some Amazon Members have mentioned problems with the Ultreo 6 months after purchase. The Ultreo comes with a 2 year warranty so that eases my concern somewhat.    If the Ultreo is as well made as the Sonicare and lasts for 4 years, I would say to go Ultreo.</li>
            <li> ULTREO is out of business. There is no known service. The only remaining heads are those in retailer inventory.</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  I have used other electric toothbrushes in the past and could not get used to the noise or the splatter.  This is so gentle, my teeth feel so clean, and I have actually noticed that they are whiter.  If anyone is looking for new technology with amazing results, this brush is the one!</li>
            <li> Ultreo Ultrasound works very effectively. My gums had receeded almost to the root of my teeth, in the time of two days one can tell that my gums are moving up to the proper gum line. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> The center area of the toothbrush is a \\&quot;pad\\&quot; surrounded by the brush bristles, and this takes some getting used to....but very little pressure is needed during brushing, and overall it leaves the teeth feeling very clean. A manual brush or device may work better to brush the tongue for breath.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Ultreo long enough to learn that it will hold a charge for more than two weeks with normal use. I must admit the first time I used it was not a comfortable experience. I do have sensitive teeth and the vibrations seemed excessive. But I do notice the experience gets better ever day. So the two weeks of use is probably a good length of time to become accustomed to it.      This power toothbrush works with a sonic bristle action that is combined with what is called ultrasound waveguide technology. The toothbrush seems to work fine and if used as directed will not only clean your teeth but also protect your gums. I found with the old round power brush and my manual brush I seemed to be over brushing and causing my gums to recede. With the Ultero that problem is now solved. And the power tip does create microbubbles as advertised.    The toothbrush has an automatic shut off that allows the toothbrush to run for the recommended two-minutes of brushing time. It also has a signal that will beep every thirty seconds so that you are reminded too give equal time to all surfaces of your mouth. The handle can also be programmed for either one or two users.    The handle has lighted indicators that let you know when the battery is charging, when it is time to replace the brush head and a battery level indicator. I have found this toothbrush can easily hold a charge for a full week worth of brushing. And the charger is small anyway, so it is not a problem to pack. The Ultreo also comes with a convenient travel case.     So if you had trouble with the old rotary toothbrush as I did a few years ago and want to give a power brush another chance, this may be the one for you. It also has a thirty-day satisfaction guarantee.</li>
            <li> The first thing I should say is that it does make my teeth feel cleaner but I am not a dentist nor do I have any other professional training such that I could make an opinion that they are actually cleaner.  I spent several minutes trying to figure out how to plug the unit into the charger since there was no male/female socket of any type.  Eventually I did figure out that you just set it into the charger without actually plugging it into anything.  This part of the design was very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes some getting used to the idea that it feels like an electric toothbrush in your hands but the head does not spin, or turn or do anything else.  It is still manual in terms of brushing action.  What it does have is an ultrasonic emitter that sends ultrasonic signals.  This supposedly loosens particles and helps the brush to remove them.  It seems to do exactly that from my perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that could be significantly improved is the brush itself.  It is difficult to get in onto the back of the teeth in any consistent manner to do a good brushing.  Since it does not move the brush head could be offset, smaller, the shaft set at an angle or any of a host of other choices to allow easier access to the back side of the front teeth.  Other than this annoyance it is a pleasure to use and definitely makes the teeth feel cleaner.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it over my other brush but will watch for one with a better ability to reach all the areas of the teeth better.</li>
            <li> I have been using the [[ASIN:B000QEG41Y Braun D25526 Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 Power Toothbrush]] for the last three years, and really liked it.  I decided to try out the Ultreo and see if the Ultrasound thing was just a gimmick or if it really worked.  I used the brush for 4 weeks.  Firstly, I didn&#x27;t notice a significant improvement in the whiteness of my teeth over my Oral B.  My mouth did feel a bit cleaner, but that could possibly be attributed to the feeling produced by the ultrasound technology.  I did not notice any significant difference in the cleanliness of my teeth from using the Ultreo over the Oral B.  While it did do a good job, I don&#x27;t feel it was worth the price, or the incredibly expensive cost of the brush heads.  Also, the timer on the toothbrush is nice if you&#x27;ve never used a toothbrush with a timer before.  It is much more efficient to clean your mouth in 4 quadrants, spending 30 seconds on each quadrant for two minutes total.  The only problem with it is that the brush cuts off after 2 minutes.  I like it to stay on so I can spend longer cleaning my mouth or brushing my tongue if I want to.  So far I have not found a way to change this.  Overall, I would not recommend anyone who currently has a good \\&quot;quality\\&quot; electric toothbrush spend the money to \\&quot;upgrade&#x27; to the Ultreo, however if you&#x27;re still using a manual toothbrush for some reason, you should definitely consider electric.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended and the toothbrush using ultrasound works better in cleaning the teeth, or the teeth feel cleaner, in comparison to my electric rotating head toothbrush. Strongly recommend the Ultreo.AAw</li>
            <li> You can buy this for a lot less now bc apparently, they are no longer being manufactured.  However, please note that the replacement heads have shot up in price from an already outrageous $25 to $60+.</li>
            <li> I have had the Sonic toothbrush for nearly fifteen years and not to knock the Sonic, but the Ultreo beats it hands down.  The Ultreo is the best toothbrush available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for about a year and it works great. It died a couple weeks ago and I&#x27;ve tried to contact Ultreo for warranty replacement. Apparently as of today, their voicemail says the company is out of business. Looks like it&#x27;s back to sonicare for me.</li>
            <li> I Loved this product. Very disappointed that is discontinued according to my efforts to reorder refill brushes and this appliance.</li>
            <li> I used Sonicare for years and liked it, but I LOVE my new Ultreo! It&#x27;s easy to use, not messy, and makes my teeth feel like I just came from the dentist. I liked mine so much, my husband had to get his own!</li>
            <li> Gone are the days when I had to expose my gums and teeth to tedious horizontal and excruciating vertical brush strokes for a duration that seemed to last eternity simply because frequent muscle aches and unpleasant memories of bleeding always courted this exercise (you know how sometimes the mistake you made in the store by grabbing the Medium vs. Soft brush makes you regret your choice later to a point of self hatred).  Well, this is the sort of product that solved my existential anguish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I regard this brush as a godsend. It has resolved my brushing compulsion, by delivering a smooth and ultra fast cleansing that is coupled with pleasant tingling sensations around the gums that equate in my opinion to gentle massages. It also helps a lot when every 30+ seconds the brush is programmed to emit a sound to let me know  when to move to the next area that needs brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to do your teeth a favor and save yourself some aggravation with a negligent selection, treat yourself to this toothbrush. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> That lick your teeth clean feeling you get at the dentist can be achieved with this ultrasound oral care product.  After using this for 2 weeks I am happy with results if you use it for the proper length of time on a daily basis you will notice the difference shortly.  The head is designed nicely and curves around each tooth while ultrasound action does its work.  Very little toothpaste is required also which has led to less expense, this could be offset when I go to replace the head however.&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself feels well made and fits nicely in the hand and makes for easy manipulation inside the mouth.  For those with limited bathroom space it can take up a little space but is actually small for an ultrasound unit.  Overall this is good alternative to the sonicare line and hopefully they see fit to sell some replacement heads for less than they are currently asking.</li>
            <li> This Ultreo Ultrasound toothbrush has been my first experience with an electric toothbrush, but so far it has been very pleasant. This seems to be a very top of the line toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package includes the toothbrush base and the replaceable brush head. Also, there is a charger that holds the toothbrush as a stand, a power cord that plugs into the charger, and a travel case. There are a few little nice additions, too, such as the velcro strap on the power cord to bundle the cord if it&#x27;s too long and a small plastic cover that snaps onto the top of the brush to protect the bristles when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ultreo Ultrasound is very different than other electric toothbrushes that I have seen. The brush head does not spin, but instead emits ultrasound waves that activates the foam in your mouth to break up the plaque on your teeth. In the middle of the bristles there is this square block that emits the ultrasound frequencies. It took about two or three days to get used to this toothbrush, but since then it&#x27;s been great. You don&#x27;t really \\&quot;brush\\&quot; like you do with a normal toothbrush, but rather lightly rub the bristles against your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush has an auto timer for two minutes so you know how long you are supposed to brush. Every thirty seconds the toothbrush does a little jingle that tells you to switch brushing locations. (The recommended order is outside bottom, inside bottom, outside top, inside top.) There is also a battery light and a replace brush head indicator at the bottom of the base unit. I usually keep the toothbrush in the charger so battery life isn&#x27;t a problem, but for the last week or so I&#x27;ve been using it without charging and so far it has been going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush makes brushing my teeth more fun and interesting, and it gives my teeth that \\&quot;right after a dental appointment\\&quot; clean feeling. The only drawback I can think of (the reason for the 4-star rating) is that the toothbrush is quite expensive and so are the replacement brush heads, which I believe are supposed to last around 6 months or so. However, if you are looking for an electric toothbrush and can afford this one, the Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush is a great choice for you.rush heads, which I believe are supposed to last around 6 months or so.

            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Sonic which was good, but I REALLY love this toothbrush.  Not had any problems with use.</li>
            <li> Initial opinion of the Ultreo is excellent.  I will review again at the 6 month mark after my next cleaning at the dentist. I predict that the hygenist will notice a difference. Easier on the gums, better vs tartar.</li>
            <li> I have had all the best over the years. I often use my Sonicare and Braun to do some household cleaning of small items. I have a separate head for such purposes. I used the Ultreo and was just amazed how much better it cleaned. It quieter and smoother than the competition and leeds one to wonder is it doing a good job. The reality it a different method - it cleaned my items faster and so much better than the others - I was just amazed. I would anticipate very good results for long term dental use. Very impressed. There is one big problem - the price of the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I suffer from gum disease and am therefore hypervigilant about keeping my teeth scrupulously clean. I floss, waterpik, (in my case I use a hydro floss irrigator) and I brush with both a regular toothbrush and with my sonicare elite every night. Yes it takes a long time but if that what it takes to keep my teeth, it is a price I am happy to pay. I get my teeth professionally cleaned 4 x a year.    I offer this background as proof that I am more than a little interested in any new innovations that might help me do the teeth-cleaning job a little better and with less abrasion to my tooth enamel and (exposed!) root surfaces. When I heard about the ultreo ultrasound toothbrush, I was anxious to try it. Honestly, I just couldn&#x27;t see the improvement over using my sonicare. In fact, I was nervous that it wasn&#x27;t cleaning my teeth very well at all. There seem to be very few actual bristles -- the center of the toothbrush is largely taken up with a large orange rubber thing which I guess is the transducer (I am not an engineer, sorry) for the ultrasound waves. Call me old-fashioned, but I feel as though actual bristles need to move over my teeth in order for them to get clean.     I used some red disclosing dye to try and figure out if perhaps the ultreo was doing a better job than I gave it credit for. Ummm ... no.  With relief I packaged it back up and returned to my tried and true sonicare. In my many years as an Amazon customer, this is the first item I have ever returned -- I am not one of those super-critical types. But honestly, I just didn&#x27;t feel this was working very well for me.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical of the claims that Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbursh can give you that dentist chair feeling. I must say that I have mildly surprised by the quality of the product. I also wondered if the \\&quot;Ultrasound\\&quot; claim was just marketing non-sense.... until my dog ran out of the room while I was brushing my teeth. My dog (Waddles) had never previously taken an issue with my tooth cleaning routine so some sort of sound must be coming from this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another important thing to remember is that the Ultreo actually does the brushing motion for you. DO NOT TRY TO MANUALLY BRUSH YOUR TEETH WHILE IT IS ON AN IN YOUR MOUTH.... The sensation is similar to a little mini-jackhammer that has been turned loose in your mouth. Not recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ease of use - If you can brush your teeth - you can use this product. Honestly, there is nothing difficult you put your toothpaste on the brush, turn the unit on and then stick it into your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger -  I have to admit that this is the most unusual aspect to the Ultreo. Why? The Ultreo unit simply slips into a plastic ring that is plugged into an outlet. What is unusual about that? THERE IS NO METAL ON METAL CONTACT! Without metal-on-metal contact electricity can not pass directly from one source to another. This is actually a good thing since most bathrooms have some water present. So how does the unit charge? My guess is that it uses some sort of magnetic rings to create a current through a coil. This could possibly explain the additional cost of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size - it is a toothbrush. Some people claimed that it was too large and bulky/heavy. I can say that at no point while brushing my teeth did my arm feel fatigued. If you can not lift 8oz (compared to a 6oz unit) for 1 minute you have bigger issues than dental hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost... this is an expensive bathroom appliance (Anything thing that costs over $150 moves into the \\&quot;Appliance\\&quot; category for me) and the replacement heads are not cheap. However, if you are looking for a very high-end tooth brush search no further!you are looking for a very high-end tooth brush search no further!</li>
            <li> (3.5 points)&lt;br /&gt;I had bought a Phillips Sonicare on the recommendation of my dental hygienist a month before Ultreo, so I was able to compare these toothbrushes for several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brushing action:&lt;br /&gt;Phillips Sonicare cleans teeth by using a \\&quot;sonic energy\\&quot; created by 30K+ bristle sweeps a minute. The bristle sweeps do a great job of getting my teeth super clean that they don&#x27;t feel \\&quot;furry\\&quot; even after the whole day. If you&#x27;ve been using a manual brush before Sonicare then you&#x27;ll notice that your teeth will soon be noticeably whiter and will feel cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultreo by comparison uses ultrasound energy. The ultrasound energy must travel through a medium and therefore you are required to keep the brush wet  and have enough liquid in your mouth. The ultrasound energy then transforms the liquid into \\&quot;micro-bubbles\\&quot; which \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; your teeth clean. The fewer bristles on an ultreo make it a gentler way to clean your teeth as it uses liquid as the scrubbing medium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The verdict? - My gums being sensitive, prefer the Ultreo which massages them with the microbubbles. However, my teeth feel cleaner and more plaque free with the Sonicare. With the Ultreo I don&#x27;t get the super-smooth feeling on my teeth like I do with the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design and Ergonomics:&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare wins this one as it is lighter, has a thin tapered flex design which feels more natural. Its brush head is also smaller than the Ultreo. That makes it easy to maneuver in your mouth and get into those hard to reach places. The bristle design makes it ideal to get in between teeth and do a good scrubbing job.  You can also change the speed from Max to Gentle, a feature not found on the Ultreo because it never gets as intense as the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ultreo has a rubber band like center called the \\&quot;waveguide\\&quot; and a circle of bristles around it. Somehow I find it hard to keep the bristles of the Ultreo positioned comfortably on  my teeth. Since the bristles are higher than the waveguide in the middle, there is a tendency to apply too much pressure on the brush which reduces its effectiveness. It is also less \\&quot;bendy\\&quot; than the Sonicare which slightly limits its maneuverability. Both Ultreo and Sonicare shut off after 2 mins and play a tune after each 30 sec so you can switch quadrants. The Ultreo arcade style tune is more fun while the Sonicare just gives a beep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Both have good design elements but Sonicare has a slight edge over Ultreo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost:&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare is cheaper than Ultreo and you can get 2 brush handles and 2 heads pack (e9650) of Sonicare for a lower price than Ultreo 1 handle brush pack. But it&#x27;s the replacement costs that matter more. Sonicare brush heads are available for less than half the cost of Ultreo brush heads. That might be a deal breaker for some as the brush heads are to be replaced every 2-3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Sonicare scores a big one over Ultreo on the price dimension. Ultreo really needs to bring down the cost of the replacement brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the last 15 days of usage, (mornings with Sonicare, evenings with Ultreo first week and flip order next week) I prefer Sonicare. However, Ultreo is still a good brush for those with more sensitive gums and I&#x27;m giving it 3.5 points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Verdict: This seems like a good brush for those who don&#x27;t like the intensity of a Sonicare but still want clean teeth. If the manufacturer can also give more information on how ultrasound technology is better in comparison with other technologies it would help convince users to pay more for the Ultreo.cy to apply too much pressure on the brush which reduces its effectiveness.

            <li> Two weeks after receiving the Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush, I can honestly feel and see a difference with my teeth.  There is not a doubt in my mind that my teeth are cleaner and whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems funny to think that something as basic as a toothbrush could benefit as much from technology, but the Ultreo Ultrasound is an excellent example of technology being put to good use.  First and most importantly, the ultrasound action makes for a far more effective cleaning.  You can feel it at work from the first time you put it in your mouth.  But sonic cleaning is just the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with many power toothbrushes is that you run the risk of wearing away the enamel over time, by adhering to the old \\&quot;brush for five minutes\\&quot; mantra that we were taught as children.  That&#x27;s fine with a nice standard \\&quot;move the brush yourself\\&quot; appliance, but with new-fangled electrics etc. you can over-brush and do damage to your teeth.  My dentist warned me of that.  The Ultreo not only has a timer that shuts the brush down at the two minute mark, it also has a ring tone-type sound that marks each 30 second interval.  That allows you to divide your mouth in to quarters to make sure that you give the proper amount of attention to your entire set of teeth and not just your favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a display that lets you know when the unit is charging or fully charged, and on of the more attractive (minimal footprint) charger bases that I&#x27;ve seen.  Oh... and you can even program it to remind you when it&#x27;s time to replace the brush head!  The travel case is a little larger than I&#x27;d like, but it&#x27;s sleek enough that I&#x27;ll probably take the darn thing with me when I travel; so there&#x27;s a plus I hadn&#x27;t considered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the cost of extra brush heads, I might suggest that you buy the [[ASIN:B000X624U0 Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush - Extra Brush Head Special - Dental Professional Model]].  That will at least save you some bucks on the first extra head, either as a replacement or for use by someone else in the household.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, this is a pricey piece of dental maintenance hardware.  But let&#x27;s face it if you&#x27;re like a good friend of mine that&#x27;s been using the same toothbrush for years, you&#x27;re probably not going to spend ten bucks on a \\&quot;throwaway\\&quot; electric toothbrush anyway, let alone one in this price range.  Ditto that for the folks that balk at the price of replacement heads.  If that&#x27;s an issue, don&#x27;t spend the bucks for a unit like this in the first place.  Dental hygiene is one of the few health sciences where the practitioners, insurers and consumers tend to agree that proactive maintenance is the best way to avoid expensive repair work down the road.  I suspect that regular use of the Ultreo will pay for itself over time by just avoiding more expensive (and uncomfortable) procedures in the dentist&#x27;s chair.  That&#x27;s an investment I&#x27;m willing to make!se by someone else in the household.    Yeah, this is a pricey piece of dental maintenance hardware.

            <li> Prior to using the Ultreo, the closest I&#x27;d come to trying an electric toothbrush was a little AA battery powered stocking stuffer.  The rough vibration of those cheap little electrics doesn&#x27;t even come close to the tingly smooth feeling operation of an Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush.  With minimal effort on my part the bristles take over and hum their way across my enamels, leaving them feeling clean and tingly.  It takes a day or two to get used to -- since you use the Ultreo a bit differently than a regular toothbrush -- but once you do get used to it, it works like a charm.  I literally look forward to brushing and find myself brushing 4 to 5 times daily instead of 3 -- because when I&#x27;m done my gums feel good and my teeth feel fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush mounts in a little \\&quot;O\\&quot; ring connected to a plug and charges up fairly quickly -- and, as it turns out, runs for weeks on a single charge.  There is an indicator on the brush to tell you when it needs to be recharged, but I&#x27;ve had mine for about 3 weeks and charged it the first day and then unplugged it and it&#x27;s still got 2/3 of its charge according to the indicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each brushing session lasts exactly two minutes, and the brush gives a little indication tone every 30 seconds when it&#x27;s on -- giving you 30 seconds to brush each of the regions of your teeth, which I find to be about enough time to cover every side of every tooth about 3 times.  The brush turns off after 2 minutes (though if you want to brush longer you can turn it back on again for 2 more minutes or for however long you want to continue).  I like the reminder, and the beeping sound every 30 seconds is not annoying -- more of a chime than a beep -- it helps me be sure I&#x27;m doing a thorough job every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to rave about a toothbrush, but I really do like this toothbrush.  In the three or four weeks since I received it, I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference in the whiteness of my teeth and the clean feel of my mouth.  I have to admit that I&#x27;m curious now about other related toothbrush products, but I expect to be using this one for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: While I really did like the Ultreo it turned out that after about two months it wasn&#x27;t working for me anymore.  The \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; has gone out of it.  It still vibrates but not nearly with the same intensity as before -- and it feels more or less just like I&#x27;m brushing my teeth manually.  I have no idea what causes this and have no idea whether this happens to other Ultreos.  It happened on about my third full charge of the device, so I&#x27;m pretty sure it is not the battery -- and if it is that would be a big reason not to buy this, since the battery is not replaceable.admit that I&#x27;m curious now about other related toothbrush products, but I expect to be using this one for a very long time.

            <li> I have been using the Ultreo toothbrush for about 6 months and I find it relatively lackluster, but OK. I think the head is too big and therefore a bit sloppy. It also vibrates a lot, which doesn&#x27;t feel great in my hand or mouth.  It gets my teeth clean , but I don&#x27;t get that same WOW clean feeling I used to get from my Sonicare.    I saw these advertised at my dentist&#x27;s office a few weeks ago and I asked them about it. They said they don&#x27;t see real difference between the efficacy of this brush over other sonic brushes. They said they may be seeing that for people with highly stain-prone teeth, the Ultreo loosens some of of the stain a bit better than Sonicare.    When this one dies, I&#x27;ll most likely go back to Sonicare.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush requires you to slow down and guide the head of the brush gently around your teeth.  The bristles, which are rather firm, are vibrating at ultrasonic speed and do not rotate or oscillate as other brands do.  This creates a foaming, cleaning action analogous to an ultrasonic jewelry cleaner.  The handle beeps and interrups every 30 seconds as a gauge of elapsed time, and the brush shuts off after about 2 minutes.  This brush gets your teeth very clean but you need to learn to use it properly.  As I was replacing an ultrasonics brush (discontinued), this was no problem for me.</li>
            <li> Just got mine 2 days ago. I noticed my teeth are squeaky clean and are brighter after the few times I have used it. I am anxious to see how my teeth appear over the next 2 to 4 weeks. The clean feeling lasts longer after brushing. The brush is gentle on the gums. I became interested after my dentist mentioned the product. She believes her teeth felt cleaner after using. This is a new product and time will tell the tale. However, at this point, my initial impression is very positive. Notice: take time to read the directions, they make a difference in the results.</li>
            <li> I am a Sonicare user for more than 10 years (yes, that is right). I got an Ultreo at the ADA conference at a discount price. Here are my opinions.    1. Brushhead is too wide for me. I have a relatively small mouth. I found that part of the brushhead is hanging outside of the teeth. The bristles are around the ultrasound generator in the middle. Now I have only half of the ring of bristles touching the teeth. The whole brushing experience becomes very awkward.    2. Ultrasound cleaning is questionable. I really don&#x27;t feel my teeth is any cleaner than the cleaning with Sonicare. I cannot tell if it is worse, either. But with Sonicare, I feel the teeth is more clean with the touch of my tounge. Maybe you already know, P&amp;G filed a lawsuit against the alleged bogus ultrasound cleaning claim by Ultreo. Ultreo then countersued P&amp;G. It is interesting to see how it goes. Sonicare also has a comparison on their website between Sonicare Flexcare and Ultreo with and without the ultrasound turned on. On the Ultreo side, it performs the same with and without the ultrasound. It makes me think all the cleaning action is done by the good old bristles.    3. Expensive. For me, the price doesn&#x27;t justify what I get.</li>
            <li> BACKGROUND:  Prior to this toothbrush, I have exclusively used a manual toothbrush.  I have normal, healthy teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SETUP:  This is pretty simple.  The toothbrush comes with a charging base that you plug in to a standard outlet.  It took about 18 hours for my unit to reach a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DOCUMENTATION:  Ultreo gives you both a quick reference sheet and a more detailed user manual.  The information is clear and concise.  In addition it is available in PDF format from the Ultreo web site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USAGE:  Coming from a manual toothbrush, this was a pretty big change for me.  The users manual has good detail about how to position the brush against your teeth and how much (or in this case little) pressure to apply when brushing.  According to the manual you are to \\&quot;let the brush do the work\\&quot; by applying only light pressure and moving the brush in small circles.  Additionally, they recommend that you brush your teeth in 4 zones:  lower/outer, lower/inner, upper/outer, and upper/inner.  Previously I had brushed my teeth these zones prior to owning this toothbrush:  upper and lower outer together, lower inner, upper inner, lower tops, and upper tops.  After reading about these adjustments to my routine, I gave it a spin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you power on the toothbrush, it runs for two minutes and gives a beep in 30 second increments signaling that it is time to change zones.  I have found that this gives me a much more disciplined routine to brushing my teeth and ensures that I spend adequate time on all of my teeth.  The bottom line is where it counts, though, and I was impressed with how much cleaner my teeth feel after using this brush compared to my manual brushes.  The results are good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DRAWBACKS:  This is probably true with most powered toothbrushes, but you do not want to hit your teeth or gums with anything but the bristles.  I have hit my upper teeth with the back of the brush head while working on my lower teeth, and it is not a pleasant experience.  It doesn&#x27;t happen everyday, but I do get the occasional reminder.  As a result, I keep my mouth open fairly wide to avoid this, but this makes brushing a little bit messier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other drawback in my opinion is the cost of replacement heads.  These clock in at just under $25 a piece, and they last 3 months.  This is one area where Sonicare has an advantage because replacement heads for a comparable model come in a 3 pack for about $5 more.  For me this is what keeps this from being a 5 star item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:  This toothbrush is definitely an investment in cleaner teeth.  If you can live with the ongoing cost and the change to your brushing routine, I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (3/26/2007):  After having used this brush for a few months, I have had the opportunity to compare this brush against the Philips Sonicare FlexCare R910 toothbrush.  Based on a comparison of the two, I would bump this down to a three star review.  With manual brushes as my only comparison it was a four star item.  However, I think the gap is pretty big between the Ultreo Ultrasonic and the Philips Sonicare.yday, but I do get the occasional reminder.

            <li> Update (November 2008):  If I could I would reduce the number of stars to one.  After less than one year of use, the unit no longer holds a charge.  I have tried draining it and recharging it several times and the charge lasts less than 30 seconds.  The unit is basically garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review: I wanted to use this product for a few weeks before reviewing it so I could develop a good opinion on how the Ultreo does the job over the long term.  My opinion is that this is a very nice toothbrush that makes my teeth feel clean and my gums feels healthy.  I normally floss after brushing and I have found that the Ultreo does a very good job of cleaning between my teeth as well.  But it is important that you use the toothbrush correctly in order for it to work effectively.  You do not actually brush your teeth with the Ultreo.  Because of the ultrasound waveguide and the sonic bristles, all you need to do is gently run the Ultreo over your teeth and gums and it does all the work.  The Ultreo creates what the manufacturer calls microbubbles from the toothpaste so you need less than you would normally use.  These microbubbles supposedly get between your teeth and help clear out plaque from hard to reach places.  I&#x27;m not sure if it actually does that but it does make my mouth feel cleaner than normal brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger for the Ultreo is small and works by induction so it fits even on a small sink and you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting electrocuted while washing your hands.  The charge indicator reminds you when it is time to recharge the Ultreo (the manufacturer claims you can get 28 2-minute brushings between charges) and it comes with a nice travel case.  The Ultreo will also remind you when it is time to change the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the head is the one downside of the Ultreo.  The cost of replacing the head is three times the cost of replacing the SonicCare heads.  For a family of four, you can spend $300 a year replacing heads.  Is it worth it?  There is an old saying that if you are true to your teeth they won&#x27;t be false to you.  The Ultreo seems to do a very nice job of cleaning teeth and helping to keep gums healthy.  Certainly, the cost of dental care can far exceed the cost of the Ultreo.  But the long term cost of using the Ultreo needs to be taken into account when deciding if the Ultreo is right for you.aying that if you are true to your teeth they won&#x27;t be false to you.

            <li> I was not an immediate devotee of the Ultreo toothbrush. Just out of the box, I had a number of problems getting started&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The toothbrush was much larger than what I was used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I had to keep my mouth closed tightly to keep all the liquid generated by the brush from running down my chin.  I was not always successful.  Not a pretty sight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The sensitivity generated on certain teeth took a few brushings to go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I gagged at the thought of $23 to replace the brush head every three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So with all these disadvantages, how did I become a convert to the new Ultreo?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me there is a very noticeable difference in the results from my Ultreo as compared to my Sonic (a previous favorite that I dragged around the world).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my results (from one month of daily use):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Whiter teeth (removing stubborn coffee and tea stains)&lt;br /&gt;2. Better gums&lt;br /&gt;3. Better breath&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultreo is expensive.  Brush head replacements are expensive, too.  But when you consider the cost of a dentist, you might want, at the very least, to give Ultreo a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, if you&#x27;re unconvinced, take a look at the clinical results provided for dentists on the Ultreo.com site.  Pretty impressive stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice that there is an Ultreo costing $10.00 more than this model.  The slightly more expensive version includes two, not just one, brush heads.  Because brush heads run $23 or so, you might consider the more expensive version a bargain.  Take a look!</li>
            <li> It is the oddest feeling using the Ultreo toothbrush for the first time. It feels like your whole jaw is vibrating and your teeth are being shaken to knock the dirt off. This is not painful or unpleasant, just very unusual. After my first use, my bite felt different. My sense is this is a very powerful tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush works very well. My teeth have never felt cleaner. While I can&#x27;t say my teeth are a shade whiter they do seem more reflective. My teeth shine and sparkle when smiling. The brown staining along my lower gums is slowly disappearing. More staining has been removed in a few weeks than ever has from a visit to a dental hygenist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the toothbrush is very easy. The toothbrush fits into a donut shaped charger that acts as a stand. It does not charge quickly. When first set up, it takes 24 hours for the lights on the toothbrush display to stop flashing indicating a full battery charge. The brush head fits tightly onto the handle. It is thin and hard to grip. Each day when removing it for cleaning I wonder if this is the day it will snap in half. The brush head is not as large as my normal tooth brush but doesn&#x27;t fit well in my mouth. The handle is long and it is not possible to get all the bristles in contact with the back of my front teeth. This might be a problem for someone with a small mouth. Still, even using just half the bristles my teeth feel cleaner than they ever have.</li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to but I love this toothbrush.  My teeth are Dentist clean!  I just had gum surgery and wanted something that would really keep my teeth clean but be gentle on my gums....this is it.</li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush.  Love the timer as I&#x27;m brushing.  Easy to handle and hold&#x27;s a charge for a good while.</li>
            <li> Its works GREAT!!!  I went from a manual tooth brush to the Ultreo and absolty love it.  I find myself brushing more frequently and for longer periods of time.  It makes my gums tingle and will never go back to anything else.    Thanks Ultreo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Ultreo for a few weeks now and absolutely love it.  From the first time I used it, my teeth felt so clean.  I am hooked and I would recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s interested.  I work in the dental field and my colleagues have been raving about the Ultreo since they started using it too.</li>
            <li> For the past year, I have used an Oral B spin brush purchased at a discount store for less than $15.  I thought I was doing a good job of brushing with it, and do not have a history of dental problems.  Now, after having used the Ultreo product, I realize that although the Oral B brush felt like it was doing a good cleaning job, it may not have been as thorough as this new Ultreo brush.     The Ultreo brush arrives packaged with a charger, cord, travel container and head cover.  The box includes an \\&quot;owner&#x27;s manual\\&quot; detailing the usage instructions, safety warnings, and cleaning provisions for the brush.  There is also a \\&quot;quick tips\\&quot; sheet that covers some of this same information.  Your brush will need to be charged for 24 hours to have a full charge, but I was able to use my brush after only eight hours of charging.  The instructions direct you to place a pea-sized amount of toothpaste on the center of the brush head.  This head actually seems to contain very few bristles, with the focal point of the head being the \\&quot;ultrasonic waveguide\\&quot; - a spinning rubbery wheel at the center of the head.  This waveguide is not actually supposed to make contact with your teeth, but accomplishing a thorough brushing without making contact takes a little practice.      The brush chimes every 30 seconds, recommending that you divide your mouth into four brushing \\&quot;quadrants\\&quot;.  At the end of two minutes, the brush automatically turns off - I normally brush longer than two minutes, so I have to stop and turn the brush on again.    The major difference between this brush and my \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; model is the noise and the pressure of the brush on your teeth and gums.  This Ultreo brush is extremely quiet and brushes with much less force than the Oral B.  When I was initially using the Ultreo, I was concerned that this lack of \\&quot;force\\&quot; meant my teeth would not be as clean.  But this does not seem to be true.  The Ultreo seems to yield good results with much less stress on my gums.  I guess the truetest will be my results at my next dental exam!    My only concern with the Ultreo is the price and convenience and expense of obtaining replacement heads.  A replacement head indicator on the brush informs you when it is time to change the brushing head.</li>
            <li> The Ultreo is great, far better than the Sonicare I had been using. It is quiet and breeze to use. My teeth feel great. The Ultreo makes little noise while operating. The brush head pops off easily so my wife can put her&#x27;s on. The brush head is sealed so no gunky build up inside! I tend to build up plaque and this is taking it off. Wonder what my dentist will say. I can see why P&amp;G is suing Ultreo this thing uses so little toothpaste that P&amp;G&#x27;s earnings will be effected!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Ultreo for about 6 weeks now...I wanted to give myself a chance to really get to know the results before I settled on my opinion.  I was using an Oral B electric toothbrush prior to using Ultreo, and I was satisfied with the feeling I got from that.  The feeling I get from Ultreo, however, is a whole different experience.  At first I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like it, and it&#x27;s not an abrasive cleaning tool...which is more what I was used to.  It relies more on the &#x27;sonic&#x27; waves for cleaning...and they WORK!!  After the first few days, my teeth ached, they were so clean.  And I have to tell you I am a fanatic about my teeth...I want them CLEAN, sparkly and fresh all the time, thus I brush several times a day, and periodically use white treatments.  However, since I started using Ultreo, I haven&#x27;t used a white treatment, have brushed twice a day, and am extremely please with the way my teeth look and feel.  They&#x27;re glossy and white, and feel like I&#x27;ve just let the dentist office clean.  I&#x27;ve actually had several people comment on how great my teeth look...and that thrills me!!&lt;br /&gt;After the first few days of brushing twice a day, for the alloted 2 min., the aching went away, and I got more used to clean that is less abrasive.  I sometimes will brush for longer than the 2 min., depending on if I&#x27;ve chewed alot of gum, or my teeth are feeling particulary in need of a deeper clean.  I simply hit the start button again, and brush until I feel my teeth are as clean as they can possibly get.  The Ultreo holds a great charge--I&#x27;ve left if off the charger for as much as 2 days--and it brushed no different than if it&#x27;d charged all day.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve said all that, lol, to say this:&lt;br /&gt;Would I pay almost $200 dollars for this toothbrush??  YES!!  In a heartbeat, and I will be purchasing replacement heads.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000V4O1UA Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush]] I am extremely pleased with this toothbrush.  It does an excellent job of giving your teeth a thorough cleaning.  If it is used as recommended, the brushing cycle is a full two minutes which is longer than I routinely brushed my teeth before getting the toothbrush.  At my last cleaning, the hygienist remarked about what a good job I was doing and I had only had my new toothbrush a week.</li>
            <li> I obtained an Ultreo from my dentist who did some restorative work on my teeth - loved it.   Then it stopped working.  Contacted MFRer - Chuck got involved &amp; was super helpful, by email.  Very helpful - turns out my brush came from a \\&quot;bad lot.\\&quot;  Chuck sent me a new one.  Worked great - then died.  Ultreo confused, but dentist said another customer had two fail on him.  So, Chuck sent me a THIRD handle.  I charge for 24 hours as directed - doesn&#x27;t work.  Chuck says, you might have to charge more than 24 hours; altho the instruction says 24 hours.  I charge for 48 hours.  Nothing.  I contact Chuck, who had been a super help as the Ultreo boss ... very responsive.  Very helpful.  This time, he ignored my email.  Bad.  I meticulously followed directions every time.  Watch out - seems this product is too complicated to keep working reliably.  I&#x27;m finding a new brand.  Sorry, Chuck, you let me down.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this product since last winter, and we are both very satisified with it.  It does an amazing job of cleaning your teeth.  We switched from an Oral B to this brush and I did hesitate due to the cost of the unit and the cost of the replacement brushes.  The first time I went to the dentist after switching to the Ultreo, the hygenist told me what a great job I was doing with my teeth.  If you are serious about your dental health, you should definitely consider the Ultreo.</li>
            <li> I had been shopping around for a brush for a while, tried my boyfriend&#x27;s sonicare and liked it, but didn&#x27;t love it.  Never really was able to be consistent with an electric brush or waterpic, because of tooth sensitivity.  My dentist said to be careful about applying too much pressure with any electric toothbrush as I do with manual brush (thus the sensitivity).  Then I read about Ultreo and suspected the ultrasonic technology would assist with this problem.  I considered investing in the sonicare flexcare and then read some comparisons which said they are comparable, or that Ultreo is slightly better.  I was also heartened to read a few reviews which described the Ultreo as having a \\&quot;light touch\\&quot; and not allowing for too hard brushing by virtue of the design and the ultrasonic technology, which supported my theory based on the description of the design and technology.  I was still skeptical but took the plunge because of the great savings through amazon-- $86 with shipping!    Having received my Ultreo a few days ago, I can honestly say I really like using it and I love the way my teeth feel afterwards.  They literally look polished, like after a professional cleaning.  And NO tooth/gum sensitivity!!  I even think they are starting to look whiter.  And I don&#x27;t have difficulty making it through the recommended two minutes, like I did with the sonicare.  When I go to floss, no residue is apparent- it seems the ultrasonic waves get to all the stuff that needs to be gotten, and my teeth feel really clean.    The only thing is that I am still getting used to managing the liquid that forms without drooling on myself... but so far I&#x27;ve been looking forward to using the Ultreo every morning despite this minor challenge, and I have been told by other electric brush users that this is something that you get used to and isn&#x27;t a problem after a while.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product.  Ultreo has gone out of business.  So no warranty or replacement brush heads. Google Ultreo and WSJ (Wall Street Journal). Amazon won&#x27;t allow weblinks in reviews.</li>
            <li> The Ultreo is a sensational unit and does an amazing job - but sadly it is truly an orphan brand now - Ultreo went under in the early part of 2009- thus if you DO by this, do understand that there is no warranty,and the once easy to find brush heads are gone from the retail market.    The unit is similar to the Sonic products, but did seem to work faster and better.  If you are lucky, you may find some brush heads for sale at your dentists office- the product was also sold by dental professionals.    The instructions say to replace the brush head every 3 months - you might be able to extend that a bit by alternating with another system every other day.    Though one can hope, I dont think we will see this made again- I understand that there were several legal issues regarding the technology that was used.      Really too bad, as this was the best toothbrush I ever used.  I say keep your eyes peeled in case there is ever a gold box deal/liquidation price on this one.  It might be well worth it to buy a new system for the elusive brush heads!      Alas, even were that to happen, you are just buying time..    I dont think I have ever written a review quite like this before - I LOVE the product ( so did my dentist ) and even bought one (at full price!) as a gift for a famly member last year.  But it is hard overlook it&#x27;s now very limited lifespan.       I am sure you will like it if you get one, just dont get too attached!</li>
            <li> The toothbrush worked very well.  Better than sonicare.  Better than rotary oralB even, which is very hard to beat.  Maybe on par with the ionic battery tech.  At any rate, Proctor and Gamble sued the Ultreo company dead because it worked so well it would have put their toothpaste / surfactant monopoly out of business.  So there you have it: another win for the &#x27;poor&#x27; corporation that puts food on your family, in your teeth and needs protection from rogue startups that threaten to undermine them entirely with the new use of a proven technology - real ultrasound.  Good job P&amp;G!  You&#x27;ve made the world worse for consumers by killing off a good new technology instead of fighting to own it for the betterment of your customers.  So while their teeth are rotting in their skulls at least their pits smell fantastic!      What people don&#x27;t know is that dental calculus is a biofilm and needs either to be physically touched to be removed, blasted of the surface by something like electrical charge or ultrasound...and that traditional chemicals alone just aren&#x27;t sufficient---the stronger you make them in fact, the more likely they are to damage your mucous membranes than they are to remove a biofilm, thats a fact.  That&#x27;s why Proctor and Gamble make crap products, because if it actually did what it claimed beyond leaving your breath minty fresh, we would be going to dentists every 5 years instead of twice to four times a year.</li>
            <li> I got my first Ultreo in 2007 and just had to replace it this year in 2013.  People have posted fairly extensive reviews so I am not going to go into details. But do want to say a few things. I am someone who has had lots of dental problems - lots of cavities, root canals, and crowns.  Since I started using this toothbrush - the only dental work I have had to do is maintenance on existing dental work and my dental hygienist aways comments on how clean my teeth are and that she didn&#x27;t have much in the way of tartar or plaque to remove. Admittedly - I am not great at keeping up with my dental hygiene - I usually brush once a day and am pretty hit or miss with flossing. Going to the dentist usually feels like a confessional. However - they always tell me my teeth are really clean - so I attribute it to my Ultreo.  One thing to note is the company seems to come and go - a few years ago I was going to get one as a gift and the company had gone out of business. This past year when I bought myself a new one - I could only get it on Ebay - company was still out of business - but now they seem to be going again (just ordered new ones). My plan was to buy additional units in case it happened again - figuring they perhaps don&#x27;t have a great business model or something despite a great product.  The price has come down so maybe they are getting better - my first was purchased at about $200 in 2007.  You can get it directly from the company for $149 (with about $11 in shipping).  I seriously rave about this toothbrush to people - so if you can swing the price - it is definitely worth it - especially when you consider the cost of dental work.</li>
            <li> A superb and unique product!  It takes a few days to get the feel of how to use this true ultrasound electric toothbrush.  The results are great, it really does remove stains, and leaves the mouth feeling so clean.  The company is back in business and will be producing products in time for the Holiday Season in 2011.  This is great news.</li>
            <li> Gentlepersons:  I realize this is not Amazon&#x27;s fault, however, the Ultreo IUltrasound Toothbrush I received from you sounded like&lt;br /&gt;it had a &amp;#34;bad transmission&amp;#34; from the get go....and then it died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always recommend your service, but I can not recommend this product.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I love my Ultreo.  It leaves my teeth feeling so much cleaner than my Sonicare ever did. One morning, I even forgot to brush because my teeth still felt clean from the previous night! My teeth are definitely whiter too.</li>
            <li> I first tried an electric tooth about 3 years back - I used it for 4 weeks with the batteries and later on just used it as a normal toothbrush.    But this one is different, the very first time I used it, I felt it a bit odd because of the ultrasound vibrations and was not too sure if it would do its job.  The 2nd/3rd time onwards, I can feel that it is doing its job very well and felt comfortable using it.    What I like about it the most:    * Induction charging - Means there is no direct electric contacts for charging - so no risk of electric shocks    * Charge indicator - tells you when the charge is down, even though the manuals asks you to keep it charged continually    * Nice travel case to go with it    * Clean and fresh feeling after brushing    What I do not like:    * $22 for the replacements heads     Overall, I highly reccomend this toothbrush to anyone switching to a new electric toothbrush or just switching from a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This Ultreo Ultrasound toothbrush is my first electric toothbrush, so I can&#x27;t compare it to any of the other leading brands.  However, I&#x27;m pretty good at brushing my teeth with one of those old-fashioned toothbrushes that require a slight arm motion and don&#x27;t include batteries.  The toothbrush head on this toothbrush is not all bristles--there is an orange, rubbery, rectangular \\&quot;ultrasound emitter\\&quot; in the middle, which is what sets this toothbrush apart from other electrics (and, I assume, justifies the sketchy price of the replacement heads).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this brush for a few weeks (long enough to get a handle on the technique of using an electric brush), I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with its operation.  It tingles when you use it right, and if you surround the head with liquid, it really does do a better job.  One of my favorite features is a little sound the brush makes every 30 seconds to remind you to switch to a different part of your mouth.  Also, it comes with a travel case that makes transporting the brush a bit easier (as long as you&#x27;re not traveling long enough to need the charger).  I would say, though, that for the price, I&#x27;m not sure if this brush really beats a conventional one with more bristles--it&#x27;s not very effective for brushing a tongue, and it can be easy to miss spots on your teeth and notice plaque after you&#x27;re done brushing, which generally doesn&#x27;t happen when I use my conventional brush.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll keep buying the replacement heads (it says every 3 months, but I personally believe that they&#x27;ll last longer and this time frame is more of a marketing scheme).  For now, I think I&#x27;ll probably use this brush once a day for the supposed ultrasound benefits it offers, but use my other brush once a day as well, to make sure I get as thorough a brushing as I was before.</li>
            <li> I bought an Ultreo about a month ago at the Sharper Image. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve been very disappointed with it.     I&#x27;m a longtime Sonicare user, and would honestly recommend Sonicare over Ultreo anytime. Despite having a nice grip, a nice travel case, and a handy adapter for overseas travel (no need for a transformer), the brush head is larger than sonicare and has an odd rubber piece in the middle. This rubs against your teeth and is a nuisance. The rubber means less bristles and less cleaning action on your teeth.     Overall, I find ultreo does a worse cleaning compared to Sonicare and is an overall bad value for the money. I have gingivitis and recession, and I found that sonicare kept my pockets a lot cleaner than ultreo.     I contacted ultreo to get a refund but I was told that my 30 day satisfaction guarantee was expired, so I was on my own. Oh well, I guess I won&#x27;t be an ambassador for the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonic Care for many years and have always been satisfied.  When the rechargeable batteries finally failed I decided to shop for a new electric toothbrush.  Ultreo was the latest and greatest and despite the relatively high cost I took the plunge.  The unit just stopped working at the three month mark.  The customer service was extremely helpful and replaced my handle without a hassle.  It&#x27;s really no better than anything else I&#x27;ve used and the replacement heads are REALLY expensive.  One thing that really drives me nuts is that about twenty-five percent of the time toothpaste tends to run down the handle and splatter down the front of my shirt... I&#x27;ve never had that happen with any other toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Not since I was sweet sixteen have my teeth looked and felt this good! This toothbrush does everything the promo copy says it will. My teeth are no longer sensitive and my gums are no longer irritated from overly aggressive brushing. My son will be getting one for Christmas. He&#x27;ll think it&#x27;s a toothbrush, but in reality, it&#x27;s a bright, confident smile and great dental health for years to come.</li>
            <li> I used Oral-B Vitality, Philips Sonicare FlexCare and finally Ultreo; and BELIEVE me this is undoubtedly the best solution out there. The brush does not physically wear and tear your enamel. It cleans almost 100% of plaque. Over two weeks of use, all my stains were gone and my mouth felt fresh as just after a dentist cleaning.    Ultreo: I read concerns about the big plastic head inside the brush head, in an Amazon.com review. I was very concerned in the beginning. The 1-877-4-ULTREO help desk clarified that this is the ultra-sound frequency generator that provides the cleaning action. The jutting plastic head contained in between the bristles is the heart of this equipment. The bristles do not provide scrubbing action, rather they only contain the fluid (paste and saliva) so the plastic head can bombard the plaque with the fluid mixture. The cleaning action from this technology does not cause any physical wear on the enamel and consequently, there is no reason for use of this product to cause any sensitivity over the long run. I would describe this as the invention of the decade and has the potential to literally kill your dentist&#x27;s business.    Oral-B Vitality: After 2 years of continued usage, I realized that this product started to cause continued sensitivity in my teeth. This brush pushes all the plaque and tartar under the gum. The reach is very bad, impacting all molar teeth especially in the lower jaw. Overall, I would rate this product as a 1 out of possible 5. For price sensitive customer&#x27;s, I would give it a 3 out of possible 5 rating. It does the job but YOU pay in the long term.    Philips Sonicare: The sonic action in the bristles is just a non-performer. The brush head is too small and ineffective. This brush also pushes the plaque and tartar under the gum. This brush doesn&#x27;t help you get rid of any stains, even though the manufacturer claims this.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this claimed &#x27;ultra-sound&#x27; brush, but after my first month of use I&#x27;m now an avid fan. I&#x27;ve not been to my dentist yet to confirm if any health improvements, but the claim that teeth feel super-clean is true! After each brushing, the teeth are smooth and slippery as if polished. And, I&#x27;ve noticed too that the high-frequency vibrating dislodges many tiny bits of food and snacks often hidden away between my back teeth.    So, yes I would say this device is a big-step improvement for tooth care.</li>
            <li> My dentist of the past ten years raved about Ultreo, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I have bad gums and so I thought Ultreo would be better than Sonicare. Unfortunately, Ultreo is clumsy to use and I don&#x27;t get the nice \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling I usually get with my Sonicare. The head is too big and the bristles don&#x27;t seem to move fast enough. I charged it for over a week and the so-called \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; vibrations are still weak. The rubber in the middle is awkward and I&#x27;m confused on where it&#x27;s supposed to touch. My dentist suggested I don&#x27;t \\&quot;brush\\&quot; but just move the Ultreo over my teeth and gums. Unfortunately, this results in such a gentle motion that I still have food stuck between my teeth after brushing, something that wasn&#x27;t true of Sonicare!! Thinking back to how my dentist pushed Ultreo at me, I realize now he made a commission on every sale, so he&#x27;s not exactly a disinterested party in this. I wasted over $100 on this, and now it&#x27;s back to Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through Oral B and Sonicare.  Both are good, but don&#x27;t match the Ultreo.  I agree with a previous reviewer that even the packaging (ala Apple) is an experience in quality.    I have \\&quot;crowded\\&quot; bottom teeth and, even after flossing, I always felt like I have food or something still hung up in there.  With the Ultreo, I never have that feeling.    At first I was leery of this product.  My dentist recommended it the last time I was in for a cleaning and I thought, \\&quot;Yeah, she must be getting a pretty good cut.....\\&quot;  But I went ahead and purchased one.    It&#x27;s been three months now since my cleaning and my teeth still look and feel like they did when I left her office....whiter than ever and always with that \\&quot;just polished\\&quot; feel.      It&#x27;s not cheap, but the replacement heads are not that expensive and, in the long run, I&#x27;m sure it will pay for itself in lower dental bills.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a worth spending if you really want to keep your teeth clean, and you have problem with cleaning your teeth. I felt how clean my teeth bacame in the first day. Of course, you need to keep using it.     Because my gum is not strong enough to use this three times a day. I use this great toothbrush once a day.    One thing, though. I wish the size of brush was a little bit smaller.</li>
            <li> I got this toothbrush because at my last dental visit a couple of months ago the dentist said I would be needing an ultrasound cleaning next time if I didnt get to flossing more. So I said hmmm unltrasound. Well it made my mouth very fresh and clean feeling the first week then it was downhill. I tried to wait a month before rating this. But dont waste your money on this overrated toothbrush...</li>
            <li> I love it! Keeps your mouth feeling fresher longer... just like the ad says. Keeps tarter away better and has less splatter than the Sonicare. Also, far less prone to grunge build up in the head and handle.</li>
            <li> I bought an ultreo at my dentist&#x27;s recommendation a year ago. I was very skeptical about the claims, but I get a lot of plaque buildup despite paying a lot of attention to cleaning my teeth. I get a dentist cleaning 4 times a year.    The ultreo does not eliminate the plaque buildup, but it significantly reduces it. That makes it worthwhile for me.    The problem is that the non-replacable battery in it died after a year, and ultreo went out of business. It&#x27;s a shame.</li>
            <li> The only data that I have to support the assertion that it works are the comments by my dental hygienist \\&quot;So, you&#x27;ve been taking care of your teeth, I see.\\&quot; She usually berates me for neglecting them. My last two visits have been good and I believe it is due to the ultreo.  I bought one for my wife and my 2 kids.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed to see so many negative reviews because it is bankrupt vs the quality of the product but than a good warning about warranty is useful.    This was a pretty good product when you adjusted to the correct method of using it.  It did take me over a month but I still perfered spending 2 minutes bottom an 2 minutes on top.  It provided a clean that I could not get with the other sonic toothbrush and I used both phillips and oralb.  However it did nothing for gums in my opinion.  After not flossing for a week and just using the ultreo... it did bleed when I flossed.  In essence ultrasound is not a complete solution but a better one than what our sonic toothbrushes will do.  Unfortunately with this out of the market...  no improvements will be made which is quite disappointing for oral health.</li>
            <li> All the promises they give about whitening your teeth is false. I used it for 6 months and got very dissapointed for such a costly loss. Spending so much i&#x27;ve expected this toothbrush to be on a cutting edge but i did not find any extra effects. Furthermore after using toothbrush for 6 months - toothbrush stopped working. i&#x27;ve returned to my oral b toothbrush. I&#x27;LL NEVER BUY ANYTHING ELSE FROM ULTREO OR ANY OTHER ONE-DAY-BUSINESSES!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Phillips Sonicare for about 8 years now. I am one of those people that if I don&#x27;t stay on top of my brushing and flossing, tartar builds up rather quickly. I didn&#x27;t have to go through periodontal surgery but at one point in my life my gum pockets were pretty deep, one of them being 12 milliliters! After regular cleaning sections at my dentist every 3 months, I don&#x27;t have those deep pockets anymore, but occasionally -- if I forget to floss -- I can \\&quot;feel\\&quot; a build up and I need to work harder to remove this still somewhat soft tartar build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Ultreo. I have noticed at the very first use (after a full 24h of battery charge, as recommended) that the cleaning performance is vastly superior, in half of the time. This brush runs for 1:20 minutes each time, my sonicare runs for more than 2 minutes. The difference is that with the Ultreo I don&#x27;t have to \\&quot;brush\\&quot; my teeth. I just glide the brush in circles over the teeth/gum line and the brush does all the work. It gives me a beep sound signaling to change the teeth \\&quot;quadrant\\&quot; to be brushed next. 30 seconds each area, 1:20 minutes total, done. And I have to tell you, it feels **clean**. It in fact blasts away the buildups that are still somewhat soft, and I have noticed the spaces between my inside lower teeth slowly getting bigger, meaning that there is some harder build up there that is being slowly removed at every brushing session. I have also noticed that the trick is to keep as much fluid as possible around the brush head while in use, it works much better, which makes sense. If you ever took you watch or jewelry to be cleaned up in one of those ultrasound baths, you understand what I&#x27;m talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is the real deal. I&#x27;m very happy with this brush and it does the work that my sonicare can&#x27;t do, in half the time. Remember, with this brush you don&#x27;t \\&quot;brush\\&quot;, you don&#x27;t apply any pressure. You just glide it with lots of liquid there. It works. I&#x27;m sold!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Unfortunately I had to return this toothbrush because something got loose inside after a few days of use, and the vibrations are no longer being transferred to the brush head. The brush head is fine, the battery is fully charged, but something inside its body went wrong. It&#x27;s a shame because this is a really good and effective toothbrush, I couldn&#x27;t get a replacement via Amazon, just a refund but I am willing to give it a try again because this brush is much better than my sonicare.</li>
            <li> The proof is using it.  It is gentle but it packs the proof in cleaning.  Your teeth REALLY do feel better than using a sonicare or other power brush.&lt;br /&gt;You can actually feel the difference.  I brushed with my old sonicare flexcare just to confirm my suspicion on it feeling cleaner!  I was right.... I had to immediately brush with the Ultreo.  It is definitely a cleaner feeling that I get using ultreo.  If I don&#x27;t use ultreo now I feel like my teeth aren&#x27;t clean.  It&#x27;s like leaving the house without a shower!</li>
            <li> I went from a manual brush to the Ultreo, although I did own a Sonicare a few years ago.  Without the Sonicare here to compare it to, this review will be limited to my comparisons with manual brushing.  Cleanliness:  I have to give it 5 stars in this regard.  It actually surprised me how clean my teeth feel when I&#x27;m done brushing.  I tended to be a bit hard on my teeth and gums when brushing manually, so at first I had to think about it to keep from mashing it into my teeth because it doesn&#x27;t feel the same.  Even later in the day, my teeth still feel clean.  It comes packaged with a little brush cap to keep germs off.  Ease of use:  Pop in the brush head, charge it up and you&#x27;re off.  It doesn&#x27;t have a slanted head like my old manual, so it takes some adjusting before you feel like its actually getting your teeth.  I like the narrow stem; I think it results in less toothpaste drooling.  I&#x27;m not sure how long it takes to charge completely, but it takes about a half hour to charge up enough to use.  It tells you every 30 seconds that its time to change zones.  Economic benefits:  You use a tiny bit of toothpaste (also contributes to reduced drooling) and yet your teeth still feel amazing.  It is programmed to remind you when to change your brush head, and is programmable for 2 people, so you&#x27;ll each get a separate reminder.  Unfortunately, the initial purchase does not include an extra brush head. The brush heads are a bit spendy, but I suspect they would actually last longer than the recommended 3 months since you are not really smashing the bristles into your teeth and gums.  Out of the box:  You get the base, the charger, one brush head, a travel pack, and a little plastic brush head cover.    The charger base is tiny, and doesn&#x27;t take much of a footprint on your bathroom counter.   They make up for it with a gigantic travel container.  Seems a bit odd but it all works.  Cleanliness part 2:  My teeth are really white already, so I can&#x27;t vouch for improved whiteness.  They do feel amazingly clean after using it, and pretty much all the time for the last 3 weeks since I started using it.  The only caveat I&#x27;ll throw in here is that while my hygienist has been recommending an ultrasonic toothbrush for a long time, she hasn&#x27;t seen my teeth since I started using this one.  Before I go all out and say this is the best toothbrush on earth I&#x27;d like to have her endorsement.  My instincts tell me my teeth and gums will be improved at my next visit however, because they look and feel fantastic.</li>
            <li> I am coming from a traditional toothbrush and this product is so far above it sets a new standard of oral hygiene. My teeth have never felt this clean. The tone reminds you to switch quadrants. The brush gets into difficult places and scrubs them at ultrasonic rates. The inductive charger ensures that there are no contacts to get corroded. I get about 2 weeks out of a charge. To sum it all up... WOW!</li>
            <li> Great little toothbrush! It comes down to a matter of preference, but the Ultreo worked out fine for me. I was used to my previous brushing implement, Sonicare; Ultreo is a different experience.    The Ultreo brushhead is larger and odder, which takes a bit of getting used to. Funny thing is that the manual toothbrush I used to use had about the same size head, so when I got the Sonicare I had to get used to their smaller head, but with Ultreo, the big head is back.    It&#x27;s noisier and harsher, but since I&#x27;m a brushing fanatic, my gums have toughened up and it didn&#x27;t bother me. After several weeks of use, I can see where my teeth are marginally whiter.    If you never used any kind of electronic brushing device, Ultreo would be an excellent choice.</li>
            <li> I really do love my new Ultreo.  I purchased it about a month ago at the recommendation of my hygienist.  So far my teeth are literally squeaky clean after every brushing.  I do feel a slight buzzing from time to time when I brush one of my crowns that has a collar that is very near the gum line, but other than that,  it is very comfortable and easy to use.  I do agree that this product is a bit on the pricey side, but if it helps me avoid costly and painful dental work in the future, it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> I agree with a previous poster that some of these reviews seem very suspect. Rest assured that this is a real review from a person who actually is using the Ultreo (you can check out my other reviews to see that I&#x27;ve been posting them for a while).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, the topic at hand is the Ultreo. Is it worth the money? Is it better than the other electric toothbrushes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think so, but \\&quot;better\\&quot; is a very subjective term. I&#x27;ve been using an Oral B electric toothbrush for a few years. Started with the 7000 series and recently upgraded to the 9900 Triumph (the one with the wireless monitor). Both do an excellent job, and get your teeth a lot cleaner than a manual toothbrush (at least for me). The only problem is that they can be a bit rough on the gums. Nothing major, but enough to feel some discomfort. I switched to the ultra soft head which helped a lot, but still there&#x27;s some minor irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ultreo solves this problem completely. It is as gentle as can be on the gums while still getting your teeth clean. Takes a couple of uses to get the hang of it, but once you get the technique down, the process is easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a lot to like about the Ultreo. Love the design - best way to describe it is that if Apple were to make a toothbrush, this would be it. Nice build quality, feels good in the hand, takes up very little counter space. The designers should take a bow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other strong positives (in addition to the gentle approach to the gums) is that it really does help whiten your teeth. No, it&#x27;s not like getting a whitening treatment, but I&#x27;ve noticed a clear difference that I did not get with the Oral B (even when using their polishing head). Battery life is good, and it&#x27;s easy to clean (and keep clean).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some negatives as well. First is the price - kind of steep. The replacement heads aren&#x27;t cheap either. Also, the brush head is a bit on the large side, which makes it tough to get into the nooks and crannies as well as a smaller head as found on the Oral B. Getting behind the front teeth is especially challenging - it can be done, but you have to contort a bit, and there&#x27;s usually some drooling involved. Not something you&#x27;d want others to see!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the best combo is to use the Ultreo as my \\&quot;main\\&quot; toothbrush, but every so often use the Oral-B to make sure that all areas are getting clean. The smaller head is a lot more maneuverable for me. Plus, I use a WaterPik once a day as well. Yes, I&#x27;m a real stickler when it comes to teeth, but ever since I&#x27;ve started paying more attention to my teeth cleaning routine, I&#x27;ve been spending a whole lot less time and money at the dentist! For me, it&#x27;s well worth the time and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - any electric toothbrush will usually be a better choice than a manual one. If you can swing the cost, the Ultreo is a fine choice. Despite the few negatives, I&#x27;d give it 4.75 stars. It&#x27;s the best choice if you have sensitive gums. Otherwise, you&#x27;ll also see good results with an Oral B or a Sonic Care. Best way to find out what works best for you is to try them all out - I know the Ultreo and the Oral-B models have a money back guarantee from the manufacturer, so you&#x27;re not going to be out of pocket if the one you pick doesn&#x27;t work well for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy brushing!behind the front teeth is especially challenging - it can be done, but you have to contort a bit, and there&#x27;s usually some drooling involved. Not something you&#x27;d want others to see!    I find that the best combo is to use the Ultreo as my \\&quot;main\\&quot; toothbrush, but every so often use the Oral-B to make sure that all areas are getting clean. The smaller head is a lot more maneuverable for me. Plus, I use a WaterPik once a day as well.

            <li> The Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush was my first experience using an electric toothbrush. It was a bit strange for me at first, and I didn&#x27;t feel I had done a good job cleaning my teeth with it, following up with brushing the old-fashioned way for safety&#x27;s sake.  By the second usage though, I got the hang of it and my teeth felt very clean. In fact, I&#x27;m totally willing to convert to it completely, except that there is no way I will be paying the current price for the replacement heads. Here&#x27;s hoping they become more affordable in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a big fan of the orange accents the brush has either. I&#x27;m more of a green guy, not that it&#x27;s that important. The brush comes with some handy features and stuff, like a travel container and the necessary recharger, and a helpful beeping to let you know when to move on to a different area of your mouth. It shuts off after the recommended 2-minutes of brushing time, but you can always just push the button again. There&#x27;s an indicator on the front to let you know when to recharge and when to replace your brush head. All great stuff. Something else to note though, is that the battery is not replaceable. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s normal for electric toothbrushes though. When you get the hang of it, the toothbrush is easy to use and clear instructions are provided. More than anything, you have to remember to do as little as possible. The instructions do say you need to keep fluid around the bristles for the cleaning process to work properly, but this has never been a problem for me. Also, I have dental work, and according to the information provided, that is not a problem. I certainly hope that&#x27;s true. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the toothbrush but disappointed that I probably won&#x27;t be able to get the replacement heads unless they get a lot more affordable, and I feel I have to deduct at least one star for that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve burned through 3 Ultreo handsets in the past 8 months. Two of these have failed after less than 3 months use. One of them starting rattling before ceasing to work; the other one sprang a micro-leak somewhere and allowed moisture to enter the internals, causing it the handset to fail prematurely. Ultreo&#x27;s customer service is good and they have replaced these handsets, but a generic cover letter from the CEO (included with one of the replacement handsets) alluded that there was a design flaw in some or all of the handsets and that they&#x27;d had a high rate of failure. No telling how long my third handset will last before dying like the others.    The build quality and materials appear to be top-rate, but a 66% failure handset failure rate (my experience) says a lot about this first-generation product. I&#x27;ve used Oral B Sonic Complete (my favorite and a real bargain at less than fifty dollars many places) and the SonicCare Elite. The Ultreo is no better than its competitors. My favorite brush is the Oral B Sonic Complete for its low price and reliability (the handset still works after 3 years).    The ultrasound cleaning feature is a marketing gimmick in my opinion. The Ultreo Web site has no credible scientific studies corroborating its claimed benefits. Stick with a tried-and-true brand like Sonicare or Oral B Sonic Complete.</li>
            <li> As a dental hygienist, I cannot express how great the Ultreo is!! I brush, floss, etc. as most dental hygienist do, but even with my home care regiman I got tremendous results with tea stain removal and the \\&quot;just out of the dental chair\\&quot; feeling of clean!!! Ultrasonic is the only way to ensure thorough brushing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Sonicare toothbrush for some time and my hygienist and I have always been satisfied with its performance, so I didn&#x27;t expect this Ultreo toothbrush to make such a difference. But I noticed what a good job it did the first time I used it, and every time I&#x27;ve used it since I have been similarly impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few things about this that are less than ideal, which is why I only gave it four stars. For one thing, I would have liked it if the Ultreo had come with two toothbrush heads (as the Sonicare does) instead of just one, so my wife wouldn&#x27;t presumably need to purchase a whole second unit so she could use this too. The place where the head attaches to the unit body vibrates, and thus makes more noise, than seems necessary. And since I have a smaller mouth, the option of a smaller toothbrush head would have been nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But these last two objections, especially, are fairly minor. On the whole, I&#x27;m quite happy with this device. I can&#x27;t wait to hear what my hygienist says now.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Ultreo Toothbrush for about three months.  It is a great product.  I had been using the Braun Sonic toothbrush for years, but prefer the Ultreo Toothbrush. It leaves my teeth feeling like I have just had a professional cleaning by a dental hygenist.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This ultrasound toothbrush has been in use for six months.  It has been used for about 45 sec twice a day, although the recommended use is 2 min twice a day.  Tartar  has decreased dramatically and pockets in gums were reduced in half. My dentist looked at my teeth and gums and promptly ordered one for his office.  The toothbrush lasts for at least 6 months with my moderate use.  I highly recommend this product compared to the Sonicare  which I have used in the past.  My frequency of hygienist appointments has decreased to two per year.</li>
            <li> I bought this appliance a month ago with high hopes.Unfortunately, I have now abandoned it in favor of my old toothbrush, a Sonicare. The Ultreo was simple to use and the battery lasted well on a 10 day vacation without its charger, but my cleaning results were unsatisfactory. Plaque built up on my teeth while using the Ultreo and the situation was getting worse, not better. It felt like I needed more \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; from the Ultreo in its brushing. Upon going back to the Sonicare, I was able to get things under control. I have no idea if I got any benefit from the ultrasonic stimulation of my gums. This is an attractive product with good potential. It just did not work well for me.</li>
            <li> I wanted the best toothbrush on the market, so I bought and compared both the Sonicare DiamondClean and Ultreo; both were found out about through word of mouth. (no pun intended)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DiamondClean comes with all sorts of bells and whistles that don&#x27;t really matter like a charging glass, charging travel case, multiple cleaning levels (which are gimiky in my opinion), and an extra brush head. The Ultreo is straightforward and simple. Brush, handle, charger, and travel case. Simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually didn&#x27;t like the ultreo as much as sonicare off the bat because it had such a large brush head. However, I noticed that when I brushed with the Ultreo as per the instructions keeping lots of fluid in my mouth my teeth felt so clean I&#x27;d forget to brush for a couple of days. Sonicare never gave such a superb cleaning experience and thus I chose the Ultreo as my next gen toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product, but buyers should know that the manufacturer went out of business and this is no longer being produced, meaning of course, that a warranty replacement will be impossible, and replacement heads will soon be unavailable.  Caveat emptor.</li>
            <li> Note: This is a review on the original Ultreo units.  The units manufactured by the new Ultreo may not have this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased an Ultreo way back when they first came out, and I loved it!  It got my teeth sparkling clean, and my dental hygienist was thoroughly impressed.  It was my dental secret weapon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, into my first year, the toothbrush died on me.  It wouldn&#x27;t charge.  I called the company (before they went out of business), and they replaced it, free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the company went out of business, and the brush heads became hard to get, unless you wanted to spend a premium on them.  Finally, the company was brought back to life, and I was able to purchase more brush heads.  Everything was great until - you guessed it, the toothbrush refused to charge.  I called the company, and since the toothbrush was now out of service, they offered to sell me some old stock units for $60.  I purchased this unit, and it worked great... for about 9 months.  Now, I&#x27;m left with yet another unit that refuses to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I love my Ultreo, I just can&#x27;t justify paying for it again at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this was a problem with the old units and the new units don&#x27;t have this issue, but it is something to keep in mind, should you decide to purchase this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TLDR - It&#x27;s a great product, with some quality control issues.</li>
            <li> So my ex sister in law is a dental hygienist, and HIGHLY recommended the Ultreo to me many years ago--at least six years ago, maybe as many as 7 or 8. I&#x27;ve had the brush ever since and have been exceptionally happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company went out of business several years back and when I heard that was happening, I bought an extra unit right away, and as many brushes as I could find.  I&#x27;ve been s-t-r-e-t-c-h-i-n-g my use of them out for years.  The first brush died after 4-5 years, as battery-operated-anything are wont to do (so no complaints--daily use for 1500 days is good by me!).  I then put the extra unit into service and it&#x27;s been cranking along for going on three years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am finally on my last replacement brush.  In a \\&quot;hail mary\\&quot; attempt, I went online tonight to find replacement brushes. HALLELUJAH I discover they&#x27;re back in business (and have been for more than a year, it seems).  Thank goodness!!!  I found replacement brushes on drugstore.com for $35--not cheap, but not a rip-off either.  That&#x27;s the right price as I recall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you get in return for the price are AMAZINGLLY clean teeth.  I&#x27;ve tried many other devices out there, but this one just simply rocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m SO happy to share with you all how happy I&#x27;ve been.  I&#x27;ve been keeping it to myself so that I could get replacement brushes without competition, and now that&#x27;s not a problem :-)</li>
