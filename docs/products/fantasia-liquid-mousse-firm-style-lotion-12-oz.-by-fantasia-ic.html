    <ol>
            <li> Recommended to me by my brother.  Wash, towel try and apply the mousse.  Tames your tresses and adds body.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a long time. Gives my hair some body so that I can style it nicely.</li>
            <li> has a plastic smell to it</li>
            <li> This product is great for men who want to add a little styling help to their hair without the look OR SMELL of traditional hair products.</li>
            <li> good I&#x27;ve used it (faithfully) for some 23 years ? suttle and very very apealing scent that carries itself through the day ONLY downfall &#x3D; it&#x27;s hard too find in many or ANY beauty supply stores ....</li>
            <li> Love how the spray works and goes on more than foam. Lighter and recommended by my hair dresser. Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Great product, Fantasia Liquid Mousse is the best mousse I have ever used. I used it for several years, then Walgreens discontinued carrying this item. I looked for it locally for a long time, but finally gave up, thinking I would never be able to find it again. This year while cleaning out cabinets I found an old, almost empty bottle of Fantasia, I decided to look for it on amazon and to my surprise there it was. Amazon is the best. Thank you.</li>
            <li> i spray this product on towel dried hair right before i blow dry and curl my hair with a curling iron it works very well it helps hold curls,waves longer and its helps with frizz too!! and i also feel like it is helping my hair grow! i would recommend this product to a friend!</li>
            <li> We use this with curl formers.  We mix the setting lotion with water in a spray botttle before we use the curl formers.  This doesn&#x27;t get hard like many sprays, this stays soft but holds the form of the curl very well.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 20 years now.  It is absolutely an excellent mousse.  It si so good for your hair,  it has panthenol in it.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, great for styling</li>
            <li> Love the spray - so much cleaner and easier to use than the spray foam type.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Will buy more.</li>
            <li> Used this product for many many years. Will try something new but always come back. Gives body without weight or being gummy or stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped and delivered as promised. Would definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be discontinued in Beauty supply stores.&lt;br /&gt;This setting lotion is great.... not cakey and does not flake.  I highly recommend this product especially if your hair&lt;br /&gt;is relaxed and you want your curls to last.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like most gel or foam mousse because I have fine, thin hair and those products tend to weigh my hair down. This liquid mousse work very well, giving me just enough hold and not a lot of weight.</li>
            <li> I love this and have used it for years.  Love that it&#x27;s a liquid not foam so I can just spray it directly on my hair instead of having to put it in my hands to apply it (then my hands get all sticky, yuck.)  Controls my hair really well (I have curly hair that frizzes easily when it&#x27;s humid or rainy, and yeah I use antifrizz control but I need more than that.)  And I love the convenience of buying it from Amazon.com instead of searching from store to store to buy it.</li>
            <li> Not Amazon&#x27;s fault, but this product, even though it had the same name as what the hairdresser used, did not perform as well. Could it be altered from the commercial product?</li>
            <li> I have used fantasia for years in my attempt to stop using aerosols. It took a little time to make the adjustment but was well worth it...It does a great job..</li>
            <li> The best Mousse without it being sticky.</li>
            <li> We love this product from Adults, teenagers, to children. we all use it, some as mousse and some as hair spray and some of us as frizz control.</li>
