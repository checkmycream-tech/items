            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>It allows you to remove the cuticle effortlessly and to have a good finish on your nails.</li>
            <li>I took off a star because it doesnt work as good as Sally Hanson.</li>
            <li>orange wood sitck or cuticle pusher is really good</li>
            <li>and it came on time and the job it does is amazing</li>
            <li>It did the job nicely and I recommend the product.</li>
            <li>This is the best cuticle remover I&#x27;ve used so far!</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and does it&#x27;s job lickity-split!  </li>
            <li>I tried this product because of the great reviews and they were not wrong.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge for what the product is and for the price, there&#x27;s no reason not to buy this!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>My husband had to take his knife tip, put it in the top, and turn it.  </li>
            <li>This  dries if you do more than 3 fingers at a time.  </li>
            <li>I love that it takes the work out of cuticle pushing.</li>
            <li>and I remember it was ok on shipping time.</li>
            <li>The best cuticle remover ever and the only one I will ever buy.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s much better and easier.</li>
            <li>Just need to apply it on top of the cuticle areas and after a minute or so, they are easier to remove.</li>
            <li>Glad I ordered this.</li>
            <li>It helped me in my Do-It-Yourself manicure and pedicure. :)</li>
            <li>I guess I wanted it to work better than store bought stuff</li>
            <li>Still had to use cuticle nippers more than like to.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I purchased this product for my problem cuticles.  </li>
            <li>My hands have never looked better.</li>
            <li>you use as directed, you will love it.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it works and also the amount of product...</li>
            <li>Very useful to use in between for cuticle clean-ups!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>but it does so through a strong chemical action.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Nice big bottle at a good price point.  </li>
            <li>Fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and came fast</li>
            <li>I liked a lot this product, Thanks for all and for a faster shippment.</li>
            <li>This product is a great deal...6 oz will last me a loooong time!</li>
            <li>Goes on very easily, removes very quickly and does an excellant job, very surprised at the ending results.  </li>
            <li>I use this all the time and it keeps my cuticles looking fresh every manicure!</li>
            <li>It works great, i left it on for 1 -2 mins and used a cuticle pusher and it just came right off...</li>
            <li>And it does a good enough job (if you follow directions) that I&#x27;ve had family members ask who I have do my nails.</li>
            <li>I love how soft and light it is.</li>
            <li>I am doing my own nails now and love how this goes on, a little goes a long way and it was a great price for the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s removing invisible, dead cuticles or if I&#x27;m scraping off the top of my nail.</li>
            <li>No artificial colors.  </li>
            <li>Allows easy push back of cuticles and easy nipping.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item because of the reviews and they were right, the cuticles come right off</li>
            <li>This works very well to really clean the nails</li>
            <li>I think that works a little faster and better, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>The product does, in fact, do a nice job of removing that thin layer nicely.</li>
            <li>Tried this only once so far, it works good.  </li>
            <li>It easily removes my hyponicium and makes my cuticles extremly soft after I&#x27;m done trimming them and finishing my manicure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a nail professional, but this stuff is so easy to use that it doesn&#x27;t matter.  </li>
            <li>but this is very gentle</li>
            <li>worth the price because it is a large bottle compared to what i&#x27;ve bought in a drugstore.</li>
            <li>And for the price its worth it also it came fast</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t exactly work how I had imagined it would.</li>
            <li>Nothing in past worked as good as this one.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly like the product only available to nail technicians in Canada.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to push the cuticle back without damaging them.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in using another cuticle softener such as a lotion over using this.  </li>
            <li>Huge bottle - will last me forever.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really remove them.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need too much for each nail.</li>
            <li>this gel helps get cuticles done fast.</li>
            <li>I bought this after having it used on me in a salon, but can&#x27;t see that it really does much of anything.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell that it&#x27;s softening or removing my cuticles as I gently rub with a cotton-wrapped orange stick.  </li>
            <li>so I tried this out and left my cuticle beds clean.</li>
            <li>But SH costs 10 times more for less product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is such a large quantity, I tried it on the bottoms of my feet and it worked better any product I&#x27;ve ever used to remove dry skin!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really makes my cuticles soft</li>
            <li>Highly recomend it for anyone in the industry that is looking for a new brand of cuticle remover and to people who are just looking for something to try at home while doing self manicures.</li>
            <li>It makes it easy to use a cuticle stick to push the cuticle down.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>If you do your cuticles regularly tit takes less time to remove them and you can do more fingers at a time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on both my hands and my toes and have gotten professional looking results, no need to cut the cuticles</li>
            <li>It is a large bottle that will probably last me several years.</li>
            <li>I have to leave product on for an extra long time or soak hands/feet first.</li>
            <li>I really will by with you other product.</li>
            <li>A scissor won&#x27;t cut it, and it is unclear where to cut, but be careful not to cut too low or too much will come out at a time.</li>
            <li>Also does not dry my skin.</li>

            <li> Also does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li> I find that this softens my cuticles and makes it easier to trim them--I usually use it just before hopping in the shower--but it&#x27;s not a dramatic cure-all.</li>
            <li> Will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> For the price you get a lot and it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Way too expensive when this works just fine.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let it sit on your cuticles too long.</li>
            <li> so it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I used Orly brand at my salon and it was a bit thicker and didn&#x27;t dry on the rest of my fingers before I was done removing the cuticles.  </li>
            <li> and you can rub off the dry cuticles around your nail bed.</li>
            <li> I normally have pretty crazy cuticles to begin with</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional but this does what is expected.</li>
            <li> It does NOT remove the whole, thin ring of skin that comprises the cuticle, so don&#x27;t expect that.</li>
            <li> Not what i expected.</li>
            <li> Not much to tell.</li>
            <li> Be careful to use as directed, I lost track of time and ended with hangnails because the product seeped in the sides of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After I let a small dot (I mean really small) sit on my cuticle for about a minute, the cuticle just comes right off, which means no clipping and grating the edges of my nails!</li>
            <li> Some other cuticle removers use KOH, which is Potassium hydroxide.  </li>
            <li> Works as described in other reviews.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m just supposed to push the cuticle back and use a cuticle remover to get the thin layer that&#x27;s left off the nail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very used to pushing the cuticle back and then cutting it all off, so this has been a transition for me.</li>
            <li> I guess it cleans my nails and makes it easier to push my cuticles down</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on cuticle removers over the years and usually get about a tenth of the amount for this price.  </li>
            <li> A little bit upset (((</li>
            <li> this will last me for at least a year!</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a very long time because it takes a very small amount to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> That is why it dried out my finger</li>
            <li> Test a small area</li>
            <li> and I do my nails at least twice a month.</li>
            <li> (don&#x27;t forget the toenails) so that the gel nail products really adhere to the nails without peeling from the base of the nail.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a thick consistency so it stays where you want it and doesn&#x27;t run.</li>
            <li> It is a lot stronger than what you get at Sally&#x27;s, but almost impossible to open.  </li>
            <li> I usually clip my cuticles (I know that is really bad)</li>
            <li> so I can clip them with cutting my self</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is awesome! And for the price its worth it also it came fast I got it in 2 days! 😄</li>
            <li> Like the stuff the manicurist uses in the salon.  Very useful to use in between for cuticle clean-ups!</li>
            <li> Lots of product. Good price.  Will last a long time.  Definitely works. Don&#x27;t let it sit on your cuticles too long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay I guess it cleans my nails and makes it easier to push my cuticles down but it didn&#x27;t really remove them.</li>
            <li> This stuff works like a charm! The bottle is huge for what the product is and for the price, there&#x27;s no reason not to buy this!</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s removing invisible, dead cuticles or if I&#x27;m scraping off the top of my nail.</li>
            <li> Works well on softening cuticles.  Would use orange stick and/or cuticle cutter in addition.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and came fast</li>
            <li> It is a lot stronger than what you get at Sally&#x27;s, but almost impossible to open.  My husband had to take his knife tip, put it in the top, and turn it.  A scissor won&#x27;t cut it, and it is unclear where to cut, but be careful not to cut too low or too much will come out at a time.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly like the product only available to nail technicians in Canada. This saves me lots of money and time by having the opportunity to have this product at home</li>
            <li> My nail girl used this and I loved it I am doing my own nails now and love how this goes on, a little goes a long way and it was a great price for the size of the bottle. I use this all the time and it keeps my cuticles looking fresh every manicure!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on good reviews.  It&#x27;s a good product and you get a lot for the price.  I gave 4 stars b/c I used Orly brand at my salon and it was a bit thicker and didn&#x27;t dry on the rest of my fingers before I was done removing the cuticles.  This  dries if you do more than 3 fingers at a time.  If you do your cuticles regularly tit takes less time to remove them and you can do more fingers at a time.  The Orly was about 14 euros ($18.95)for the size of a nail polish bottle!! Way too expensive when this works just fine.</li>
            <li> This is the best cuticle remover I&#x27;ve used so far! I recommend it to friends as well as use it regularly.</li>
            <li> i like this stuff a lot. works great with an orange stick, etc. worth the price because it is a large bottle compared to what i&#x27;ve bought in a drugstore.</li>
            <li> Great cuticle remover. For the price you get a lot and it will last a long time. Allows easy push back of cuticles and easy nipping. Will buy again when I run out, but that won&#x27;t be for a while!</li>
            <li> My nail tech tells me I&#x27;m not supposed to use a cuticle cutter to remove skin, I&#x27;m just supposed to push the cuticle back and use a cuticle remover to get the thin layer that&#x27;s left off the nail. Fine. I&#x27;ll try that. I&#x27;m very used to pushing the cuticle back and then cutting it all off, so this has been a transition for me. The product does, in fact, do a nice job of removing that thin layer nicely. It does NOT remove the whole, thin ring of skin that comprises the cuticle, so don&#x27;t expect that. Over 3 months of using the product I do see the cuticle is not growing back a diligently as it did when I cut it all off. Perhaps there is something to this method. I&#x27;ll give this method a bit longer, but I do prefer the cuticle all gone so I may be biased giving this 3 stars.</li>
            <li> This product stays where it is put and is very effective.  It makes my job easier!  Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else</li>
            <li> This cuticle remover is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  Goes on very easily, removes very quickly and does an excellant job, very surprised at the ending results.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This product is basically Lye, as another reviewer mentioned.  That is why it dried out my finger nails.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it works- but it does so through a strong chemical action.&lt;br /&gt;This product can damage collagen, and is not recommended for skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do use it, just dab it on with a Q-Tip.  And, don&#x27;t get it in your eyes- it would cause burning and possible damage.</li>
            <li> Not what i expected. Doesn&#x27;t remove cuticle well. A little bit upset (((</li>
            <li> Tried this only once so far, it works good.  I usually clip my cuticles (I know that is really bad) so I tried this out and left my cuticle beds clean.</li>
            <li> This is really great cuticle remover. I was very surprised. I am happy and will purchase this again when I run out but this is a big bottle for the money!</li>
            <li> WOW! This product is amazing! I love that it takes the work out of cuticle pushing. After I let a small dot (I mean really small) sit on my cuticle for about a minute, the cuticle just comes right off, which means no clipping and grating the edges of my nails!</li>
            <li> It helps soften the cuticles to make pushing them back easier.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in using another cuticle softener such as a lotion over using this.  Wish it helped kept them moisturized.</li>
            <li> The CND Cuticle Remover does not work, as advertized.  I tried it several times and it did nothing.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> I find that this softens my cuticles and makes it easier to trim them--I usually use it just before hopping in the shower--but it&#x27;s not a dramatic cure-all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this bottle for over a year now and I do my nails at least twice a month. good price and I remember it was ok on shipping time. It&#x27;s really makes my cuticles soft so I can clip them with cutting my self</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped</li>
            <li> It works great, i left it on for 1 -2 mins and used a cuticle pusher and it just came right off...</li>
            <li> CND cuticle remover is one of the best I have ever used. It easily removes my hyponicium and makes my cuticles extremly soft after I&#x27;m done trimming them and finishing my manicure. Highly recomend it for anyone in the industry that is looking for a new brand of cuticle remover and to people who are just looking for something to try at home while doing self manicures.</li>
            <li> Wait a minute or so for your cuticle to absorb this and you can rub off the dry cuticles around your nail bed. Works well. Don&#x27;t need too much for each nail.</li>
            <li> Nice big bottle at a good price point.  No artificial colors.  Works sufficiently if you use enough and do it often.  Contains sodium hydroxide, which is lye.  Some other cuticle removers use KOH, which is Potassium hydroxide.  I think that works a little faster and better, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I use this product every time I do a manicure and it keeps my cuticles looking great.  The bottle lasts a very long time because it takes a very small amount to get the job done.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a nail professional, but this stuff is so easy to use that it doesn&#x27;t matter.  And it does a good enough job (if you follow directions) that I&#x27;ve had family members ask who I have do my nails.</li>
            <li> The best cuticle remover ever and the only one I will ever buy.</li>
            <li> I have my nails done every 2 weeks. But sometimes I take a rest. So when I do my nails this gel helps get cuticles done fast. Happy I bought it for myself to use. Nothing in past worked as good as this one.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price. I have used several times and have found that it softens the cuticle rather than remove the cuticle. It makes it easy to use a cuticle stick to push the cuticle down.</li>
            <li> I liked a lot this product, Thanks for all and for a faster shippment. I really will by with you other product.</li>
            <li> My manicurist swears by this stuff.  I&#x27;ve decided to start maintaining my nails at home &amp; purchased this to try it out.  AWESOME!  I normally have pretty crazy cuticles to begin with but this is very gentle and it&#x27;s easy to push the cuticle back without damaging them.  I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> the best product ever</li>
            <li> Does the job amazingly! And a BIG bottle too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the second time I buy this stuff and I really love it!! I love how soft and light it is. It definitely removes my clients cuticles and I also use it on myself. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on cuticle removers over the years and usually get about a tenth of the amount for this price.  This works very well to really clean the nails (don&#x27;t forget the toenails) so that the gel nail products really adhere to the nails without peeling from the base of the nail.  Also helps avoid cuticle nicks.</li>
            <li> I bought this after having it used on me in a salon, but can&#x27;t see that it really does much of anything.  I can&#x27;t tell that it&#x27;s softening or removing my cuticles as I gently rub with a cotton-wrapped orange stick.  I&#x27;ve tried rubbing immediately after applying the gel and after letting the gel sit on my cuticles for a couple minutes, doesn&#x27;t make a difference.  I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Very nice, does the job.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t gotten a chance to try it yet but it was sent out before the stated delivery time and was larger then I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li> Gives the best manicure at home, with out having to spend $$$ at a salon. It&#x27;s easy to use. I love it</li>
            <li> Works as described in other reviews. It allows you to remove the cuticle effortlessly and to have a good finish on your nails.</li>
            <li> Not much to tell. It did the job nicely and I recommend the product. It is a large bottle that will probably last me several years.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this item, I thought it was just like my regular cuticle remover before. I&#x27;m happy when I used it, it&#x27;s much better and easier. Just need to apply it on top of the cuticle areas and after a minute or so, they are easier to remove. Glad I ordered this. It helped me in my Do-It-Yourself manicure and pedicure. :)</li>
            <li> The beat cuticle remover out there!  I willemite nothing else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional but this does what is expected. Also does not dry my skin. The bottle is really big so it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because of the great reviews and they were not wrong. It is easy to apply and does it&#x27;s job lickity-split!  No odor.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t exactly work how I had imagined it would. I have to leave product on for an extra long time or soak hands/feet first. I guess I wanted it to work better than store bought stuff but it didn&#x27;t. Still had to use cuticle nippers more than like to.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Huge bottle - will last me forever.</li>
            <li> This product is a great deal...6 oz will last me a loooong time! The product works well too. I took off a star because it doesnt work as good as Sally Hanson. But SH costs 10 times more for less product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a thick consistency so it stays where you want it and doesn&#x27;t run. It is such a large quantity, I tried it on the bottoms of my feet and it worked better any product I&#x27;ve ever used to remove dry skin! Test a small area first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again when it runs out.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I purchased this product for my problem cuticles.  It worked. My hands have never looked better.</li>
            <li> sono molto soddisfatta sia del prodotto che del servizio di spedizione lo comprerò di nuovo quando sarà finito grazie .</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because of the reviews and they were right, the cuticles come right off it&#x27;s amazing! I&#x27;ve used it on both my hands and my toes and have gotten professional looking results, no need to cut the cuticles they just come off. Be careful to use as directed, I lost track of time and ended with hangnails because the product seeped in the sides of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use as directed, you will love it.</li>
            <li> i bought it cause i needed a cuticle remover asap and it came on time and the job it does is amazing i dont even have to use and orange wood sitck or cuticle pusher is really good</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it works and also the amount of product...this will last me for at least a year!</li>
