            <li>Good Luck !</li>
            <li>In order for this to work you must drink A LOT of water, and have a great skin care regime to go with it.</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy to submit my review on Pantothen.</li>
            <li>And I am honestly proud to say that Pantothen has put my acne breakouts under control.</li>
            <li>It was a great price.</li>
            <li>Works very effectively with no side effects.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no question in my mind that this product successfully addressed my acne problem and did what it said it could do.</li>
            <li>It sounds good though.</li>
            <li>this supplement work really good on me.</li>
            <li>Without a good skin care routine, this product will not be helpful.</li>
            <li>I am still looking for a good skin care routine.</li>
            <li>Zinc is a good sleep aid</li>
            <li>I read through the reviews for this product and it seems that for the people who said it doesn&#x27;t work, they weren&#x27;t using a good skin care routine anyway.</li>
            <li>pills.&lt;br /&gt;Using this routine, I see really good results.</li>
            <li>But, if you&#x27;re doing a good job of keeping up with washing and everything, this should work for you.</li>
            <li>I balked, and good thing I did because I came across the product ad and tried it.  </li>
            <li>My son has been taking it for 3 months now, and I can most deffinitely say that his acne is probably 60% better!!</li>
            <li>A good skin care routine is very important and a good scrub and body lotion as well.</li>
            <li>but I found this amazing product and it did wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li>You might want to look into it more or ask your doctor...</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re thinking about using this product, do some more research before you buy it.</li>
            <li>My skin feels a lot more drier than it was before.</li>
            <li>i have hormonal acne here and there during the month and getting more toward my period.but since i have taken this supplement</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Hope people had better luck with this product than me.</li>
            <li>Im doing accutane/isotretinoin now, which is much better.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be buying any more but moving onto another product to try..</li>
            <li>go to a doctor to find a better solution than this product.</li>
            <li>and i find for the most part that it is WORKING.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for sure.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I love Pantothen...</li>
            <li>I am a proactive solutions user love the product but for some reason my skin started to break out</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure what was going on with my skin.</li>
            <li>LOVE Pantothen and who ever created it ...</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the magic question.  </li>
            <li>a day works better</li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously, if you&#x27;re going to use this product, you have to have a good, consistent skin care routine in place.</li>
            <li>I feel beautiful, and I have such pretty skin!!!</li>
            <li>Pills are huge and have no writing on them</li>
            <li>I am happy to report after using Pantothen for several weeks</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t waste your money on this product, didn&#x27;t do anything at all best</li>
            <li>Within about a week I noticed drastic results and about a month I was blemish free. ....</li>
            <li>But didn&#x27;t clear my skin up as good as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li>He is also using Zinc for Acne by Good &#x27;N Natural, but those are taken at night before bed.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t doubt that this could work for other people, pantothenic acid is very good for you, if you do find that pantothen works for you</li>
            <li>I have been taking Pantothen for 1 month and have noticed significant results.  </li>
            <li>and I was so excited.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s what is different about this product it gives the body time to heal while more acne doesn&#x27;t form so that was amazing.</li>
            <li>People have actually commented on how good my skin have become.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not 100% though, as I&#x27;m probably going to keep him on this for another couple of months!Alls he uses for cleanser is a mild neutrogena cleanser that contains salycylic acid, as anything that contained</li>
            <li>you really have nothing to lose!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my blemishes have faded, and I rarely get acne or whiteheads.</li>
            <li>I am completely breakout free!</li>
            <li>I have been using Pantothen for over 2.5 months and most of my acne is cleared out and I can feel and see that the rest of my acne is clearly drying out.</li>
            <li>Good part is that he doesn&#x27;t have dryness or redness of the face, like when using other acne medicine.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it for a few more months to  see even better results.</li>
            <li>My skin does get really dry and kind of flaky, but that is what I want to happen.</li>
            <li>However, I offer advice to the people who feel it is not working for them (assuming you already have a consistent skin-care regimen).</li>
            <li>I was aware of all the side-effects it has</li>
            <li>It breaks u put at first</li>
            <li>Im almost finished my first bottle now</li>
            <li>(BTW, I have pretty oily skin)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then at night time, around 8:00, I take my makeup off, wash with the same 2 products I used in the morning and take 2 more Pantothen</li>
            <li>When that starts happening, I use a moisturizer and that does me pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is possible that I just need more time</li>
            <li>I went to it out of sheer desperation and the fact that I liked that it was natural.</li>
            <li>Pantothen helped me a little im using my first bottle, so far good its controlling my acne as in</li>
            <li>nothing really helped .</li>
            <li>I still have some oily skin around  my forehead, but not as much as before.</li>
            <li>I am very suspicious.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I finished the whole bottle of this product with no results.</li>
            <li>I understand that not all skin products work on everyone but there was absolutely ZERO change in my skin to the point that I&#x27;d have to call Pantothen a scam.</li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>It got to me so fast</li>
            <li>Pantothen works very well for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Proactive, things that claim to be better than Proactive, and various different things with pretty much 0 results.</li>
            <li>So far so good, haven&#x27;t taken it long enough..</li>
            <li>The result is a beautiful complexion with hardly any pimples; she now has maybe one or two a week whereas before it was multiple outbreaks.</li>
            <li>But, the bottle is full of big horse pills that cannot be swallowed.</li>
            <li>I recommed this to anyone who wants to have a clear complexion!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to people suffering from acne.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It is totally natural and hasn&#x27;t affected me in any other way, so I feel that it is safe to do this.</li>
            <li>For many years I tried accutane and antiobiotics with little results.</li>
            <li>Its a little tough though to keep reminding a 16 year old to have to take 4 of these per day, but he does his best, and I can say absolutely that there is an improvement in his skin!</li>
            <li>I tried for a week and everyday i just kept breaking out more than ususal.</li>
            <li>I have had him to 3 different dermatologists, and he has been on every antibiotic out there, and we tried hundreds of dollars worth of creams, soaps, etc..</li>
            <li>Gonna make another update to my review in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>Ok, so this is the second month me taking this Pantothen, I have noticed improvement in my skin, less breakouts after about three weeks of taking it consistently, even helped with my keratosis pilaris.</li>
            <li>Then again, maybe it was the new water softener we had installed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried Benzoyl Peroxide Treatments, AHA peels, Oxy, Clean &amp; Clear, Pro Active etc, etc..  </li>
            <li>I have never achieved a perfectly clear complexion with Pantothen</li>
            <li>the morning, I shower and then wash my face with Aveeno Clear Complexion foaming wash, and then use a drying spot treatment lotion.</li>
            <li>yes, it is a bit pricey, but is all natural.</li>
            <li>Because I suffer from adult acne, I did some research online.  </li>
            <li>Then I found out that it slows the production of oil in your skin NATURALLY.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural and there are no side effects, and in my case I noticed a difference within one week.  </li>
            <li>I  was researching natural supplements which addressed problem skin with ongoing outbreaks of acne.  </li>
            <li>I am 28 years old today, I have had acne since I was 15</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really help me enough to stick with it.</li>
            <li>and my son has been VERY inconsistent with taking ALL 4 pills on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>This product naturally reduces the production of oil in the skin.  </li>
            <li>I will be 40 this year and since my early 20s have been battling acne.  </li>
            <li>They are natural and no parabeans.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about staying on antibiotic’s for long periods of time and next approach was to try accutane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been looking high and low to find the ingredients used in this product online but</li>
            <li>My first bottle&#x27;s  almost empty</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found if I use it daily (when no acne is present), that it dries my skin out too much.</li>
            <li>After 2 years with pantothen my skin is now soft and clear around my shoulders and back and it is not itchy.</li>
            <li>i usually don&#x27;t make videos, but this one&#x27;s worth the hassle!</li>
            <li>I have tried natural remedies such as Baking Soda, Lemon Juice (applied on face),</li>
            <li>Im guessing the second week was the &amp;#34;Its gets worse before better stage&amp;#34; because this week it is really clear again.</li>
            <li>I have tried all sorts of medication in the past including Retin-A, Proactive, over-the-counter meds, blu-light treatments and facials, without much success.  </li>
            <li>Major issue with this product is taking these large pills 4 times a day and it only helped my skin a little bit.</li>
            <li>Is 25 years not long enough to be dealing with this?</li>

            <li> Gonna make another update to my review in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> Ok, so this is the second month me taking this Pantothen, I have noticed improvement in my skin, less breakouts after about three weeks of taking it consistently, even helped with my keratosis pilaris.</li>
            <li> Then again, maybe it was the new water softener we had installed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried Benzoyl Peroxide Treatments, AHA peels, Oxy, Clean &amp; Clear, Pro Active etc, etc..  </li>
            <li> I have never achieved a perfectly clear complexion with Pantothen</li>
            <li> the morning, I shower and then wash my face with Aveeno Clear Complexion foaming wash, and then use a drying spot treatment lotion.</li>
            <li> yes, it is a bit pricey, but is all natural.</li>
            <li> Because I suffer from adult acne, I did some research online.  </li>
            <li> Then I found out that it slows the production of oil in your skin NATURALLY.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural and there are no side effects, and in my case I noticed a difference within one week.  </li>
            <li> I  was researching natural supplements which addressed problem skin with ongoing outbreaks of acne.  </li>
            <li> I am 28 years old today, I have had acne since I was 15</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really help me enough to stick with it.</li>
            <li> and my son has been VERY inconsistent with taking ALL 4 pills on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> This product naturally reduces the production of oil in the skin.  </li>
            <li> I will be 40 this year and since my early 20s have been battling acne.  </li>
            <li> They are natural and no parabeans.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about staying on antibiotic’s for long periods of time and next approach was to try accutane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been looking high and low to find the ingredients used in this product online but</li>
            <li> My first bottle&#x27;s  almost empty</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found if I use it daily (when no acne is present), that it dries my skin out too much.</li>
            <li> After 2 years with pantothen my skin is now soft and clear around my shoulders and back and it is not itchy.</li>
            <li> i usually don&#x27;t make videos, but this one&#x27;s worth the hassle!</li>
            <li> I have tried natural remedies such as Baking Soda, Lemon Juice (applied on face),</li>
            <li> Im guessing the second week was the &amp;#34;Its gets worse before better stage&amp;#34; because this week it is really clear again.</li>
            <li> I have tried all sorts of medication in the past including Retin-A, Proactive, over-the-counter meds, blu-light treatments and facials, without much success.  </li>
            <li> Major issue with this product is taking these large pills 4 times a day and it only helped my skin a little bit.</li>
            <li> Is 25 years not long enough to be dealing with this?</li>
            <li> I have adult acne due to allergies &amp; use this product whenever I have an outbreak.</li>
            <li> Two things; be consistent every day for at least 3 weeks before seeing noticable results, and secondly, double the dose.</li>
            <li> I have to take at LEAST 8 pills a day in order to maintain consistent results.</li>
            <li> I ran across this miracle vitamin and to make a long story short I cancelled my appt.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been battling acne since as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> The second week of using it i had a pretty bad break out but the week before that it was extremely clear.</li>
            <li> This product might work wonders on other customers but it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> I still have an occasional small pimple or two</li>
            <li> other then that i&#x27;ve used 6pills</li>
            <li> were the sleep, diet and other things</li>
            <li> First time I had them, it took me 3 days to get rid of aches painful acne that I had... totally going to buy them again sometime soon.</li>
            <li> my acne is significantly less than before.</li>
            <li> My son has been using it less than a week</li>
            <li> I did not want to subject my daughter to the harshness of the alternative - has anyone read the side effects of Accutane?  </li>
            <li> Tried it for 6 months with little effect.</li>
            <li> My excessively oily skin is due to PCOS and exessive testosterone.  </li>
            <li> a little search on the internet and found this product, did a little research and read the revues.  </li>
            <li> This supplement is also very hard to find objective information about online.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this snake oil.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> when I over indulge on fatty food, but don&#x27;t have the pus and cysts like before.  </li>
            <li> DETOX and you won&#x27;t have trouble with acne anymore.</li>
            <li> Nothing helped for the long run, I tried changing my diet and that didn&#x27;t help, some of the methods I tried made my acne even worse.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In addition to the absolutely no visible improvement in my skin, I was also cursed with some unpleasant GI episodes, which I think are related to all that pantothenic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am not sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that I know the answer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m desperate to find a natural solution that works.  </li>
            <li> When I notice my skin getting excessively oily I start taking Pantothen &amp; usually that&#x27;s all I need.</li>
            <li> I keep a schedule when I take it, because you have to take it four times a day, which can be annoying, especially when you forget to take one at some point; and I do wish the price was lower, pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> benzoil peroxide just irritated his skin and dried him out worse!</li>
            <li> when I say everything, I mean it!</li>
            <li> If anything it&#x27;s worse.</li>
            <li> So, I have to say, my 16 year old son has been suffering with very bad acne for about 3 years now.</li>
            <li> I think it is too expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 21 now and am sick of it.</li>
            <li> I have done my research on that drug, and it is extremely dangerous!</li>
            <li> Wish i could return this bottle of crap.</li>
            <li> I hate this</li>
            <li> I do have to say, I hate taking all those pills and am always on the lookout for soemthing else, but I&#x27;m stuck with it until then.</li>
            <li> this crap does NOT work!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Pills are huge and have no writing on them so it makes me fill like Im taking placebos. I tried for a week and everyday i just kept breaking out more than ususal. I stopped taking them and went back to my $150 bottle of doxycycline, my face started clearing up in lesss than 2 days. Wish i could return this bottle of crap.</li>
            <li> Dont buy Pantothen if you have oily skin it did nothing for my oily skin it actually made me break out around my cheek area and doesn&#x27;t get rid of blackheads!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I gave the product a chance to work. I had for a month and not results.  SO maybe, maybe not. It sounds good though.</li>
            <li> So, I have to say, my 16 year old son has been suffering with very bad acne for about 3 years now. I have had him to 3 different dermatologists, and he has been on every antibiotic out there, and we tried hundreds of dollars worth of creams, soaps, etc..nothing really helped . the doctor said the only solution for his type of acne would be accutane.. I refused! I have done my research on that drug, and it is extremely dangerous! So, I went online and starting researching alternatives to accutane. This is where I came across Pantothen. yes, it is a bit pricey, but is all natural. My son has been taking it for 3 months now, and I can most deffinitely say that his acne is probably 60% better!! Its a little tough though to keep reminding a 16 year old to have to take 4 of these per day, but he does his best, and I can say absolutely that there is an improvement in his skin! It&#x27;s not 100% though, as I&#x27;m probably going to keep him on this for another couple of months!Alls he uses for cleanser is a mild neutrogena cleanser that contains salycylic acid, as anything that contained benzoil peroxide just irritated his skin and dried him out worse! I wish I would have taken before and after pics, but I didn&#x27;t!So, if you suffer, give it a try.. you really have nothing to lose!! Good luck!</li>
            <li> I have been using pantothen for over a year now. I went to it out of sheer desperation and the fact that I liked that it was natural. I have moderate to moderately severe acne and have struggled with it since I was a teenager. I have never achieved a perfectly clear complexion with Pantothen but it definitely has cleared me up between 80 and 97%. However, I offer advice to the people who feel it is not working for them (assuming you already have a consistent skin-care regimen). Two things; be consistent every day for at least 3 weeks before seeing noticable results, and secondly, double the dose. Especially at the beginning. I have to take at LEAST 8 pills a day in order to maintain consistent results. I hate this but that&#x27;s just how it is. It is totally natural and hasn&#x27;t affected me in any other way, so I feel that it is safe to do this. You might want to look into it more or ask your doctor... I&#x27;m just letting you know how I get it to work for me. I have used it this way for a year now and it works for me. I do have to say, I hate taking all those pills and am always on the lookout for soemthing else, but I&#x27;m stuck with it until then.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pantothen going on 3 months. It has taken some time to see results but my face has cleared up a lot! I&#x27;ve noticed my blemishes have faded, and I rarely get acne or whiteheads. In order for this to work you must drink A LOT of water, and have a great skin care regime to go with it. I recommed this to anyone who wants to have a clear complexion!</li>
            <li> 4 out of the 5 people that have left 5 star reviews are people that have only commented on this one product. Whenever I see this, I get suspicioius.  This supplement is also very hard to find objective information about online. If you&#x27;re thinking about using this product, do some more research before you buy it.</li>
            <li> I have been taking Pantothen for 1 month and have noticed significant results.  My skin feels a lot more drier than it was before. I still have some oily skin around  my forehead, but not as much as before. It cleared up my cystic acne on my back and  chest and some on my neck and face. I will continue to use it for a few more months to  see even better results. I highly recommend this to people suffering from acne.  For many years I tried accutane and antiobiotics with little results. This truly is the  best product to try.</li>
            <li> this supplement work really good on me. i have hormonal acne here and there during the month and getting more toward my period.but since i have taken this supplement my acne is significantly less than before.My first bottle&#x27;s  almost empty so i definitely order the second bottle soon.</li>
            <li> Ok, so this is the second month me taking this Pantothen, I have noticed improvement in my skin, less breakouts after about three weeks of taking it consistently, even helped with my keratosis pilaris. I do wish it worked faster but since everybody is different I will keep taking it and see if there is anymore progress. I keep a schedule when I take it, because you have to take it four times a day, which can be annoying, especially when you forget to take one at some point; and I do wish the price was lower, pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> Because I suffer from adult acne, I did some research online.  I found Pantothen.  Then I found out that it slows the production of oil in your skin NATURALLY.  This is what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  It&#x27;s natural and there are no side effects, and in my case I noticed a difference within one week.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I have been looking high and low to find the ingredients used in this product online but&lt;br /&gt;cannot find anything. I am very suspicious.&lt;br /&gt;If i am going to put this in my body I want to see a list of ingredients&lt;br /&gt;there is not even non on their website, probably dangeroous stuff in it&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x60;t think I am going to buy it</li>
            <li> I  was researching natural supplements which addressed problem skin with ongoing outbreaks of acne.  I am happy to report after using Pantothen for several weeks I noticed clearer skin with no further outbreaks. After I stopped using it I began having outbreaks again. There&#x27;s no question in my mind that this product successfully addressed my acne problem and did what it said it could do. My experiment proved that this is the product for me.  I will continue to use Pantothen.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy to submit my review on Pantothen. I bought this product while seeking an alternative for Accutane. As a result of recurring acne on my face and shoulders my dermatologist wanted to prescribe me Accutane. I was aware of all the side-effects it has and therefore I decided to give my last fight. I told my Dr. that I am going to try a product I found online called Pantothen. He looked it up online and wished his best luck to me....   I am 28 years old today, I have had acne since I was 15 and I tried EVERYTHING, and I when I say everything, I mean it! I tried Benzoyl Peroxide Treatments, AHA peels, Oxy, Clean &amp; Clear, Pro Active etc, etc..  I have tried natural remedies such as Baking Soda, Lemon Juice (applied on face), Egg white/aspirin Masks etc.. you name it.. and I tried it - Nothing helped for the long run, I tried changing my diet and that didn&#x27;t help, some of the methods I tried made my acne even worse.  I have been struggling with my acne for 13 years. And I am honestly proud to say that Pantothen has put my acne breakouts under control. I am completely breakout free! I have been using Pantothen for over 2.5 months and most of my acne is cleared out and I can feel and see that the rest of my acne is clearly drying out. I feel beautiful, and I have such pretty skin!!! so glad to have found this product!!!  Thank God I didn&#x27;t start taking Accutane!! I can&#x27;t compliment enough on this miracle cure! This is a blessing to all acne sufferers!   I will definitely spread out the word! Pantothen ROCKS!!!</li>
            <li> I finished the whole bottle of this product with no results. This product is to be taken 4 times a day. I think it is too expensive. Without a good skin care routine, this product will not be helpful. I am still looking for a good skin care routine. Hope people had better luck with this product than me.</li>
            <li> First time I had them, it took me 3 days to get rid of aches painful acne that I had... totally going to buy them again sometime soon.</li>
            <li> So far so good, haven&#x27;t taken it long enough.. But i think it is working, will continue taking it for a while.</li>
            <li> I used this stuff just as it directed and 3 weeks later I have noticed no change in my acne condition. If anything it&#x27;s worse. Save your money, this stuff don&#x27;t work. My next step is just to go see a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> This product might work wonders on other customers but it didn&#x27;t do anything for me. Oh, well. It just wasn&#x27;t meant to be.</li>
            <li> Tried it for 6 months with little effect. Returned 5 unopened bottles, all within warranty limit. Never got any money back. Been writing them 4 emails since, which have all been ignored. Can definitely not recommend anyone buying from these guys. Im doing accutane/isotretinoin now, which is much better.</li>
            <li> so, this may or may not work. But, the bottle is full of big horse pills that cannot be swallowed.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product. But didn&#x27;t clear my skin up as good as I&#x27;d hoped.  I have severe breakouts on my back and chest. I&#x27;ve tried this for a month and probably cleared up my acne by about 50%. I won&#x27;t be buying any more but moving onto another product to try.. Major issue with this product is taking these large pills 4 times a day and it only helped my skin a little bit. If this has helped others, great! It didn&#x27;t really help me enough to stick with it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this product, didn&#x27;t do anything at all best go to a doctor to find a better solution than this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and got no results from it . It breaks u put at first but thats it . No results afther finishing the bottle</li>
            <li> My son has been using it less than a week and I am not sure how well it&#x27;s working because you have to take 4 pills and my son has been VERY inconsistent with taking ALL 4 pills on a daily basis. Good part is that he doesn&#x27;t have dryness or redness of the face, like when using other acne medicine. He is also using Zinc for Acne by Good &#x27;N Natural, but those are taken at night before bed. Zinc is a good sleep aid so that&#x27;s the reason why he takes those at night. I think the combo will work well together. Gonna make another update to my review in a few more weeks. Pantothen is a bit pricey and taking 4 pills daily are the reasons why I didn&#x27;t 5 star it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Proactive, things that claim to be better than Proactive, and various different things with pretty much 0 results. Even things recommended by my dermatologist didn&#x27;t work. Then when I read how Pantothen worked I figured it made since and tried it out. Lo and behold- this crap does NOT work! I took before&amp;after pictures to prove it and even used the wash that came with it 2x a day instead of just daily. I understand that not all skin products work on everyone but there was absolutely ZERO change in my skin to the point that I&#x27;d have to call Pantothen a scam.</li>
            <li> Then again, maybe it was the new water softener we had installed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using Pantothen for one month (i.e., one entire bottle), nothing changed. I&#x27;m still a 38-year-old woman with cystic acne. --Side note: Haven&#x27;t I suffered enough? Is 25 years not long enough to be dealing with this? End side note --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the absolutely no visible improvement in my skin, I was also cursed with some unpleasant GI episodes, which I think are related to all that pantothenic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really starting to believe that the only cure for acne is Accutane. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this snake oil.</li>
            <li> I did not want to subject my daughter to the harshness of the alternative - has anyone read the side effects of Accutane?  This product naturally reduces the production of oil in the skin.  Works very effectively with no side effects.</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing. I took it as directed and I didn&#x27;t notice one difference in my skin. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moUD5DJFKJG8T]]hey guys, this is my testimonial for pantothen. i usually don&#x27;t make videos, but this one&#x27;s worth the hassle!</li>
            <li> I took pantothen four times a day, noticed no difference whatsoever. My skin felt as oily as ever and blackheads didn&#x27;t seem to know that i was trying to get rid of them. I wouldn&#x27;t doubt that this could work for other people, pantothenic acid is very good for you, if you do find that pantothen works for you then i would just buy bulk vitamin B5 as it&#x27;s the same thing and cheaper.</li>
            <li> Im almost finished my first bottle now and i find for the most part that it is WORKING. There is still some acne but they are much smaller. The second week of using it i had a pretty bad break out but the week before that it was extremely clear. Im guessing the second week was the &amp;#34;Its gets worse before better stage&amp;#34; because this week it is really clear again. I would recommend it for sure. Im also using a soda called FaceDoctor so maybe the combination helps. Good Luck !</li>
            <li> I read through the reviews for this product and it seems that for the people who said it doesn&#x27;t work, they weren&#x27;t using a good skin care routine anyway. I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been battling acne since as long as I can remember. I&#x27;m 21 now and am sick of it. I got this product because I was trying to find something that could help my acne from the inside, out. I think the pills are really big, and you are supposed to take 4 a day. So here&#x27;s my routine and how it works for me... (BTW, I have pretty oily skin)&lt;br /&gt;In the morning, I shower and then wash my face with Aveeno Clear Complexion foaming wash, and then use a drying spot treatment lotion. I put my makeup on, grab 2 of the Pantothen pills and my pill cutter, and head to work. At my lunch break, I cut the pills into quadrants and take them. They&#x27;re too big for me to just swallow as they are, so I have to cut them up. Then at night time, around 8:00, I take my makeup off, wash with the same 2 products I used in the morning and take 2 more Pantothen pills.&lt;br /&gt;Using this routine, I see really good results. My skin does get really dry and kind of flaky, but that is what I want to happen. When that starts happening, I use a moisturizer and that does me pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, if you&#x27;re going to use this product, you have to have a good, consistent skin care routine in place. I wouldn&#x27;t say this is a miracle drug for your skin or anything, because if you&#x27;re not taking care of your skin externally, this medication won&#x27;t work internally. But, if you&#x27;re doing a good job of keeping up with washing and everything, this should work for you.</li>
            <li> I will be 40 this year and since my early 20s have been battling acne.  I have tried all sorts of medication in the past including Retin-A, Proactive, over-the-counter meds, blu-light treatments and facials, without much success.  Some of them work for some time and the stop working.  Just before I tried Pantothen, I went to a spa place where they were charging me $1400 to do a package treatment of lasers to help cure it.  I balked, and good thing I did because I came across the product ad and tried it.  Within a couple of weeks, it cleared my cystic acne.  I kept using it and it&#x27;s a year now.  I still have an occasional small pimple or two when I over indulge on fatty food, but don&#x27;t have the pus and cysts like before.  I am also using Kojic acid cream at night so the years of brown pigmentation is almost gone.  People have actually commented on how good my skin have become.  I love Pantothen...it has freed me from years of misery with acne.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you having acne in your 40s is no joke... but I found this amazing product and it did wonders for my skin. I am a proactive solutions user love the product but for some reason my skin started to break out and I wasn&#x27;t sure what was going on with my skin. So I made an appt. to see the dermatologist and in the meantime while waiting for my appt. I ran across this miracle vitamin and to make a long story short I cancelled my appt. to see my dermatologist. My skin began to cure itself inside then out that&#x27;s what is different about this product it gives the body time to heal while more acne doesn&#x27;t form so that was amazing. Within about a week I noticed drastic results and about a month I was blemish free. .... LOVE Pantothen and who ever created it ... God bless you! :D</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the magic question.  I&#x27;m not sure that I know the answer.  I&#x27;ve used for 3 weeks and haven&#x27;t seen any results.  My excessively oily skin is due to PCOS and exessive testosterone.  I&#x27;m desperate to find a natural solution that works.  It is possible that I just need more time but I&#x27;m uncertain I want to invest again to find out.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne due to allergies &amp; use this product whenever I have an outbreak. It dries your skin from the inside &amp; I&#x27;ve noticed than when used with external acne treatments, speeds up the healing time. I&#x27;ve found if I use it daily (when no acne is present), that it dries my skin out too much. I only use it. When I notice my skin getting excessively oily I start taking Pantothen &amp; usually that&#x27;s all I need.</li>
            <li> Pantothen helped me a little im using my first bottle, so far good its controlling my acne as in i had no break outs. just need my scars out any idea? let me know please. other then that i&#x27;ve used 6pills a day works better</li>
            <li> Let me save you some time and frustration. Acne is caused by an imbalance in your system. My friend just introduced me to &amp;#34;food combining&amp;#34; and it has opened my eyes. The drug industry is always coming up with something they claim will work. In all honesty, it may work for some people but in my opinion, you don&#x27;t know that person&#x27;s eating habits. CHANGE YOUR DIET and cleanse your body from the &amp;#34;inside out&amp;#34;. DETOX and you won&#x27;t have trouble with acne anymore.</li>
            <li> We have been to the dermatologists several times to try and get control of the acne our daughter has been fighting. Not crazy about staying on antibiotic’s for long periods of time and next approach was to try accutane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did a little search on the internet and found this product, did a little research and read the revues.  We figured we didn’t have anything to lose so we took her off her prescriptions and started this over a month ago. The result is a beautiful complexion with hardly any pimples; she now has maybe one or two a week whereas before it was multiple outbreaks. Also throw in 2 different summer camps were the sleep, diet and other things tend to be ignored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with product!!!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. It got to me so fast and I was so excited. It was a great price. I highly recommend. It is making a big difference.</li>
            <li> Pantothen works very well for me. I had pimples in my back and shoulders.My skin was itchy. After 2 years with pantothen my skin is now soft and clear around my shoulders and back and it is not itchy. I didn&#x27;t have any side problems. A good skin care routine is very important and a good scrub and body lotion as well. Argan oil  body  lotion and gel are gret. They are natural and no parabeans. Our body system is diferent. It might work for some people or not for others.  I am an Esthetician and this is my experience with Pantothen.</li>
