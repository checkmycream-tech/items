            <li>This is great!  </li>
            <li>I am a happy consumer.</li>
            <li>the price was really great.</li>
            <li>name brand at great price when ordered as an &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Spinbrushes do a great job cleaning our teeth and stimulating our gums.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you change the head every couple of months to get the best performance.</li>
            <li>to have these available is a wonderful thing to add to an already great toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>The price on here is comparable and is always good quality.</li>
            <li>;... very pleased</li>
            <li>and I was worried that there would be a difference between spinbrush and spinbrush pro, but they still fit and work great.</li>
            <li>Turns out, I kind of like it.  </li>
            <li>A four pack would be even better but two pack is good</li>
            <li>I HAVE NICE PEARLY WHITES NOW</li>
            <li>Repeated replacements is why many stores do not carry the medium-more replacements, more sales, more profit!!</li>
            <li>Awesome cleaning power, just buy good batteries and snap the bottom of your spinbrush tight.</li>
            <li>and they have to be replaced more often.</li>
            <li>So, with both it covers more area.</li>
            <li>I like the Crest much better.</li>
            <li>We love our Spinbrushes, and these replacement heads extend the life of the Spinbrush, as the motor and body outlast the brush pieces themselves.  </li>
            <li>Yep, good buy, work well with my new spin brush; happy with the purchase and a very good buy as usual at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I change my toothbrush head every three months and since I travel about that often its really easy to remember.</li>
            <li>These replacement heads fit my model of Spinbrush, even though it wasn&#x27;t one of the listed models.</li>
            <li>these seem to fit the Arm and Hammer power toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Fit my toothbrush and worked as promised.  </li>
            <li>This was quick and easy.</li>
            <li>The brushes fit and are nice when new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d swear that the original version of these things had the lower brushes moving side to side like you are supposed to move the brush when brushing.  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and is as described.  </li>
            <li>Saved a dollar so it was worth waiting 5 days for.</li>
            <li>medium seems right for me</li>
            <li>have 2 right now because my oldest one died(but</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t replaced the head that&#x27;s on my spinbrush yet, but I really like the pro clean spinbrush.  </li>
            <li>With all the new electric toothbrushes out there it&#x27;s good to know that my old school electric toothbrush works just as good if not better than the new ones!</li>
            <li>great for your spinbrush, just don&#x27;t press so hard.</li>
            <li>It seems to work quicker and does a better job than a manual toothbrush or powered one with a smaller head.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted ty</li>
            <li>So this design is pretty crappy for an electric brush.</li>
            <li>Gift for my daughter and at this time she has not used them as of yet, so I really can give you a  positive rating.</li>
            <li>Works with spinbrush....and very well.</li>
            <li>It really cleans your teeth.  </li>
            <li>These refills are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Its as if the vibration of the brush just was too much and they wobble all around now.</li>
            <li>I bought the Medium Spinbrush replacement heads at Amazon because many stores only carry the Soft heads.</li>
            <li>lots of new Spin Brushes, but no replacement heads!  </li>
            <li>I was going to purchase a new Spinbrush when I discovered they&#x27;d started selling replacement heads!  </li>
            <li>The original set lasted for months, but these replacements came loose and they can&#x27;t be tightened.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty well, and my last cleaning at the dentist didn&#x27;t involve mine workers and blasting caps.  </li>
            <li>Replacement heads are more expensive than buying the original unit.  </li>
            <li>and I got soft.</li>
            <li>I suffered all this time with my old brush heads waiting for the replacement to arrive, even passing up buying it in Walmart.</li>
            <li>I was waiting the whole time for the replace that was never sent on a order they messed up and their only way of apologizing was to give me a coupon for 5% off.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I was at my small neighborhood supermarket, let me go to the super-duper-supermarket on the highway... same thing!  </li>
            <li>Not much to say really.</li>

            <li> The round brushes don&#x27;t really spin, they just oscillate back and forth a little.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Works with spinbrush....and very well.</li>
            <li> Often can&#x27;t find replacement heads in store where brushes sold.  This was quick and easy.</li>
            <li> So I get a coupon for a couple of dollars off an Arm &amp; Hammer Spinbrush and for about nine dollars, decide to buy one.  Turns out, I kind of like it.  Works pretty well, and my last cleaning at the dentist didn&#x27;t involve mine workers and blasting caps.  Come time to buy some replacements and what?.... lots of new Spin Brushes, but no replacement heads!  Okay, so I was at my small neighborhood supermarket, let me go to the super-duper-supermarket on the highway... same thing!  Drugstore?... same thing.  So after a lot of wasted time and gasoline, I bought a bunch here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t replaced the head that&#x27;s on my spinbrush yet, but I really like the pro clean spinbrush.  I think I take a lil longer brushing my teeth and the vibration helps relieve my clogged sinus.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads fit my model of Spinbrush, even though it wasn&#x27;t one of the listed models. I am a happy consumer.</li>
            <li> Not much to say really. The brushes fit and are nice when new. Makes the brush usable again. Convenient compared to making a trip to the store.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my spinbrush and I was worried that there would be a difference between spinbrush and spinbrush pro, but they still fit and work great.</li>
            <li> I bought the Medium Spinbrush replacement heads at Amazon because many stores only carry the Soft heads. The soft heads do not clean as well and they have to be replaced more often. Repeated replacements is why many stores do not carry the medium-more replacements, more sales, more profit!!</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are more expensive than buying the original unit.  Wish they were cheaper to buy in quantity, but they work well.</li>
            <li> I had a rechargeable toothbrush of a different brand that only had one small brush head that would spin. I decided on the Crest battery toothbrush because it had two heads. One moves up and down and the other spins. So, with both it covers more area. I like the Crest much better. It seems to work quicker and does a better job than a manual toothbrush or powered one with a smaller head. Just make sure you change the head every couple of months to get the best performance.</li>
            <li> these seem to fit the Arm and Hammer power toothbrush. the double bristle motion cleans teeth quite well. Thank you</li>
            <li> Yep, good buy, work well with my new spin brush; happy with the purchase and a very good buy as usual at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I purchase these online so I always have them and that way I don&#x27;t worry about running out. I like that its a two pack and the price was really great. I change my toothbrush head every three months and since I travel about that often its really easy to remember. A four pack would be even better but two pack is good and I can always order 2 of them and I am covered for the year.</li>
            <li> name brand at great price when ordered as an &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34;... very pleased</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted ty</li>
            <li> We love our Spinbrushes, and these replacement heads extend the life of the Spinbrush, as the motor and body outlast the brush pieces themselves.  Spinbrushes do a great job cleaning our teeth and stimulating our gums.</li>
            <li> Gift for my daughter and at this time she has not used them as of yet, so I really can give you a  positive rating.</li>
            <li> great for your spinbrush, just don&#x27;t press so hard. Awesome cleaning power, just buy good batteries and snap the bottom of your spinbrush tight.</li>
            <li> medium seems right for me</li>
            <li> THEY WORK  I HAVE NICE PEARLY WHITES NOW</li>
            <li> I ordered the medium heads and I got soft. When I contacted the company they promised to replace my heads with the medium. I suffered all this time with my old brush heads waiting for the replacement to arrive, even passing up buying it in Walmart. When I checked my email to find out what happened they tell me they returned my money and gave me a coupon for 5% off my next purchase. I was waiting the whole time for the replace that was never sent on a order they messed up and their only way of apologizing was to give me a coupon for 5% off. Don&#x27;t waste your time buying this online. It&#x27;s not worth the mistakes and wait.</li>
            <li> I have used the Spinbrush for years.  It really cleans your teeth.  These refills are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> With all the new electric toothbrushes out there it&#x27;s good to know that my old school electric toothbrush works just as good if not better than the new ones!</li>
            <li> I was going to purchase a new Spinbrush when I discovered they&#x27;d started selling replacement heads!  This is great!  For the price of a toothbrush you get two heads for an electric toothbrush.  The spinbrush works so well anyway to have these available is a wonderful thing to add to an already great toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;For the money you can&#x27;t beat the Spinbrush and it&#x27;s replacement head.  You can have tons of these without having to shell out a ton of money.&lt;br /&gt;I have 2 right now because my oldest one died(but it lasted quite a while, over 2 years.)&lt;br /&gt;LOVE The brushes and now the replacement heads!</li>
            <li> Fit my toothbrush and worked as promised.  No problems.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find the medium bristles in the store.  It arrived quickly and is as described.  I will purchase again when the times comes to replace these.</li>
            <li> The round brushes don&#x27;t really spin, they just oscillate back and forth a little.  The lower brushes move up and down in the long direction of the head.  I&#x27;d swear that the original version of these things had the lower brushes moving side to side like you are supposed to move the brush when brushing.  Because of the way it moves up and down lengthwise instead of crosswise it&#x27;s not moving how it should to properly brush your teeth. Your teeth are supposed to be brushed up and down, not back and forth. So this design is pretty crappy for an electric brush.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t hold up.  The original set lasted for months, but these replacements came loose and they can&#x27;t be tightened.  Its as if the vibration of the brush just was too much and they wobble all around now.</li>
            <li> For some reason I cannot find the medium heads in the store. The price on here is comparable and is always good quality.</li>
            <li> I bought these replacement heads because I was having a hard time finding them around our area and this works!!!</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are the Same as in the store.  Saved a dollar so it was worth waiting 5 days for.</li>
