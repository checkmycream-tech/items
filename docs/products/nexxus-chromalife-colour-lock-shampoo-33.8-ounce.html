            <li>I absolutely LOVE this shampoo by Nexxus!!!!</li>
            <li>Also, my product arrived in perfect condition and was not at all damaged which always makes me happy!</li>
            <li>I always order this shampoo online because of the great price, size, and convenience.</li>
            <li>This is a great value, about 1/3 to 1/2 lower than at the salon.</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>Good item for your hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sulfate free, prolongs the life of my colored hair, keeps my hair healthy, manageable &amp; hydrated, AND it smells amazing!!!</li>
            <li>and it smells AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>What great customer service and friendly people.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is also highly recommended, and it smells great too!</li>
            <li>Also, I use this shampoo in conjunction with the Chromalife conditioner, the colour lock mask, and the colour lock treatment spray which, all together, make my hair extremely vibrant and healthy!!! :)</li>
            <li>I love the way this shampoo smells and feels.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>it is one of my favorite shampoos.</li>
            <li>Phyto Organics is Nexxus &amp;#34;original formula&amp;#34; I have used for so many years.</li>
            <li>With that being said, I LOVE THIS line</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite shampoos.</li>
            <li>Shampoo smells and looks OK</li>
            <li>AND I like the handy pump feature on top of it as well (since it makes it easier to dispense just the right amount of shampoo that I need!).</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizing gental sulfate free shampoo</li>
            <li>It is natural smells great and doesn&#x27;t strip your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that other prices can range from $30 to even $40 or more!!!</li>
            <li>purchased for mother, she has used this product for several years and a great purchase from Aamazon</li>
            <li>Very gentle love it but wished it was cheaper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many other shampoos for colored hair and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shampoo but nothing special and would not buy it again.</li>
            <li>I love it so much, that I purchase this product a lot on here.  </li>
            <li>Gave as a gift, difficult to find in salons, great product, very satisfied</li>
            <li>It came in super fast time.</li>
            <li>Product exactly what I wanted and arrived in a timely manner.  </li>
            <li>Plus, I REALLY like the bottle itself too!</li>
            <li>Anyways, I told the seller the problem and they sent me a new one right away, no cost!</li>
            <li>It left my fine hair feeling gummy.  </li>
            <li>Just an overall GREAT everyday shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I expected much more.  </li>
            <li>The price on this did seem a little steep at first, upon first glance, but when you factor in the large quantity of shampoo you&#x27;re getting PLUS the fact that pretty much anywhere else that has this in stock is selling it for a MUCH higher price!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this conditioner AND the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Left my fine hair gummy also- kinda gross.  </li>
            <li>It is very thick and creamy and leaves good texture in my very fine but thick hair.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive scalp and I can always tell when I use another shampoo.</li>
            <li>Finally, I am SO thankful that CostSell is selling this particular bottle of Chromalife shampoo because they delivered it to me in just 4-5 days instead of a week or two!</li>
            <li>Your hair color will last much longer.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the big, jumbo liter size (which before I&#x27;ve only ever seen the hair stylists use in hair salons and wasn&#x27;t really available to the public- until now that is!)</li>
            <li>This was probably the third or fourth time that I&#x27;ve ordered it, and the first time it came damaged.</li>
            <li>First the box arrived wet on the bottom - the bottle leaked.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my opinion that sulfate free shampoos take a little extra effort.  </li>
            <li>It is literally THE complete package of everything you could possibly want in a hair care product!</li>

            <li> I love the way this shampoo smells and feels.  It is very thick and creamy and leaves good texture in my very fine but thick hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My hairdresser began to use this on me years ago.  I love it so much, that I purchase this product a lot on here.  The conditioner is also highly recommended, and it smells great too!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizing gental sulfate free shampoo it is one of my favorite shampoos. It is natural smells great and doesn&#x27;t strip your hair.</li>
            <li> I always order this shampoo online because of the great price, size, and convenience. This was probably the third or fourth time that I&#x27;ve ordered it, and the first time it came damaged. It must of busted open somehow during shipping; it was leaking all over the package. Anyways, I told the seller the problem and they sent me a new one right away, no cost! What great customer service and friendly people. Thank you, I appreciate it, and I&#x27;ll order again in a few months!</li>
            <li> If you color your hair you need to use this product. Your hair color will last much longer. Shampoos that are NOT made this way will shorten the life of your color. Also tried chroma lock hair conditioner it will help maintain your hair and color.</li>
            <li> To make a long story short...I stopped buying Nexxus when they changed the formula so they could sell to a larger market. Phyto Organics is Nexxus &amp;#34;original formula&amp;#34; I have used for so many years. With that being said, I LOVE THIS line and it smells AMAZING.  Just an overall GREAT everyday shampoo and conditioner.  I especially like the shampoo as it removes buildup. It&#x27;s my opinion that sulfate free shampoos take a little extra effort.  My tip is to shampoo twice to get the lather going.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite shampoos. I have a very sensitive scalp and I can always tell when I use another shampoo. Does not leave my head itchy. Very gentle love it but wished it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> Left my fine hair gummy also- kinda gross.  A big waste of money.  Bottle arrived leaking.  Shampoo smells and looks OK</li>
            <li> This product extends the time between hair colorings.  I&#x27;ve used many other shampoos for colored hair and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the best for color-treated hair.  My hair dresser recommended it.  It came in super fast time.</li>
            <li> Product exactly what I wanted and arrived in a timely manner.  Will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> purchased for mother, she has used this product for several years and a great purchase from Aamazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Chromalife products exclusively for several years because my stylist recommended it. My highlighted/colored hair is in excellent condition and I don&#x27;t have a fading problem despite living in Florida. Highly recommend this conditioner AND the shampoo. This is a great value, about 1/3 to 1/2 lower than at the salon.</li>
            <li> Works as promised. Smells good. Makes your hair soft.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this shampoo by Nexxus!!!! It is literally THE complete package of everything you could possibly want in a hair care product!
