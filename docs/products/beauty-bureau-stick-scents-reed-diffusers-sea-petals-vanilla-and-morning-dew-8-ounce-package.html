    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using the Beauty Bureau Stick Scents for over a year and have been very impressed by them.</li>
            <li>Great buy!</li>
            <li>The price of these during the deal was excellent.  </li>
            <li>These are wonderful home freshners.</li>
            <li>I think they are wonderful and will stick with Beauty Bureau.</li>
            <li>so they are perfect!  </li>
            <li>My wife is very happy with our purchase.</li>
            <li>The vanilla to me smells the best, but it&#x27;s also the weakest.</li>
            <li>I find the scents pleasant, and especially liked the \\&quot;Candy Cane\\&quot; from the Christmas pack.  </li>
            <li>The variety of scents are great and the glass holder is beautiful for display in any home.  </li>
            <li>This pack of 3 is a GREAT deal.</li>
            <li>These are so great I am giving them as gifts at my wedding.</li>
            <li>this was a great buy.  </li>
            <li>I put it in a two room apartment we have and it has added a very nice scent to the 550 sq.</li>
            <li>I say good news, because they don&#x27;t smell very nice.</li>
            <li>We have the sea petals in the bathroom and it works just as good.</li>
            <li>Not my idea of a good product or one that I would recommend to anyone else.  </li>
            <li>Bought for my wife and she loved them.</li>
            <li>This product is good for its price.  </li>
            <li>I love to walk into a great smelling house.</li>
            <li>I loved the scent and it filled the air beautifully.</li>
            <li>These are very nice and HUGE!  </li>
            <li>I would have liked a bit stronger sent.</li>
            <li>Sea Petals is a bit more assertive, but in a good way.  </li>
            <li>The ones from Pier One are definately far and away the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these to anyone and would easily compare to Yankee!</li>
            <li>They arrived in good condition, look pretty, and scent the room effectively.  </li>
            <li>each is very pleasant and just brings a general brightness to each room we have them in.</li>
            <li>The scent is not overpowering like so many others on the market and</li>
            <li>I wished I would of ordered more than one to give as gifts.  </li>
            <li>and I am really pleased in how well they work.  </li>
            <li>As for length of time - I find I don&#x27;t HAVE to flip them every week in order to still be able to smell them.</li>
            <li>The smaller size works perfectly for a bathroom or guest bedroom.  </li>
            <li>Ended up ordering more just to keep around for gifts for those \\&quot;whoops, I forgot it was her birthday\\&quot; occasions.  </li>
            <li>The main reason I bought these was because of all the great reveiws I read.</li>
            <li>The scent level is just right!!  </li>
            <li>Easy to flip the stixs over to refresh the scent.</li>
            <li>They are strong but not too strong.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather spend $35 for one diffuser that nicely scents a large room than $45 for three diffusers that don&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product, the Amazon cost is also a great value for 3 scents.  </li>
            <li>Another great plus -- these things last forever!  </li>
            <li>The price for a 3 pack is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Of course after I realized how much I loved them, I bought more for just about every other room.  </li>
            <li>I purchased these diffusers as a 3 for $25 special.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be returning them, good deal or not.  </li>
            <li>and it still has a mild scent.</li>
            <li>It evaporated quickly.</li>
            <li>Hope you enjoy them as much as I have!</li>
            <li>I have bought several Stick Scent sets and love them!  </li>
            <li>You can give all three as a set or separately because they are individually packed in their own box.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m more sensitive than some.  </li>
            <li>, as we refer to them now, I smile came across my face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice because each room can have a different scent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice the way this comes packed because you can give them as individual gifts too.</li>
            <li>Also, I DID contact customer service and was informed that because of the original demand on these they didn&#x27;t even have any left to be able to ship me a replacement, so I had no choice but to return it.  </li>
            <li>These are quietly effective and we used each scent in a different area of the house.. really does help keep things fresher during the air conditioning months!</li>
            <li>The three different scents are wonderful and have long lasting strong scents.  </li>
            <li>MAINLY because it took over two months for them to even be shipped to me when I was originally told 3 to 5 days (</li>
            <li>These are a good deal for the money at $15 per diffuser, which is less than they sell for in stores.  </li>
            <li>very much like the Sea Petal.  </li>
            <li>and at first I thought here</li>
            <li>But within the first week, I noticed everytime</li>
            <li>I have had several brands of reed diffusers and these are my favorite.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted about 3 1/2 months not 9 or so like some of the others stated.  </li>
            <li>My first purchase was an Archipelago  diffuser in Pineapple Ginger.</li>
            <li>I got so many of these for me and gifts, and all the unopened ones are going back.</li>
            <li>At $45 for three the price was more reasonable, even if it too lasted for only two months.</li>
            <li>Smell good, but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>And I have 2 of the large bottles in my combined kitchen/living room.      </li>
            <li>My fave is the Morning Dew, which is just a nice, clean, subtle scent.  </li>
            <li>The names of the scents sound great, but they all smell similar and they are not pleasant.</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed with the product.</li>
            <li>They do not have much of a smell to them.</li>
            <li>I really dont like the types that are overpowering</li>
            <li>I bought these because I had purchased another brand of reed diffusers before and really like the way they scented the room.  </li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers I purchased these during a gold box deal after reading all the glowing reviews.  </li>
            <li>Nice, not overwhelming, background scent.</li>
            <li>Beauty Bureau&#x27;s are all natural so the scent really brings you \\&quot;there\\&quot;    </li>
            <li>I like the scent, but you can only smell it if you put your nose right up to it.</li>
            <li>I got my first stick scents as a gift about a year ago (big bottle), and it just now ran out!</li>
            <li>It is floral and crisp at the same time.  </li>
            <li>and I was really excited to finally receive them weeks later.    </li>
            <li>The Sea Petal is in another small bathroom, and although you can smell it better than the Vanilla  </li>
            <li>With the free shipping, I could not turn them down.  </li>
            <li>the fragrence is so mild that it is undetectable when intering the room, even with the door closed.</li>
            <li>I got near \\&quot;the sticks\\&quot;</li>
            <li>A very nice, yet subtle fragrance that last a long time.</li>
            <li>They really do capture  the essence of certain scents naturally, without an overpowering chemical overtone that exists in other similar products.  </li>
            <li>The scent is barely on the reeds when I smelled them directly.  </li>
            <li>my rooms are large open floor plan, but I have to be standing almost next to it to smell the fragrance.</li>
            <li>These read diffusers are much higher quality than any other I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps my sense of smell has diminished with age, but I could barely smell these.  </li>
            <li>It came in a box that shipped directly from the manufacturer, so possibly Amazon did not even know.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands in the past, but the scents were often completely overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>The Morning Dew is in a large master bath and it is barely noticeable unless the room has been closed up for awhile, in which case you can smell it just enough to know that something is there.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that you turn the reeds upside down every week, as recommended.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend that you turn the reeds upside down every week, as recommended.</li>
            <li> I appreciate blunt reviews by other shoppers on amazon, so someone criticizing me for being honest -- that&#x27;s just wrong.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed as the initial reviews were good, and I and many people bought these based on those reviews which were misleading, and false.</li>
            <li> I guess there was a reason these were so marked down!</li>
            <li> absolutely no scent whatsoever and to think I got a second set as a gift...</li>
            <li> It may be easy to find replacement reeds in big cities, but in a rural setting like mine - impossible.</li>
            <li> reed diffusers for less even at Wallyworld, and especially not of the quality</li>
            <li> Only complaint is they didn&#x27;t last nearly as long as some of the reviews stated.  </li>
            <li> This is a great concept, but I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been using these reed diffusers for a few years; they are long lasting and the scent is not over powering like other brands.  </li>
            <li> My only negative with that product was that it only lasted about two months, which made it quite pricey in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The Morning Dew smells unpleasant and harsh, and the Sea Petal doesn&#x27;t smell much better.</li>
            <li> Should be absolutely NO STARS!</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, unless your nose is within inches of the sticks, there is no smell whatsovever.  </li>
            <li> these are so weak you can hardly smell them, and the good news is these are so weak you can hardly smell them.</li>
            <li> They are not worth buying.    </li>
            <li> Not worth the wait nor the anticipation.    </li>
            <li> I have purchased many different diffusers in the past and these were the worst.  </li>
            <li> Mine all arrived intact after a somewhat frustrating wait, though the vanilla was in a different type of packaging.  </li>
            <li> My wife had placed these in a few places throughout the house (i.e. bathrooms, bannister ..)</li>
            <li> One of the tops that the reeds rest on was missing from the packageing.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to go searching for replacements for the missing reeds.  </li>
            <li> something like that), and then the &#x27;set&#x27; looked tacky and was missing parts.  </li>
            <li> These sticks were the biggest, biggest waste of money....</li>
            <li> We have small bathrooms and boys</li>
            <li> I put a diffuser in my small bathroom, bedroom and kitchen</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t even smell up a small bathroom.  </li>
            <li> The Vanilla Bean is in a small guest bath</li>
            <li> All in all I am pretty disappointed in this purchase.</li>

            <li> We&#x27;ve been using the Beauty Bureau Stick Scents for over a year and have been very impressed by them. The scent is not overpowering like so many others on the market and each is very pleasant and just brings a general brightness to each room we have them in. I recommend these to anyone who likes the smell of the outdoors inside!</li>
            <li> I purchased this a Deal of the Day for $25.00.  I wished I would of ordered more than one to give as gifts.  You can give all three as a set or separately because they are individually packed in their own box.  The three different scents are wonderful and have long lasting strong scents.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> I received these reed diffusers as a present. I was very dissapointed with the product. They do not have much of a smell to them. I would not recommend this product. They are not worth buying.    Kathy</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased these.  I snapped them up during a Deal of the Day.  Mine all arrived intact after a somewhat frustrating wait, though the vanilla was in a different type of packaging.  I&#x27;ve put out two of them already and find them subtle but nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I very much like the Sea Petal.  I put it in a two room apartment we have and it has added a very nice scent to the 550 sq. feet space.  I have flipped the reeds and moved it around a couple times.  I&#x27;ve had one bottle in my living room since January and it still has a mild scent. I guess if one is expecting overpowering scent, this is not the product for them.  I prefer reed diffusers because they don&#x27;t add the smoke and fire dangers of candles but do provide a welcoming scent when you come into the house or room.  Maybe I&#x27;m more sensitive than some.  I find the scents pleasant, and especially liked the \\&quot;Candy Cane\\&quot; from the Christmas pack.  The price of these during the deal was excellent.  I couldn&#x27;t find 8 oz. reed diffusers for less even at Wallyworld, and especially not of the quality I feel these are.</li>
            <li> my favourite is the vanilla bean and it gives my living room just enough fragrance when I come it.  I really dont like the types that are overpowering and I can smell it 24-7; as well as giving me a headache.  neither of these fragrance do that and I am really pleased in how well they work.  We have the sea petals in the bathroom and it works just as good. I highly recommend that you turn the reeds upside down every week, as recommended.</li>
            <li> These read diffusers are much higher quality than any other I have tried.  The variety of scents are great and the glass holder is beautiful for display in any home.  I have been using these reed diffusers for a few years; they are long lasting and the scent is not over powering like other brands.  I definitely recommend this product, the Amazon cost is also a great value for 3 scents.  Hope you enjoy them as much as I have!</li>
            <li> My wife had placed these in a few places throughout the house (i.e. bathrooms, bannister ..) and at first I thought here she goes again.  But within the first week, I noticed everytime I got near \\&quot;the sticks\\&quot;, as we refer to them now, I smile came across my face.  They really do capture  the essence of certain scents naturally, without an overpowering chemical overtone that exists in other similar products.  Would definitely recomend to all (especially if kids are in the house!).</li>
            <li> the fragrence is so mild that it is undetectable when intering the room, even with the door closed. I would have liked a bit stronger sent. One of the tops that the reeds rest on was missing from the packageing.I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful home freshners. Easy to flip the stixs over to refresh the scent. I have allergies and these dont aggravate them . Spray can air freshners irritate my allergies. These are quietly effective and we used each scent in a different area of the house.. really does help keep things fresher during the air conditioning months!</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers I purchased these during a gold box deal after reading all the glowing reviews.  That was a couple months ago.  They finally arrived today and upon opening them I found that the Morning Dew and Sea Petal were just like the picture, but the Vanilla Bean was in different packaging and did not include any reeds.  I am NOT happy.  I had purchased the set to give as a gift, but they don&#x27;t look like a set and I don&#x27;t want to go searching for replacements for the missing reeds.  I will definitely be returning them, good deal or not.  Not worth the wait nor the anticipation.    ****Update - just to be clear, I gave this a bad review MAINLY because it took over two months for them to even be shipped to me when I was originally told 3 to 5 days (something like that), and then the &#x27;set&#x27; looked tacky and was missing parts.  Not my idea of a good product or one that I would recommend to anyone else.  I appreciate blunt reviews by other shoppers on amazon, so someone criticizing me for being honest -- that&#x27;s just wrong.  I understand this is a product review and not a service review, but where else do I warn other shoppers of these crazy delays?  Also, I DID contact customer service and was informed that because of the original demand on these they didn&#x27;t even have any left to be able to ship me a replacement, so I had no choice but to return it.  It may be easy to find replacement reeds in big cities, but in a rural setting like mine - impossible.</li>
            <li> I have had several brands of reed diffusers and these are my favorite. I have them all over my house. It&#x27;s nice because each room can have a different scent but you can&#x27;t smell them outside of the room you are in. Air freshners are not supposed to smack you in the face when you walk in. The scent level is just right!!  They have a creme brule one that is sooo yummy! This pack of 3 is a GREAT deal. It&#x27;s nice the way this comes packed because you can give them as individual gifts too. As for length of time - I find I don&#x27;t HAVE to flip them every week in order to still be able to smell them. I think they are wonderful and will stick with Beauty Bureau.</li>
            <li> These stick scents are totally FAB!!!  I&#x27;ve tried other brands in the past, but the scents were often completely overwhelming.  These are just fragrant enough, and don&#x27;t overpower.  I have different scents in several different rooms, and the scents don&#x27;t mix at all.  You do need to turn the sticks over about once a week to keep the fragrance coming through.    Also, I&#x27;ve found other brands to be fake, like you can almost smell the chemicals.  Beauty Bureau&#x27;s are all natural so the scent really brings you \\&quot;there\\&quot;    Another great plus -- these things last forever!  I got my first stick scents as a gift about a year ago (big bottle), and it just now ran out! Of course after I realized how much I loved them, I bought more for just about every other room.  The smaller size works perfectly for a bathroom or guest bedroom.  And I have 2 of the large bottles in my combined kitchen/living room.      Bottom line -- These sticks rock!</li>
            <li> I have bought several Stick Scent sets and love them!  I put them in all the rooms in my house, especially the bathrooms.  We have small bathrooms and boys so they are perfect!  These are so great I am giving them as gifts at my wedding.</li>
            <li> These are very nice and HUGE!  The price for a 3 pack is fantastic.  Only complaint is they didn&#x27;t last nearly as long as some of the reviews stated.  My first one lasted about 3 1/2 months not 9 or so like some of the others stated.  Perhaps they had theirs in a low air flow area.  They are strong but not too strong.  I would recommend these to anyone and would easily compare to Yankee!</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife and she loved them. Ended up ordering more just to keep around for gifts for those \\&quot;whoops, I forgot it was her birthday\\&quot; occasions.  Nice, not overwhelming, background scent. If you&#x27;re a guy looking for a gift, you can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
            <li> These are a good deal for the money at $15 per diffuser, which is less than they sell for in stores.  With the free shipping, I could not turn them down.  They arrived in good condition, look pretty, and scent the room effectively.  My fave is the Morning Dew, which is just a nice, clean, subtle scent.  Sea Petals is a bit more assertive, but in a good way.  It is floral and crisp at the same time.  I am going to give the Vanilla Bean as a Christmas present to a friend who loves the scent of vanilla.</li>
            <li> I bought these because it was a gold box deal plus another $7.50 off with promo code. The main reason I bought these was because of all the great reveiws I read. However, I totally disagree. In my opinion these diffusers have no smell at all. I&#x27;m a big fan of candles, oils and diffusers. I love to walk into a great smelling house. I put a diffuser in my small bathroom, bedroom and kitchen and I can&#x27;t smell a thing. Unless I just got a bad batch or they were on the shelf too long, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these.</li>
            <li> This is a great concept, but I am very disappointed. The names of the scents sound great, but they all smell similar and they are not pleasant.</li>
            <li> this was a great buy.  I saw them at 3 times the amount and they are the very same thing</li>
            <li> I purchased these diffusers as a 3 for $25 special.  They were back ordered and I was really excited to finally receive them weeks later.    Well I am VERY disappointed.  They don&#x27;t even smell up a small bathroom.  The scent is barely on the reeds when I smelled them directly.  Even letting the reeds soak in the oil and flipping them over doesn&#x27;t help.  I will NEVER purchase these again and would never recommend them.    I have purchased many different diffusers in the past and these were the worst.  The ones from Pier One are definately far and away the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> A very nice, yet subtle fragrance that last a long time. I&#x27;d like a stronger scent, but not over powering. My wife is very happy with our purchase. Mike</li>
            <li> These sticks were the biggest, biggest waste of money....absolutely no scent whatsoever and to think I got a second set as a gift...I am so embarrassed.  Never again would I think of ordering from this company.  Should be absolutely NO STARS!</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with this purchase. Perhaps my sense of smell has diminished with age, but I could barely smell these.  I have moved them from different parts of the room, but nada.  Granted my rooms are large open floor plan, but I have to be standing almost next to it to smell the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I had purchased another brand of reed diffusers before and really like the way they scented the room.  NOT these!  As other reviewers have stated, unless your nose is within inches of the sticks, there is no smell whatsovever.  If it wouldn&#x27;t have been such a hassle to ship these back, I would have done so in a minute.  Try another brand, but NOT these.  They are worthless.</li>
            <li> This product is good for its price.  Smell good, but doesn&#x27;t last long. It evaporated quickly.</li>
            <li> This is only my second purchase of reed diffusers. My first purchase was an Archipelago  diffuser in Pineapple Ginger. I loved the scent and it filled the air beautifully. My only negative with that product was that it only lasted about two months, which made it quite pricey in my opinion. This time I decided to try the Beauty Bureau Scents, 1 each of 8-Ounce Morning Dew, Sea Petal and Vanilla Bean. At $45 for three the price was more reasonable, even if it too lasted for only two months. I have had them for several days now and have put each in different bathrooms. The Vanilla Bean is in a small guest bath and I&#x27;m the only one that seems to know it&#x27;s in there. I like the scent, but you can only smell it if you put your nose right up to it. The Sea Petal is in another small bathroom, and although you can smell it better than the Vanilla  Bean it is still too subtle of a scent. The Morning Dew is in a large master bath and it is barely noticeable unless the room has been closed up for awhile, in which case you can smell it just enough to know that something is there. All in all I am pretty disappointed in this purchase. I guess that sometimes you get what you pay for and if I had to do over again I would purchase the Archipelago  diffuser  again. I&#x27;d rather spend $35 for one diffuser that nicely scents a large room than $45 for three diffusers that don&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
            <li> these are so weak you can hardly smell them, and the good news is these are so weak you can hardly smell them. I say good news, because they don&#x27;t smell very nice. The vanilla to me smells the best, but it&#x27;s also the weakest. I have it in a very small bathroom, and you can hardly smell it walking in. The Morning Dew smells unpleasant and harsh, and the Sea Petal doesn&#x27;t smell much better. The scents are one dimensional, and not very pleasant. I got so many of these for me and gifts, and all the unopened ones are going back. I guess there was a reason these were so marked down! I&#x27;m very disappointed as the initial reviews were good, and I and many people bought these based on those reviews which were misleading, and false.</li>
            <li> When I bought this, it was advertised as a set of three 8-ounce scents...but mine arrived as two 8-ounce scents and one 4-ounce [Vanilla Bean]. It came in a box that shipped directly from the manufacturer, so possibly Amazon did not even know. I have advised Amazon...so hopefully they will correct the item description.</li>
