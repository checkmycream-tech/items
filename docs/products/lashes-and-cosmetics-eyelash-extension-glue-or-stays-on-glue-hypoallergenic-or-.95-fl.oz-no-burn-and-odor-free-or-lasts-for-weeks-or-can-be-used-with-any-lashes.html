    <ol>
            <li>but once you learn how to work with it, it is great!</li>
            <li>my best friend told me about this</li>
            <li>The best way I can describe it is it&#x27;s like putting on mascara made of liquid rubber...</li>
            <li>It always makes your eyes look awesome!!</li>
            <li>So if your wife or girlfriend is having eyelash issues,this glue will take care of the problem...worked great for her!</li>
            <li>You will love this eyelash glue!!!</li>
            <li>I am sooooooooo amazed at how amazing it works!!</li>
            <li>so, buying this glue and applying your own lashes is a money saver!!</li>
            <li>My patients have been extremely happy as I have.  </li>
            <li>I was going to return it however, after more experimentation, I found its best to let this glue sit for a couple of minutes before use.</li>
            <li>I get better results from the cheapo Salon Perfect glue.</li>
            <li>You have a great product, but you need to put it in a better container!</li>
            <li>- Might be good for beginners since it takes the glue a while to set.  </li>
            <li>Wore for going clubbing and loved the results I got.</li>
            <li>You will have more repeat customers with this product!</li>
            <li>All your friends will definetely love it!</li>
            <li>It holds better and longer for a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not happy,it&#x27;s not permanent, if you are talking about permanently remove your own lashes</li>
            <li>I was so excited and intrigued when I saw it, in theory it&#x27;s a great idea.</li>
            <li>It also isn&#x27;t clumpy, and is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This glue is best by far.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best product ever!!</li>
            <li>I am also able to apply my own lashes without burning my eyes.  </li>
            <li>The application is easy and The packaging is cute, but you cannot WASH your face!</li>
            <li>My clients were vvery happy at first when there was no burn or irritation.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me she loved how it worked.</li>
            <li>Looks great on and if you don&#x27;t know what to get that hard to shop for person, this makes an excellent gift.</li>
            <li>glue is odorless and non-irritating (to me) unlike the adhesives used in most nail salons for eyelash applications.</li>
            <li>I am currently using Blink and LOVE it!!!!  </li>
            <li>This is ok, just reach out for help. :-)</li>
            <li>I love the ease of use and the longevity it provides.</li>
            <li>I made sure I followed the directions to the T.  </li>
            <li>My $6 Lash Duo glue holds much better than this one.</li>
            <li>best eyelash glue last 2 weeks</li>
            <li>Hi, I am the owner and operator of Lavender&#x27;s Lair a skin care spa in Port Orange and have been looking for a glue for MANY Years</li>
            <li>The glue that comes with the eyelashes is better..</li>
            <li>you will not regret it!!:)</li>
            <li>What I&#x27;ve found that what works best is the Andrea Perma-lash Individual Eyelash Adhesive.  </li>
            <li>That made her like me even more.</li>
            <li>I was expecting so much more.</li>
            <li>love the color of this product, but I feel like I was hoping it was more permanent.  </li>
            <li>and when I squeezed to push out more glue, the side of it cracked.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and the quick service provided.  </li>
            <li>Takes time to apply but worth the process!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to eyelash adhesives becoming tacky within a matter of seconds.</li>
            <li>hands down best lash glue i have ever used-stays put for weeks and doesnt itch like most glue.</li>
            <li>The company was super nice and sent me everything again with no hassle and even included some free samples.  </li>
            <li>i fell in love(: and realized that no other eye lash glues were as good as this one.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off buying 6 pairs of the throw away kind and putting a new pair on every night.</li>
            <li>In addition, if you are blond like me and have light lashes this product isn&#x27;t for you, unless you&#x27;re going for that made up look all the time.</li>
            <li>It is so light weight</li>
            <li>I figured the chances of the lashes staying on and actually looking good for 7 days was a stretch, but figured if I could even get a weekend out of them, I&#x27;d be happy - I barely got a night.</li>
            <li>Would work great for a special event, but not for regular use.</li>
            <li>Worth the effort!</li>
            <li>It works great and lasts a long time without any burning sensations to the eye.  </li>
            <li>I tried the black and it&#x27;s perfect to blend right in.  </li>
            <li>It takes a while to dry, which is great in my windy climate with no AC.</li>
            <li>but the glue is absolutely amazing so far.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t do a full set with one dollop.  </li>
            <li>Last for a good week but is kind of goey and takes more than 10 seconds to dry.</li>
            <li>With the first tube, it snapped off when the bottle was still 2/3 full!</li>
            <li>If you are lucky, it&lt;br /&gt;may</li>
            <li>Products dries too quickly on stone.</li>
            <li>It is a fine product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>My lashes were too intense looking even though my extensions were light brown.</li>
            <li>We still laugh about it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I like this product, and it&#x27;s better than everything else I&#x27;ve used thus far, but it could still use some improvement.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product due to the good reviews stating that it lasted for weeks even months.</li>
            <li>It set right away</li>
            <li>and right it was so embarassing.  </li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re absolutely right.</li>
            <li>Not a long lasting glue 10 hours would have been great and that was not what was happening.</li>
            <li>It was so much easier to use than this one since it set so quickly.  </li>
            <li>Read the great reviews and was so excited to try this product I have worn false lashes ( done by myself and profesionally) for years</li>
            <li>3 clients had to come back within 2 days to get redone with better glue.</li>
            <li>The creamy texture actually gives the eyes the eyeliner \\&quot;intense\\&quot; look - LOVE</li>
            <li>We followed the directions exactly...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely skeptical of the reviews saying this is the best glue they&#x27;ve ever tried...</li>
            <li>Ya just wanna wake up lookin&#x27; pretty.</li>
            <li>When I first ordered this product it got lost in the mail.  </li>
            <li>so I am very familiar with the different glues.</li>
            <li>The cheap soft plastic tip can&#x27;t withhold much squeezing and will snapped off.</li>
            <li>This glue is great I have used hair bonding glue, duo, and several other glues and no glue can compare.</li>
            <li>That means that I constantly have to reapply new ones, which is more often then when I go and get my eyelashes done.  </li>
            <li>Glue works very well.</li>
            <li>My wife really enjoys and uses this product.  </li>
            <li>and I offer this company a HIGH FIVE!</li>
            <li>just an absolute f&#x27;n disaster.</li>
            <li>and it really stays on no lashes falling off</li>
            <li>Too much to ask?</li>
            <li>If you follow the directions on this product your client ends up looking like someone who put on some really clumpy mascara.</li>
            <li>The false lashes looked great for 3 days then started to look frayed after 5 days.  </li>
            <li>She said it was easy to use and stayed on for a long time.</li>
            <li>This product barely lasts a day if your lucky.</li>
            <li>the new 2nd tube, I wrapped the tip with duct tape to secure it</li>
            <li>It definitely holds better than regular eyelash adhesive, but I feel like the lashes are ready to fall off after about 2 or 3 days.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>Do not use a clear adhesive because it will be super obvious that your lashes aren&#x27;t real.  </li>
            <li>Lashes looked very shiny and natural, no mascara needed.</li>
            <li>Overall I was OK with this product and will buy the clear version next time.</li>
            <li>Thinking it&#x27;s worth going back to salon to get my lashes done.</li>
            <li>With all the products out there this one really stands out &amp; above, you&#x27;ve won me over ;)</li>
            <li>The tweezers are the only thing worth keeping.</li>
            <li>I was happy with them the first day because I was going out and was wearing make-up, but the next day they looked fake on my face - all because of the glue.</li>
            <li>Globs up and creates a huge mess and tarantula eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Is there a certain range of steps I have to take to make this glue last longer?</li>
            <li>a professional</li>
            <li>remember, let it sit for a minute or two, and it&#x27;ll be ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;Ive uploaded a short vid to demonstrate the sturdiness of the eyelash adhesive.</li>
            <li>and so far I haven&#x27;t had any fall off yet</li>
            <li>Not for professional use.</li>
            <li>may work for at home use but not for professional salon use.  </li>
            <li>I had my friend, who&#x27;s a professional makeup artist, apply them.</li>
            <li>Well that gets old too.</li>
            <li>With this particular glue, by the next day, I&#x27;ll have some lashes already fall off.  </li>
            <li>Other products for less money work better</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way so, although the tube isnt large, you dont need a lot of glue to apply your lashes and considering the length of time your lashes stay on, its well worth the $45.</li>
            <li>but it dont burn and dry fast</li>
            <li>I got this product and tried it few times with my fake lashes and it does not work as good as they say it does, also once you open the tub the glue dries inside the tub fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used more than my fair share of lashes and glues and this was without a doubt the worst one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This eyelash glue is amazing!It stays on for a very long time and it is so easy to apply!This product, ulike other eyelash glues, actually works!</li>
            <li>That is a really long time to keep your hand steady.  </li>
            <li>The glue isn&#x27;t goopy or hard to do and it blends in very well with your eyelashes so that they look very real.</li>
            <li>The next day they also looked good, but then...The glue is not black, it&#x27;s actually blue/purple, which isn&#x27;t a problem when applied, because it&#x27;s looks black on lashes, BUT, after couple of days of wear and several showers, the glue becomes turquoise green and it puffs up like pop corn!  </li>
            <li>Also, I noticed that my eyes were itchy, not that they were irritated, but in general I had a desire to rub them, but couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>However, the next day the lashes were falling off in clumps!thier natural lashes were not with them</li>
            <li>It barely stays on for three to four days.</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:moX1YKSSTRX18L]]Ive been wearing false lashes (on and off) for more than 4 years.</li>
            <li>Decided to try out new glue for my salon and this glue last only one day vs my old glue last up to month for my clients.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little time to set up, but goes on easily and is very long lasting.</li>
            <li>first use with this glue was messy and aggravating.</li>

            <li> and it really stays on no lashes falling off</li>
            <li> Too much to ask?</li>
            <li> If you follow the directions on this product your client ends up looking like someone who put on some really clumpy mascara.</li>
            <li> The false lashes looked great for 3 days then started to look frayed after 5 days.  </li>
            <li> She said it was easy to use and stayed on for a long time.</li>
            <li> This product barely lasts a day if your lucky.</li>
            <li> the new 2nd tube, I wrapped the tip with duct tape to secure it</li>
            <li> It definitely holds better than regular eyelash adhesive, but I feel like the lashes are ready to fall off after about 2 or 3 days.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> Do not use a clear adhesive because it will be super obvious that your lashes aren&#x27;t real.  </li>
            <li> Lashes looked very shiny and natural, no mascara needed.</li>
            <li> Overall I was OK with this product and will buy the clear version next time.</li>
            <li> Thinking it&#x27;s worth going back to salon to get my lashes done.</li>
            <li> With all the products out there this one really stands out &amp; above, you&#x27;ve won me over ;)</li>
            <li> The tweezers are the only thing worth keeping.</li>
            <li> I was happy with them the first day because I was going out and was wearing make-up, but the next day they looked fake on my face - all because of the glue.</li>
            <li> Globs up and creates a huge mess and tarantula eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Is there a certain range of steps I have to take to make this glue last longer?</li>
            <li> a professional</li>
            <li> remember, let it sit for a minute or two, and it&#x27;ll be ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;Ive uploaded a short vid to demonstrate the sturdiness of the eyelash adhesive.</li>
            <li> and so far I haven&#x27;t had any fall off yet</li>
            <li> Not for professional use.</li>
            <li> may work for at home use but not for professional salon use.  </li>
            <li> I had my friend, who&#x27;s a professional makeup artist, apply them.</li>
            <li> Well that gets old too.</li>
            <li> With this particular glue, by the next day, I&#x27;ll have some lashes already fall off.  </li>
            <li> Other products for less money work better</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so, although the tube isnt large, you dont need a lot of glue to apply your lashes and considering the length of time your lashes stay on, its well worth the $45.</li>
            <li> but it dont burn and dry fast</li>
            <li> I got this product and tried it few times with my fake lashes and it does not work as good as they say it does, also once you open the tub the glue dries inside the tub fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used more than my fair share of lashes and glues and this was without a doubt the worst one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This eyelash glue is amazing!It stays on for a very long time and it is so easy to apply!This product, ulike other eyelash glues, actually works!</li>
            <li> That is a really long time to keep your hand steady.  </li>
            <li> The glue isn&#x27;t goopy or hard to do and it blends in very well with your eyelashes so that they look very real.</li>
            <li> The next day they also looked good, but then...The glue is not black, it&#x27;s actually blue/purple, which isn&#x27;t a problem when applied, because it&#x27;s looks black on lashes, BUT, after couple of days of wear and several showers, the glue becomes turquoise green and it puffs up like pop corn!  </li>
            <li> Also, I noticed that my eyes were itchy, not that they were irritated, but in general I had a desire to rub them, but couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> However, the next day the lashes were falling off in clumps!thier natural lashes were not with them</li>
            <li> It barely stays on for three to four days.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moX1YKSSTRX18L]]Ive been wearing false lashes (on and off) for more than 4 years.</li>
            <li> Decided to try out new glue for my salon and this glue last only one day vs my old glue last up to month for my clients.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little time to set up, but goes on easily and is very long lasting.</li>
            <li> first use with this glue was messy and aggravating.</li>
            <li> It dont State on long only a week</li>
            <li> I need an affordable long lasting glue that doesn&#x27;t sting.</li>
            <li> she predicted they weren&#x27;t going to last very long, the corners were coming up</li>
            <li> Every single lashes fall off after my client shower the next day.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the color of the glue, but I wish it were more permanent like Crazy Glue.  </li>
            <li> Once it does become tacky and is applied your lashes stay on for a long time.</li>
            <li> so you have to hold the lash in place for that long.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me a while to get used to the long setting time</li>
            <li> I have been in the business for a long time.</li>
            <li> Also, the actual tube that this comes in is not very durable.  </li>
            <li> IT WAS VERY STICKY AND MESSY !!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s waterproof, in case you tear up, and stays on for a very long time.</li>
            <li> It also takes forever to dry and gets all over if you blink after applying/prior to it setting.</li>
            <li> the glue i used to use would dry up before i finished it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still waiting for it to dry...</li>
            <li> The glue doesnt stick until it&#x27;s about to dry.</li>
            <li> (Careful how much tape you used or the cap won&#x27;t close), we&#x27;ll see if that will help made it to at least 2/3 of the tube!&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> I saw a previous person had the same problem with two bottles....</li>
            <li> This is the only glue Ive used that has allowed my flare lashes to stay on for an extended period of time (longer than a few days</li>
            <li> I wish I could send  this back and get a refund what a waste of  money and lashes.</li>
            <li> Plus the pink application stick did not arrive with the package.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit on Groupon for $20 and was pissed I spent that...</li>
            <li> so needless to say it&#x27;s DEFINITELY not worth paying full price.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other reviews where people say the glue is like tar...</li>
            <li> No more constantly redoing your lashes.  </li>
            <li> Neither did vaseline, or any other google-searched remedy.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not exactly going to do it again.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t stay on through a shower/bath/face wash, even if you are very careful.</li>
            <li> Just a waste of money, it only works for a few hours, does not stayed glued for the time they promise, follow all directions and nothing.</li>
            <li> Since I thought these would last at least a couple days</li>
            <li> It is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am a licensed professional and I am not happy with this item at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s odd how it won&#x27;t hold your lashes on, but it will NEVER come off of your skin without the remover when it smudges on your lids.</li>
            <li> I ended up ripping out half of my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s black glue and that helps highlight the color of my clients lashes.</li>
            <li> I agree, otherwise it&#x27;s just like any other, very black, eyelash glue.</li>
            <li> I sat it upright in the refrigerator in a zip tight bag and that didn&#x27;t prevent the glue from leaking all over the plastic.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thin and doesn&#x27;t get tacky like normal lash glue.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money!</li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s $100 wasted.</li>
            <li> This had to be one of the worse glues I&#x27;ve ever used my lashes were literally falling off left</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have triedl a lot of glue out there (wasted hundred of $ ).</li>
            <li> This glue didnt hold for a few hours.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This glue is no better than the black bonding hair weaving glue.  </li>
            <li> No good for Single eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li> Unlike any other of the millions of glues I have tried, at least this one lasted overnight, however if you wash your face, like I do, you will find that the lashes loosen and fall off....</li>
            <li> Not cool for the price you charge!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not new to false lashes.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I applied the glue correctly?</li>
            <li> /&gt;And 4 days later, the tip is broken!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually operator error.</li>
            <li> Messy when try to put it on!</li>
            <li> If you ignore the instructions and simply apply the glue to the fake lashes it falls out in no time.</li>
            <li> Painful, red, swollen eyes, gummy, cant see, not worth it.</li>
            <li> I still try to think up a way to make it work, but so far so bad.</li>
            <li> Desperate, I next day ordered the remover because it looked so unprofessional at work.  </li>
            <li> - The glue becomes thick and gummy like after a while</li>
            <li> As a result, I wear false lashes everyday.</li>
            <li> When they say no burning and no fumes they really mean it.</li>
            <li> It looked so ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> : You have to pace it on the clients lashes before applying the fake lashes, (clumpy mess).</li>
            <li> I have been trying other brand of glue and this is the worst of all by far.  </li>
            <li> so it was a weak bond with the glue.</li>
            <li> If you reapply the glue you wind up with an even clumpier mess, (dirty tweezers, fingers, lashes stuck together, etc).</li>
            <li> I was maybe under the wrong impression when i ordered this and will be returning it.</li>
            <li> Fail.</li>
            <li> because I was thinking, I made a mistake ore had just a bad day....</li>
            <li> I have really bad mascara allergies.</li>
            <li> Really bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> I work with lash extentions since years, this is the worst product I ever had.</li>
            <li> IT IS HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> Just nasty!</li>
            <li> awful!</li>
            <li> JUST AWFUL...</li>

    <ol>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moX1YKSSTRX18L]]Ive been wearing false lashes (on and off) for more than 4 years. Ive used Ardell lash glues, hair weaving glue, etc. This is the only glue Ive used that has allowed my flare lashes to stay on for an extended period of time (longer than a few days/week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first use with this glue was messy and aggravating. I&#x27;m used to eyelash adhesives becoming tacky within a matter of seconds. I was going to return it however, after more experimentation, I found its best to let this glue sit for a couple of minutes before use. Once it does become tacky and is applied your lashes stay on for a long time. No worries about lashes coming off while youre sleep (like eyelashes applied with \\&quot;common\\&quot; brand individual or strip eyelash adhesives) or from eyelash plucking or picking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glue is odorless and non-irritating (to me) unlike the adhesives used in most nail salons for eyelash applications. A little goes a long way so, although the tube isnt large, you dont need a lot of glue to apply your lashes and considering the length of time your lashes stay on, its well worth the $45. One application at a salon can cost $45+ (not including $20+ \\&quot;touch ups\\&quot;) so, buying this glue and applying your own lashes is a money saver!! Im in no manner a professional but, I like to save money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember, let it sit for a minute or two, and it&#x27;ll be ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;Ive uploaded a short vid to demonstrate the sturdiness of the eyelash adhesive.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product due to the good reviews stating that it lasted for weeks even months. Yet this glue only lasted 2 days for me. I am not sure if I applied the glue correctly? I used the cluster individual lashes. Is there a certain range of steps I have to take to make this glue last longer?</li>
            <li> I work with lash extentions since years, this is the worst product I ever had. I read the instructions and repeated the procedure the next day, because I was thinking, I made a mistake ore had just a bad day.... but the lashes did not stay on AT ALL!!</li>
            <li> Pros:  - Does not sting.  - Might be good for beginners since it takes the glue a while to set.  Cons:  - The bond only last for 2-3 days.  - Takes about 5 seconds to set so you have to hold the lash in place for that long.  That is a really long time to keep your hand steady.  - The glue becomes thick and gummy like after a while so I can&#x27;t do a full set with one dollop.  I&#x27;ll have to do a total of three dollops  I am currently using Blink and LOVE it!!!!  It stings quite a bit but the glue is absolutely amazing so far.  It was so much easier to use than this one since it set so quickly.  I places the lash and didn&#x27;t have to hold it in place.  It set right away and so far I haven&#x27;t had any fall off yet (although I just tried it last night).  With this particular glue, by the next day, I&#x27;ll have some lashes already fall off.  Hope this helps</li>
            <li> Just a waste of money, it only works for a few hours, does not stayed glued for the time they promise, follow all directions and nothing. Other products for less money work better</li>
            <li> Not for professional use. No good for Single eyelash extensions. I was maybe under the wrong impression when i ordered this and will be returning it.</li>
            <li> Only lasted 2 or 3 days. Used it to apply faux mink eyelash extentions on someone with a latex allergy. Would work great for a special event, but not for regular use.</li>
            <li> My clients were vvery happy at first when there was no burn or irritation. However, the next day the lashes were falling off in clumps!thier natural lashes were not with them so it was a weak bond with the glue. 3 clients had to come back within 2 days to get redone with better glue. This is NOT a product I would recommend!</li>
            <li> This is the second tube I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;It took me a while to get used to the long setting time (vs the 1-2 seconds)and the creamy texture but once you learn how to work with it, it is great! The creamy texture actually gives the eyes the eyeliner \\&quot;intense\\&quot; look - LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;It is indeed \\&quot;sting &amp; stink free\\&quot;, I used it on MYSELF in between fills and on those days that the lashes are about to shed and just needing that extra TLC before I can get to have it fill.&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complain is the crappy packaging! IT IS HORRIBLE! The cheap soft plastic tip can&#x27;t withhold much squeezing and will snapped off. With the first tube, it snapped off when the bottle was still 2/3 full! I sat it upright in the refrigerator in a zip tight bag and that didn&#x27;t prevent the glue from leaking all over the plastic.&lt;br /&gt;With the new 2nd tube, I wrapped the tip with duct tape to secure it (Careful how much tape you used or the cap won&#x27;t close), we&#x27;ll see if that will help made it to at least 2/3 of the tube!&lt;br /&gt;At this steep $, I only get to use 1/3 of what I paid for - hence the 2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I am stuck with it since this seems to be the only glue that does not sting/stink!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And 4 days later, the tip is broken! So that&#x27;s $100 wasted.</li>
            <li> My clients rave about this glue!! No burning, No fumes! This will revolutionize the cosmetics industry !! You will have more repeat customers with this product! Bravo!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re having issues, you aren&#x27;t applying it correctly! Watch the DVD or contct me I will assist you on how to correctly apply the lashes. Not one of my clients have issues ! I have been in the business for a long time. It&#x27;s usually operator error. This is ok, just reach out for help. :-)</li>
            <li> Last for a good week but is kind of goey and takes more than 10 seconds to dry. I&#x27;d buy again for short term use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and the quick service provided.  I love the ease of use and the longevity it provides.</li>
            <li> Takes time to apply but worth the process!! Wore for going clubbing and loved the results I got. Worth the effort!</li>
            <li> Read the great reviews and was so excited to try this product I have worn false lashes ( done by myself and profesionally) for years so I am very familiar with the different glues. This had to be one of the worse glues I&#x27;ve ever used my lashes were literally falling off left and right it was so embarassing.  I made sure I followed the directions to the T.  I wish I could send  this back and get a refund what a waste of  money and lashes.</li>
            <li> Product says lash ring was included but I didn&#x27;t get one. That&#x27;s one of the reasons I purchased this glue.</li>
            <li> Glue is not as stated it last for a couple of hour and then unsticks.Not a long lasting glue 10 hours would have been great and that was not what was happening. Very disappointed with the product. Plus the pink application stick did not arrive with the package.</li>
            <li> It dont State on long only a week and it lift up if u keep washing face but it dont burn and dry fast</li>
            <li> Fail. My $6 Lash Duo glue holds much better than this one. It also takes forever to dry and gets all over if you blink after applying/prior to it setting. It&#x27;s very thin and doesn&#x27;t get tacky like normal lash glue. It&#x27;s odd how it won&#x27;t hold your lashes on, but it will NEVER come off of your skin without the remover when it smudges on your lids. Aarrggh!</li>
            <li> best eyelash glue last 2 weeks</li>
            <li> hands down best lash glue i have ever used-stays put for weeks and doesnt itch like most glue. the glue i used to use would dry up before i finished it but this doesnt. my best friend told me about this and i wont try anything else now!</li>
            <li> It worked well, for couple of days anyway. Lashes looked very shiny and natural, no mascara needed. The next day they also looked good, but then...The glue is not black, it&#x27;s actually blue/purple, which isn&#x27;t a problem when applied, because it&#x27;s looks black on lashes, BUT, after couple of days of wear and several showers, the glue becomes turquoise green and it puffs up like pop corn!  Also, I noticed that my eyes were itchy, not that they were irritated, but in general I had a desire to rub them, but couldn&#x27;t. In addition, if you are blond like me and have light lashes this product isn&#x27;t for you, unless you&#x27;re going for that made up look all the time. My lashes were too intense looking even though my extensions were light brown. I was happy with them the first day because I was going out and was wearing make-up, but the next day they looked fake on my face - all because of the glue. Overall I was OK with this product and will buy the clear version next time.</li>
            <li> You have a great product, but you need to put it in a better container! I saw a previous person had the same problem with two bottles.... Not cool for the price you charge! I have had this for about a month and follow the directions... Pre-swipe my lashes with the glue before putting on the lash, etc.... How do I keep my lashes from getting gunky looking? Also, when I shower, the glue on my lashes tend to turn whitish. Solutions? Help? Tips? I&#x27;m not new to false lashes. Thinking it&#x27;s worth going back to salon to get my lashes done.</li>
            <li> Glue works very well. It takes a little time to set up, but goes on easily and is very long lasting. A little bit goes a long way. It is a fine product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This glue is best by far.  I tried the black and it&#x27;s perfect to blend right in.  I haven&#x27;t had my lashes stay on and last so well in ...ages!  With all the products out there this one really stands out &amp; above, you&#x27;ve won me over ;)&lt;br /&gt;Thanks \\&quot;Lashes &amp; Cosmetics\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This eyelash glue is amazing!It stays on for a very long time and it is so easy to apply!This product, ulike other eyelash glues, actually works! It is even waterproof. The glue isn&#x27;t goopy or hard to do and it blends in very well with your eyelashes so that they look very real. This is by far the best product ever!! You will love this eyelash glue!!!</li>
            <li> This glue is no better than the black bonding hair weaving glue.  If you are lucky, it&lt;br /&gt;may stay on 24 hrs,but even then, clumps where the glue is. Not worth the money!</li>
            <li> Products dries too quickly on stone. Globs up and creates a huge mess and tarantula eyelashes. Just nasty! Will never order fron them again.</li>
            <li> My wife really enjoys and uses this product.  It works great and lasts a long time without any burning sensations to the eye.  The key to the use of this product is simply:  FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS FOR APPLYING THE GLUE.</li>
            <li> Hi, I am the owner and operator of Lavender&#x27;s Lair a skin care spa in Port Orange and have been looking for a glue for MANY Years that is non irritant and lasts.  I have finally found it with Lashes &amp; Cosmetics stay on glue!  I am also able to apply my own lashes without burning my eyes.  My patients have been extremely happy as I have.  I actually thought I would have to eliminate doing eyelash extensions from my spa until I found this line of glue.  No complaints here and I offer this company a HIGH FIVE!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Won&#x27;t stay on through a shower/bath/face wash, even if you are very careful. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I get better results from the cheapo Salon Perfect glue.</li>
            <li> may work for at home use but not for professional salon use.  lasted one week on clients.  no burning or stinging though but not work it for spas/salons.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally over priced.  It  doesn&#x27;t lasts for weeks. It lasts for a day. I wake up with lashes in my bed.</li>
            <li> Unlike any other of the millions of glues I have tried, at least this one lasted overnight, however if you wash your face, like I do, you will find that the lashes loosen and fall off.... The application is easy and The packaging is cute, but you cannot WASH your face!</li>
            <li> I have triedl a lot of glue out there (wasted hundred of $ ). this is only one that doesn&#x27;t cause redness, itchiness and swollen.&lt;br /&gt;but lash only last for 3 days or so. need refill every 2 days or so.</li>
            <li> Would give it -1 stars if it was possible. I bought this kit on Groupon for $20 and was pissed I spent that...so needless to say it&#x27;s DEFINITELY not worth paying full price. I was so excited and intrigued when I saw it, in theory it&#x27;s a great idea. I figured the chances of the lashes staying on and actually looking good for 7 days was a stretch, but figured if I could even get a weekend out of them, I&#x27;d be happy - I barely got a night. Since I thought these would last at least a couple days I had my friend, who&#x27;s a professional makeup artist, apply them. We followed the directions exactly...30 seconds after she put them on she predicted they weren&#x27;t going to last very long, the corners were coming up and they just wouldn&#x27;t stay on. I&#x27;ve seen other reviews where people say the glue is like tar...and they&#x27;re absolutely right. The best way I can describe it is it&#x27;s like putting on mascara made of liquid rubber...just an absolute f&#x27;n disaster. I&#x27;m extremely skeptical of the reviews saying this is the best glue they&#x27;ve ever tried...I&#x27;ve used more than my fair share of lashes and glues and this was without a doubt the worst one I&#x27;ve ever used. You&#x27;re better off buying 6 pairs of the throw away kind and putting a new pair on every night. The tweezers are the only thing worth keeping.</li>
            <li> The glue that comes with the eyelashes is better..I&#x27;m still waiting for it to dry...I will never purchase again..awful! JUST AWFUL...</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS A SCAM !! IT DOESNT WORK !! I TRIED AND TRIED TO APPLY AS INSTRUCTED BUT COULNDNT GET PRODUCT TO WORK. IT WAS VERY STICKY AND MESSY !!</li>
            <li> I got this product and tried it few times with my fake lashes and it does not work as good as they say it does, also once you open the tub the glue dries inside the tub fairly quickly.  I will not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Messy when try to put it on!</li>
            <li> Decided to try out new glue for my salon and this glue last only one day vs my old glue last up to month for my clients.  Every single lashes fall off after my client shower the next day.  I have been trying other brand of glue and this is the worst of all by far.  I used this glue for individual eyelashes.  STAY AWAY.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy,it&#x27;s not permanent, if you are talking about permanently remove your own lashes I agree, otherwise it&#x27;s just like any other, very black, eyelash glue.</li>
            <li> This glue is great I have used hair bonding glue, duo, and several other glues and no glue can compare. When they say no burning and no fumes they really mean it. It is so light weight you don&#x27;t get that saggy eye feeling and it really stays on no lashes falling off</li>
            <li> Ever since i used this eye lash glue.. i fell in love(: and realized that no other eye lash glues were as good as this one. I am sooooooooo amazed at how amazing it works!! It&#x27;s waterproof, in case you tear up, and stays on for a very long time. It also isn&#x27;t clumpy, and is very easy to apply. It always makes your eyes look awesome!! All your friends will definetely love it! if you buy this product, i promise you.. you will not regret it!!:)</li>
            <li> This product keeps your lashes on even when you shower!  No more constantly redoing your lashes.  Save on product use since it does not need to be reapplied often.</li>
            <li> but this is superglue.  The false lashes looked great for 3 days then started to look frayed after 5 days.  But you can&#x27;t take them off.  It looked so ridiculous.  I used several cluster lashes on each eye, and it appeared as if I had decomposing caterpillar parts on my eyelids.  Desperate, I next day ordered the remover because it looked so unprofessional at work.  Didn&#x27;t work. Neither did vaseline, or any other google-searched remedy.  I ended up ripping out half of my eyelashes.  My husband was incredulous that I would superglue something so close to my eyes.  We still laugh about it but I&#x27;m not exactly going to do it again.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product. I have really bad mascara allergies. Really bad. Tried every mascara known, and cant wear any of them. Painful, red, swollen eyes, gummy, cant see, not worth it. As a result, I wear false lashes everyday. Well that gets old too. Ya just wanna wake up lookin&#x27; pretty. Too much to ask? Yep. This glue didnt hold for a few hours. I tried several different ways, different types of lashes, and it lifted immediately. I still try to think up a way to make it work, but so far so bad. Cant reccomend this.</li>
            <li> For the price of this glue you would think it would hold lashes for days, even weeks....NOT!  I tried and tried to use this with individual flair lashes and it just does not have the holding power.  What I&#x27;ve found that what works best is the Andrea Perma-lash Individual Eyelash Adhesive.  It holds better and longer for a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend was having problems keeping her eye lashes in. I saw this ad in Amazon for the lash glue, so I thought i would get it for her. Lucky for me she loved how it worked. She said it was easy to use and stayed on for a long time. That made her like me even more. So if your wife or girlfriend is having eyelash issues,this glue will take care of the problem...worked great for her!</li>
            <li> I am a licensed professional and I am not happy with this item at all. The lashes fall off by the next day. I will not use this product again.</li>
            <li> This product barely lasts a day if your lucky. It gets flaky and extensions fall off. It is not worth the money. I was expecting so much more. It does not burn, but lashes will not stay on.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and would recommend this product to all my friends and family. Looks great on and if you don&#x27;t know what to get that hard to shop for person, this makes an excellent gift.</li>
            <li> When I first ordered this product it got lost in the mail.  The company was super nice and sent me everything again with no hassle and even included some free samples.  They get 5 stars for customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the color of this product, but I feel like I was hoping it was more permanent.  It definitely holds better than regular eyelash adhesive, but I feel like the lashes are ready to fall off after about 2 or 3 days.  That means that I constantly have to reapply new ones, which is more often then when I go and get my eyelashes done.  You can&#x27;t beat the color of the glue, but I wish it were more permanent like Crazy Glue.  Do not use a clear adhesive because it will be super obvious that your lashes aren&#x27;t real.  Also, the actual tube that this comes in is not very durable.  I didn&#x27;t do anything to it and when I squeezed to push out more glue, the side of it cracked.  Now this process has become much more difficult and i need to duck tape this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like this product, and it&#x27;s better than everything else I&#x27;ve used thus far, but it could still use some improvement.</li>
            <li> If you follow the directions on this product your client ends up looking like someone who put on some really clumpy mascara. The Likes: It&#x27;s black glue and that helps highlight the color of my clients lashes. It doesn&#x27;t burn or make your eyes water. It takes a while to dry, which is great in my windy climate with no AC. Dislikes: You have to pace it on the clients lashes before applying the fake lashes, (clumpy mess). It barely stays on for three to four days. If you reapply the glue you wind up with an even clumpier mess, (dirty tweezers, fingers, lashes stuck together, etc). If you ignore the instructions and simply apply the glue to the fake lashes it falls out in no time. I&#x27;m really disappointed. I need an affordable long lasting glue that doesn&#x27;t sting. This doesn&#x27;t make the grade.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money. The glue doesnt stick until it&#x27;s about to dry. It does not last two weeks like it says</li>
