            <li>Wonderful for Brazilian waxes.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li>This product does not do a very good job removing hair.</li>
            <li>When I reduce temperature, my skin still gets incredibly irritated and feels like it&#x27;s burning.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy with it.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Great - this should be perfect!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and im a beginner it worked great</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good idea to take two ibuprofen before getting a bikini wax.</li>
            <li>I loved this product.</li>
            <li>I Loved</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>After reading the good reviews I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>i have used this product and it works good</li>
            <li>This is the first wax my wife used and it&#x27;s been very great.  </li>
            <li>Love this wax!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for legs, but don&#x27;t use it for underarms or bikini area!</li>
            <li>Took me a couple of minutes before I remembered the sticky wax on the top of my feet!</li>
            <li>This is great wax gets the job done and is easy to remove with oil.  </li>
            <li>GiGi makes good products but there are better choices than this one.</li>
            <li>Even if the wax is luck warm it will still take off every hair in grasp.  </li>
            <li>Also, Moom heated up in the microwave, which was really nice.</li>
            <li>This item was a good deal, I was looking in many websites and this one was cheap and good quality</li>
            <li>Nothing seemed to work well for very fine hairs.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>MUCH MUCH better</li>
            <li>But I love this wax.  </li>
            <li>and I love this wax.</li>
            <li>I have used Gigi&#x27;s Brazilian wax for more than 2 years.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this product</li>
            <li>I bought this wax with my Gigi wax warmer (Which I loooove!), because it seemed to have a better rating and rave than the all-purpose Honee wax...  </li>
            <li>It dripped everywhere including the top of my foot.  </li>
            <li>When I get a rectangle about two inches by 6-7 inches, I take my applicator and scrape across the top to remove excess.</li>
            <li>I have used many gigi waxes, and decided to try this.  </li>
            <li>So at first I was super happy.</li>
            <li>This is a great wax for sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>so I find it melts very quickly in the warmer.  </li>
            <li>The wax is liquidy and sticky, so it gets everywhere easily.  </li>
            <li>It comes off more cleanly with the strips than the others, and I found the stripless ones don&#x27;t come off easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sticky, but with practice, it&#x27;s easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li>This is my first time waxing on my own</li>
            <li>I bought the warmer from Gigi and that is fine, but I recommend using another brand of wax.</li>
            <li>All was fine until the dog came and curled up at my feet.  </li>
            <li>This wax is gentle, it smells good and heats up quick.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, pulls easily &amp; leaves very little residue which is easy to remove with baby oil (which makes your legs feel great as a bonus!).  </li>
            <li>I used the gigi azulene wax and the pre-epilation oil and had fabulous results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to stick to home made sugar &#x27;wax&#x27; - cheap and</li>
            <li>I love this wax so much, and use it for most of my clients.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The pulls on this wax are not always clean.</li>
            <li>And it is a beast to clean up.</li>
            <li>i loved it definitely will purchase in the near future best wax ever</li>
            <li>And .......d very gentle it clean off easily ....  </li>
            <li>And, as others have reviewed how sticky it is....it&#x27;s so true.</li>
            <li>It seems very gentle and come off easily with baby oil if you drip it.</li>
            <li>If warmed right, it goes on smooth and comes off with ease.</li>
            <li>so you need to work quickly once it&#x27;s on the applicator</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick</li>
            <li>I honestly specifically got this one versus the Honee wax, because the latter was said to be too sticky by a lot of the customers -</li>
            <li>lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since one isn&#x27;t supposed to wax over areas again with soft wax, I just though \\&quot;Okay, I&#x27;ll use the oil and it will be fine.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>just right, not to hot not to cool</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>Aside from this being such a sticky and messy product, it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li>I was apprehensive about this wax based on some of the other reviews, but I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I tried Moom wax first, both the womens and mens versions, and they worked okay, but I had to go over the same spots again and again, and if the temp wasn&#x27;t just right, it didn&#x27;t remove anything.</li>
            <li>I wax my legs and underarms all the time and have used many different products.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s not difficult at all</li>
            <li>I wax my eyebrows, and I have tried so many different waxes over the years.</li>
            <li>but no worries, i boiled some hot water &amp; but the wax in, the packaging is metal</li>
            <li>I still haven&#x27;t been able to fully remove them, a month later.  </li>
            <li>Not only will this save you some product, the thinner the application, the better with this</li>
            <li>This combo worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>have used other kinds of wax and this ones stands on its own.  </li>
            <li>When I needed something for my legs, I bought the azulene wax based on all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>(The azulene wax left me red for two days and very sensitive), and worked on many more hairs.</li>
            <li>The wax is Ok, took a long time to melt and is very sticky.  </li>
            <li>This wax is sooo gentle.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this wax!</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s very drippy, a couple drops landed on the porcelain sink...  </li>
            <li>It removes hair very well in my opinion.</li>
            <li>After using this wax 4-5x, I know the most effective way to apply this wax is very thin.</li>
            <li>I got a little bit of the wax on my finger, and it came off very easily with baby oil.</li>
            <li>The only caveat is that even when \\&quot;hard\\&quot; the product is tacky so if you drip/spill any it won&#x27;t fully harden &amp; peel up, you&#x27;ll need to clean it up with baby oil.  </li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;If the clean up and residue wasn&#x27;t such a headache, I would give this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I bought this wax and do not know how to clean the same.</li>
            <li>use this on my legs where I have very sensitive skin and hair that runs from very course to very fine.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>so I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>After even the professional wax removers failed I resorted to using olive oil followed by pure eucalyptus oil - which incidently is great as it has anti-inflammatory, antiseptic and antibacterial properties.</li>
            <li>BUT its the most sticky and messy wax i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few wax products, and now that I&#x27;ve gotten my practice, this is my favorite one.</li>
            <li>in mind as you read my review that I may have a completely different opinion if I had done it the RIGHT way.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is the first wax that I rate 5 stars, I would really recommend this for fine hairs (I cannot say anything about how well it works thick hairs).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used various wax products for years now and after reading the great reviews, finally bought the Gigi Wax Warmer and a container of Brazilian Body Hard Wax and the Azulene Wax.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, and not too messy.</li>
            <li>So, if that&#x27;s how you&#x27;re planning to do it, be prepared for a HUGE mess.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more comfortable than the brazilian hard wax, and I had a lot less swelling.</li>
            <li>Since my leg hair is finer than either my pit hairs or my hairs down there, I was very optimistic that the Azulene Wax was the right choice.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, I use this wax only - get it hot and put on very thin layer.</li>
            <li>I purchased Gigi Hard Wax and with it I was able to wax and NO REDNESS</li>
            <li>One thing you need to know is that even after this wax has completely cooled off, it still runs.</li>
            <li>This is a professional product, so i didnt realize i needed the machine that heats up the wax</li>
            <li>This wax worked very well for both myself and my teenage daughter.  </li>
            <li>I have to go back with the cloth and gently at an angle press across it and try to take off residue.</li>
            <li>All this while dealing with a sticky mess each time, even though I use baby oil to clean up...there is always</li>
            <li>(although it did get about half the hairs), cleaning it up involved digging with my fingernails on my skin for about 45 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say the wax seems okay for the upper lip and tiny areas...  </li>
            <li>So I decided to try this and it removed all the hair, the first time, in multiple areas of the body and at different angles.</li>
            <li>so I tried just applying the wax in a hairless area of my arm and removing it with baby oil and the same redness developed!!</li>
            <li>While it works, it is super messy.</li>
            <li>It is very soft to skin contact when heated enough.  </li>
            <li>If fact, considering the time (and $$) it took for the wax to heat up and then the time it took me to clean up the mess on my feet, counter and floor, I give this a big fat 2 stars.  </li>
            <li>For me, the end result isn&#x27;t worth the mess you have to deal with in the end.</li>
            <li>The main reason is because it&#x27;s HARD, so it dries to a solid state and is 5,000 times easier to clean up than the azulene wax.  </li>
            <li>wax.i used few wax earlier which just clean by water.</li>
            <li>wax is very messy for clean up.</li>
            <li>The only reason I only gave it four stars is because it is not easy to clean off the body.</li>
            <li>The Gigi Brazilian hard wax is a breeze for clean up compared to this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned that you don&#x27;t want to pull and yank on the same spot more than once because you will get broken capillaries: a</li>
            <li>Posting this review as a warning to others who may also experience major irritation or burns to look at ingredients (like glycolic acid) of facial products they use.  </li>
            <li>so sometimes I put a small amount on my applicator, then put it on, then take a little more and put it on.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend covering all surfaces with cling wrap, foil or some other disposable plastic sheet before waxing.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s reasonable, but the cleanup afterward is a mess.</li>

            <li> After even the professional wax removers failed I resorted to using olive oil followed by pure eucalyptus oil - which incidently is great as it has anti-inflammatory, antiseptic and antibacterial properties.</li>
            <li> BUT its the most sticky and messy wax i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few wax products, and now that I&#x27;ve gotten my practice, this is my favorite one.</li>
            <li> in mind as you read my review that I may have a completely different opinion if I had done it the RIGHT way.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is the first wax that I rate 5 stars, I would really recommend this for fine hairs (I cannot say anything about how well it works thick hairs).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various wax products for years now and after reading the great reviews, finally bought the Gigi Wax Warmer and a container of Brazilian Body Hard Wax and the Azulene Wax.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to apply, and not too messy.</li>
            <li> So, if that&#x27;s how you&#x27;re planning to do it, be prepared for a HUGE mess.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more comfortable than the brazilian hard wax, and I had a lot less swelling.</li>
            <li> Since my leg hair is finer than either my pit hairs or my hairs down there, I was very optimistic that the Azulene Wax was the right choice.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, I use this wax only - get it hot and put on very thin layer.</li>
            <li> I purchased Gigi Hard Wax and with it I was able to wax and NO REDNESS</li>
            <li> One thing you need to know is that even after this wax has completely cooled off, it still runs.</li>
            <li> This is a professional product, so i didnt realize i needed the machine that heats up the wax</li>
            <li> This wax worked very well for both myself and my teenage daughter.  </li>
            <li> I have to go back with the cloth and gently at an angle press across it and try to take off residue.</li>
            <li> All this while dealing with a sticky mess each time, even though I use baby oil to clean up...there is always</li>
            <li> (although it did get about half the hairs), cleaning it up involved digging with my fingernails on my skin for about 45 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say the wax seems okay for the upper lip and tiny areas...  </li>
            <li> So I decided to try this and it removed all the hair, the first time, in multiple areas of the body and at different angles.</li>
            <li> so I tried just applying the wax in a hairless area of my arm and removing it with baby oil and the same redness developed!!</li>
            <li> While it works, it is super messy.</li>
            <li> It is very soft to skin contact when heated enough.  </li>
            <li> If fact, considering the time (and $$) it took for the wax to heat up and then the time it took me to clean up the mess on my feet, counter and floor, I give this a big fat 2 stars.  </li>
            <li> For me, the end result isn&#x27;t worth the mess you have to deal with in the end.</li>
            <li> The main reason is because it&#x27;s HARD, so it dries to a solid state and is 5,000 times easier to clean up than the azulene wax.  </li>
            <li> wax.i used few wax earlier which just clean by water.</li>
            <li> wax is very messy for clean up.</li>
            <li> The only reason I only gave it four stars is because it is not easy to clean off the body.</li>
            <li> The Gigi Brazilian hard wax is a breeze for clean up compared to this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned that you don&#x27;t want to pull and yank on the same spot more than once because you will get broken capillaries: a</li>
            <li> Posting this review as a warning to others who may also experience major irritation or burns to look at ingredients (like glycolic acid) of facial products they use.  </li>
            <li> so sometimes I put a small amount on my applicator, then put it on, then take a little more and put it on.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend covering all surfaces with cling wrap, foil or some other disposable plastic sheet before waxing.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s reasonable, but the cleanup afterward is a mess.</li>
            <li> Hard was is a bit painful, but not so messy and does a pretty good job!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest that I did have a bit of trouble getting the consistency right, but even then, I found this wax very messy and difficult to work with.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super sticky which makes it messy and more painful.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using all purpose honey wax for a few years now and was exited to try something new.</li>
            <li> My wife works for a Nail Salon / Spa and they use the GiGi CREAM waxes (PINK not BLUE).</li>
            <li> I stored the wax in my bathroom vanity and my husband accidentally bumped it just enough to tilt it a bit, and a few days later, when I opened our vanity, there was wax everywhere!</li>
            <li> I would try something else next time, because the time and money spent cleaning the wax from anything you touch after 30 minutes is not worth it.</li>
            <li> I just leave them alone, let them grow another half week, and go back with this wax</li>
            <li> I will considering amending this review depending on how long it takes for the hair to grow back and/if I experience any excessive bumps/in-grown hairs.</li>
            <li> It removed the hair but be careful when using.  </li>
            <li> Tonight I have a half a mustache and half red inflamed skin shaped like a mustache!  </li>
            <li> Not any better (or less painful) than the Veet Wax Strips for Leg and Body that I can get at the nearest grocery store.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I use wax hair removal and was questionable with the purchase.  </li>
            <li> it is not like other wax which i used from GIGI (all purpose</li>
            <li> as compared to repeated attempts with the other kit.  </li>
            <li> and she did from the other kit.  </li>
            <li> I read some other reviews that said to heat it in a pan of boiling water</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this a try as I use azulene oil to get excess wax off when I use other brands.</li>
            <li> No hair and no red skin left behind.  </li>
            <li> I decided to take a break and sit down in the chair.  </li>
            <li> Put down a lot of towels or newspapers to protect your surfaces because if you&#x27;re not patient, you will get strings and plops of this product everywhere.</li>
            <li> and I had to wax again less than 2.5 weeks after waxing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sticking to the less sticky all purpose honey wax.</li>
            <li> It works on about half of the hair...  </li>
            <li> Unlike the previous organic wax kit we had ordered (Moom, I think was the name)</li>
            <li> otherwise it&#x27;s a liquid mess.</li>
            <li> The stripless hard wax also hurts a lot less, left very little redness and irritation</li>
            <li> We used the baby oil gel which was less messy.</li>
            <li> If hairs are very thick and coarse then this wax doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It gave me huge red bumps and nasty ingrowns!.</li>
            <li> Maybe it wouldn&#x27;t have been so messy?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit messy, rips the skin but does not remove the hairs.</li>
            <li> I remove this wax, it leaves some hairs behind that are a bit too short to be picked up.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve have some pretty bad burns.  </li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t even any sticky residue left behind!</li>
            <li> Results were worse than I expected</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re usually gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> WHAT A MESS!!  </li>
            <li> Microwaving it did not work; it just made the wax hard.</li>
            <li> Also, it is hard to replace the aluzene wax from the warmer because it is so sticky with wax</li>
            <li> recommendation would be going for the Brazilian hard body wax.  </li>
            <li> It leaves little if any hair behind.</li>
            <li> pain (at least for me, then of course the pain depends of the skin,</li>
            <li> I started, I was applying it way too thick.</li>
            <li> but you need to scrub at it and scrape it off if it&#x27;s thick.</li>
            <li> The other half of the hair is left covered in the disgustingly sticky wax...  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m missing few patches of skin :(</li>
            <li> It is a very thick wax to begin with</li>
            <li> I get a halo effect where the edges of the wax were applied stay behind.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous!</li>
            <li> (still a little painful buy</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst wax I have used.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this is not a great wax.</li>
            <li> Go with GIGI Hard Wax instead!!</li>
            <li> After some disappointing (and painful) attempts with this wax we went to Sally&#x27;s and got the CREAM wax (pink).</li>
            <li> WRONG.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, it did work on pulling out the dog hair  -</li>
            <li> If any drop falls on the ground, it is difficult to remove.  </li>
            <li> Its harsh, very thin consistency, and I just hated the result from it.</li>
            <li> even it do not clean from body worst</li>
            <li> But this one was really disappointing.</li>
            <li> And removing it from your skin, towels, floor, sink etc. is almost impossible.</li>
            <li> It still removed the hair though, but was really painful to spread.</li>
            <li> I used to not wax my legs because its so painful.</li>
            <li> But with this wax, it really isn&#x27;t painful at all.</li>
            <li> OK...I have to say that I was really disappointed with this stuff.  </li>
            <li> i hate this wax.</li>
            <li> This wax is horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This wax is horrible! I bought the warmer from Gigi and that is fine, but I recommend using another brand of wax. I wax my legs and underarms all the time and have used many different products. This one is NOT water soluble at all and therefore any spills or mistakes need to be scrubbed off using elbow grease and lots of oil. Ridiculous! Please do not purchase this!!</li>
            <li> This wax is great!  This is the first wax my wife used and it&#x27;s been very great.  No hair and no red skin left behind.  I use the muslin cloth to remove extras on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;The can is severely bending out of shape sitting Gigi warmer.  No idea why!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various wax products for years now and after reading the great reviews, finally bought the Gigi Wax Warmer and a container of Brazilian Body Hard Wax and the Azulene Wax.  Since my leg hair is finer than either my pit hairs or my hairs down there, I was very optimistic that the Azulene Wax was the right choice. WHAT A MESS!!  I&#x27;ll be honest that I did have a bit of trouble getting the consistency right, but even then, I found this wax very messy and difficult to work with.  Did it efficiently remove my leg hair?  Not any better (or less painful) than the Veet Wax Strips for Leg and Body that I can get at the nearest grocery store.  If fact, considering the time (and $$) it took for the wax to heat up and then the time it took me to clean up the mess on my feet, counter and floor, I give this a big fat 2 stars.  I will considering amending this review depending on how long it takes for the hair to grow back and/if I experience any excessive bumps/in-grown hairs. For me, the end result isn&#x27;t worth the mess you have to deal with in the end.</li>
            <li> I used the gigi azulene wax and the pre-epilation oil and had fabulous results. This is a great wax for sensitive areas. It&#x27;s much more comfortable than the brazilian hard wax, and I had a lot less swelling. FYI--it&#x27;s a good idea to take two ibuprofen before getting a bikini wax.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive about this wax based on some of the other reviews, but I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  It stays a bit tacky all the time so I find it melts very quickly in the warmer.  It is a bit runny so you need to work quickly once it&#x27;s on the applicator or it&#x27;ll drip, but if you&#x27;re a veteran waxer like I am, it&#x27;s no problem.  I don&#x27;t find it to be overly stringy at all.  It goes on smooth, pulls easily &amp; leaves very little residue which is easy to remove with baby oil (which makes your legs feel great as a bonus!).  The only caveat is that even when \\&quot;hard\\&quot; the product is tacky so if you drip/spill any it won&#x27;t fully harden &amp; peel up, you&#x27;ll need to clean it up with baby oil.  But that&#x27;s not difficult at all so I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product does not do a very good job removing hair. We had to RE-WAX the same spot several times. (OUCH) My wife works for a Nail Salon / Spa and they use the GiGi CREAM waxes (PINK not BLUE). After some disappointing (and painful) attempts with this wax we went to Sally&#x27;s and got the CREAM wax (pink). MUCH MUCH better (still a little painful buy hey it is waxing) GiGi makes good products but there are better choices than this one.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. I recommend when waxing the bikini area, you start from below and move your way up towards your belly button. If the wax gets stuck, just pour lots of baby oil and pick it off with your fingers or a cotton pad.    One thing you need to know is that even after this wax has completely cooled off, it still runs. I stored the wax in my bathroom vanity and my husband accidentally bumped it just enough to tilt it a bit, and a few days later, when I opened our vanity, there was wax everywhere! So I&#x27;m back now to buying another bottle!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I use wax hair removal and was questionable with the purchase.  But I love this wax.  It is very soft to skin contact when heated enough.  I&#x27;m not allergic to it.  It adiere well.   I Loved</li>
            <li> have used other kinds of wax and this ones stands on its own.  it is great!!!!  Even if the wax is luck warm it will still take off every hair in grasp.  recommend to every wax lover!</li>
            <li> Good stuff, I use this wax only - get it hot and put on very thin layer. Does a great job! It feels since the time I bought that Gigi wax machine and strips, plus this wax, I&#x27;ve saved a fortune on wax salons. Shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> This is my first time waxing on my own and I love this wax. It seems very gentle and come off easily with baby oil if you drip it.</li>
            <li> I tried Moom wax first, both the womens and mens versions, and they worked okay, but I had to go over the same spots again and again, and if the temp wasn&#x27;t just right, it didn&#x27;t remove anything. So I decided to try this and it removed all the hair, the first time, in multiple areas of the body and at different angles. Even my underarm hair all came off with ONE strip!! The only reason I only gave it four stars is because it is not easy to clean off the body. I did read online that if you don&#x27;t have the GIGI wax removal, you can use baby oil, so I am going to try that. Also, Moom heated up in the microwave, which was really nice. This container has to be heated in a wax warmer (I found the warming pad on my glass cooktop to work quite well). Microwaving it did not work; it just made the wax hard. It still removed the hair though, but was really painful to spread. Good luck!!</li>
            <li> This wax is sooo gentle. I used to not wax my legs because its so painful. But with this wax, it really isn&#x27;t painful at all. I love this wax so much, and use it for most of my clients. If hairs are very thick and coarse then this wax doesn&#x27;t work. I use honey wax for those clients instead. Love this wax! I am so happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have tried probably 20 different types of wax in my life. Nothing seemed to work well for very fine hairs.&lt;br /&gt;This one instead is just perfect. It just comes off with no effort and no whatsoever pain (at least for me, then of course the pain depends of the skin, thickness of the hairs etc). Virtually no hairs are left behind.&lt;br /&gt;You have to use the gigi strips obviously, as others brands may not work.&lt;br /&gt;It is the first wax that I rate 5 stars, I would really recommend this for fine hairs (I cannot say anything about how well it works thick hairs).</li>
            <li> I have used Gigi&#x27;s Brazilian wax for more than 2 years. Loved it. When I needed something for my legs, I bought the azulene wax based on all the positive reviews.  While it works, it is super messy.I have to spread newspaper on the floor (and do NOT use it on carpet) before waxing. That&#x27;s reasonable, but the cleanup afterward is a mess. The wax is liquidy and sticky, so it gets everywhere easily.  My Gigi wax warmer which I&#x27;ve had for 2 years and has been spotless from using Brazilian wax now has azulene wax on the outside and INSIDE of the warmer. How I got there I have no idea. Also, it is hard to replace the aluzene wax from the warmer because it is so sticky with wax -- I never had that problem with my Brazilian wax. I would try something else next time, because the time and money spent cleaning the wax from anything you touch after 30 minutes is not worth it.</li>
            <li> it is not like other wax which i used from GIGI (all purpose honeey)one . It is not sticky . ...And .......d very gentle it clean off easily ....  I am enjoying this product and I would recommend to everyone. ....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Gigi warmer and blue wax for about 5 months now and have almost given up .....I only use it on my facial hair (lady mustache) and I&#x27;ve have some pretty bad burns.  When I reduce temperature, my skin still gets incredibly irritated and feels like it&#x27;s burning.  All this while dealing with a sticky mess each time, even though I use baby oil to clean up...there is always some wax left lurking somewhere, either on my face, hands, countertop...ugh.  Tonight I have a half a mustache and half red inflamed skin shaped like a mustache!  Had to stop halfway because of burning.  And after cleaning up, I still have wax on my fingertips as I can feel the keys on my keyboard sticking to me.  I think I&#x27;ve figured out the problem of irritation and burning...I use a facial cleanser with glycolic acid in it, so I think I need to discontinue using for several days before waxing...but I&#x27;m throwing in the towel with this wax...cannot handle how sticky it is.  Posting this review as a warning to others who may also experience major irritation or burns to look at ingredients (like glycolic acid) of facial products they use.  And, as others have reviewed how sticky it is....it&#x27;s so true.</li>
            <li> The wax served its purpose at removing hair and not removing any skin. So at first I was super happy. However, shortly after came the allergic reaction! It gave me huge red bumps and nasty ingrowns!. I thought it was because I was waxing so I tried just applying the wax in a hairless area of my arm and removing it with baby oil and the same redness developed!! I may be allergic to the Azulene oil as there is nothing else I can think off that could cause this. This wax also made me itch and I had to wax again less than 2.5 weeks after waxing. Overall I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.  I purchased Gigi Hard Wax and with it I was able to wax and NO REDNESS AT ALL!! Go with GIGI Hard Wax instead!!</li>
            <li> This item was a good deal, I was looking in many websites and this one was cheap and good quality</li>
            <li> I wax my eyebrows, and I have tried so many different waxes over the years. This is the BEST one I have ever used! It is easy to apply, and not too messy. Every hair came off with just one application. I LOVE IT!!! There wasn&#x27;t even any sticky residue left behind! I got a little bit of the wax on my finger, and it came off very easily with baby oil. I highly recommend this wax!</li>
            <li> This is a professional product, so i didnt realize i needed the machine that heats up the wax lol. but no worries, i boiled some hot water &amp; but the wax in, the packaging is metal so, it does the job. Delivery was quick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using all purpose honey wax for a few years now and was exited to try something new. But this one was really disappointing. It&#x27;s ok for legs, but don&#x27;t use it for underarms or bikini area! It&#x27;s super sticky which makes it messy and more painful.    Definitely won&#x27;t reorder. I&#x27;m sticking to the less sticky all purpose honey wax.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best waxes I have ever used.  It leaves little if any hair behind. Wonderful for Brazilian waxes.</li>
            <li> I bought this wax with my Gigi wax warmer (Which I loooove!), because it seemed to have a better rating and rave than the all-purpose Honee wax...  I honestly specifically got this one versus the Honee wax, because the latter was said to be too sticky by a lot of the customers - so I thought, \\&quot;Great - this should be perfect!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wax is an ineffective nightmare.  I did all the proper pre-care and post-care for these treatments.  I used the azulene wax on my legs, upper lip and chin.  It works on about half of the hair...  The other half of the hair is left covered in the disgustingly sticky wax...  And it hurts...  A lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since one isn&#x27;t supposed to wax over areas again with soft wax, I just though \\&quot;Okay, I&#x27;ll use the oil and it will be fine.\\&quot;  WRONG.  I can&#x27;t imagine what works to truly remove this wax beyond some classified military-developed detergent.  Because it&#x27;s very drippy, a couple drops landed on the porcelain sink...  I still haven&#x27;t been able to fully remove them, a month later.  In the shower with the oil just made me upset...  Not only did the product not work well (although it did get about half the hairs), cleaning it up involved digging with my fingernails on my skin for about 45 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say the wax seems okay for the upper lip and tiny areas...  It got basically all the hairs there.  For anything bigger than that - or for hairs any courser than the upper lip hair (so basically any hair), I would never recommend this wax.  EVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation would be going for the Brazilian hard body wax.  The main reason is because it&#x27;s HARD, so it dries to a solid state and is 5,000 times easier to clean up than the azulene wax.  The stripless hard wax also hurts a lot less, left very little redness and irritation (The azulene wax left me red for two days and very sensitive), and worked on many more hairs.</li>
            <li> This wax worked very well for both myself and my teenage daughter.  Unlike the previous organic wax kit we had ordered (Moom, I think was the name) this stuff pulled the hair the 1st time.....as compared to repeated attempts with the other kit.  My daughter also did not get a rash from this wax and she did from the other kit.  The only thing that we found to get the wax off is baby oil. (wax remaining on the skin)  We used the baby oil gel which was less messy.</li>
            <li> OK...I have to say that I was really disappointed with this stuff.  However, I have never waxed before and didn&#x27;t have a warmer.  I read some other reviews that said to heat it in a pan of boiling water so I did that instead.  So, if that&#x27;s how you&#x27;re planning to do it, be prepared for a HUGE mess.  I heated it up in a pan of boiling water and then tried to spread it on my lower leg.  It dripped everywhere including the top of my foot.  When I finally gave up, I couldn&#x27;t get the wax off!  I decided to take a break and sit down in the chair.  All was fine until the dog came and curled up at my feet.  Took me a couple of minutes before I remembered the sticky wax on the top of my feet! Needless to say, it did work on pulling out the dog hair  - it was just unfortunate that the dog hair was now stuck to the top of my foot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind as you read my review that I may have a completely different opinion if I had done it the RIGHT way.  Maybe it wouldn&#x27;t have been so messy?  Either way, I won&#x27;t buy again and gave to a cosmotologist friend who knows what she&#x27;s doing!</li>
            <li> After reading the good reviews I decided to give it a try. Thank God I tried it on my legs not my bikini!!! It&#x27;s a bit messy, rips the skin but does not remove the hairs. Had to go over the same spot twice or three times. Results were worse than I expected and I&#x27;m missing few patches of skin :( I will not recommend to use it on bikini area! Hard was is a bit painful, but not so messy and does a pretty good job!</li>
            <li> I tried this wax on the recommendations on Amazon and another beauty web site.&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say, it took me a while to figure out how to use this wax.&lt;br /&gt;When I started, I was applying it way too thick. I was wasting a lot of product. After using this wax 4-5x, I know the most effective way to apply this wax is very thin. It is a very thick wax to begin with so sometimes I put a small amount on my applicator, then put it on, then take a little more and put it on. When I get a rectangle about two inches by 6-7 inches, I take my applicator and scrape across the top to remove excess. Then I take the excess and put it back in the can in my warmer. Not only will this save you some product, the thinner the application, the better with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my legs where I have very sensitive skin and hair that runs from very course to very fine.&lt;br /&gt;When I remove this wax, it leaves some hairs behind that are a bit too short to be picked up. You can go back with tweezers. I just leave them alone, let them grow another half week, and go back with this wax and they&#x27;re usually gone.&lt;br /&gt;The pulls on this wax are not always clean. I get a halo effect where the edges of the wax were applied stay behind. I have to go back with the cloth and gently at an angle press across it and try to take off residue. If you try once to remove a big area of residue wax, don&#x27;t try again. I&#x27;ve learned that you don&#x27;t want to pull and yank on the same spot more than once because you will get broken capillaries: a big no-no.&lt;br /&gt;This wax is very messy for clean up. Put down a lot of towels or newspapers to protect your surfaces because if you&#x27;re not patient, you will get strings and plops of this product everywhere. And it is a beast to clean up. I use baby oil and it works but you need to scrub at it and scrape it off if it&#x27;s thick. The Gigi Brazilian hard wax is a breeze for clean up compared to this product.&lt;br /&gt;If the clean up and residue wasn&#x27;t such a headache, I would give this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I bought this wax and do not know how to clean the same. even it do not clean from body worst wax.i used few wax earlier which just clean by water. i hate this wax.</li>
            <li> The wax is Ok, took a long time to melt and is very sticky.  It removed the hair but be careful when using.  If any drop falls on the ground, it is difficult to remove.  I prefer sugar based waxes.  I would not buy this wax again.</li>
            <li> This wax is gentle, it smells good and heats up quick. It removes hair very well in my opinion. BUT its the most sticky and messy wax i&#x27;ve ever used. You have to get the temperature just right, not to hot not to cool otherwise it&#x27;s a liquid mess. And removing it from your skin, towels, floor, sink etc. is almost impossible. I highly recommend covering all surfaces with cling wrap, foil or some other disposable plastic sheet before waxing. After even the professional wax removers failed I resorted to using olive oil followed by pure eucalyptus oil - which incidently is great as it has anti-inflammatory, antiseptic and antibacterial properties. This combo worked pretty well. I won&#x27;t be buying this product again. I&#x27;m going to stick to home made sugar &#x27;wax&#x27; - cheap and water soluable.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst wax I have used.  It is beyond sticky.  In solid form is sticky, in melted form is sticky, even when done properly it leaves a sticky reside on your skin.  I have used many gigi waxes, and decided to try this.  I will not make that mistake again.  You cannot get it on anything...even the slightest amount.  It is the stickiest wax I have ever come across.</li>
            <li> i loved it definitely will purchase in the near future best wax ever and im a beginner it worked great</li>
            <li> i have used this product and it works good but it doesnt catch all the hairs so i have been buying different products but it does work</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this a try as I use azulene oil to get excess wax off when I use other brands. Unfortunately this is not a great wax. Its harsh, very thin consistency, and I just hated the result from it. I used it for my arms and face. I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few wax products, and now that I&#x27;ve gotten my practice, this is my favorite one. It comes off more cleanly with the strips than the others, and I found the stripless ones don&#x27;t come off easily. So this is the one I&#x27;m going to stick with. It&#x27;s sticky, but with practice, it&#x27;s easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li> This is great wax gets the job done and is easy to remove with oil.  I would buy it again but it has lasted 2 years just waxing my face though.</li>
            <li> Aside from this being such a sticky and messy product, it&#x27;s wonderful! If warmed right, it goes on smooth and comes off with ease. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
