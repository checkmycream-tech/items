            <li> i have thin, fine, and short hair.</li>
            <li> And not the easiest thing to grab them especially if you have long nails.</li>
            <li> Even too small to use on my toddler b/c my adult fingers can barely work these clips.</li>
            <li> These clips are much smaller than I expected...mini to the extreme.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair, so these super small clips literally hold 2-3 strands of my hair.</li>
            <li> So I will throw one of these little clips in to hold the fly-aways back</li>
            <li> Only holds a few strands of hair, literally.</li>
            <li> These work as expected.</li>
            <li> Too small to hold any hair properly.</li>
            <li> like 0.33\\&quot; wide!</li>
            <li> these msut be for babies, I have thin hair and long and they are so small  </li>
            <li> (small little buggers!)</li>

            <li> Too small to hold any hair properly. Absolutely useless. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> Extremely small. Even too small to use on my toddler b/c my adult fingers can barely work these clips. Also I just generally don&#x27;t like the way they hold the hair.</li>
            <li> this was the only place I could find this size and this was the size I use. I have very fine hair these are the only clips small enough to do the job right</li>
            <li> I actually bought these Goody clips for my own hair, because they stay in better than bobby pins.  They are tiny, but the spring is nice and strong -- very good quality.  It clamps and holds.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for a craft project. Work great as little clamps!</li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t I find these in stores?  These are great for pulling bangs back - hold very well.  I&#x27;ll keep ordering more as I lose them (small little buggers!)</li>
            <li> We purchased these for our 2-year-old&#x27;s fine curly hair and they are the perfect size.  Not too big that she notices they are in her hair but big enough that they stay in well throughout the day.  Great neutral colors are a welcomed addition to our hair accessories lot. Would work well in an adult&#x27;s fine hair, too.  Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I thought these were the small clips, as it was listed. They are very tiny in size..</li>
            <li> they were just what I wanted and after looking for quite a while,  you were the only place I could find them.</li>
            <li> They are super small but that&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for! Good for clipping small braids into place or children&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Only holds a few strands of hair, literally. Like 4-5 strands. Not the best. These clips are SUPER mini, really small.</li>
            <li> I too bought these for my own hair.  I have thin hair and wanted lots of &#x27;updo&amp;#34; options.  These are small, but great quality and I am wearing them instead of bobby-pins for more precision and a funky look.  They work great for me!  I&#x27;m ordering more now.  :-]</li>
            <li> Soooo tiny, they can be hard to work with, but I love them once they&#x27;re in my hair!</li>
            <li> These work as expected.</li>
            <li> Always love Goody! I love these clips cause I have brown curly hair and I get these fly-aways around my bangs area. Even though I don&#x27;t have bangs (just broken ends) So I will throw one of these little clips in to hold the fly-aways back and ya can even notice there in.</li>
            <li> Hard to find a good selection of these in my area.  Most of the stores have a limited selection of colors.  My daughter likes these</li>
            <li> The clips are super mini - didn&#x27;t realize when I purchased them  they would be that small. They wouldn&#x27;t hold up my hair. Needed to order larger ones</li>
            <li> these msut be for babies, I have thin hair and long and they are so small  that I really cant open the claw. slips right out of my hands, will not return just no worth the cost to send so I tossed. I wanted the bigger size like 2x this size so picture here makes it look like ones I have and needed more of</li>
            <li> Great for styling hair.</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE LITTLE CLIPS!  I have very wavy hair that does whatever it wants to -- especially on humid days.  Headbands always give me a headache.  By using 4-6 of these clips at strategic spots, I keep the curls organized and out of my face AND avoid headband headache.</li>
            <li> I love these mini hair clips and have trouble finding them in my area. Thanks to Amazon, I am able to still purchase them! They keep my medium length, layered hair up when I want to wear it in a pony tail or a bun!</li>
            <li> These are perfect for my thinning hair.  Love them and have many!</li>
            <li> Great for clipping hair back</li>
            <li> I first bought these, but I had such a hard time opening them that I ended up by the Scunci&#x27;s mini clips, which open easily.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the goody clips.  It takes two hands to open them.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, so these super small clips literally hold 2-3 strands of my hair. Even for thinner hair, they don&#x27;t hold much. They are just WAY too small.</li>
            <li> Love little clips, these are sturdy. will order again if need be, but all are in tact</li>
            <li> These clips are much smaller than I expected...mini to the extreme.  The teeth break very easily of which renders them useless.</li>
            <li> They really are MICRO! ..like 0.33\\&quot; wide! And not the easiest thing to grab them especially if you have long nails. No complains though.</li>
            <li> Work great.  Keeps my hair away from my eyes.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Way too tiny.  I cannot open them.  I threw them out.  I wish the description would have better defined just how microscopic these clips are.  Too small to use.  By the way, I m a small 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; girl....so who are these for?</li>
