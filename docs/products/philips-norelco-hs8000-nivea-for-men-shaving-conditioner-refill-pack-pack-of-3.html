            <li>I use it everday in the shower and it works great.</li>
            <li>Great, this stuff is like crack: once you start using you can&#x27;t stop.    </li>
            <li>, it looks, better, it feels better, and my girlfriend has noticed it...!!!!</li>
            <li>Plus you save a good deal when you order 3 instead of separately.</li>
            <li>Easy to insert in the shaver, nice smell!!</li>
            <li>Dunk the Coolskin in warm water and start shaving.</li>
            <li>Since I live in Alaska, this was a great deal!</li>
            <li>The Norelco HS800 Shaver is the best that I have used so far.</li>
            <li>but this lotion is by far the best option.</li>
            <li>sure if this will work for everyone,</li>
            <li>Great product ,Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>My shave is as close as it&#x27;s ever been for the most part and</li>
            <li>this shaving system is excellent and the shaving gel is a big part of the equation</li>
            <li>I have more redness with the silver bottles.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is injected right into the electric razor with this dispenser bottle, and gives you a great, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Provides an excellent \\&quot;glide\\&quot; across your face, pretty much eliminates any irritation, and moisturizes to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The foam dispenser really helps to have a good shave and in minutes, The problem is to get the refill cartridges.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, really does what it says on the box, ensures a very close and comfortable shave but quite pricey</li>
            <li>Norelco Cool Skin 7775x electric shaver that they don&#x27;t make anymore!  </li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco HS8000 Nivea for Men Shaving Conditioner Refill Pack fits the razor that I purchased this item for and works fine.</li>
            <li>Because Norelco has discontinued the razor that uses this product, it is no longer available in stores.  </li>
            <li>but I get a great shave, takes only 2-3 minutes, and my face is smooth and comfortable all day.</li>
            <li>This shaving conditioner works well and keeps skin smooth and helps to avoid razor burn.  </li>
            <li>and this was the cheapest deal I got from Amazon for a pack of three which includes free shipping.  </li>
            <li>Also, I noted that in my original review I said to inflate the cartridge then fill.</li>
            <li>Even better, it&#x27;s ready to use inside the shaver.</li>
            <li>The original re-fill cartridges were discontinued years ago and those still available being sold at very high prices - in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, went thru the trial size in about a month, went and purchased 2, 2.5 Oz replacements from Target in Clifton New Jersey, they were $6.94</li>
            <li>I am thinking about a straight razor, shaving mug and a brush!!  </li>
            <li>The whole shaving moisturizer line has been a good replacement for regular shaving.  </li>
            <li>First wet your face (warm water) and lather up with a liquid soap (I use a store brand, but any brand of liquid soap will work).</li>
            <li>If you feel the razor start to drag, dunk it again in warm water.</li>
            <li>shaver)&lt;br /&gt;That was a real plus !</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>I have been searching a box including a new tank without any success.</li>
            <li>This works very well with the Norelco Coolskin line (I use it with my 8060 model).</li>
            <li>I just received this very product</li>
            <li>The soap protects your face during the first pass, and the Nivea puts down a nice moisturizing layer on the second pass.</li>
            <li>I was surprized to find a new product chamber with each of the threee</li>
            <li>So far each box included the conditioner along with a new tank and pump attached to it.</li>
            <li>Both blue and silver has the same number, HS800, but the silver has an earlier item number, so assuming an earlier product, which isn&#x27;t as good as the newer blue label.    </li>
            <li>I just blow it up to clear the nozzle area then deflate it. .</li>
            <li>I thought I was ordering the refill, only, but it turns out each refill comes with a new plastic reservoir.  </li>

            <li> Because Norelco has discontinued the razor that uses this product, it is no longer available in stores.  The lotion is injected right into the electric razor with this dispenser bottle, and gives you a great, smooth shave.  Price and availability of this three-pack was perfect.</li>
            <li> The Norelco HS800 Shaver is the best that I have used so far. The foam dispenser really helps to have a good shave and in minutes, The problem is to get the refill cartridges. Afortunately I could get them through Amazon.  Now I use Amazon for whatever need I could have, not only books or DVD&#x27;s.  Good option!</li>
            <li> This works very well with the Norelco Coolskin line (I use it with my 8060 model). Provides an excellent \\&quot;glide\\&quot; across your face, pretty much eliminates any irritation, and moisturizes to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pricy, however, and I&#x27;ve found that if you take a few preparation steps you can use a lot less without sacrificing comfort. First wet your face (warm water) and lather up with a liquid soap (I use a store brand, but any brand of liquid soap will work). Don&#x27;t rinse. Dunk the Coolskin in warm water and start shaving. If you feel the razor start to drag, dunk it again in warm water. Do a single pass over your face. Then, dispense the Nivia lotion, and make a second pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I end up hitting the dispenser button only once or twice per shave, so the bottle of Nivea lasts for months. The soap protects your face during the first pass, and the Nivea puts down a nice moisturizing layer on the second pass. And, it&#x27;s a lot less messy than using shaving cream or foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if this will work for everyone, but I get a great shave, takes only 2-3 minutes, and my face is smooth and comfortable all day.</li>
            <li> Great product ,Fast shipping. I was surprized to find a new product chamber with each of the threee I bought(Part of shaver)&lt;br /&gt;That was a real plus !</li>
            <li> I have had the shaver for over a year and it is perfect.  I use it everday in the shower and it works great.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, went thru the trial size in about a month, went and purchased 2, 2.5 Oz replacements from Target in Clifton New Jersey, they were $6.94 each.    Cheapest price I found.</li>
            <li> The whole shaving moisturizer line has been a good replacement for regular shaving.  My shave is as close as it&#x27;s ever been for the most part and the best part is I no longer have the nicks and blood trickling on my face as I used to.  I recommend this to anyone who is tired of cutting themselves with an old fashioned razor.</li>
            <li> Since I live in Alaska, this was a great deal! Plus you save a good deal when you order 3 instead of separately. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products, including regular shaving foam and gel but this lotion is by far the best option. Even better, it&#x27;s ready to use inside the shaver.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my uncle along with a Norelco razor and cleaning gel for the razor.  This shaving conditioner works well and keeps skin smooth and helps to avoid razor burn.  He loved it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner with my philips shaver for years now. So far each box included the conditioner along with a new tank and pump attached to it. Suddenly the conditioner is now sold without the tank and pump. I wonder if this is very sanitary and how long this little pump will last. I have been reusing now the same tank and pump for a few months. I have been searching a box including a new tank without any success.</li>
            <li> this shaving system is excellent and the shaving gel is a big part of the equation</li>
            <li> I have been using the Phillips Norelco shaver from the last two years. This moisturizer conditioner is a consumable and I found after exhaustive research from all the stores including online and this was the cheapest deal I got from Amazon for a pack of three which includes free shipping.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, really does what it says on the box, ensures a very close and comfortable shave but quite pricey (1.5 bottles a month are required...), hence four rather than five stars.    RA</li>
            <li> Purchased 2 bottles same brand at Walmart $4.67 a bottle 2.5oz. on May 9, 2010</li>
            <li> Wrong Product Sent, Site shows Blue Bottle, Sent Silver.  Their site show the blue bottle, the one you want.    Both blue and silver has the same number, HS800, but the silver has an earlier item number, so assuming an earlier product, which isn&#x27;t as good as the newer blue label.    I have more redness with the silver bottles.  Nivea is screwed anyway, cause no way can you get 3 months out of this bottle.    So be Warned!  You want the blue bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! Now my skin has no irritation, it looks, better, it feels better, and my girlfriend has noticed it...!!!! Easy to insert in the shaver, nice smell!! I´m happy with this product!!!!</li>
            <li> Great, this stuff is like crack: once you start using you can&#x27;t stop.    But this is a ripoff.  They&#x27;re $6.99 each at Wal-mart and Target.</li>
            <li> I just received this very product so I could refill my HQ 170 cartridges (maybe HQ160 too) for my Cool-skin Norelco  6701x and 7735X shavers. The original re-fill cartridges were discontinued years ago and those still available being sold at very high prices - in my opinion. Anyway, I removed the empty cartridge from my 6701X; carefully pulled out the little pump device; rinsed it off; blew it up  the cartridge like you do a a balloon; attached the empty cartridge to the injector stem on the HS8000 refill can; and carefully pumped in the shaving lotion - just a pump or two does it; re-installed the little pump; and put it back in the razor.  There is some waste, but it is minimal. Worked like a champ for me. Since I had to buy 3 cans, I think my razors will be long worn out before I use it up. I do not know if the HS800 refills will work. This is the HS 8000. They could be the same, but I like to stick with what works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11/6/2017.  Just opened a second can. So it does last awhile. Also, I noted that in my original review I said to inflate the cartridge then fill. I forgot to say to deflate it before filling. I just blow it up to clear the nozzle area then deflate it. . With a little practice, very little waste.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco HS8000 Nivea for Men Shaving Conditioner Refill Pack fits the razor that I purchased this item for and works fine.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and as described</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering the refill, only, but it turns out each refill comes with a new plastic reservoir.  Seems like a lot of wasted material that probably drives the cost.  I lilke the razor and the lotion but would rather just refill it with lotion vice lotion and a plastic replacement part. How hard can it be to just design a permanent reservoir for the lotion?  And why are the cans (yes cans) so small?  Didn&#x27;t Germans design this stuff?  Isn&#x27;t German engineering some of the best in the world?  Why so much waste?  I am thinking about a straight razor, shaving mug and a brush!!  Why is everytning so damned complicated?</li>
            <li> My husband loves this</li>
            <li> got this to fill up those little Nivea shaving cartridges that go in my &amp;#34;antique&amp;#34; Norelco Cool Skin 7775x electric shaver that they don&#x27;t make anymore!  :(((  Very messy to try to refill those cartridges!</li>
