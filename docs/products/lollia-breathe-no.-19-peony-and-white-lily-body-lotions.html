            <li>It smell good, it&#x27;s not greasy, and it&#x27;s one of Oprah&#x27;s favorite things.</li>
            <li>Not too greasy and smells nice.</li>
            <li>A very light, flowery, summer fragrance to be sure - and leaves your hands feeling pampered!</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing hand cremes.</li>
            <li>I like it much better than L&#x27;Occitane which leaves my hands feeling kind of greasy.  </li>
            <li>Love this hand cream.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>but this one is my favorite one for now.</li>
            <li>I had to try it and ever since it&#x27;s been one of my favorite things, too.</li>
            <li>Love it as I do all the Lollia products.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to make your hands smell and feel great.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this cream...</li>
            <li>Love this scent.</li>
            <li>I enjoy being able to easily spread this all over my forearms as well, without becoming overly fragrant.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this many years ago.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong.</li>
            <li>this tube is too large for carrying around, so I&#x27;m on the lookout for more!</li>
            <li>Just a wonderful texture, so rich and creamy, unlike any other creme I have tried.</li>
            <li>Lightly scented.</li>
            <li>Few hand creams smell as wonderful as this one.  </li>
            <li>it was thicker/creamier and more moisturizing; the lightness and thin-ness of the product makes me have to reapply it several times before my skin is moisturized and 2) if its smell had more character and allure rather than the most neutral floral scent I&#x27;ve ever smelled.</li>
            <li>Shea with a fresh scent!</li>
            <li>Clean scent and non greasy</li>
            <li>The smell is light, and the cream absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>I place an order right away as I never want to run out!</li>
            <li>Love it so much that I bought two of them.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is fresh and light.</li>
            <li>(even the box is pretty!).  </li>
            <li>So dainty and delicate.</li>
            <li>totally worth it</li>
            <li>Costly but worth it as a splurge.</li>
            <li>This product is okay, but I wasn&#x27;t wild about it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money</li>
            <li>By far my favorite hand lotion - worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth every dollar.</li>
            <li>The unique peony and white lily fragrance has become my favorite.</li>
            <li>It also soothes after a long shift of alcohol based hand sanitizers, gloves, washing, and more hand sanitizer!  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and the scent is wonderful, like you just got out of the shower using a flowery shower gel.  </li>
            <li>If you are in an industry where washing hands is an absolute MUST; this is the hand cream for you!</li>
            <li>it smells like fresh flowers and isn&#x27;t greasy at all, so it makes your hands super soft.</li>
            <li>Like everything about it except the container, It would be more beautiful and easy manipulated if the container is made of rubber or plastic like other modern tube creams, it is hard to open and close, I had to empty it to a used  bath and body hand cream container I had before.</li>
            <li>Unlike many hand cremes, it&#x27;s very moisturizing and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a really long way and it smells sooo good.</li>
            <li>It has a very delicate scent which does not overpower but even better it absorbs quickly and leaves your hands feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need too much to moisturize my hands, so a tube will last ~6 months +.  </li>
            <li>Not real heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li>it does not leave an oily residue, is easy to distribute, and the smell is subtle and sweet (although it makes me think of a nice, plain, boring, innocent, all-American girl.)</li>
            <li>(just different, neither better nor worse).</li>

            <li> Perfect splurge for my about-to-be daughter-in-law.  A jillion dollars, but totally worth it (even the box is pretty!).  It is the only hand lotion I&#x27;ve ever used that isn&#x27;t all greasy.</li>
            <li> Love this hand cream. Does a wonderful job keeping my skin moist.</li>

            <li> My favorite!  Smells soooo good!!</li>
            <li> Great hand lotion.  Never greasy</li>
            <li> If you are in an industry where washing hands is an absolute MUST; this is the hand cream for you! After years of bartending and now going into nursing, this lotion has been a staple!  I can put this on and still pick up wet glasses and not have to worry about dropping them.  The sanitizer behind the bar is very harsh for disinfecting and this stays on for hours of repeated hand-washing of bar glasswear.  It also soothes after a long shift of alcohol based hand sanitizers, gloves, washing, and more hand sanitizer!  It is coveted in both fields!</li>
            <li> LOVE this scent!!!  Good hand lotion</li>
            <li> I like that it does not leave an oily residue, is easy to distribute, and the smell is subtle and sweet (although it makes me think of a nice, plain, boring, innocent, all-American girl.) The design does not look like it does in the product photo (just different, neither better nor worse). I enjoy being able to easily spread this all over my forearms as well, without becoming overly fragrant.  I would give it 5 stars if 1) it was thicker/creamier and more moisturizing; the lightness and thin-ness of the product makes me have to reapply it several times before my skin is moisturized and 2) if its smell had more character and allure rather than the most neutral floral scent I&#x27;ve ever smelled.</li>
            <li> I just love this product. Lightly scented. Not real heavy on my skin. I have tried  the different scents ... but this one is my favorite one for now. It comes in a beautiful box. Perfect for gift giving.</li>
            <li> Oprah selected this hand creme for her &amp;#34;Favorite Things&amp;#34; giveaway. I had to try it and ever since it&#x27;s been one of my favorite things, too. The unique peony and white lily fragrance has become my favorite. Unlike many hand cremes, it&#x27;s very moisturizing and long lasting. It&#x27;s well worth the money and I would heartily recommend it for yourself or as a gift––the packaging is beautiful.</li>
            <li> I love this wonderful scent and the light great feeling lotion! When I start running low I place an order right away as I never want to run out!</li>
            <li> Love it as I do all the Lollia products. It doesn&#x27;t take much to make your hands smell and feel great. Pamper yourself or someone else. This is a great place to start!</li>
            <li> Best hand cream of all time...hands down.  Love this stuff, but it is SO EXPENSIVE!!!  I don&#x27;t need too much to moisturize my hands, so a tube will last ~6 months +.  The smell is light, and the cream absorbs quickly.  I like it much better than L&#x27;Occitane which leaves my hands feeling kind of greasy.

            <li> Husband said I smelled like his grandma. That&#x27;s the smell I was going for.</li>
            <li> Not too greasy and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Few hand creams smell as wonderful as this one.  I would recommend it to anyone who would like a soothing cream with a delightful fresh&lt;br /&gt;scent.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy, not too perfumey, not too greasy.  I keep a tube of this lotion at my desk.  A little bit goes a really long way and it smells sooo good. By far my favorite hand lotion - worth the price.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing. That&#x27;s all I can say! Worth every dollar.</li>
            <li> Love! Love! Love! This cream...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cream... it smells like fresh flowers and isn&#x27;t greasy at all, so it makes your hands super soft. this is going to be my go to Christmas present for a lot of people this year</li>
            <li> It smells amazing !!! This is my most favorite fragrance!!!</li>
            <li> I like this brand and product and very good smell. Unfortunately the box was smashed when I opened the package~!</li>
            <li> Shea with a fresh scent!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this many years ago.  A little goes a long way and the scent is wonderful, like you just got out of the shower using a flowery shower gel.  Love it so much that I bought two of them. One for home and one for my purse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this cream and was so happy amazon had it in stock.</li>
            <li> Beautiful light scent.  Not too strong.</li>
            <li> I love this! The fragrance is fresh and light. Not greasy at all. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Love this scent. So dainty and delicate.</li>
