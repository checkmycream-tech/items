            <li>/&gt;They arn&#x27;t the biggest, but they work for me and hold a good amount for anyone who doesn&#x27;t need horse pills -- and I believe they even offer an XL size if you do?&lt;br</li>

            <li>I love pill case it work really great</li>
            <li>Because I take a good number pills, it would be quite the annoyance to have to pick them up from my purse if the lids spontaneously opened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it and find it very handy when traveling.</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>i love this set!</li>
            <li>, that was a must, my Aunt is now filling her own meds.</li>
            <li>Since he is always on the go and often forgets to take care of his own needs, this pill organizer could literally be a life-saver for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Helps me be more organized, which is always good.</li>
            <li>Too bulky to carry in a bag of any kind.</li>
            <li>These are handy, but after some use the printed lettering is beginning to wear off.</li>
            <li>The product is Ideal for exactly and serve the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Ever since I&#x27;ve had to take more than one kind of pill four times a day</li>
            <li>I put all the pills I need at the beginning of each week so that it&#x27;s easy for me to grab and go during the week!  </li>
            <li>Very handy to take along a days worth.</li>
            <li>This pill case set is a great idea that allows for each day to be a separate grouping which is quite handy when you have a large number of pills each day to take.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s very secure.  </li>
            <li>I see if company write on number like 1,2,3,4 than it will become more helpful for those who wear eyeglass.</li>
            <li>Love this product compare to the carrying case I have now that I keep in my pocket, now I have one for every each day and can fill all of them up once a week instead of every morning,</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t think I would be able to find one like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li>Perfect for daily, on the go use.</li>
            <li>Amazon has many choices, this fit the bill for our needs!  </li>
            <li>I love this style -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with this pill box organizer.</li>
            <li>It worked out better than having to wait for it to be received, processed and then replaced.</li>
            <li>I use the 4 boxes for morning and evening pills and that way I am able to fill 2 weeks of pills at one time.</li>
            <li>Then I throw the appropriate day box into my purse each morning.  </li>
            <li>I can also make sure that I took my meds for the day just by checking the appropriate day.  </li>
            <li>and I take more than 10 pills a day.</li>
            <li>I love this product for that reason.</li>
            <li>I love the color coded boxes.</li>
            <li>Would not recommend if you need more than two pills in each 1/4 square.</li>
            <li>maybe too many meds??</li>
            <li>it is better suited to my needs</li>
            <li>I should have paid more attention to the size.</li>
            <li>I love these boxes.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for featuring this great product for those of us who can&#x27;t seem to remember when to take our pills.</li>
            <li>I had looked everywhere for this set of pill boxes and so pleased when I found the set on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love these boxes for the most part, until it is time to fill them.</li>
            <li>you can not put more than 4 capsules/vitamins in one box</li>
            <li>This is one of the best products for dispensing multiple medicines I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>okay, airline chipped a piece off where the clip was, but again 6+ years and counting and the rest of the days are holding strong,printed words have worn off a lot, but love this product.</li>
            <li>I considered many pill cases and am glad I went with this one.</li>
            <li>The best feature is that if the kids are going to Grandma&#x27;s for the afternoon, we can just take that day&#x27;s case and hand it to her without having to transport the whole week&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>love that the tops are translucent</li>
            <li>so it saves even more space.</li>
            <li>these are ok..</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and with them divided appropriately</li>
            <li>It would be much better to have it done by the company.</li>
            <li>Many thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i had to get 4 more to make</li>
            <li>Besides that, this item is a good buy, seems to be of good quality, and hopefully will last for many many uses.</li>
            <li>I would say that is pretty d&#x3D;&#x3D; good.</li>
            <li>But after 4 years, and all the travels they did I was very happy with the original set, and this is exactly like the first.</li>
            <li>I love the product and it does fit my needs.</li>
            <li>Nice and colorful.  </li>
            <li>These are great because they are very secure so don&#x27;t open in my pocket or purse.</li>
            <li>but it is easy to read (Numeric) 1,2,3,4.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy for me to separate the pills I need during which time of the day.  </li>
            <li>but it is easy to use and serves its purpose.  </li>
            <li>Easy to read</li>
            <li>It is so easy to grab and go.</li>
            <li>This is a great product if you have viatamins that are big and need to take them more than once a day.</li>
            <li>I wanted something portable &amp; easy for me to keep on schedule of meds</li>
            <li>easy storage.</li>
            <li>This product makes it easy to carry with you all your medications for the day.  </li>
            <li>This pill organizer is compact and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Making it easy to pour pills into your hand.</li>
            <li>It is easy to carry with me in my purse also.</li>
            <li>strongly recommend the product.&lt;br /&gt;Navin Patel</li>
            <li>During the dryer months, my vitamins stayed fine without the zip lock.</li>
            <li>More than adequate for my needs.</li>
            <li>If you have more than 3 medium to large size pills for a time period - they might not all fit!  </li>
            <li>Then again, my pills are huge and plentiful.</li>
            <li>Great Size. can fit some of your larger sized Pills.</li>
            <li>All of my mother&#x27;s 23 pills fit with plenty of room leftover.</li>
            <li>Great after several months!</li>
            <li>Lids are secure and I have had no problems with mine or this one.</li>
            <li>But, still fit a lot of pills.  </li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t fit comfortably in a pocket.</li>
            <li>I know it takes up more counter space, but it&#x27;s worth it for ease of use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d guess up to three or even four of these would fit in one slot, or</li>
            <li>Use this everyday to keep all my vitamins in order and it is so great if you are on the go!</li>
            <li>Anyhow, to fill this up a week at a time, I have to take all seven containers out and line them up so that all of the morning/noon sections are at the bottom, just to make sure I will be putting the right stuff in the correct time slot.</li>
            <li>The square shape allows me to fit all the pills in that I need in each section and it fits excellent in my purse taking up very little space.</li>
            <li>They are a slimmer version of the original.  </li>
            <li>Easy to access and easy to keep straight.</li>
            <li>i take a lot of medicines, and there&#x27;s so much space in the cases.. and they still fit right in my pocket just fine!</li>
            <li>looks like well built and should open and close good</li>
            <li>He works full time, runs a business on the side AND does volunteer work.</li>
            <li>This pill organizer is good but not as deep</li>
            <li>This is just good enough to keep at home.</li>
            <li>The color coding and lettering make it nice and clear</li>
            <li>product is a great Idea, but it needs more technical and ergonomics designing.&lt;br /&gt;The hinge&#x27;s (plastic) easily break after several months of use.</li>
            <li>and this makes it pretty darn easy.  </li>
            <li>The idea is good but in my case I need a deeper box, to fit my first and last vitamins for the day</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are other ones out there that might work even better, but I do need to be able to take the day&#x27;s worth of stuff with me to work too.</li>
            <li>I have personally found the four compartment, inch deep pill box the best for my needs.  </li>
            <li>She was forgetting to take pills, so this quickly organized her and monitors if she took all her pills for the day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They seem to be constructed adequately.</li>
            <li>Lol and my monday morning section cover broke during a trip through baggage, after a while covers don&#x27;t stay down as well, quick tip, squeeze the front of the box below where it clips on</li>
            <li>Literally, it&#x27;s a great grab and go concept for the active person!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what my grandmother needs!</li>
            <li>The color coding is nice as we can quickly see that both kids are on the same color day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some of my supplements are rather large, but I can fit 3 of them into one of the compartments.  </li>
            <li>It might be possible to design something with real hinges and fasteners that are secure but more easily opened</li>
            <li>This little pack is great.  </li>
            <li>I have traumatic brain injury after constantly forgetting and mixing up my meds my wife picked up these and they&#x27;re amazing</li>
            <li>I have been using this same kind of pill boxes for about 10 years.</li>
            <li>I must add that the finishing and actual product looks nice as well.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>it worth the money</li>
            <li>These pill boxes are a nice way for her to to count out and organize her pills into the specific times of day that she has to take them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also handy to alert a  person to when you&#x27;re running low on pills, since,</li>
            <li>Her kids even have fun helping her set up the containers for the week.</li>
            <li>I have had this 7Day Pill Dispenser for the last two years to have my mother&#x27;s medicines handy for her keepers.</li>
            <li>This is a very handy little organizer for pills.</li>
            <li>Now I can fill an entire weeks worth of pills for myself very easily.</li>
            <li>Perfect, convenient and small enough to still fit in my pockets.</li>
            <li>night, you never forget which pills to take at the right time.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>but will be replace right away.</li>
            <li>Cannot compare to similar products since it is the first of its kind that I use.</li>
            <li>Great for small pills.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough how great these are: portable, colorful, and simple.</li>
            <li>Best pill cases made,Sturdy,close tightly andbig enough to hold alot of pills.</li>
            <li>Great products has place for all my daily meds.took 3 individual ones on a,recebt trip.</li>
            <li>So far, because it is a bit of a hassle to try to fill each box, I haven&#x27;t filled a week&#x27;s worth and used them that way.</li>
            <li>Great size, fits a giant prenatal with another couple of smaller pills in one of the four sections.</li>
            <li>I was worried b/c the depth and size of the compartments was smaller than I expected; however, all of my med&#x27;s fit perfectly and this includes a big ol mucinex-d pill!  </li>
            <li>I like this pill organizer very much.  </li>
            <li>It is with different color for each day this I like most.</li>
            <li>I love the four different compartments</li>
            <li>This makes my morning routine so much easier!</li>
            <li>at many different times of day!  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for and could not find it in the stores.</li>
            <li>This is really a convenient product!</li>
            <li>I take about 10-15 vitamins throughout the day; this pill organizer is appropriately sized for all the vitamins I need on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>The first order I received was defective.</li>
            <li>It is the best system I have found to do just that in such a small amount of space.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Theses dispensers make my life so much easier!  </li>
            <li>I purchased the larger size and have been satisfied</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when all my meds and supplement fit.</li>
            <li>This pill dispenser was exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>I have gotten as many as 9 pills in one mini-compartment, but most were small.</li>
            <li>Identical to the first.  </li>
            <li>and when, I got this as a gift over 6 years ago, I love it, had not been able to find anything similar since only problem i have had</li>
            <li>so my husband and I can look and see if any more pills are in a section without having to open it.</li>
            <li>If something happens, she doesn&#x27;t lose a whole bottle, but just one dose or day&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for and needed.</li>
            <li>If life was like these rainbow colored daily organizers, the world would be a better place.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what my dad needed to stay organized.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed for my meds.  </li>
            <li>and I have bought 2 more recently.</li>
            <li>As a large volume medication taker, it took me a while to find something that could handle a whole days worth without needing to remember which</li>
            <li>Keeps it perfectly organized and marked so that she doesn&#x27;t get confused.</li>
            <li>all ready I want to buy more in later</li>
            <li>for those who need to take many pills every day and for long time&lt;br</li>
            <li>Compartments are decent size although if you take more than 4 biggies, several times a day this will be snug.</li>
            <li>I take numerous medications throughout the day and this works as a true reminder !</li>
            <li>Each container has 4 opening and each one is easy to open and close.</li>
            <li>They are so easy to take along individually too.  </li>
            <li>Convenient access to daily meds, easy to take with for trips.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space, is easy to use, has sections for four (4) different times each day.  </li>
            <li>This product will hold large pills if you need to take them.</li>
            <li>B001CDZPN6 Four-a-day, Weekly, One Day At a Time, Medication Organizer - Large]].</li>
            <li>Great to get 4 weeks worth of pills in such a small space.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to slip one of the pill boxes into a purse or pocket, which makes taking pills so much easier, especially when on the go.</li>
            <li>I really like the design Idea, but they break so easily from wear after about  6-8 months of constant use.</li>
            <li>so you had better have not too many pills to take (or they had better be small), or you will have trouble using them.</li>
            <li>The size of the individual compartments is fine for my pills, but if you have lots of vitamin or mineral pills, get the7PACK with the 1&amp;#34</li>
            <li>This is a nice little case.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>i like things organized so this is working really well for me...</li>
            <li>We really like the pill boxes.</li>
            <li>Additionally, it does not take up too much room on the kitchen counter.</li>
            <li>Placing it in a shirt pocket should not be much of a problem and it won&#x27;t take up much room in a purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So the user really needs to determine how much space is needed for the pills to be taken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This container allows me to keep 4 weeks of medications ready to distribute when needed.  </li>
            <li>This helps so much in keeping the pills i need for that day and keeping it organized.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>You can plan the whole week and just carry around the days pills.</li>
            <li>However, I wish each section were a bigger to fit all the pills I have.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My big vitamins and arthritis pills fit in with room to spare.</li>
            <li>so they&#x27;re always ready.</li>
            <li>Thanks...</li>
            <li>I am really someone who does not like to be tied to my house for taking all the pills I have to..</li>
            <li>very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>These hold a reasonable number of pills in each slot.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient to carry and keep pills organized.</li>
            <li>but I probably wouldn&#x27;t want to spend as much as that would cost.</li>
            <li>The color coding is very helpful.</li>
            <li>thank you so much.</li>
            <li>And sure enough, it&#x27;s crystal clear for him.</li>
            <li>We have two children with special needs, each of whom takes several pills per day.</li>
            <li>The good part (compact size) affects the overall size (less area for pills).  </li>
            <li>Furthermore, the small, four-compartment box fits nicely into my purse and it&#x27;s comforting to know that I have the day&#x27;s supply with me at all times.</li>
            <li>/&gt;He has been doing very well remembering to take his newly prescribed medications</li>
            <li>These boxes have simplified my life and have made the process of taking what I need to take to stay healthy less of a chore.old.  </li>
            <li>These boxes have simplified my life and have made the process of taking what I need to take to stay healthy less of a chore.</li>
            <li>Some of the pills need to be spaced out and/or taken at particular times.</li>
            <li>It is super convenient to just open one tab and toss all the pills into your mouth at once.</li>
            <li>Each day is a different color and is printed in bold type.</li>
            <li>In the past, being forgetful and not having the means to carry many bottles of supplements with me meant I missed most of my doses.  </li>
            <li>The compartments are large enough for several tablets and easily removed and carried in the pocket for a trip.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>In just the \\&quot;Morning\\&quot; section, it can easily hold a large calcium tab, a large fish oil capsule, an extra large potassium tablet, as well as three other pills.</li>
            <li>This pill box is easy to organize and is very helpful in keeping track of different pills taken at different times of day.</li>
            <li>May be OK for smallish Rx pills and tablets, but way too small for large vitamins and supplements.</li>
            <li>I take quite a few supplements as well as prescription meds, so I ended up ordering the deeper version of these that hold more pills.</li>
            <li>But once I got them all open, the hinges loosened and they all open and shut easily now.</li>
            <li>The 7 Day Pill Pack daily containers are easy to use and have enough room to place the medications that I use each day in the compartments.  </li>
            <li>I had to make another order rather than return and then get a new pill box set.</li>
            <li>The back is flat and easy to apply a logo.</li>
            <li>Very helpful when trying to manage a senior citizen&#x27;s medicine but yet give them as much independence as possible.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t imagine an older adult or someone with arthritis opening these.</li>
            <li>So far, the compartments stay shut as well!  </li>
            <li>(it works better for opening and closing for a while before i need to change it, now and again a small pill will stick to it, but otherwise, works</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but small and not a convenient as i thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Good way to set up pills for an entire week, but only for a few pills in each section.</li>
            <li>It takes up very little room, which I like, but each day pack is large enough for 12 large capsules or even more smaller pills.</li>
            <li>The first set lasted 4 years of daily use, and really there were only a couple of days that didn&#x27;t always seal shut.</li>
            <li>Easily fits 3 standard capsule pills in each compartment and with careful placement can get 4.  </li>
            <li>The individual compartments (morning, noon, evening, and bedtime) are printed in a smaller type font, but still fairly bold.</li>
            <li>Was a  tight fit and had to strategically place them</li>
            <li>If taking a lot of vitamins then they won&#x27;t be large enough.</li>
            <li>but if you take a large amt of supplements you might want to get the one with DEEP compartments.</li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for - four compartments that are large enough for all of my meds for morning &amp; evening!</li>
            <li>The compartments were tough to open which is good to prevent spills in purses or pockets</li>
            <li>which day I am on and it also makes it clear when I am going to need a refill on my medication.</li>
            <li>No one wants to be saddled with necessary medication, especially at such a young age, but this is at least one way to manage the pills effectively and discretely.</li>
            <li>This one replaced an old one that I had.  </li>
            <li>and it seems to be an answer to a prayer so far.</li>
            <li>And, it took me awhile before I figured this out, but the lid component will lift out completely for ease of dosing out the pills.</li>
            <li>I wanted something that could fit several pills, on different times of the day, but also that wasn&#x27;t so bulky or just a daily pill holder.</li>
            <li>My only problem is the names of the day and parts of the day rub off to fast.</li>
            <li>well worth every dime I spent</li>
            <li>While I like the organizer once it is filled, it is seriously a pain to actually fill it up with a week&#x27;s worth of pills.</li>
            <li>its color coded &amp; bold black letters of the days of d week.</li>
            <li>The sections are large enough for all my pills (I take 16 different ones).  </li>
            <li>My mother recently accidentally took too much of a new medication.</li>
            <li>Have been using them lightly for the last few months.</li>
            <li>There is enough room for a pretty large multi-mitamin and quite a few pills besides.</li>
            <li>surprised at the way the product was shipped through the mail, it was only in a plastic shipping bag, with no packing material inside, but it made it intact.</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t have enough pills left to fill them for the week, you know to call and ask for refills prior to running out, especially since most doctor offices need a few days to follow up on a prescription request, not to mention they being unavailable on the weekends.  </li>
            <li>I can pack a few days&#x27; worth and toss them in my purse for trips.  </li>
            <li>A bit too small for my needs but a good idea for a person with tiny pills, small amount of pills.</li>
            <li>This four compartment,1/2 inch deep pill box actually holds less pills than the two compartment 1/2 inch deep pill box that is available.  </li>
            <li>Individual days of this set is small enough for a mans pants pocket or ladies purse, easily.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;ll be fine for a while longer, so other than keeping my monday taped down with duct tape,</li>
            <li>is that it is nice and compact as it hardly takes up any room, but that&#x27;s because of how each day is set up, which is what my main complaint is above.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The day is clearly labeled which is key because of different medication schedules.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste precious time everyday trying to figure out what you need to take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Having the days of the week in separate, small containers is convenient so my daughter can bring just one day&#x27;s worth in her purse.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no need for her to remember whether she took an earlier dose because one look in the divided compartment will indicate whether a particular slot or dose is empty.  </li>
            <li>I take several pills, three times a day and my old 7-day organizer simply wasn&#x27;t big enough to hold my meds and vitamins.  </li>
            <li>If you have to take quite a few large pills, however, you may want to consider another option (see image gallery).  </li>
            <li>Great for cutting down on time in the mornings when I can do all my meds for the week at once!</li>

            <li> I love pill case it work really great</li>
            <li> Because I take a good number pills, it would be quite the annoyance to have to pick them up from my purse if the lids spontaneously opened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it and find it very handy when traveling.</li>
            <li> I love these!</li>
            <li> I love these!</li>
            <li> i love this set!</li>
            <li> , that was a must, my Aunt is now filling her own meds.</li>
            <li> Since he is always on the go and often forgets to take care of his own needs, this pill organizer could literally be a life-saver for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Helps me be more organized, which is always good.</li>
            <li> Too bulky to carry in a bag of any kind.</li>
            <li> These are handy, but after some use the printed lettering is beginning to wear off.</li>
            <li> The product is Ideal for exactly and serve the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Ever since I&#x27;ve had to take more than one kind of pill four times a day</li>
            <li> I put all the pills I need at the beginning of each week so that it&#x27;s easy for me to grab and go during the week!  </li>
            <li> Very handy to take along a days worth.</li>
            <li> This pill case set is a great idea that allows for each day to be a separate grouping which is quite handy when you have a large number of pills each day to take.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very secure.  </li>
            <li> I see if company write on number like 1,2,3,4 than it will become more helpful for those who wear eyeglass.</li>
            <li> Love this product compare to the carrying case I have now that I keep in my pocket, now I have one for every each day and can fill all of them up once a week instead of every morning,</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think I would be able to find one like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> Perfect for daily, on the go use.</li>
            <li> Amazon has many choices, this fit the bill for our needs!  </li>
            <li> I love this style -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with this pill box organizer.</li>
            <li> It worked out better than having to wait for it to be received, processed and then replaced.</li>
            <li> I use the 4 boxes for morning and evening pills and that way I am able to fill 2 weeks of pills at one time.</li>
            <li> Then I throw the appropriate day box into my purse each morning.  </li>
            <li> I can also make sure that I took my meds for the day just by checking the appropriate day.  </li>
            <li> and I take more than 10 pills a day.</li>
            <li> I love this product for that reason.</li>
            <li> I love the color coded boxes.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend if you need more than two pills in each 1/4 square.</li>
            <li> maybe too many meds??</li>
            <li> it is better suited to my needs</li>
            <li> I should have paid more attention to the size.</li>
            <li> I love these boxes.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for featuring this great product for those of us who can&#x27;t seem to remember when to take our pills.</li>
            <li> I had looked everywhere for this set of pill boxes and so pleased when I found the set on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love these boxes for the most part, until it is time to fill them.</li>
            <li> you can not put more than 4 capsules/vitamins in one box</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products for dispensing multiple medicines I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> okay, airline chipped a piece off where the clip was, but again 6+ years and counting and the rest of the days are holding strong,printed words have worn off a lot, but love this product.</li>
            <li> I considered many pill cases and am glad I went with this one.</li>
            <li> The best feature is that if the kids are going to Grandma&#x27;s for the afternoon, we can just take that day&#x27;s case and hand it to her without having to transport the whole week&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> love that the tops are translucent</li>
            <li> so it saves even more space.</li>
            <li> these are ok..</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and with them divided appropriately</li>
            <li> It would be much better to have it done by the company.</li>
            <li> Many thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i had to get 4 more to make</li>
            <li> Besides that, this item is a good buy, seems to be of good quality, and hopefully will last for many many uses.</li>
            <li> I would say that is pretty d&#x3D;&#x3D; good.</li>
            <li> But after 4 years, and all the travels they did I was very happy with the original set, and this is exactly like the first.</li>
            <li> I love the product and it does fit my needs.</li>
            <li> Nice and colorful.  </li>
            <li> These are great because they are very secure so don&#x27;t open in my pocket or purse.</li>
            <li> but it is easy to read (Numeric) 1,2,3,4.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy for me to separate the pills I need during which time of the day.  </li>
            <li> but it is easy to use and serves its purpose.  </li>
            <li> Easy to read</li>
            <li> It is so easy to grab and go.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you have viatamins that are big and need to take them more than once a day.</li>
            <li> I wanted something portable &amp; easy for me to keep on schedule of meds</li>
            <li> easy storage.</li>
            <li> This product makes it easy to carry with you all your medications for the day.  </li>
            <li> This pill organizer is compact and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Making it easy to pour pills into your hand.</li>
            <li> It is easy to carry with me in my purse also.</li>
            <li> strongly recommend the product.&lt;br /&gt;Navin Patel</li>
            <li> During the dryer months, my vitamins stayed fine without the zip lock.</li>
            <li> More than adequate for my needs.</li>
            <li> If you have more than 3 medium to large size pills for a time period - they might not all fit!  </li>
            <li> Then again, my pills are huge and plentiful.</li>
            <li> Great Size. can fit some of your larger sized Pills.</li>
            <li> All of my mother&#x27;s 23 pills fit with plenty of room leftover.</li>
            <li> Great after several months!</li>
            <li> Lids are secure and I have had no problems with mine or this one.</li>
            <li> But, still fit a lot of pills.  </li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t fit comfortably in a pocket.</li>
            <li> I know it takes up more counter space, but it&#x27;s worth it for ease of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d guess up to three or even four of these would fit in one slot, or</li>
            <li> Use this everyday to keep all my vitamins in order and it is so great if you are on the go!</li>
            <li> Anyhow, to fill this up a week at a time, I have to take all seven containers out and line them up so that all of the morning/noon sections are at the bottom, just to make sure I will be putting the right stuff in the correct time slot.</li>
            <li> The square shape allows me to fit all the pills in that I need in each section and it fits excellent in my purse taking up very little space.</li>
            <li> They are a slimmer version of the original.  </li>
            <li> Easy to access and easy to keep straight.</li>
            <li> i take a lot of medicines, and there&#x27;s so much space in the cases.. and they still fit right in my pocket just fine!</li>
            <li> looks like well built and should open and close good</li>
            <li> He works full time, runs a business on the side AND does volunteer work.</li>
            <li> This pill organizer is good but not as deep</li>
            <li> This is just good enough to keep at home.</li>
            <li> The color coding and lettering make it nice and clear</li>
            <li> product is a great Idea, but it needs more technical and ergonomics designing.&lt;br /&gt;The hinge&#x27;s (plastic) easily break after several months of use.</li>
            <li> and this makes it pretty darn easy.  </li>
            <li> The idea is good but in my case I need a deeper box, to fit my first and last vitamins for the day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are other ones out there that might work even better, but I do need to be able to take the day&#x27;s worth of stuff with me to work too.</li>
            <li> I have personally found the four compartment, inch deep pill box the best for my needs.  </li>
            <li> She was forgetting to take pills, so this quickly organized her and monitors if she took all her pills for the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They seem to be constructed adequately.</li>
            <li> Lol and my monday morning section cover broke during a trip through baggage, after a while covers don&#x27;t stay down as well, quick tip, squeeze the front of the box below where it clips on</li>
            <li> Literally, it&#x27;s a great grab and go concept for the active person!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what my grandmother needs!</li>
            <li> The color coding is nice as we can quickly see that both kids are on the same color day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some of my supplements are rather large, but I can fit 3 of them into one of the compartments.  </li>
            <li> It might be possible to design something with real hinges and fasteners that are secure but more easily opened</li>
            <li> This little pack is great.  </li>
            <li> I have traumatic brain injury after constantly forgetting and mixing up my meds my wife picked up these and they&#x27;re amazing</li>
            <li> I have been using this same kind of pill boxes for about 10 years.</li>
            <li> I must add that the finishing and actual product looks nice as well.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> it worth the money</li>
            <li> These pill boxes are a nice way for her to to count out and organize her pills into the specific times of day that she has to take them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also handy to alert a  person to when you&#x27;re running low on pills, since,</li>
            <li> Her kids even have fun helping her set up the containers for the week.</li>
            <li> I have had this 7Day Pill Dispenser for the last two years to have my mother&#x27;s medicines handy for her keepers.</li>
            <li> This is a very handy little organizer for pills.</li>
            <li> Now I can fill an entire weeks worth of pills for myself very easily.</li>
            <li> Perfect, convenient and small enough to still fit in my pockets.</li>
            <li> night, you never forget which pills to take at the right time.</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> but will be replace right away.</li>
            <li> Cannot compare to similar products since it is the first of its kind that I use.</li>
            <li> Great for small pills.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough how great these are: portable, colorful, and simple.</li>
            <li> Best pill cases made,Sturdy,close tightly andbig enough to hold alot of pills.</li>
            <li> Great products has place for all my daily meds.took 3 individual ones on a,recebt trip.</li>
            <li> So far, because it is a bit of a hassle to try to fill each box, I haven&#x27;t filled a week&#x27;s worth and used them that way.</li>
            <li> Great size, fits a giant prenatal with another couple of smaller pills in one of the four sections.</li>
            <li> I was worried b/c the depth and size of the compartments was smaller than I expected; however, all of my med&#x27;s fit perfectly and this includes a big ol mucinex-d pill!  </li>
            <li> I like this pill organizer very much.  </li>
            <li> It is with different color for each day this I like most.</li>
            <li> I love the four different compartments</li>
            <li> This makes my morning routine so much easier!</li>
            <li> at many different times of day!  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for and could not find it in the stores.</li>
            <li> This is really a convenient product!</li>
            <li> I take about 10-15 vitamins throughout the day; this pill organizer is appropriately sized for all the vitamins I need on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> The first order I received was defective.</li>
            <li> It is the best system I have found to do just that in such a small amount of space.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Theses dispensers make my life so much easier!  </li>
            <li> I purchased the larger size and have been satisfied</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when all my meds and supplement fit.</li>
            <li> This pill dispenser was exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> I have gotten as many as 9 pills in one mini-compartment, but most were small.</li>
            <li> Identical to the first.  </li>
            <li> and when, I got this as a gift over 6 years ago, I love it, had not been able to find anything similar since only problem i have had</li>
            <li> so my husband and I can look and see if any more pills are in a section without having to open it.</li>
            <li> If something happens, she doesn&#x27;t lose a whole bottle, but just one dose or day&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for and needed.</li>
            <li> If life was like these rainbow colored daily organizers, the world would be a better place.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what my dad needed to stay organized.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed for my meds.  </li>
            <li> and I have bought 2 more recently.</li>
            <li> As a large volume medication taker, it took me a while to find something that could handle a whole days worth without needing to remember which</li>
            <li> Keeps it perfectly organized and marked so that she doesn&#x27;t get confused.</li>
            <li> all ready I want to buy more in later</li>
            <li> for those who need to take many pills every day and for long time&lt;br</li>
            <li> Compartments are decent size although if you take more than 4 biggies, several times a day this will be snug.</li>
            <li> I take numerous medications throughout the day and this works as a true reminder !</li>
            <li> Each container has 4 opening and each one is easy to open and close.</li>
            <li> They are so easy to take along individually too.  </li>
            <li> Convenient access to daily meds, easy to take with for trips.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space, is easy to use, has sections for four (4) different times each day.  </li>
            <li> This product will hold large pills if you need to take them.</li>
            <li> B001CDZPN6 Four-a-day, Weekly, One Day At a Time, Medication Organizer - Large]].</li>
            <li> Great to get 4 weeks worth of pills in such a small space.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to slip one of the pill boxes into a purse or pocket, which makes taking pills so much easier, especially when on the go.</li>
            <li> I really like the design Idea, but they break so easily from wear after about  6-8 months of constant use.</li>
            <li> so you had better have not too many pills to take (or they had better be small), or you will have trouble using them.</li>
            <li> The size of the individual compartments is fine for my pills, but if you have lots of vitamin or mineral pills, get the7PACK with the 1&amp;#34</li>
            <li> This is a nice little case.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> i like things organized so this is working really well for me...</li>
            <li> We really like the pill boxes.</li>
            <li> Additionally, it does not take up too much room on the kitchen counter.</li>
            <li> Placing it in a shirt pocket should not be much of a problem and it won&#x27;t take up much room in a purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So the user really needs to determine how much space is needed for the pills to be taken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This container allows me to keep 4 weeks of medications ready to distribute when needed.  </li>
            <li> This helps so much in keeping the pills i need for that day and keeping it organized.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> You can plan the whole week and just carry around the days pills.</li>
            <li> However, I wish each section were a bigger to fit all the pills I have.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My big vitamins and arthritis pills fit in with room to spare.</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re always ready.</li>
            <li> Thanks...</li>
            <li> I am really someone who does not like to be tied to my house for taking all the pills I have to..</li>
            <li> very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> These hold a reasonable number of pills in each slot.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient to carry and keep pills organized.</li>
            <li> but I probably wouldn&#x27;t want to spend as much as that would cost.</li>
            <li> The color coding is very helpful.</li>
            <li> thank you so much.</li>
            <li> And sure enough, it&#x27;s crystal clear for him.</li>
            <li> We have two children with special needs, each of whom takes several pills per day.</li>
            <li> The good part (compact size) affects the overall size (less area for pills).  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, the small, four-compartment box fits nicely into my purse and it&#x27;s comforting to know that I have the day&#x27;s supply with me at all times.</li>
            <li> /&gt;He has been doing very well remembering to take his newly prescribed medications</li>
            <li> These boxes have simplified my life and have made the process of taking what I need to take to stay healthy less of a chore.old.  </li>
            <li> These boxes have simplified my life and have made the process of taking what I need to take to stay healthy less of a chore.</li>
            <li> Some of the pills need to be spaced out and/or taken at particular times.</li>
            <li> It is super convenient to just open one tab and toss all the pills into your mouth at once.</li>
            <li> Each day is a different color and is printed in bold type.</li>
            <li> In the past, being forgetful and not having the means to carry many bottles of supplements with me meant I missed most of my doses.  </li>
            <li> The compartments are large enough for several tablets and easily removed and carried in the pocket for a trip.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> In just the \\&quot;Morning\\&quot; section, it can easily hold a large calcium tab, a large fish oil capsule, an extra large potassium tablet, as well as three other pills.</li>
            <li> This pill box is easy to organize and is very helpful in keeping track of different pills taken at different times of day.</li>
            <li> May be OK for smallish Rx pills and tablets, but way too small for large vitamins and supplements.</li>
            <li> I take quite a few supplements as well as prescription meds, so I ended up ordering the deeper version of these that hold more pills.</li>
            <li> But once I got them all open, the hinges loosened and they all open and shut easily now.</li>
            <li> The 7 Day Pill Pack daily containers are easy to use and have enough room to place the medications that I use each day in the compartments.  </li>
            <li> I had to make another order rather than return and then get a new pill box set.</li>
            <li> The back is flat and easy to apply a logo.</li>
            <li> Very helpful when trying to manage a senior citizen&#x27;s medicine but yet give them as much independence as possible.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine an older adult or someone with arthritis opening these.</li>
            <li> So far, the compartments stay shut as well!  </li>
            <li> (it works better for opening and closing for a while before i need to change it, now and again a small pill will stick to it, but otherwise, works</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but small and not a convenient as i thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Good way to set up pills for an entire week, but only for a few pills in each section.</li>
            <li> It takes up very little room, which I like, but each day pack is large enough for 12 large capsules or even more smaller pills.</li>
            <li> The first set lasted 4 years of daily use, and really there were only a couple of days that didn&#x27;t always seal shut.</li>
            <li> Easily fits 3 standard capsule pills in each compartment and with careful placement can get 4.  </li>
            <li> The individual compartments (morning, noon, evening, and bedtime) are printed in a smaller type font, but still fairly bold.</li>
            <li> Was a  tight fit and had to strategically place them</li>
            <li> If taking a lot of vitamins then they won&#x27;t be large enough.</li>
            <li> but if you take a large amt of supplements you might want to get the one with DEEP compartments.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for - four compartments that are large enough for all of my meds for morning &amp; evening!</li>
            <li> The compartments were tough to open which is good to prevent spills in purses or pockets</li>
            <li> which day I am on and it also makes it clear when I am going to need a refill on my medication.</li>
            <li> No one wants to be saddled with necessary medication, especially at such a young age, but this is at least one way to manage the pills effectively and discretely.</li>
            <li> This one replaced an old one that I had.  </li>
            <li> and it seems to be an answer to a prayer so far.</li>
            <li> And, it took me awhile before I figured this out, but the lid component will lift out completely for ease of dosing out the pills.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that could fit several pills, on different times of the day, but also that wasn&#x27;t so bulky or just a daily pill holder.</li>
            <li> My only problem is the names of the day and parts of the day rub off to fast.</li>
            <li> well worth every dime I spent</li>
            <li> While I like the organizer once it is filled, it is seriously a pain to actually fill it up with a week&#x27;s worth of pills.</li>
            <li> its color coded &amp; bold black letters of the days of d week.</li>
            <li> The sections are large enough for all my pills (I take 16 different ones).  </li>
            <li> My mother recently accidentally took too much of a new medication.</li>
            <li> Have been using them lightly for the last few months.</li>
            <li> There is enough room for a pretty large multi-mitamin and quite a few pills besides.</li>
            <li> surprised at the way the product was shipped through the mail, it was only in a plastic shipping bag, with no packing material inside, but it made it intact.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t have enough pills left to fill them for the week, you know to call and ask for refills prior to running out, especially since most doctor offices need a few days to follow up on a prescription request, not to mention they being unavailable on the weekends.  </li>
            <li> I can pack a few days&#x27; worth and toss them in my purse for trips.  </li>
            <li> A bit too small for my needs but a good idea for a person with tiny pills, small amount of pills.</li>
            <li> This four compartment,1/2 inch deep pill box actually holds less pills than the two compartment 1/2 inch deep pill box that is available.  </li>
            <li> Individual days of this set is small enough for a mans pants pocket or ladies purse, easily.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;ll be fine for a while longer, so other than keeping my monday taped down with duct tape,</li>
            <li> is that it is nice and compact as it hardly takes up any room, but that&#x27;s because of how each day is set up, which is what my main complaint is above.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The day is clearly labeled which is key because of different medication schedules.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste precious time everyday trying to figure out what you need to take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having the days of the week in separate, small containers is convenient so my daughter can bring just one day&#x27;s worth in her purse.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no need for her to remember whether she took an earlier dose because one look in the divided compartment will indicate whether a particular slot or dose is empty.  </li>
            <li> I take several pills, three times a day and my old 7-day organizer simply wasn&#x27;t big enough to hold my meds and vitamins.  </li>
            <li> If you have to take quite a few large pills, however, you may want to consider another option (see image gallery).  </li>
            <li> Great for cutting down on time in the mornings when I can do all my meds for the week at once!</li>
            <li> Large enough to hold fish oil, calcium, and several other pills in each container.&lt;br /&gt;Stays closed when you want it to, opens when you want it to.  </li>
            <li> These things are a PAIN to open, I am not old but there is almost nothing to grab onto to open them up --</li>
            <li> They are small but not too small for all the pills &amp; so easy to take with you for the day if you have to be away from home.</li>
            <li> The 4 compartments for each day are really rather small</li>
            <li> Rides in my purse loose without coming open</li>
            <li> I ordered enough that when added with my other ones it is enough for a month.  </li>
            <li> other reviewers said, they do open hard the first couple times, but it&#x27;s easier after that.</li>
            <li> bad, we really liked the product.</li>
            <li> Long trip coming up.</li>
            <li> Before too long the plastic began to crack and break.....</li>
            <li> The lids on my last pill organizer wouldn&#x27;t stay closed</li>
            <li> Morning/Noon will open at the bottom, and then the Evening/Night are upside down and open at the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a single pill box, but trying to fit my supplements in it was always difficult.</li>
            <li> Someone with poor fine motor skills or an arthritic hand might have too much trouble.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish is that the compartments were a little bigger.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother who was having trouble taking several pills through out the day at different times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to bend the lids back too much farther than they naturally want to go because they are just plastic, with plastic &amp;#34;hinges&amp;#34;, and I don&#x27;t want to break them.</li>
            <li> I posted pictures with an individual case on my hand and along the average size calcium, vitamin and capsule to help you get an idea of its size.</li>
            <li> The only (minor) complaint is that the first time I opened the plastic tops they were a little hard to open.  </li>
            <li> The compartments are a little hard to open &amp; I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> It might not work for severely arthritic or people with VERY limited vision.</li>
            <li> I wish the compartments were a little bigger</li>
            <li> Now, if we can just remember which day of the week it is, our pills are laid out for us - if we can get the little boxes open.</li>
            <li> But the tip of a bobby with click the little tabs open and shazam: vitamins.</li>
            <li> As something manipulated daily, the letters has been erased a little.</li>
            <li> Product came on time and functions as expected.</li>
            <li> Then I lost one day box and another had one of the closers that would not always stayed closed.</li>
            <li> This Just what i needed along with the med center alarm clock.</li>
            <li> Money well spent.</li>
            <li> My mother is capable of taking her pills on-schedule, but would often be confused about which day.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my aunt, who for the past few months has considerably added the amount of pills she has to take thru out the day.</li>
            <li> really like this concept for a pill box, as it has the day broken down into 4 time periods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was not exactly what I wanted but it was close.  </li>
            <li> The only issue with the pill pack is that the boxes are a wee bit small.</li>
            <li> and I seemed to dump the small boxes out of tray on regular basis.</li>
            <li> I take 6 calcium along with other vitamins for gastric bypass (ds)</li>
            <li> Has  4 small compartments for various times.</li>
            <li> The corners are a bit sharp-</li>
            <li> It was also a bargain compared to other 7-day organizers.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> These hold plenty of pills for us, yet are small enough to be portable.</li>
            <li> Boxes are small enough to carry in your purse if needed.</li>
            <li> I put my prescription pills in two of them because I have to take them day and night and with the other two compartments I put 2 chewable multivitamins and in the other my vitamin D, sublingual B and Iron pills.</li>
            <li> The tracks were minimal for the boxes so not as sturdy as a previous dispenser I had.</li>
            <li> are hard to see against the same colored background.</li>
            <li> This product is too hard to open for anyone with arthritis in the hands.</li>
            <li> They will hold at least 8 big calcium pills.</li>
            <li> I have a lot I have to put into the boxes each week, so that&#x27;s my biggest and only complaint.</li>
            <li> It was getting confusing enough for us to keep track of who had what and when, let alone another caregiver.</li>
            <li> If you flip it upside down the cases at each end fall out.</li>
            <li> a little hard to open and load pills as the lids are in the way, functional but will probably change it out.</li>
            <li> Had previously used this product</li>
            <li> Each compartment will hold three vitamin size pills, plus a couple of small pills, or numerous small pills.</li>
            <li> a month &amp; a half month pill organizer.i just grab a pill box each day &amp; put in my purse.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of this set of boxes, but it is not easy to open up for filling and it&#x27;s hard to shake just one pill out.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my teenager had a psychotic break and, after hospitalization, was placed on a few, very important, psychotropic medications.  </li>
            <li> The cells are awkward to open but that may be necessary to keep them closed when carrying.</li>
            <li> A little less durable than I would like.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and just needed something that would stay tight.</li>
            <li> The lids close tightly and each box has 4 compartments.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This works well for traveling as the lids snap tight even when tossed around in luggage or a purse.  </li>
            <li> during shipping mine got cheaped &amp; d lock not that tight anymore.</li>
            <li> This is the handiest little medication aid I&#x27;ve ever found.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that one little pill box doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> These little boxes fatigue easily.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Neat little product, I like the idea of the product</li>
            <li> We were please with this find as they do not take up a lot of room, unlike other pill organizers we have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I just pick my day, plop the little box in my purse</li>
            <li> I have always kept my pills in little cups lined up for the week.  </li>
            <li> Awkward to fill because the &amp;#34;lids&amp;#34; don&#x27;t open widely enough.</li>
            <li> I take quite a few vitamins each day, from calcium to B12 to iron.</li>
            <li> /&gt;At 1/2 inch deep, it is fairly thin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update:  A few months after purchase a couple of the compartment tops snapped off and the lettering on the tops of the compartments rubbed off which is problematic.  </li>
            <li> I ordered and received two of them but had to send one back because some of the lids were cracked or broken.</li>
            <li> My wife and I each use a set of these - have used them for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my mom and the slots are a little small for some of her meds</li>
            <li> packs I will be using and keep them in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;For a recent week-long trip I put one pack in my purse at a time and put the base and other packs in my carryon, secured with a single rubber band.</li>
            <li> not sure how plastic hinge will hold up.</li>
            <li> It was way to small for what I need.</li>
            <li> For me, the holes were too small for all my supplements.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I would recommend it for supplements.</li>
            <li> Small compartments difficult to open</li>
            <li> Idea of bending plastic repeatedly usually end up opeaning while in your pocket, dumping everything together in your pocket.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Seven small boxes in a tray.</li>
            <li> The lids are a tad bit difficult to open</li>
            <li> A small grooved plastic tab snaps over a ridge.</li>
            <li> but it will def be too hard for the elderly and those with sore hands.  </li>
            <li> We have been hard on it, throwing it in our pockets to take along.</li>
            <li> I chose it for my dad because I thought it was the least confusing of all the options for someone who has to take meds four times a day.</li>
            <li> So with THE OTHER dispensers she often pulled &amp;#34;Noon&amp;#34; from the wrong day.  </li>
            <li> the hinges are, is plastic, bending for what ever there thin plastic hinges can tolerate, then some brake after about 1,000 or so bendings!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so she could set it up beforehand and not get confused.</li>
            <li> My elderly father and I found opening these boxes too difficult.  </li>
            <li> The fact that each day is desperate is why I bought this.</li>
            <li> Im a sickly person</li>
            <li> I would have given it a 5 star review if the cases stayed put in the base.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> a little hard to open and load pills as the lids are in the way, functional but will probably change it out.</li>
            <li> Product came on time and functions as expected. Cannot compare to similar products since it is the first of its kind that I use.</li>
            <li> I was worried b/c the depth and size of the compartments was smaller than I expected; however, all of my med&#x27;s fit perfectly and this includes a big ol mucinex-d pill!  Rides in my purse loose without coming open so it&#x27;s very secure.  Great for cutting down on time in the mornings when I can do all my meds for the week at once!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  happy and pleased with this pill box organizer. It is with different color for each day this I like most. I see if company write on number like 1,2,3,4 than it will become more helpful for those who wear eyeglass. It is stressful to read word without eyeglass but it is easy to read (Numeric) 1,2,3,4. The company put braille language on box it is more welcome. The product is Ideal for exactly and serve the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend the product.&lt;br /&gt;Navin Patel</li>
            <li> Was not exactly what I wanted but it was close.  The tracks were minimal for the boxes so not as sturdy as a previous dispenser I had.</li>
            <li> I put all the pills I need at the beginning of each week so that it&#x27;s easy for me to grab and go during the week!  I love the four different compartments so it&#x27;s easy for me to separate the pills I need during which time of the day.  This is definitely a great product and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> i like things organized so this is working really well for me...</li>
            <li> Love this product compare to the carrying case I have now that I keep in my pocket, now I have one for every each day and can fill all of them up once a week instead of every morning, looks like well built and should open and close good - won&#x27;t know until i try...have 7 of them to use if a problem later!</li>
            <li> This makes my morning routine so much easier!</li>
            <li> This one replaced an old one that I had.  Didn&#x27;t think I would be able to find one like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> Perfect for daily, on the go use.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what my grandmother needs! She loves these, and they work well for her because she takes meds four times a day.</li>
            <li> This works well to help me remember to take my daily medications.  I can take the daily box with me on the go and no longer forget my daytime medications.</li>
            <li> In one short week I went from a couple of aspirin a month to 6 meds multiple times a day; but I&#x27;m not \\&quot;house bound.\\&quot;  I was looking for something that would seperate my meds, remind me to take them, but something smaller than a suitcase so I could stick all my meds in my purse or pocket every morning.  This is perfect.</li>
            <li> We really like the pill boxes. There is one for each day of the week.They are small but not too small for all the pills &amp; so easy to take with you for the day if you have to be away from home.With space to put pills morning, noon, evening, &amp; night, you never forget which pills to take at the right time.</li>
            <li> This pill box is perfect for folks who have to take pills 3-4 times a day. There are seven separate pill boxes, each with four compartments. It&#x27;s easy to slip one of the pill boxes into a purse or pocket, which makes taking pills so much easier, especially when on the go.</li>
            <li> This is the handiest little medication aid I&#x27;ve ever found.  Now I don&#x27;t have to rummage through all my prescription bottles 3 times a day, and I can see at a glance if I&#x27;ve remembered my last dose.  Wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> Very handy way to store pills.  It&#x27;s convenient for travel as well as you have the option to just carry pills for the days you&#x27;ll be gone rather than an entire week.</li>
            <li> I wish the compartments were a little bigger but it is easy to use and serves its purpose.  I have dropped the cases several times and not had any spills!  That was a definite plus!  I would like to see a larger size of this item.  We take a lot of vitamins!</li>
            <li> This Pill Organizer has been Wonderful in keeping track of an elderly family members medications.  It is a must if a person takes meds. at many different times of day!  Amazon has many choices, this fit the bill for our needs!  Each container has 4 opening and each one is easy to open and close. They are so easy to take along individually too.  Easy to read, that was a must, my Aunt is now filling her own meds. weekly herself, she is over 90 yrs. old!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised at the way the product was shipped through the mail, it was only in a plastic shipping bag, with no packing material inside, but it made it intact.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for and could not find it in the stores. It is so easy to grab and go.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband when he suddenly had to go on several different medications. He works full time, runs a business on the side AND does volunteer work. Since he is always on the go and often forgets to take care of his own needs, this pill organizer could literally be a life-saver for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Sunday evening, he looks at his meds list and sets them all up. Then every morning he slips that day&#x27;s container in his pocket and off he goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has been doing very well remembering to take his newly prescribed medications and I think a lot of it has to do with this pill organizer.</li>
            <li> This pill box is easy to organize and is very helpful in keeping track of different pills taken at different times of day.</li>
            <li> I can store in the cabinet and only pull out the day I need. Helps me be more organized, which is always good.</li>
            <li> I love this style - it helps when I need to be gone for a couple of days, I can just take the daily boxes that I need rather than pack an entire pill organizer.</li>
            <li> Great products has place for all my daily meds.took 3 individual ones on a,recebt trip.</li>
            <li> I take several pills, three times a day and my old 7-day organizer simply wasn&#x27;t big enough to hold my meds and vitamins.  I&#x27;m so pleased with this pill box organizer. In just the \\&quot;Morning\\&quot; section, it can easily hold a large calcium tab, a large fish oil capsule, an extra large potassium tablet, as well as three other pills. Everything fits, yet the item is so compact it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space.  The only (minor) complaint is that the first time I opened the plastic tops they were a little hard to open.  But once I got them all open, the hinges loosened and they all open and shut easily now. This is really a convenient product!</li>
            <li> Good 4-compartment box for for up to 8 pills per compartment.  Have just started to use, so not sure how plastic hinge will hold up.</li>
            <li> Great containers. All of my mother&#x27;s 23 pills fit with plenty of room leftover.</li>
            <li> I take about 10-15 vitamins throughout the day; this pill organizer is appropriately sized for all the vitamins I need on a daily basis. Additionally, it does not take up too much room on the kitchen counter.</li>
            <li> This is a very handy little organizer for pills. It was a bit smaller than we expected - we&#x27;re old and take a bunch of meds to keep going - but it does suffice. Now, if we can just remember which day of the week it is, our pills are laid out for us - if we can get the little boxes open.</li>
            <li> I have vitamins I take all day and they look alike!  This is the perfect solution for me. It keeps my morning afternoon and evening vitamins separated so that I can take them at times that work for me.  No lugging of bottles.  I can pack a few days&#x27; worth and toss them in my purse for trips.  Simplifies my world.</li>
            <li> The first order I received was defective. I had to make another order rather than return and then get a new pill box set. It worked out better than having to wait for it to be received, processed and then replaced. I have been using this same kind of pill boxes for about 10 years. Then I lost one day box and another had one of the closers that would not always stayed closed. I would say that is pretty d&#x3D;&#x3D; good. I use the 4 boxes for morning and evening pills and that way I am able to fill 2 weeks of pills at one time. It is the best system I have found to do just that in such a small amount of space. If I am going to be gone from my home for a couple of days, I just take a couple of boxes with me rather than having to take the entire set with me.</li>
            <li> Compartments are decent size although if you take more than 4 biggies, several times a day this will be snug. We&#x27;re using it to dole out son&#x27;s meds and it&#x27;s working great. Very handy to take along a days worth.</li>
            <li> like it helps me keep my meds in order</li>
            <li> I take quite a few vitamins each day, from calcium to B12 to iron. Some of the pills need to be spaced out and/or taken at particular times. This pill organizer is good but not as deep as I require.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 1/2 inch deep, it is fairly thin. Placing it in a shirt pocket should not be much of a problem and it won&#x27;t take up much room in a purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any problems with the lids breaking or had difficulty with shutting or opening them when needed. I&#x27;ve also never had a lid open while in my purse. Because I take a good number pills, it would be quite the annoyance to have to pick them up from my purse if the lids spontaneously opened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy two of these, you can fill them and have 14 days of medication/vitamins at your fingertips. Don&#x27;t waste precious time everyday trying to figure out what you need to take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ve probably seen several styles of this pill box. Some are 1/2 inch deep, some are an inch deep, some have four compartments and others two compartments. This product will hold large pills if you need to take them. If you have to take quite a few large pills, however, you may want to consider another option (see image gallery).  This four compartment,1/2 inch deep pill box actually holds less pills than the two compartment 1/2 inch deep pill box that is available.  I have personally found the four compartment, inch deep pill box the best for my needs.  You can see the deep, one inch box here: [[ASIN:B000E13BVA 7 Day 4 Compartment Pill Organizer DEEP One Inch]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deep one inch, four compartment pill box is the same style and material as the two compartment and four compartment boxes that are each 1/2 inch deep.  So the user really needs to determine how much space is needed for the pills to be taken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have included some photos in the product gallery that may help you make your decision. I used the largest vitamin that I take so you can, perhaps, formulate some idea what each type will hold.  These boxes have simplified my life and have made the process of taking what I need to take to stay healthy less of a chore.old.  These boxes have simplified my life and have made the process of taking what I need to take to stay healthy less of a chore.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.  Just wish there were no white containers as white pills are hard to see against the same colored background.</li>
            <li> This is just what the doctor ordered.... (pun intended). It organizes a weeks supply of pills. I love it and find it very handy when traveling.</li>
            <li> I fill these with my supplements each week.  Then I throw the appropriate day box into my purse each morning.  I have everything I need throughout the day.  Some of my supplements are rather large, but I can fit 3 of them into one of the compartments.  So far, the compartments stay shut as well!  Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  A few months after purchase a couple of the compartment tops snapped off and the lettering on the tops of the compartments rubbed off which is problematic.  Wish they would have lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I like it. The only thing I wish is that the compartments were a little bigger. Bought it for my mom and the slots are a little small for some of her meds</li>
            <li> The Tuesday pill box there is one of the latches that won&#x27;t stay shut, I have to put a rubber band around it.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware on this item. The 4 compartments for each day are really rather small so you had better have not too many pills to take (or they had better be small), or you will have trouble using them. I do use them for travel but only for a couple of the medicines that I take at bedtime. If taking a lot of vitamins then they won&#x27;t be large enough.</li>
            <li> Large enough to hold fish oil, calcium, and several other pills in each container.&lt;br /&gt;Stays closed when you want it to, opens when you want it to.  Great after several months!</li>
            <li> May be OK for smallish Rx pills and tablets, but way too small for large vitamins and supplements. An excellent idea, including the portability--if you&#x27;re going out, just slip that day&#x27;s pack out and put it in your purse or pants pocket. But needs to be offered in a bigger size.</li>
            <li> This container allows me to keep 4 weeks of medications ready to distribute when needed.  I can also make sure that I took my meds for the day just by checking the appropriate day.  Easy to access and easy to keep straight.</li>
            <li> This Just what i needed along with the med center alarm clock. I can take these pill contains any where &amp; not miss a pill.My only thing is that i have personally lost or miss placed to of them. I like that i can put them in my purse easily.&lt;br /&gt;These bottles have helped me a lot. I hope you they meet your need as well!</li>
            <li> I bought the pill organizer to bring my supplements with me to work and to ensure that I was taking everything I needed. The only issue with the pill pack is that the boxes are a wee bit small. Then again, my pills are huge and plentiful.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I needed. Ever since I&#x27;ve had to take more than one kind of pill four times a day I&#x27;ve found that one little pill box doesn&#x27;t cut it. Now I can fill an entire weeks worth of pills for myself very easily. It is super convenient to just open one tab and toss all the pills into your mouth at once. Furthermore, the small, four-compartment box fits nicely into my purse and it&#x27;s comforting to know that I have the day&#x27;s supply with me at all times.</li>
            <li> well worth every dime I spent</li>
            <li> Great, handy organizer.  Convenient access to daily meds, easy to take with for trips.  Ends clutter of numberous script bottles.</li>
            <li> Best pill cases made,Sturdy,close tightly andbig enough to hold alot of pills.Will buy this item again,already bought another set.Good price too.</li>
            <li> Im a sickly person and I take more than 10 pills a day. This helps so much in keeping the pills i need for that day and keeping it organized.</li>
            <li> I have to say that these were a God-send.  I&#x27;m having trouble keeping my grandmom&#x27;s pills straight for her and this makes it pretty darn easy.  The day is clearly labeled which is key because of different medication schedules.  These are plenty big (which I was worried about initially because she takes a lot of big pills).  She was very happy with these and it seems to be an answer to a prayer so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different pill organizers. These are great because they are very secure so don&#x27;t open in my pocket or purse. And, it took me awhile before I figured this out, but the lid component will lift out completely for ease of dosing out the pills. I take quite a few supplements as well as prescription meds, so I ended up ordering the deeper version of these that hold more pills. I recommend them to anyone who needs to organize their pills.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you have viatamins that are big and need to take them more than once a day. I love this product for that reason.</li>
            <li> Great for herbalife tablets. The back is flat and easy to apply a logo.</li>
            <li> It was way to small for what I need.</li>
            <li> Very helpful when trying to manage a senior citizen&#x27;s medicine but yet give them as much independence as possible.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Convenient and well made.  Great for travel.  For me, the holes were too small for all my supplements.  Should have ordered the 3 compartment.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Works very well.  Great to get 4 weeks worth of pills in such a small space.  Long trip coming up.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my aunt, who for the past few months has considerably added the amount of pills she has to take thru out the day. I wanted something that could fit several pills, on different times of the day, but also that wasn&#x27;t so bulky or just a daily pill holder. This does the trick. The actual day holders are portable and the spaces hold several different sizes of pills. You can plan the whole week and just carry around the days pills. I must add that the finishing and actual product looks nice as well.</li>
            <li> Perfect, convenient and small enough to still fit in my pockets. I love the color coded boxes. I had a single pill box, but trying to fit my supplements in it was always difficult. This box makes it easier.</li>
            <li> This is a compartmental medicine organizer. I used this to take daily supplements while working out - but it didn&#x27;t end up being practical. Too bulky to carry in a bag of any kind. This is just good enough to keep at home. By the time a week was over I had to reorganize it again ... Not sure if I would recommend it for supplements.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother who was having trouble taking several pills through out the day at different times. Found this box and it meets all her needs. Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> A bit too small for my needs but a good idea for a person with tiny pills, small amount of pills. Would not recommend if you need more than two pills in each 1/4 square.</li>
            <li> I love the product and it does fit my needs. However, I wish each section were a bigger to fit all the pills I have.</li>
            <li> Theses dispensers make my life so much easier!  I ordered enough that when added with my other ones it is enough for a month.  The color coding and lettering make it nice and clear which day I am on and it also makes it clear when I am going to need a refill on my medication.</li>
            <li> This pill case set is a great idea that allows for each day to be a separate grouping which is quite handy when you have a large number of pills each day to take.  It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space, is easy to use, has sections for four (4) different times each day.  The one issue that buyers might want to consider is the size of each pill section.  If you have more than 3 medium to large size pills for a time period - they might not all fit!  The good part (compact size) affects the overall size (less area for pills).  Take this into consideration when purchasing.  Besides that, this item is a good buy, seems to be of good quality, and hopefully will last for many many uses.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my aging Mother and it was definitely a good investment. We do not have to guess when pills have to be taken. I especially like it because of the four compartments: morning, afternoon, evening, bedtime. This works just perfect for us.</li>
            <li> Great product to stay organized! Literally, it&#x27;s a great grab and go concept for the active person!</li>
            <li> for those who need to take many pills every day and for long time&lt;br /&gt;that device is very good&lt;br /&gt;it lets you see the needed pills according to the time of the day (4 choices) and the day</li>
            <li> I like this pill organizer very much.  In the past, being forgetful and not having the means to carry many bottles of supplements with me meant I missed most of my doses.  With the 7 day pill pack I stock each day at the beginning of the week and if I leave the house, I simply take that day&#x27;s pack with me.  Setting alarms on my smartphone helps to ensure I take them.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Had previously used this product I the larger size, so bought 4 of these to cover my meds for a month...Before too long the plastic began to crack and break.....maybe too many meds??? I purchased the larger size and have been satisfied</li>
            <li> Small compartments difficult to open and I seemed to dump the small boxes out of tray on regular basis. I purchased an all in one unit even though it was bigger it is better suited to my needs</li>
            <li> Good way to set up pills for an entire week, but only for a few pills in each section. Great for someone who is taking pills throughout the day because there are four sections on each box and you can take the daily box with you. Lids are secure and I have had no problems with mine or this one. I bought one for myself that had larger boxes, so when I ordered this one for my husband I thought it was like mine. I should have paid more attention to the size. But he only takes a couple of pills anyway.</li>
            <li> I love these! The square shape allows me to fit all the pills in that I need in each section and it fits excellent in my purse taking up very little space.</li>
            <li> I love these boxes.  They are a slimmer version of the original.  But, still fit a lot of pills.  My only problem is the names of the day and parts of the day rub off to fast.</li>
            <li> This is very handy to keep pills organized. I ordered and received two of them but had to send one back because some of the lids were cracked or broken. The size of the individual compartments is fine for my pills, but if you have lots of vitamin or mineral pills, get the7PACK with the 1&amp;#34; deep compartments. They will hold at least 8 big calcium pills.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of this set of boxes, but it is not easy to open up for filling and it&#x27;s hard to shake just one pill out. I&#x27;m afraid to bend the lids back too much farther than they naturally want to go because they are just plastic, with plastic &amp;#34;hinges&amp;#34;, and I don&#x27;t want to break them. So far, because it is a bit of a hassle to try to fill each box, I haven&#x27;t filled a week&#x27;s worth and used them that way. I&#x27;m still looking for that perfect pill box.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little case. I was pleasantly surprised when all my meds and supplement fit. Was a  tight fit and had to strategically place them but it worked. I take 6 calcium along with other vitamins for gastric bypass (ds) but if you take a large amt of supplements you might want to get the one with DEEP compartments. The compartments were tough to open which is good to prevent spills in purses or pockets but it will def be too hard for the elderly and those with sore hands.  I would have given it a 5 star review if the cases stayed put in the base. If you flip it upside down the cases at each end fall out. Would be perfect if it didn&#x27;t. I posted pictures with an individual case on my hand and along the average size calcium, vitamin and capsule to help you get an idea of its size.</li>
            <li> This pill dispenser was exactly as pictured. I love it. Has  4 small compartments for various times. My big vitamins and arthritis pills fit in with room to spare. Money well spent. Thanks Amazon for featuring this great product for those of us who can&#x27;t seem to remember when to take our pills.</li>
            <li> The idea is good but in my case I need a deeper box, to fit my first and last vitamins for the day</li>
            <li> This is ideal.  My mother is capable of taking her pills on-schedule, but would often be confused about which day.  So with THE OTHER dispensers she often pulled &amp;#34;Noon&amp;#34; from the wrong day.  With this, we can simply set out the BOX-OF-THE-DAY for her.</li>
            <li> My elderly mother takes several medications 3 times a day. This dispenser is perfect. Keeps it perfectly organized and marked so that she doesn&#x27;t get confused.</li>
            <li> I love these! I already have a set. I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it! So, I bought my mom a set, then came back and bought these for my daughter.  There is enough room for a pretty large multi-mitamin and quite a few pills besides.</li>
            <li> My wife and I each use a set of these - have used them for a few years now. They are simple, well constructed for ease of opening and closing the four mini-compartments for each day. I have gotten as many as 9 pills in one mini-compartment, but most were small. The ones like these that are twice as deep are just too big. Individual days of this set is small enough for a mans pants pocket or ladies purse, easily. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great idea, but could use some tweaking. The compartments are a little hard to open &amp; I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s! Can&#x27;t imagine an older adult or someone with arthritis opening these. The corners are a bit sharp- so they don&#x27;t fit comfortably in a pocket. The fact that each day is desperate is why I bought this. I wanted something portable &amp; easy for me to keep on schedule of meds every 6 hours.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have any hand strength issues &amp; just use these at home, they serve their purpose well. I personally should&#x27;ve just bought the one at the dollar store.</li>
            <li> I have been using these pill boxes for about five years.  My husband and I each  have several boxes and fill them ahead of time so they&#x27;re always ready.</li>
            <li> This is my second set of these. The first set lasted 4 years of daily use, and really there were only a couple of days that didn&#x27;t always seal shut. But after 4 years, and all the travels they did I was very happy with the original set, and this is exactly like the first. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Best med dispenser ever!</li>
            <li> does what its supposed to do. easy storage. good container, no spills and it locks well.the labels are also of good use. would buy it again if needed</li>
            <li> Really happy. Just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Wife loves it as a second pill box.  Identical to the first.  That should say it all. good piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> This pack is perfect at keeping me on schedule.  My last pack was to big and bulky. The medicine would fall out and get lost in my backpack.  I travel a lot and just needed something that would stay tight. This little pack is great.  The shipping was expedited and came on time for me to pack and go. Thanks...</li>
            <li> I love pill case it work really great I would tell friend to buy it I would buy this again I got three of them  all ready I want to buy more in later it workout for me and my family great price it worth the money</li>
            <li> I had looked everywhere for this set of pill boxes and so pleased when I found the set on Amazon. I like them because each box is labeled for a day of the week and each box has four flip up lids that are also labeled with a time of day. This allows you to keep pills separate so what is taken in the morning is not with what is taken at night.</li>
            <li> This product makes it easy to carry with you all your medications for the day.  There is no trying to remember if a medication was taken because each box [7 of them, one for each day] are divided into 4 compartments: morning, noon, evening, and bedtime.  This is the third set I&#x27;ve gotten! They&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> This pill organizer is compact and easy to use. It was also a bargain compared to other 7-day organizers.&lt;br /&gt;When I travel I take out only the &amp;#34;day&amp;#34; packs I will be using and keep them in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;For a recent week-long trip I put one pack in my purse at a time and put the base and other packs in my carryon, secured with a single rubber band. It takes up very little room, which I like, but each day pack is large enough for 12 large capsules or even more smaller pills.</li>
            <li> The lids on my last pill organizer wouldn&#x27;t stay closed so I bought this one. The lids close tightly and each box has 4 compartments.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for what I need at a cheap price.</li>
            <li> Love these boxes for the most part, until it is time to fill them. Awkward to fill because the &amp;#34;lids&amp;#34; don&#x27;t open widely enough. I have a lot I have to put into the boxes each week, so that&#x27;s my biggest and only complaint.</li>
            <li> you can not put more than 4 capsules/vitamins in one box</li>
            <li> Excellent. Works Great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for six weeks. While I like the organizer once it is filled, it is seriously a pain to actually fill it up with a week&#x27;s worth of pills. I don&#x27;t take a LOT of meds/supplements, well, am: three supplements, noon: two supplements, evening: two supplements, night: one supplement, two prescriptions. (So maybe that IS a lot.) Anyhow, to fill this up a week at a time, I have to take all seven containers out and line them up so that all of the morning/noon sections are at the bottom, just to make sure I will be putting the right stuff in the correct time slot. Opening each section also is a bother since they don&#x27;t all open in the same direction. Morning/Noon will open at the bottom, and then the Evening/Night are upside down and open at the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I DO like is that it is nice and compact as it hardly takes up any room, but that&#x27;s because of how each day is set up, which is what my main complaint is above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m moving to the [[ASIN:B001CDZPN6 Four-a-day, Weekly, One Day At a Time, Medication Organizer - Large]]. I know it takes up more counter space, but it&#x27;s worth it for ease of use. I&#x27;m sure there are other ones out there that might work even better, but I do need to be able to take the day&#x27;s worth of stuff with me to work too.</li>
            <li> i love this set! i take a lot of medicines, and there&#x27;s so much space in the cases.. and they still fit right in my pocket just fine!</li>
            <li> This is a great organizer for distributing your meds and taking them each day at the specified time.  I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I am a speech-language pathologist and have worked with a lot of elderly patients who have memory issues. This is one of the best products for dispensing multiple medicines I&#x27;ve seen. I chose it for my dad because I thought it was the least confusing of all the options for someone who has to take meds four times a day. And sure enough, it&#x27;s crystal clear for him. Each day is a different color and is printed in bold type. The individual compartments (morning, noon, evening, and bedtime) are printed in a smaller type font, but still fairly bold. My dad loves this!</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this product, about $10 -12.&lt;br /&gt;This product is a great Idea, but it needs more technical and ergonomics designing.&lt;br /&gt;The hinge&#x27;s (plastic) easily break after several months of use.These little boxes fatigue easily.&lt;br /&gt;The Idea of bending plastic repeatedly usually end up opeaning while in your pocket, dumping everything together in your pocket.&lt;br /&gt; I really like the design Idea, but they break so easily from wear after about  6-8 months of constant use. They missed the mark ever so slightly!&lt;br /&gt;All the hinges are, is plastic, bending for what ever there thin plastic hinges can tolerate, then some brake after about 1,000 or so bendings!&lt;br /&gt;I did buy it again!</li>
            <li> As a large volume medication taker, it took me a while to find something that could handle a whole days worth without needing to remember which and when, I got this as a gift over 6 years ago, I love it, had not been able to find anything similar since only problem i have had is I cant stand the color of a thursday, Lol and my monday morning section cover broke during a trip through baggage, after a while covers don&#x27;t stay down as well, quick tip, squeeze the front of the box below where it clips on and it&#x27;ll be fine for a while longer, so other than keeping my monday taped down with duct tape, (it works better for opening and closing for a while before i need to change it, now and again a small pill will stick to it, but otherwise, works okay, airline chipped a piece off where the clip was, but again 6+ years and counting and the rest of the days are holding strong,printed words have worn off a lot, but love this product. Looked forever for one similar or this one and finally found it.</li>
            <li> Easily fits 3 standard capsule pills in each compartment and with careful placement can get 4.  Great way to keep your meds / vitamins organized.</li>
            <li> These are handy, but after some use the printed lettering is beginning to wear off.</li>
            <li> We have two children with special needs, each of whom takes several pills per day. It was getting confusing enough for us to keep track of who had what and when, let alone another caregiver. I considered many pill cases and am glad I went with this one. The best feature is that if the kids are going to Grandma&#x27;s for the afternoon, we can just take that day&#x27;s case and hand it to her without having to transport the whole week&#x27;s worth. Or I can carry it in my pocket if we&#x27;re going out. Each day&#x27;s four slots are prelabeled morning, noon, evening and bedtime, so even a babysitter can figure out when to administer the meds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the tops are translucent so my husband and I can look and see if any more pills are in a section without having to open it. The color coding is nice as we can quickly see that both kids are on the same color day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers said, they do open hard the first couple times, but it&#x27;s easier after that. Someone with poor fine motor skills or an arthritic hand might have too much trouble. I appreciate that they stay shut. These hold plenty of pills for us, yet are small enough to be portable. We set the case on end in the cabinet and pull out each day like drawers of a dresser so it saves even more space. The largest pill we give is a chewable vitamin (about the size of a Flinstone&#x27;s). I&#x27;d guess up to three or even four of these would fit in one slot, or several smaller pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After 7 months of daily use, one lid flap broke off, but for the price I&#x27;ll order another once my duct tape fix no longer holds. We have been hard on it, throwing it in our pockets to take along.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my teenager had a psychotic break and, after hospitalization, was placed on a few, very important, psychotropic medications.  These pill boxes are a nice way for her to to count out and organize her pills into the specific times of day that she has to take them.  It&#x27;s also handy to alert a  person to when you&#x27;re running low on pills, since, if you don&#x27;t have enough pills left to fill them for the week, you know to call and ask for refills prior to running out, especially since most doctor offices need a few days to follow up on a prescription request, not to mention they being unavailable on the weekends.  Having the days of the week in separate, small containers is convenient so my daughter can bring just one day&#x27;s worth in her purse.  If something happens, she doesn&#x27;t lose a whole bottle, but just one dose or day&#x27;s worth.  There&#x27;s no need for her to remember whether she took an earlier dose because one look in the divided compartment will indicate whether a particular slot or dose is empty.  No one wants to be saddled with necessary medication, especially at such a young age, but this is at least one way to manage the pills effectively and discretely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but small and not a convenient as i thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Great size. Seven small boxes in a tray. Boxes are small enough to carry in your purse if needed. Each box contains four compartments w/ separate lids. Making it easy to pour pills into your hand. Each compartment will hold three vitamin size pills, plus a couple of small pills, or numerous small pills. I use this at home, and while traveling. Exactly what I was looking for and needed.</li>
            <li> Great for small pills.  I put a month&#x27;s supply of morning pills in these. Nice and colorful.  Fair price.</li>
            <li> The sections are large enough for all my pills (I take 16 different ones).  The lids are a tad bit difficult to open but they do not come open in purse or pocket.  More than adequate for my needs.</li>
            <li> these are ok.. I am really someone who does not like to be tied to my house for taking all the pills I have to.. they work great to fill once a week and throw into my pusre each day as I go out the door !</li>
            <li> Neat little product, I like the idea of the product very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downsides of this product are that between the compartments there are gaps, was attempting to hold a powdered supplement in one of the compartments -- it will not work for that. Also... These things are a PAIN to open, I am not old but there is almost nothing to grab onto to open them up -- granted I keep my fingernails on the short side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They arn&#x27;t the biggest, but they work for me and hold a good amount for anyone who doesn&#x27;t need horse pills -- and I believe they even offer an XL size if you do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;::Overall:: 4/5 because of the gaps between compartments and difficulty opening.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday to keep all my vitamins in order and it is so great if you are on the go!</li>
            <li> This works well for traveling as the lids snap tight even when tossed around in luggage or a purse.  These hold a reasonable number of pills in each slot.  We were please with this find as they do not take up a lot of room, unlike other pill organizers we have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> Purchased for a friend that was recently diagnosed with mg and has multiple pills to take throughout the day. She was forgetting to take pills, so this quickly organized her and monitors if she took all her pills for the day. Her kids even have fun helping her set up the containers for the week.</li>
            <li> If life was like these rainbow colored daily organizers, the world would be a better place. I just pick my day, plop the little box in my purse and I&#x27;m all set. I can&#x27;t say enough how great these are: portable, colorful, and simple. The only trick is opening them up. I use a bobypin because I don&#x27;t have monster hands lol. But the tip of a bobby with click the little tabs open and shazam: vitamins.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what my dad needed to stay organized.</li>
            <li> I take numerous medications throughout the day and this works as a true reminder !</li>
            <li> A little less durable than I would like.&lt;br /&gt;Had I known how big the compartments were I would have opted for the two compartment container instead of the four.</li>
            <li> I love it. Keeps me on track and I don&#x27;t miss what I need or when. I use  my phone clock alarms to beep when it&#x27;s time to take my meds. and with them divided appropriately I never miss any now</li>
            <li> My elderly father and I found opening these boxes too difficult.  Dad is on coumadin&lt;br /&gt;and cut himself while trying to open them!  I immediately sent them back....&lt;br /&gt;Too bad, we really liked the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the vitamins I have to take after having WLS and my prescriptions. Each individual pill pack has 4 compartments. I put my prescription pills in two of them because I have to take them day and night and with the other two compartments I put 2 chewable multivitamins and in the other my vitamin D, sublingual B and Iron pills. It works out great and I never forget to take my vitamins. Every Sunday I refill all 7 packs for the week. The only thing I recommend is that the multivitamins, in humid weather, do absorb the humidity by the end of the week so I place my dispenser in a zip lock bag. The packs are not moisture proof but, the zip lock helps. During the dryer months, my vitamins stayed fine without the zip lock.</li>
            <li> I have traumatic brain injury after constantly forgetting and mixing up my meds my wife picked up these and they&#x27;re amazing</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for - four compartments that are large enough for all of my meds for morning &amp; evening!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re taking 5 big pills in one sitting, this might not be the box for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this concept for a pill box, as it has the day broken down into 4 time periods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They seem to be constructed adequately. Have been using them lightly for the last few months.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my elderly mother who has several pills to take over the day.  The compartments are large enough for several tablets and easily removed and carried in the pocket for a trip.  Definately recommended for anyone who needs medication.</li>
            <li> The 7 Day Pill Pack daily containers are easy to use and have enough room to place the medications that I use each day in the compartments.  It is easy to carry with me in my purse also.</li>
            <li> PERFECT solution for me. Very convenient to carry and keep pills organized. makes it a lot easier to keep track of when I need refills. Great Size. can fit some of your larger sized Pills.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed for my meds.  Holds my amt. of pills just right.</li>
            <li> It might not work for severely arthritic or people with VERY limited vision. The cells are awkward to open but that may be necessary to keep them closed when carrying. A small grooved plastic tab snaps over a ridge. You open it with your fingernail. I haven&#x27;t had any problem with the hinged lids but they are not designed to last forever. They are just thinned part of the plastic. It might be possible to design something with real hinges and fasteners that are secure but more easily opened but I probably wouldn&#x27;t want to spend as much as that would cost.</li>
            <li> I have had this 7Day Pill Dispenser for the last two years to have my mother&#x27;s medicines handy for her keepers. It has served well the purpose. As something manipulated daily, the letters has been erased a little. But I like  the item and I have bought 2 more recently. My only suggestion to the manufacturers would be to write the days of the week also in Spanish for the rest of Latin America countries which also buy by Internet. I am from Panama and our employees do not understand English. I wrote the names in Spanish with a pilot, but they erase easely. It would be much better to have it done by the company. Many thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marcela Diaz Cabal</li>
            <li> Great size, fits a giant prenatal with another couple of smaller pills in one of the four sections.</li>
            <li> Purchased item for my Mother-In-Law. The color coding is very helpful. Well-made pill boxes. Good size.</li>
            <li> A must have for someone who has a strict schedule for meds. Only way I stay organized and on schedule.</li>
            <li> This product is too hard to open for anyone with arthritis in the hands. The one I ordered went in the trash after 3 weeks trying it.</li>
            <li> My mother recently accidentally took too much of a new medication. She couldn&#x27;t remember if she had taken in already so she took another one. I got this for her so she could set it up beforehand and not get confused. She takes it too work with her and she said it fits in her purse well and makes her life easier.</li>
            <li> I have always kept my pills in little cups lined up for the week.  This product enables me to keep the pill in on e compact place without having to worry about spilling them.</li>
            <li> i just loved this pill organizer. its color coded &amp; bold black letters of the days of d week. i already hv a 7 day pack, its perfect. that&#x27;s y i had to get 4 more to make a month &amp; a half month pill organizer.i just grab a pill box each day &amp; put in my purse. so organized.&lt;br /&gt;maybe during shipping mine got cheaped &amp; d lock not that tight anymore. 5 days got d cheaped on d lock. but will be replace right away. thank you so much. i would definitely recommend to friends &amp; relatives.</li>
            <li> There is nothing fancy here.  Sturdy platic holder for sturdy plastic pill holders.  There is a generous space for each compartment and my father&#x27;s medication fits with room to spare.  Very nice product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the pills we need to dispense.  The color coding is a bonus!  Would recommend this to anyone that takes pills 4 times a day.</li>
