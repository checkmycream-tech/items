            <li>And lastly I love the lashes I got!!</li>
            <li>THAT CHEAP THEN!!!</li>
            <li>Omg very good they are amazing</li>
            <li>but, I&#x27;m more than happy with what I got!</li>
            <li>The boxes that they are in were kind of squished, but there was no harm to the lases at all!</li>
            <li>These are so cute and great!!!</li>
            <li>Awesome product is Awesome looks very natural</li>
            <li>They good quality they fit perfect</li>
            <li>It took about one week which was really good.</li>
            <li>And the box was in good condition.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I can recommend this product to you all, quality wise, but I hope they don&#x27;t treat all of their customers this way.</li>
            <li>Good for price</li>
            <li>These lashes are good and got here in the time stated.  </li>
            <li>I still want the lashes and seems as though all they want are good reviews</li>
            <li>They fit 97% of my eyelid which is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>But they are still good.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price,</li>
            <li>Shipping time was good also.</li>
            <li>Loved them.</li>
            <li>But theyre really good.</li>
            <li>And if you&#x27;re a beginner this is a good way to get a feel of them.</li>
            <li>They blend in so good that you cant tell you&#x27;re wearing them.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for lashes to add to your collection or if you just want to practice, then this is a good way to do that.</li>
            <li>really good price for the quality i like that</li>
            <li>they are good quality for the cost</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good buy, would recommend.</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t mind because the box is a fairly sturdy glossy cardboard, and the lashes are in tact (which is all that</li>
            <li>when i got them they seemed good</li>
            <li>But the ones I did get I loved.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not even good if you&#x27;re trying to learn how to put on lashes.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re even more gorgeous!</li>
            <li>These lashes are so beautiful, so much better than shelling out 10 bucks for ONE pair at a drug store</li>
            <li>For being so ridiculously cheap and not any kind of name brand, these are awesome!</li>
            <li>I loved being able to have that variety!</li>
            <li>I love the eyelashes ,Great customer service , quick shipping &amp; awesome quality !</li>
            <li>They look great for an even better price.</li>

            <li>For the price, I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything amazing.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re nice.</li>
            <li>Such a great price for a great product!</li>
            <li>I said sure but as soon as i receive the lashes I would write a good review.</li>
            <li>I had told them that once I receive the lashes that I was charged for I would gladly write a good review.</li>
            <li>I could wear these anytime and they will blend in with my own lashes and just enhance them, not look like I am on stage.</li>
            <li>, she said she liked them, then again she does have way biger eyes than me.</li>
            <li>I like making my own liner on my eyes</li>
            <li>but with much practice they&#x27;ll look great!</li>
            <li>I really liked the ones i got in this order.</li>
            <li>Nice lashes.</li>
            <li>I will try to find an eyelash case to see if holding them in there will help mold it into that nice curve.</li>
            <li>these were supposed to save me money and time to be honest.</li>
            <li>and you get the best natural looking lashes ever!</li>

            <li>im the kind of person that like the more natural look and</li>
            <li>This product came rapidly and they are really nice, better than my natural eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>Really good lashes, comfortable and natural looking.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying lashes from China for years and tried many different companies, but these ones are so far the best quality.</li>
            <li>nice , it&#x27;s like the real thing</li>
            <li>Curls easily, light weight.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for cheap product falls apart</li>
            <li>so cheap bought two types to try but started breaking out around my eyes every time i wore them.</li>
            <li>so cheap I would buy again</li>
            <li>These are so great for different clients.</li>
            <li>Quality of product cheap.  </li>
            <li>So I like to have light lash enhancements like these to give my eyes</li>
            <li>They are so cheaply made and they are not even in length.</li>
            <li>Great steal for only a couple bucks!!!</li>
            <li>They are so light weight</li>
            <li>Such a great product for the price...</li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re looking for everyday lashes they&#x27;re perfect!</li>
            <li>they better be worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Get Cheap Price &#x3D;</li>
            <li>They are so light and not make of plastic.</li>
            <li>They are cheaply made and there is almost no place for glue to stick to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the lashes overall.</li>
            <li>and I THOROUGHLY ENJOY THEM.  </li>
            <li>great, takes forever to clear customs but worth it for the price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say there better than the red cheery brand.</li>
            <li>Fun, fast service good quality</li>

            <li>I was very suprised when my lashes arrived sooner then expected, I was also very happy about the condition of the lashes.</li>
            <li>I love the lashes but they are all natural looking :)</li>
            <li>They are super light</li>
            <li>/&gt;These lashes are made in Taiwan and are super comfortable</li>
            <li>I really liked how they looked, very natural.</li>
            <li>These were by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>But they look really pretty &amp; natural!!!!! :)</li>
            <li>there okay you cant bend them too much</li>
            <li>worth the cheap price.</li>
            <li>For full coverage, I would not have to snip much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice &amp; soft lash look too.  </li>
            <li>I love them so much that I purchase 6 packs.</li>
            <li>and but I like a full lash.</li>
            <li>Owell still not bad for $2.00 but would have loved to try different styles</li>
            <li>Though not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>Love this those are super Natural, my clients are happy with them, the final result looks glam.  </li>
            <li>They are very cheap for the decent quality.</li>
            <li>seriously, these are the best lashes I&#x27;ve tried yet.</li>
            <li>Luckily they reached April 24.</li>
            <li>I like how natural they look, they&#x27;re just very easy to break and a lot thinner</li>
            <li>Very pretty lashes but seem like one time use&#x3D;</li>
            <li>They are long a gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>However, they&#x27;re very natural looking and the perfect compliment to more subtle makeup.</li>
            <li>natural looking and easy to apply!</li>
            <li>The lashes themselves are pretty and comfortable, but obviously synthetic, which is fine, most lashes are.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>For the price, these lashes are the most natural looking ones I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>

            <li>Lashes came in the mail wish they had come sooner but came I a reasonably  amount of time they are very natural and nice</li>
            <li>it isnt a set of various falsies, theyre all the same - but its fine because they were only a dollar :P definitely a nice lil cheap gift.</li>
            <li>look real and tremendous!</li>

            <li>Great everyday lashes</li>
            <li>These are probably the most natural looking lashes I have purchased.</li>
            <li>Natural looking and can be wearable more than twice.</li>
            <li>Got these today, been waiting forever, but worth it</li>
            <li>They are perfect for ppl that have thin lashes.</li>
            <li>THEY WORTH FOR THE VALUE.</li>
            <li>If you want something that is natural looking .i love it</li>
            <li>And they are more of a natural look</li>
            <li>I love the clear band on these and the lash</li>
            <li>I like to get a more natural look</li>
            <li>I have had so much fun with the compliments I have been receiving.  </li>
            <li>they are worth it.</li>
            <li>I really love these lashes, they look so natural you don&#x27;t even have to wear</li>
            <li>Pretty long and nice I really liked them they look natural, arrivd on time and was not damaged.</li>
            <li>These are nice lashes, the only thing is when you apply them you need to use a lot of glue.</li>
            <li>Only one style , but still nice</li>
            <li>So glad I got these because they look so natural</li>
            <li>I love how natural these lashes looks.</li>
            <li>These lashes are natural looking which I love.</li>
            <li>The lashes are not missing, they just split to the sides more.</li>
            <li>I love eyelashes with clear bands so this was a bonus.</li>
            <li>I dont think these were worth the money.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re well worth the wait</li>
            <li>They are all well made, and worth the inexpensive price.</li>
            <li>If you apply it, you have to hold it downwards for a more natural look.</li>
            <li>They look really natural and I am able to wear them without hiding the band with eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>these are the most natural lashes ive ever had the pleasure of wearing.</li>
            <li>Honestly, they were not different eyelashes</li>
            <li>they are not really that good to m e</li>
            <li>Honestly these are good but not great.</li>
            <li>Shipping wasn&#x27;t super quick, but it came at a decent time!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to use them, we had a small hiccup and the company quickly responded and took care of the issue :) !!</li>
            <li>They are a tad long, but if anything that&#x27;s a good thing, better than them being too short!</li>
            <li>I really was excited to get this one too.</li>
            <li>They came early which is a good thing packed in a bubble wrap package nothing was damaged or missed placed looks pretty natural on in my opinion</li>
            <li>just the right size for a person who wears glasses.</li>
            <li>so it doesnt just pop right off then hold it there for a couple seconds</li>
            <li>These are great everyday lashes for when you want to enhance without doing too much!</li>
            <li>Really looks natural and light weight and cheap price.</li>
            <li>What i received from china is only one kind of lashes, all the same style and size, no varieties at all and not as many as the one in photo.</li>
            <li>Just a good basic natural lash.</li>
            <li>But for a natural lash, easy to use and not break your bank - they are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The band is clear and bends easily.</li>
            <li>The clear band blends so easily.</li>
            <li>They are easy to attach and looks 100% natural.</li>
            <li>Besides Ardell&#x27;s lashes in 110, this is my absolute favorite natural lashes.</li>
            <li>The ones I received are all the same &amp; very light.  </li>
            <li>Look and feel very real</li>
            <li>So Comfortable and Pretty .The lashes are very natural looking.</li>
            <li>They came very fast too.</li>
            <li>Like the product, like the results, love how they look, easy to put on  but just Received half of my order,</li>
            <li>The first two times they are easy to clean, but sometimes if you pull to hard the lashes will slide off the band, which is okay with me because I always have to trim mine anyways.  </li>
            <li>They are so pretty</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty put</li>
            <li>, it was her first time wearing lashes.</li>
            <li>I sanitize and re-wear all my lashes up to 4 times, but most of mine are 100% Human Hair.</li>
            <li>are pretty</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these!!</li>
            <li>The next day they called me asking if I could write a better review and even emailed me with steps.</li>
            <li>This eyelash is exactly what i want.</li>
            <li>I actually just ordered 3 more.</li>
            <li>so I tried them and recently ordered 4 more boxes.</li>
            <li>Am currently considering buying two more boxes, 10/10 would reccommend.</li>
            <li>The first set I bought, took about 4 weeks to arrive.</li>
            <li>and I will definitely order more</li>
            <li>Definitely WILL be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I like these lashes because they look so natural and light weight.</li>
            <li>especially how lovely they look</li>
            <li>This is my first time ordering from these people.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving ese lashes 4 stars because the are exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>but i repeat these aint for a party night or any festival or any kind of place where you will want your eyes to be the center of attention these eyelashes wont work for that look .</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>they do take close to a month to receive when you order, so i suggest you order more boxes to have extra.</li>
            <li>Will continue to buy in future, my first order was 5 boxes. :)</li>
            <li>I really like these lashes!</li>
            <li>Model or Red cherry eyelashes are better.</li>
            <li>exactly as i stated in the tittle.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re good eyelashes if you want a natural but long look.</li>
            <li>They are super flexible and can be made to fit to your individual eyes.</li>
            <li>Love these lashes, they are nice size, not too long or too short, easy to apply, can be used several times, they are very affordable and come with 10 pairs.</li>
            <li>I mainly bought theese lashes because I want to practice on applying lashes in general better.</li>
            <li>Love how they are so natural looking if you want that natural look.</li>
            <li>Good enough for the price I paid, and I know they&#x27;ll last.</li>
            <li>I freaking love these lashes, the band is clear which makes them look seamless.</li>
            <li>Super soft !</li>
            <li>The lashes are nice, long, and very natural yet \\&quot;doll\\&quot; like on me</li>
            <li>I will say this much and natural looking, but that is the only nice thing I can say.</li>
            <li>Love the look of these...little hard getting them out package due to stickers on lashes but otherwise great</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical about ordering these lashes because they were so inexpensive, but they turned out to be amazing!!</li>
            <li>These are very pretty but would be best for a person just beginning to wear lashes as they are quite thin but quite long from corner of eye to end</li>
            <li>The lashes were very fragile and and break easily.  </li>
            <li>Also the main reason why I am giving them four stars is because they had really fast shipping, more then three weeks prior to the estimated shipping date.</li>
            <li>I use my fingers to initially place them, then use my tweezers to help press them in and do fine adjustments before the glue sets up.</li>
            <li>they were all the same, they are super natural and light if thats what you wanted</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re pretty soft which I like!!</li>
            <li>It is not my problem, and I found that very unprofessional.</li>
            <li>These really don&#x27;t stick on with any type of eyelash glue.  </li>
            <li>My friends thought they were my real lashes😀</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t too bulky or plastic, the bands are very bendable and stay on really really well.</li>
            <li>You really get what you pay for with this.  </li>
            <li>very close!And</li>
            <li>Unless you have straight eyes or slits, do not buy these.</li>
            <li>The order came within 2 weeks, much faster than I was quoted.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Service was as fast as it can come from China</li>
            <li>But when I applied mascara on my real lashes and put these on the glue would not stick on my real lashes.</li>
            <li>I know alot of people that enjoy these lashes, but they simply were not for me.</li>
            <li>I always get asked if they&#x27;re real or lash extentions</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t look real</li>
            <li>This looks absolutely nothing like the picture</li>
            <li>Will be stocking up very soon.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really notice them on</li>
            <li>They also look like your real lashes.</li>
            <li>They hold mascara really well if you want to build them up.</li>
            <li>They really suckkk..</li>
            <li>I dont really like these</li>
            <li>but they are really straight.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I can&#x27;t tell which side goes to which even when they are paired, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me much either.  </li>
            <li>they shipped fast which was awesome.price great,great product.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t think they are really reusable.</li>
            <li>All the same and more of a natural look.</li>
            <li>They are the perfect length and they aren&#x27;t too thick or thin I love them</li>
            <li>They had the same product listed for around $11 and $1 and some change, just why would I pay more for the exact same product if I can get it cheaper??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to trim the lashes because I have small eyes, but better longer than shorter!</li>
            <li>Total worth the price!</li>
            <li>The interesting thing is, I have used other &amp;#34;shorter&amp;#34; lashes  </li>
            <li>but the problem is that its waaay too light not enough lashes but overall not bad.</li>
            <li>Light, fluffy, small.  Great for beginners.  </li>
            <li>but other then i love it</li>
            <li>so I do have to cut them down as these are pretty long, which is good for others</li>
            <li>They are long and thin and are very attractive.</li>
            <li>if you need some for a special occasion order in advance, they also look so natural not to curled up or thick, perfect for everyday use!</li>
            <li>(I trimmed the thread off of the ends and cut right in the middle leaving a pair that match perfectly) easy to apply (well as easy as any fake lash) and they look the most natural of any I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I order things from HK for nail art pretty frequently, and it has taken up to 2 months, these came in about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>They took full responsibility for the mix up, and promised my money back.</li>
            <li>A full eight hours later and still comfy.</li>
            <li>There pretty and natural</li>
            <li>But they look pretty natural are not too dense or whacky.</li>
            <li>I really like these, they are wispy, not very thick but still thicker than my real lashes.</li>
            <li>but they are still nice natural lashes, thought they would be just a little longer...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the whole eye lash</li>
            <li>so I cute them and half</li>
            <li>These are decent for the price.</li>
            <li>The box they come in is adorable (white box, with see-through white cutout)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My biggest problem is that they don&#x27;t really look natural on me because my real eyelashes are thicker than these.</li>
            <li>OK, so I love fake lashes and the look they give my eyes...</li>
            <li>Most strip lashes I have used before only taper in on the inner edge and are the longest at the outer edge.</li>
            <li>I was really upset when I took the plastic lashes out of the box but even more upset that all 10 of the glue tubes were dried up.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>But the band is very flexible and clear!</li>
            <li>However, they are still very pretty lashes that I intend to use for daytime occasions (but I don&#x27;t use falsies on a regular basis).</li>
            <li>Very natural looking!</li>
            <li>Very natural looking! ♡</li>
            <li>i am not a person that will want this kind of look but you can see right away in the picture they look THIN</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>However, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for then I highly recommend them.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for high drama I would not recommend.  </li>
            <li>Recommend highly.</li>
            <li>For this price, and this quality, I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>I can get 2 wears out of a pair of these, if I&#x27;m careful, which is fine for the price.</li>
            <li>it even came a bit early!!</li>
            <li>They are so natural looking and blend well into my real lashes.</li>
            <li>and i also like that they are not thick</li>
            <li>Also the lashes dont have a normal band its band is made out of thread.</li>
            <li>For cheap they make your lashes look natural and long.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it if you use lashes regularly!</li>
            <li>The band is super thick and cheaply made.</li>
            <li>and I could not put them on evenly for right and left eyes, I gave up.  </li>
            <li>I decide to try this style, because I wanted something a little more natural looking.</li>
            <li>thinner than i expected, and not as long as i figured they would be, guess good enough for price.</li>
            <li>These have very long bands for those of us with large eyes who can&#x27;t get the standard ones to fit corner to corner.  </li>
            <li>I needed them for Christmas, new years, but no.</li>
            <li>Oh well you live and learn.</li>
            <li>Sometimes USPS delivers the products later than usual (as I&#x27;ve experienced in the past from different buyers). :)</li>
            <li>Look very natural.</li>
            <li>but they are very natural looking, The order arrived within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>They are NOT dramatic,they are very natural looking.</li>
            <li>Very natural looking.</li>
            <li>They are very natural looking as well.</li>
            <li>Very natural looking,</li>
            <li>and they look very natural</li>
            <li>Very natural look &amp; feel.</li>
            <li>The lashes are very natural looking.</li>
            <li>These are basuc lashes and give a very natural look</li>
            <li>they look very natural once on.</li>
            <li>and I receive a plain Jane type of lashes and all the same kind.</li>
            <li>Probably would not buy again because I don&#x27;t usually use top liner but with this you must because if the string.</li>
            <li>The exact same pair of lashes.  </li>
            <li>Pretty simple.</li>
            <li>You have to purchase the glue separate but for the incredibly low price of the lashes you can&#x27;t really complain!</li>
            <li>I am going to order a few more right now before they raise the price once everyone tries them and raves about them.</li>
            <li>The  band is a little longer on the outer and inner part of the lashes, but that part can easily be cut off, in matter of seconds!</li>
            <li>INSTEAD I RECEIVE THESE LITTLE THIN A$$ KIND THAT ARE THINNER AND SHORTER THAN MY VERY OWN LASHES, AND, HAPPEM TP COST WAY LESS THAN WHAT I PAID!</li>
            <li>This product makes it easy for me to wear them everyday.</li>
            <li>The lashes are soft enough and the band is pretty flexible</li>
            <li>They are natural looking lashes, like I&#x27;m talking very natural lashes</li>
            <li>So I was never able to wear lashes during the day, only when we went out at night and it was OK to look a little more &amp;#34;glam.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>After cutting the long ends they are the perfect natural lashes.</li>
            <li>VERY thin,but on lazy days I just throw them over my normal lashes &amp; pack on some mascara &amp; it makes a great,simple,beautiful look of full lashes</li>
            <li>The base is invisible, they are the perfect length, and they look completely natural!</li>
            <li>After cutting and adjusting to my size I put them on and have to say they there very light weight and comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>They really are so natural looking that I can actually wear them during the day!  </li>
            <li>They are really natural looking, have a clear band , and are really soft  </li>
            <li>I bought the clear glue strips and they stay on.  </li>
            <li>I got all natural looking ones not a mix.</li>
            <li>I am going to order at least two more boxes.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t look so natural.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t curve to a natural eye shape.</li>
            <li>, they look sooo natural and they are definitely soft.</li>
            <li>I got it faster than I thought, and the product is so natural.</li>
            <li>once the natural look.</li>
            <li>and plus i have sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>So for myself I found them to be too natural looking.  </li>
            <li>they look really natural, just how i like it..</li>
            <li>The band and the lashes are really soft, which is something I have to get used to.</li>
            <li>These lashes are natural looking and they are inexpensive.</li>
            <li>These are a MUST BUY if you are looking for natural lashes.</li>
            <li>WOW.  </li>
            <li>Soft, lush and lengthy lashes.  </li>
            <li>Looks natural on my eyes.</li>
            <li>I like natural</li>
            <li>I can wear them without make up they look so natural.  </li>
            <li>they look so natural but help define and lengthen.</li>
            <li>They were very short and way shorter than my real lashes.</li>
            <li>they look really natural</li>
            <li>If your looking for a natural looking lash</li>
            <li>The whole lash was the same length</li>
            <li>though honestly &#x27;natural&#x27; is not a thing I look for from my falsies.</li>
            <li>They were all natural.</li>
            <li>maybe going for a natural look.</li>
            <li>Really natural looking.</li>
            <li>It looks so natural.</li>
            <li>They look really natural.</li>
            <li>it blends with my natural lashes</li>
            <li>They are natural looking.</li>
            <li>Good thing the eyelashes aren&#x27;t that expensive.</li>
            <li>These lashes are nice but way to thin for me</li>
            <li>These are nice natural false lashes.</li>
            <li>and you do need to use sharp scissors to snip off the excess thread, but each pair of lashes will be able to last multiple uses (the pair I wore earlier still feels very sturdy even after I removed it and picked off the glue).</li>
            <li>Also, they don&#x27;t have the right curve to lay right on your eyelash line which makes you have to apply extra dots of glue on the ends which can get messy.</li>
            <li>, they are the same length as my normal lashes, not dramatic enough</li>
            <li>Only a few lashes were split though so if you don&#x27;t mind a few being accents and most being full wear, you are all set with these.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Subtle, great for everyday.</li>
            <li>they were pretty but more difficult to apply and not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I bought them to add to my own lashes for an everyday look but they are too thin and super long while my own are medium length and thick.</li>
            <li>than that the eyelashes are nice, they look long but not too dramatic, you could wear them everyday :)</li>
            <li>This is good product as this price, but this is thin and long eyelash.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap compare to other eyelashes that are out there, but it&#x27;s not very natural looking when I use it.</li>
            <li>The band is fairly straight (due to the packaging; it has two extended threads that are taped down by the stickers) and it&#x27;s a bit difficult to manipulate it into a nice curve for easy application.</li>
            <li>I love these lashes, the only bad thing is they took Forever to get here, more than 4 weeks, so</li>
            <li>They are cheap, and you get a lot for the small price.  </li>
            <li>With all that said, if you&#x27;re careful and patient (which you have to be inorder to apply lashes in the first palce)</li>
            <li>THEY WERE TOO LONG AND DID NOT LOOK NATURAL!!!</li>
            <li>They are are all the same style, a soft, natural looking lash.</li>
            <li>They are the closest looking to real lashes, and can be built up just like real lashes with a few coats of mascara....</li>
            <li>few of the lashes, appear more split in the center.</li>
            <li>They were all exactly the same one style of lashes which was didisappointing being the only reason I bought the lashes was try out different styles.</li>
            <li>they were all the same natural lashes!</li>
            <li>I only want an accent so for me they will work because I cut one lash strip right in the center and use one for both eyes.</li>
            <li>no where near natural lashes these are big full dramatic lashes that most girls wear that make your eyes look heavy and</li>
            <li>Three weeks was a lot faster than I excepted as generally orders from Hong Kong and Asia in general can take a lot longer.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quit surprised by these, I don&#x27;t like the real big gaudy eyelashes</li>
            <li>The eyelashes didnt come like the picture ,they were short and natural looking</li>
            <li>I ordered natural and regular ones</li>
            <li>If you want something that is natural looking but also enhances your lashes at the same time, they are the ones to go to!</li>
            <li>They are okay, not great.</li>
            <li>You have to pull them up out of a little hole and the more you pull you feel as if they&#x27;ll break in half from the tugging.</li>
            <li>1that&#x27;s ridiculous and the box was ask bent up other than that seems to be a nice product.</li>
            <li>I love wearing false lashes, as my own  are very thin &amp; sparse.</li>
            <li>I wasted a lot of time and glue just trying to get them on right...</li>
            <li>Perfect size.. Not to thick or long and don&#x27;t look super fake, just looks like I have longer fuller lashes!!</li>
            <li>The eyelashes were long and looked very natural.</li>
            <li>I purchase eyelashes usually from a beauty store and only wear them on special occasions.</li>
            <li>If you want a more dramatic effect, layer the</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to more dramatic lashes with a stiffer band.</li>
            <li>I bought this product, and as a girl who wear false eyelashes on a daily basis, I love them.</li>
            <li>the band itself is long and a clear plastic.</li>
            <li>I like these lashes, their like a natural but long.</li>
            <li>so soft they were my first fast shipping eyelashes that i received out of the other 60 pairs i order , they are also thin and long , meaning they will give you a natural long eyelash look .</li>
            <li>lashes that I haven&#x27;t worn yet because they are very bold and dramatic and I haven&#x27;t gotten up the nerve.</li>

            <li> I am extremely happy with them and plan on buying again</li>
            <li> but if you do order, you have plenty of lashes to make mistakes with lol</li>

            <li> And lastly I love the lashes I got!!</li>
            <li> THAT CHEAP THEN!!!</li>

            <li> These are so cute and great!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product is Awesome looks very natural</li>
            <li> They good quality they fit perfect</li>
            <li> It took about one week which was really good.</li>
            <li> And the box was in good condition.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I can recommend this product to you all, quality wise, but I hope they don&#x27;t treat all of their customers this way.</li>
            <li> Good for price</li>
            <li> These lashes are good and got here in the time stated.  </li>
            <li> I still want the lashes and seems as though all they want are good reviews</li>
            <li> They fit 97% of my eyelid which is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> But they are still good.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price,</li>
            <li> Shipping time was good also.</li>
            <li> Loved them.</li>
            <li> But theyre really good.</li>
            <li> And if you&#x27;re a beginner this is a good way to get a feel of them.</li>
            <li> They blend in so good that you cant tell you&#x27;re wearing them.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking for lashes to add to your collection or if you just want to practice, then this is a good way to do that.</li>
            <li> really good price for the quality i like that</li>
            <li> they are good quality for the cost</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good buy, would recommend.</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t mind because the box is a fairly sturdy glossy cardboard, and the lashes are in tact (which is all that</li>
            <li> when i got them they seemed good</li>
            <li> But the ones I did get I loved.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not even good if you&#x27;re trying to learn how to put on lashes.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re even more gorgeous!</li>
            <li> These lashes are so beautiful, so much better than shelling out 10 bucks for ONE pair at a drug store</li>
            <li> For being so ridiculously cheap and not any kind of name brand, these are awesome!</li>
            <li> I loved being able to have that variety!</li>
            <li> I love the eyelashes ,Great customer service , quick shipping &amp; awesome quality !</li>
            <li> They look great for an even better price.</li>
            <li> Just buy the good kind eyelash glue.</li>
            <li> They Shipped right on time and came in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> and you get soooo many of them!</li>
            <li> LOVE these lashes!</li>
            <li> Would def buy more of these!</li>
            <li> and I got so many compliments!</li>
            <li> Love them!</li>
            <li> Love theses lashes!</li>
            <li> I Love these!</li>
            <li> so be sure to buy some!</li>
            <li> Bends easily &amp; love the length!</li>
            <li> Love them!</li>
            <li> The lashes are wonderful and beautiful will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> but I loved the eyelashes easy to put on great buy for sure...</li>
            <li> For the price, I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything amazing.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re nice.</li>
            <li> Such a great price for a great product!</li>
            <li> I said sure but as soon as i receive the lashes I would write a good review.</li>
            <li> I had told them that once I receive the lashes that I was charged for I would gladly write a good review.</li>
            <li> I could wear these anytime and they will blend in with my own lashes and just enhance them, not look like I am on stage.</li>
            <li> , she said she liked them, then again she does have way biger eyes than me.</li>
            <li> I like making my own liner on my eyes</li>
            <li> but with much practice they&#x27;ll look great!</li>
            <li> I really liked the ones i got in this order.</li>
            <li> Nice lashes.</li>
            <li> I will try to find an eyelash case to see if holding them in there will help mold it into that nice curve.</li>
            <li> these were supposed to save me money and time to be honest.</li>
            <li> and you get the best natural looking lashes ever!</li>
            <li> Bought 3 boxes and glad I did! :)</li>

            <li> I really liked how they looked, very natural.</li>
            <li> These were by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> But they look really pretty &amp; natural!!!!! :)</li>

            <li> worth the cheap price.</li>

            <li> Nice &amp; soft lash look too.  </li>
            <li> I love them so much that I purchase 6 packs.</li>
            <li> and but I like a full lash.</li>
            <li> Owell still not bad for $2.00 but would have loved to try different styles</li>
            <li> Though not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Love this those are super Natural, my clients are happy with them, the final result looks glam.  </li>
            <li> They are very cheap for the decent quality.</li>
            <li> seriously, these are the best lashes I&#x27;ve tried yet.</li>
            <li> Luckily they reached April 24.</li>
            <li> I like how natural they look, they&#x27;re just very easy to break and a lot thinner</li>
            <li> Very pretty lashes but seem like one time use&#x3D;</li>
            <li> They are long a gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> However, they&#x27;re very natural looking and the perfect compliment to more subtle makeup.</li>
            <li> natural looking and easy to apply!</li>
            <li> The lashes themselves are pretty and comfortable, but obviously synthetic, which is fine, most lashes are.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> For the price, these lashes are the most natural looking ones I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>

            <li> /&gt;These are exactly like the picture and work well!</li>
            <li> Lashes came in the mail wish they had come sooner but came I a reasonably  amount of time they are very natural and nice</li>
            <li> it isnt a set of various falsies, theyre all the same - but its fine because they were only a dollar :P definitely a nice lil cheap gift.</li>
            <li> look real and tremendous!</li>
            <li> perfect for everyday use as this are super natural looking.</li>

            <li> Great everyday lashes</li>
            <li> These are probably the most natural looking lashes I have purchased.</li>
            <li> Natural looking and can be wearable more than twice.</li>
            <li> Got these today, been waiting forever, but worth it</li>
            <li> They are perfect for ppl that have thin lashes.</li>
            <li> THEY WORTH FOR THE VALUE.</li>
            <li> If you want something that is natural looking .i love it</li>
            <li> And they are more of a natural look</li>
            <li> I love the clear band on these and the lash</li>
            <li> I like to get a more natural look</li>
            <li> I have had so much fun with the compliments I have been receiving.  </li>
            <li> they are worth it.</li>
            <li> I really love these lashes, they look so natural you don&#x27;t even have to wear</li>
            <li> Pretty long and nice I really liked them they look natural, arrivd on time and was not damaged.</li>
            <li> These are nice lashes, the only thing is when you apply them you need to use a lot of glue.</li>
            <li> Only one style , but still nice</li>
            <li> So glad I got these because they look so natural</li>
            <li> I love how natural these lashes looks.</li>
            <li> These lashes are natural looking which I love.</li>
            <li> The lashes are not missing, they just split to the sides more.</li>
            <li> I love eyelashes with clear bands so this was a bonus.</li>
            <li> I dont think these were worth the money.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re well worth the wait</li>
            <li> They are all well made, and worth the inexpensive price.</li>
            <li> If you apply it, you have to hold it downwards for a more natural look.</li>
            <li> They look really natural and I am able to wear them without hiding the band with eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> these are the most natural lashes ive ever had the pleasure of wearing.</li>
            <li> Honestly, they were not different eyelashes</li>
            <li> they are not really that good to m e</li>
            <li> Honestly these are good but not great.</li>
            <li> Shipping wasn&#x27;t super quick, but it came at a decent time!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use them, we had a small hiccup and the company quickly responded and took care of the issue :) !!</li>
            <li> They are a tad long, but if anything that&#x27;s a good thing, better than them being too short!</li>
            <li> I really was excited to get this one too.</li>
            <li> They came early which is a good thing packed in a bubble wrap package nothing was damaged or missed placed looks pretty natural on in my opinion</li>
            <li> just the right size for a person who wears glasses.</li>
            <li> so it doesnt just pop right off then hold it there for a couple seconds</li>
            <li> These are great everyday lashes for when you want to enhance without doing too much!</li>
            <li> Really looks natural and light weight and cheap price.</li>
            <li> What i received from china is only one kind of lashes, all the same style and size, no varieties at all and not as many as the one in photo.</li>
            <li> Just a good basic natural lash.</li>
            <li> But for a natural lash, easy to use and not break your bank - they are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The band is clear and bends easily.</li>
            <li> The clear band blends so easily.</li>
            <li> They are easy to attach and looks 100% natural.</li>
            <li> Besides Ardell&#x27;s lashes in 110, this is my absolute favorite natural lashes.</li>
            <li> The ones I received are all the same &amp; very light.  </li>
            <li> Look and feel very real</li>
            <li> So Comfortable and Pretty .The lashes are very natural looking.</li>
            <li> They came very fast too.</li>
            <li> Like the product, like the results, love how they look, easy to put on  but just Received half of my order,</li>
            <li> The first two times they are easy to clean, but sometimes if you pull to hard the lashes will slide off the band, which is okay with me because I always have to trim mine anyways.  </li>
            <li> They are so pretty</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty put</li>
            <li> , it was her first time wearing lashes.</li>
            <li> I sanitize and re-wear all my lashes up to 4 times, but most of mine are 100% Human Hair.</li>
            <li> are pretty</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these!!</li>
            <li> The next day they called me asking if I could write a better review and even emailed me with steps.</li>
            <li> This eyelash is exactly what i want.</li>
            <li> I actually just ordered 3 more.</li>
            <li> so I tried them and recently ordered 4 more boxes.</li>
            <li> Am currently considering buying two more boxes, 10/10 would reccommend.</li>
            <li> The first set I bought, took about 4 weeks to arrive.</li>
            <li> and I will definitely order more</li>
            <li> Definitely WILL be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I like these lashes because they look so natural and light weight.</li>
            <li> especially how lovely they look</li>
            <li> This is my first time ordering from these people.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving ese lashes 4 stars because the are exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> but i repeat these aint for a party night or any festival or any kind of place where you will want your eyes to be the center of attention these eyelashes wont work for that look .</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> they do take close to a month to receive when you order, so i suggest you order more boxes to have extra.</li>
            <li> Will continue to buy in future, my first order was 5 boxes. :)</li>
            <li> I really like these lashes!</li>
            <li> Model or Red cherry eyelashes are better.</li>
            <li> exactly as i stated in the tittle.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re good eyelashes if you want a natural but long look.</li>
            <li> They are super flexible and can be made to fit to your individual eyes.</li>
            <li> Love these lashes, they are nice size, not too long or too short, easy to apply, can be used several times, they are very affordable and come with 10 pairs.</li>
            <li> I mainly bought theese lashes because I want to practice on applying lashes in general better.</li>
            <li> Love how they are so natural looking if you want that natural look.</li>
            <li> Good enough for the price I paid, and I know they&#x27;ll last.</li>
            <li> I freaking love these lashes, the band is clear which makes them look seamless.</li>
            <li> Super soft !</li>
            <li> The lashes are nice, long, and very natural yet \\&quot;doll\\&quot; like on me</li>
            <li> I will say this much and natural looking, but that is the only nice thing I can say.</li>
            <li> Love the look of these...little hard getting them out package due to stickers on lashes but otherwise great</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about ordering these lashes because they were so inexpensive, but they turned out to be amazing!!</li>
            <li> These are very pretty but would be best for a person just beginning to wear lashes as they are quite thin but quite long from corner of eye to end</li>
            <li> The lashes were very fragile and and break easily.  </li>
            <li> Also the main reason why I am giving them four stars is because they had really fast shipping, more then three weeks prior to the estimated shipping date.</li>
            <li> I use my fingers to initially place them, then use my tweezers to help press them in and do fine adjustments before the glue sets up.</li>
            <li> they were all the same, they are super natural and light if thats what you wanted</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re pretty soft which I like!!</li>
            <li> It is not my problem, and I found that very unprofessional.</li>
            <li> These really don&#x27;t stick on with any type of eyelash glue.  </li>
            <li> My friends thought they were my real lashes😀</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t too bulky or plastic, the bands are very bendable and stay on really really well.</li>
            <li> You really get what you pay for with this.  </li>
            <li> very close!And</li>
            <li> Unless you have straight eyes or slits, do not buy these.</li>
            <li> The order came within 2 weeks, much faster than I was quoted.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Service was as fast as it can come from China</li>
            <li> But when I applied mascara on my real lashes and put these on the glue would not stick on my real lashes.</li>
            <li> I know alot of people that enjoy these lashes, but they simply were not for me.</li>
            <li> I always get asked if they&#x27;re real or lash extentions</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t look real</li>
            <li> This looks absolutely nothing like the picture</li>
            <li> Will be stocking up very soon.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really notice them on</li>
            <li> They also look like your real lashes.</li>
            <li> They hold mascara really well if you want to build them up.</li>
            <li> They really suckkk..</li>
            <li> I dont really like these</li>
            <li> but they are really straight.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I can&#x27;t tell which side goes to which even when they are paired, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me much either.  </li>
            <li> they shipped fast which was awesome.price great,great product.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t think they are really reusable.</li>
            <li> All the same and more of a natural look.</li>
            <li> They are the perfect length and they aren&#x27;t too thick or thin I love them</li>
            <li> They had the same product listed for around $11 and $1 and some change, just why would I pay more for the exact same product if I can get it cheaper??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to trim the lashes because I have small eyes, but better longer than shorter!</li>
            <li> Total worth the price!</li>
            <li> The interesting thing is, I have used other &amp;#34;shorter&amp;#34; lashes  </li>
            <li> but the problem is that its waaay too light not enough lashes but overall not bad.</li>
            <li> Light, fluffy, small.  Great for beginners.  </li>
            <li> but other then i love it</li>
            <li> so I do have to cut them down as these are pretty long, which is good for others</li>
            <li> They are long and thin and are very attractive.</li>
            <li> if you need some for a special occasion order in advance, they also look so natural not to curled up or thick, perfect for everyday use!</li>
            <li> (I trimmed the thread off of the ends and cut right in the middle leaving a pair that match perfectly) easy to apply (well as easy as any fake lash) and they look the most natural of any I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I order things from HK for nail art pretty frequently, and it has taken up to 2 months, these came in about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> They took full responsibility for the mix up, and promised my money back.</li>
            <li> A full eight hours later and still comfy.</li>
            <li> There pretty and natural</li>
            <li> But they look pretty natural are not too dense or whacky.</li>
            <li> I really like these, they are wispy, not very thick but still thicker than my real lashes.</li>
            <li> but they are still nice natural lashes, thought they would be just a little longer...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the whole eye lash</li>
            <li> so I cute them and half</li>
            <li> These are decent for the price.</li>
            <li> The box they come in is adorable (white box, with see-through white cutout)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My biggest problem is that they don&#x27;t really look natural on me because my real eyelashes are thicker than these.</li>
            <li> OK, so I love fake lashes and the look they give my eyes...</li>
            <li> Most strip lashes I have used before only taper in on the inner edge and are the longest at the outer edge.</li>
            <li> I was really upset when I took the plastic lashes out of the box but even more upset that all 10 of the glue tubes were dried up.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> But the band is very flexible and clear!</li>
            <li> However, they are still very pretty lashes that I intend to use for daytime occasions (but I don&#x27;t use falsies on a regular basis).</li>
            <li> Very natural looking!</li>
            <li> Very natural looking! ♡</li>
            <li> i am not a person that will want this kind of look but you can see right away in the picture they look THIN</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> However, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for then I highly recommend them.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for high drama I would not recommend.  </li>
            <li> Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> For this price, and this quality, I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I can get 2 wears out of a pair of these, if I&#x27;m careful, which is fine for the price.</li>
            <li> it even came a bit early!!</li>
            <li> They are so natural looking and blend well into my real lashes.</li>
            <li> and i also like that they are not thick</li>
            <li> Also the lashes dont have a normal band its band is made out of thread.</li>
            <li> For cheap they make your lashes look natural and long.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it if you use lashes regularly!</li>
            <li> The band is super thick and cheaply made.</li>
            <li> and I could not put them on evenly for right and left eyes, I gave up.  </li>
            <li> I decide to try this style, because I wanted something a little more natural looking.</li>
            <li> thinner than i expected, and not as long as i figured they would be, guess good enough for price.</li>
            <li> These have very long bands for those of us with large eyes who can&#x27;t get the standard ones to fit corner to corner.  </li>
            <li> I needed them for Christmas, new years, but no.</li>
            <li> Oh well you live and learn.</li>
            <li> Sometimes USPS delivers the products later than usual (as I&#x27;ve experienced in the past from different buyers). :)</li>
            <li> Look very natural.</li>
            <li> but they are very natural looking, The order arrived within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> They are NOT dramatic,they are very natural looking.</li>
            <li> Very natural looking.</li>
            <li> They are very natural looking as well.</li>
            <li> Very natural looking,</li>

            <li> These are basuc lashes and give a very natural look</li>
            <li> they look very natural once on.</li>
            <li> and I receive a plain Jane type of lashes and all the same kind.</li>
            <li> Probably would not buy again because I don&#x27;t usually use top liner but with this you must because if the string.</li>
            <li> The exact same pair of lashes.  </li>
            <li> Pretty simple.</li>
            <li> You have to purchase the glue separate but for the incredibly low price of the lashes you can&#x27;t really complain!</li>
            <li> I am going to order a few more right now before they raise the price once everyone tries them and raves about them.</li>
            <li> The  band is a little longer on the outer and inner part of the lashes, but that part can easily be cut off, in matter of seconds!</li>
            <li> INSTEAD I RECEIVE THESE LITTLE THIN A$$ KIND THAT ARE THINNER AND SHORTER THAN MY VERY OWN LASHES, AND, HAPPEM TP COST WAY LESS THAN WHAT I PAID!</li>
            <li> This product makes it easy for me to wear them everyday.</li>
            <li> The lashes are soft enough and the band is pretty flexible</li>
            <li> They are natural looking lashes, like I&#x27;m talking very natural lashes</li>
            <li> So I was never able to wear lashes during the day, only when we went out at night and it was OK to look a little more &amp;#34;glam.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> After cutting the long ends they are the perfect natural lashes.</li>
            <li> VERY thin,but on lazy days I just throw them over my normal lashes &amp; pack on some mascara &amp; it makes a great,simple,beautiful look of full lashes</li>
            <li> The base is invisible, they are the perfect length, and they look completely natural!</li>
            <li> After cutting and adjusting to my size I put them on and have to say they there very light weight and comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> They really are so natural looking that I can actually wear them during the day!  </li>
            <li> They are really natural looking, have a clear band , and are really soft  </li>
            <li> I bought the clear glue strips and they stay on.  </li>
            <li> I got all natural looking ones not a mix.</li>
            <li> I am going to order at least two more boxes.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t look so natural.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t curve to a natural eye shape.</li>
            <li> , they look sooo natural and they are definitely soft.</li>
            <li> I got it faster than I thought, and the product is so natural.</li>
            <li> once the natural look.</li>
            <li> and plus i have sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> So for myself I found them to be too natural looking.  </li>
            <li> they look really natural, just how i like it..</li>
            <li> The band and the lashes are really soft, which is something I have to get used to.</li>
            <li> These lashes are natural looking and they are inexpensive.</li>
            <li> These are a MUST BUY if you are looking for natural lashes.</li>
            <li> WOW.  </li>
            <li> Soft, lush and lengthy lashes.  </li>
            <li> Looks natural on my eyes.</li>
            <li> I like natural</li>
            <li> I can wear them without make up they look so natural.  </li>
            <li> they look so natural but help define and lengthen.</li>
            <li> They were very short and way shorter than my real lashes.</li>
            <li> they look really natural</li>
            <li> If your looking for a natural looking lash</li>
            <li> The whole lash was the same length</li>
            <li> though honestly &#x27;natural&#x27; is not a thing I look for from my falsies.</li>
            <li> They were all natural.</li>
            <li> maybe going for a natural look.</li>
            <li> Really natural looking.</li>
            <li> It looks so natural.</li>
            <li> They look really natural.</li>
            <li> it blends with my natural lashes</li>
            <li> They are natural looking.</li>
            <li> Good thing the eyelashes aren&#x27;t that expensive.</li>
            <li> These lashes are nice but way to thin for me</li>
            <li> These are nice natural false lashes.</li>
            <li> and you do need to use sharp scissors to snip off the excess thread, but each pair of lashes will be able to last multiple uses (the pair I wore earlier still feels very sturdy even after I removed it and picked off the glue).</li>
            <li> Also, they don&#x27;t have the right curve to lay right on your eyelash line which makes you have to apply extra dots of glue on the ends which can get messy.</li>
            <li> , they are the same length as my normal lashes, not dramatic enough</li>
            <li> Only a few lashes were split though so if you don&#x27;t mind a few being accents and most being full wear, you are all set with these.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Subtle, great for everyday.</li>
            <li> they were pretty but more difficult to apply and not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I bought them to add to my own lashes for an everyday look but they are too thin and super long while my own are medium length and thick.</li>
            <li> than that the eyelashes are nice, they look long but not too dramatic, you could wear them everyday :)</li>
            <li> This is good product as this price, but this is thin and long eyelash.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap compare to other eyelashes that are out there, but it&#x27;s not very natural looking when I use it.</li>
            <li> The band is fairly straight (due to the packaging; it has two extended threads that are taped down by the stickers) and it&#x27;s a bit difficult to manipulate it into a nice curve for easy application.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes, the only bad thing is they took Forever to get here, more than 4 weeks, so</li>
            <li> They are cheap, and you get a lot for the small price.  </li>
            <li> With all that said, if you&#x27;re careful and patient (which you have to be inorder to apply lashes in the first palce)</li>
            <li> THEY WERE TOO LONG AND DID NOT LOOK NATURAL!!!</li>
            <li> They are are all the same style, a soft, natural looking lash.</li>
            <li> They are the closest looking to real lashes, and can be built up just like real lashes with a few coats of mascara....</li>
            <li> few of the lashes, appear more split in the center.</li>
            <li> They were all exactly the same one style of lashes which was didisappointing being the only reason I bought the lashes was try out different styles.</li>
            <li> they were all the same natural lashes!</li>
            <li> I only want an accent so for me they will work because I cut one lash strip right in the center and use one for both eyes.</li>
            <li> no where near natural lashes these are big full dramatic lashes that most girls wear that make your eyes look heavy and</li>
            <li> Three weeks was a lot faster than I excepted as generally orders from Hong Kong and Asia in general can take a lot longer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quit surprised by these, I don&#x27;t like the real big gaudy eyelashes</li>
            <li> The eyelashes didnt come like the picture ,they were short and natural looking</li>
            <li> I ordered natural and regular ones</li>
            <li> If you want something that is natural looking but also enhances your lashes at the same time, they are the ones to go to!</li>
            <li> They are okay, not great.</li>
            <li> You have to pull them up out of a little hole and the more you pull you feel as if they&#x27;ll break in half from the tugging.</li>
            <li> 1that&#x27;s ridiculous and the box was ask bent up other than that seems to be a nice product.</li>
            <li> I love wearing false lashes, as my own  are very thin &amp; sparse.</li>
            <li> I wasted a lot of time and glue just trying to get them on right...</li>
            <li> Perfect size.. Not to thick or long and don&#x27;t look super fake, just looks like I have longer fuller lashes!!</li>
            <li> The eyelashes were long and looked very natural.</li>
            <li> I purchase eyelashes usually from a beauty store and only wear them on special occasions.</li>
            <li> If you want a more dramatic effect, layer the</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to more dramatic lashes with a stiffer band.</li>
            <li> I bought this product, and as a girl who wear false eyelashes on a daily basis, I love them.</li>
            <li> the band itself is long and a clear plastic.</li>
            <li> I like these lashes, their like a natural but long.</li>
            <li> so soft they were my first fast shipping eyelashes that i received out of the other 60 pairs i order , they are also thin and long , meaning they will give you a natural long eyelash look .</li>
            <li> lashes that I haven&#x27;t worn yet because they are very bold and dramatic and I haven&#x27;t gotten up the nerve.</li>
            <li> Im going to come straight out and warn you that the lashes aren&#x27;t a variety of thick and voluminous and natural.</li>
            <li> Not too thick and just the right length.</li>
            <li> They are so natural looking not one person was able to tell they were fake!</li>
            <li> i know that they are supposed to look natural but they feel like fabric rather than lashes due to the thinness of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint, shipping - They are shipped from China, so logically, their going to take a while to get shipped from over seas.</li>
            <li> I thought they&#x27;d be different styles of lashes, as the pic would have one believe, instead I received a box full of identical, poorly made lashes.</li>
            <li> now if you&#x27;re looking for something more dramatic these are not for you!</li>
            <li> The ones they sent were just the average natural looking ones.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was it took a REALLY long time to ship to me.</li>
            <li> They are on extra long bands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty hard to work with them since they&#x27;re not flexible and I always have to cut the silicon edges because they are too long</li>
            <li> I have a hard understanding how these got any positive reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are bound by a black thread instead of clear plastic.</li>
            <li> The pack of lashes I received were all the same they were not thin ones and thick ones</li>
            <li> the clear plastic that the individual hairs are attached to is a little too long</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very soft, which is why I think I have trouble with it.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy lashes have to apply enough glue for it to cake for them to set will not use on clients pretty disappointing ...</li>
            <li> Adding insult to injury the ashesives I alreay use for other brands barely make thses tacky.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> I had purchased several other types of eyelashes all at the same time on Amazon.</li>
            <li> the main reason why i ordered these was so that i could save up some money because i usually wear ELF eyelashes</li>
            <li> Some of the eyelashes were a bit bent out of shape, but a little mist with water fixed that.</li>
            <li> Too long</li>
            <li> Took a long time to receive.</li>
            <li> Lashes aren&#x27;t as long as they appear in picture.  </li>
            <li> Comes with no glue and are not that long.</li>
            <li> ( very fragile so be careful when peeling them off the carton</li>
            <li> you just have to be extra careful when applying</li>
            <li> Just so long as they look good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are made quite long, so I have to chop them off on both ends -</li>
            <li> these are rather LONG.</li>
            <li> They take a long time.</li>
            <li> The quality makes up for the long ship time in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Yes they&#x27;re long</li>
            <li> Not much longer than my actual eyelashes though.</li>
            <li> They have thin like clear fishing wire as the base which makes them sooo much easier to hide with or without eyeliner and they look natural but definatly gives more oomph</li>
            <li> they are a little hard to get on the first time and they began to look tattered after only 2 uses.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t too dramatic and can be used for everyday wear, they are light weight and feel just like human hair.</li>
            <li> Not too bad good for people who have big eye, small eye have to cut it</li>
            <li> They are light, the band is thin, and the lashes are long and fluffy.</li>
            <li> but it took a very long time for shipping.</li>
            <li> Comes with a variety of lashes for different kinds of events there are bold ones and even thin ones for an everyday use.</li>
            <li> but you can trim them too as long as you are careful</li>
            <li> i bought these as my first false eye lashes, just to give them a try.</li>
            <li> but I probably won&#x27;t be buying this kind again due to the width of the actual lash base.</li>
            <li> This is what makes it possible to cut one strip in half.</li>
            <li> they take some manipulation but with a good eyeliner base and good glue to slick these bad boys down</li>
            <li> A lot of the reviews are negative because the product isn&#x27;t as pictured, these are very NATURAL looking not bulky.</li>
            <li> lashes are the longest in the center and taper down on both sides to the same size.</li>
            <li> GAGA 10 Pairs of Reusable Natural and Regular Long False Eyelashes.</li>
            <li> They arent too dramatic, but have enough of a wow factor which is what I was looking for!!</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist and find that they add a little something extra to the face.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was it took a little longer to get to me; even though it comes from China ( I believe)</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t tell they are fake, but they have so much length!!</li>
            <li> I have worn false eyelashes for months now trying different brands and styles along with thick and thin bands and these are my FAVORITE!</li>
            <li> Got them faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> Not really what I wanted</li>
            <li> Be careful these lashes are not what are shown.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s only few dollars</li>
            <li> not what I expected at all</li>
            <li> I was contacted by Amazon about my refund, but never received any money back or the 2 missing packages.</li>
            <li> got here a lot sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected from the photo</li>
            <li> Not really my style</li>
            <li> the only reason why i order these is because they are reusable and i want these for my everyday look at school</li>
            <li> then I expected.</li>
            <li> Faster shipping than I expected</li>
            <li> The key to applying is putting the glue on the false line then blow on it for about 10 seconds while bending it to your natural curve like a horse shoe.</li>
            <li> They arrived waaay before expected due date which is fantasttic</li>
            <li> they were a little too long for my eyes</li>
            <li> But should have listened to other reviews</li>
            <li> I know they are just a dollar and some cents, but the fact that I decided to not buy other lashes, etc....</li>
            <li> I ordered these lashes with some other things that came from China</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t come with glue, but I have plenty from other lashes.</li>
            <li> But other than that I would repurchase.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I wanted, but works.  </li>
            <li> So 5 stars for the unknown box?!?</li>
            <li> A little long so you may need to trim them down.</li>
            <li> I am new to the false eyelashes</li>
            <li> Took a little longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> They came in on time, which I was a bit surprised about because of there being some reviews from people who never got them or got them very late.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the clear band so that I don&#x27;t have to apply a very thick application of eyeliner to blend the color of the band with the rest of my eye look (as I&#x27;ve had to with some</li>
            <li> They sent me the wrong ones /: I really wanted the ones in the photo for different events, I like the daily look and the dramatic look.</li>
            <li> but it looks like you have nothing on your eyes, not worth the dollar if you ask me</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have the dark line like eyeliner.....</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the way the lashes are inserted into the box.</li>
            <li> the only thing that sucks is that the part where you put the glue on is thread...</li>
            <li> They do not include glue (I recommend buying duo lash glue dark toned)</li>
            <li> the eyelashes look and feel real, I expected them to feel like plastic</li>
            <li> So thin and natural.</li>
            <li> I had to put 3 together for fullness and trim it down</li>
            <li> Just the fact that my delivery went to my neighbors 2 streets down</li>
            <li> It did take about four weeks for me to receive, but that was expected, knowing that I ordered them from overseas!!</li>
            <li> I ordered the natural lashes and got a set of crisscross dramatic ones.</li>
            <li> But these........10 pair for less than $2.00?????</li>
            <li> the less ..</li>
            <li> Theyre half the size of what it shows in the picture.</li>
            <li> so I have to cover it up with black eyeliner.</li>
            <li> but I am going to have to trim the length down a little bit.</li>
            <li> i prefer large, thick and dramatic eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Not too thick and too long.</li>
            <li> I usually wear eyeshadow when I wear false lashes but with these ones I can wear by itself and it looks like my natural lashes!</li>
            <li> it was a little bent as well</li>
            <li> I was so excited to recieve these and was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> it makes the glue set a little</li>
            <li> It looked a little bit longer in the photo.</li>
            <li> these look super natural do not look fake at all!!!!!</li>
            <li> Not really impressed with these lashes, they were super thin and got clumpy with every mascara I tried on them.</li>
            <li> Very cheap, horrible quality makes them harder to put on,</li>
            <li> The band is very thin and the lashes are very natural.</li>
            <li> The bands are really thin and hard to work with and the display picture is incorrect, they&#x27;re all the same, thin, natural lash style.</li>
            <li> BUT I was shocked to find that they are sooooo natural looking that I WILL be wearing them daily.</li>
            <li> The band is clear so they do not look fake at all.</li>
            <li> I received my lashes a few days ago!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these lashes.</li>
            <li> I wear these basically everyday.</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian with naturally rounded eyes, these lashes are useless to me.</li>
            <li> Wasted money.</li>
            <li> I recommend this lashes to people who want or like natural looking lashes it doesn&#x27;t look fake at all.</li>
            <li> so you have to snip it before applying which is an unnecessary extra step.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> Plastic strip lashes give me all sorts of trouble wanting to pop up on the edges.</li>
            <li> However, the lashes are fluffy, and while the picture shows a variety you get one style.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on these.</li>
            <li> I wear these everyday, doesnt come with glue</li>
            <li> but then i started to notice that they arent all the same size some were longer than others and they are really really thin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.</li>
            <li> I can also reuse each pair a few times.</li>
            <li> The base of them were a clear band, and if you applied them with a clear adhesive then there is no need of any eyeliner and your eyelashes</li>
            <li> The curve pictured is because they are taped down with the small round stickers.</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried from the past reviews that I wouldn&#x27;t be receiving these lashes, but thankfully I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box came in just a plastic mailing bag, so it&#x27;s slightly squished on the edges, so those who are picky might not appreciate that.</li>
            <li> They are a bit hard to put on due to the featherweight of them</li>
            <li> These are very thin and look natural even with mascara on them.</li>
            <li> So stiff and plastic they wont bend to your eyelid with 10 tons of glue.</li>
            <li> They are a bit stiff</li>
            <li> But, if you&#x27;re used to wearing lashes, you will know you usually have to do a little bit of trimming anyway.</li>
            <li> Way too thin and too long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on day two attempting to wear them (and I&#x27;ve been wearing false lashes for quite some time), and am unable to keep them on because they are in a straight line.</li>
            <li> I just add a little Mascara for definition &amp; go on my way!</li>
            <li> A little upset about that!</li>
            <li> They are a little hard to put on because they don&#x27;t hold their shape.</li>
            <li> Quality is worse than I expected</li>
            <li> Not pleased.</li>
            <li> Not sure whats in them.</li>
            <li> Not sure what it is...  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like heavy thick lashes.</li>
            <li> Total rip-off!</li>
            <li> Buying these was pointless; you cant even use them.</li>
            <li> Do note, however, that the strip that holds the lashes is longer than the lash area and extends past the lashes a couple milometers, you&#x27;ll have to trim these on either end before applying them.</li>
            <li> They were very thin and short wasn&#x27;t what I seen in the picture so disssapointed never again</li>
            <li> I like these lashes a lot, although they are a little tough to put on.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and im not sure if they work for me because i still havent figured out how to do it correctly :(</li>
            <li> Hard to work with putting them on.  </li>
            <li> The band isnt thick and hard to apply so makes it east to put them on.</li>
            <li> at least  they got here on time</li>
            <li> Really awful and cheaply made</li>
            <li> so i filed  a complaint.</li>
            <li> it came in just a lil late</li>
            <li> If it let me rate this with no star, I would, with negative.</li>
            <li> this false lash I buy from this seller is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This was a waste and wouldn&#x27;t recommend these to anyone!!</li>
            <li> I have no problem getting these on, they have a very thin line and are extremely flexable.</li>
            <li> The ones I receieved are very small.</li>
            <li> I would definitely say these are bad quality.</li>
            <li> They are not good.</li>
            <li> I wanted the thick version but received thin lashes.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about ordering these since its hard to tell what they look like from a picture, but I was speechless at the product!</li>
            <li> Every one of them was the same. :(</li>
            <li> IT WAS HARD TO GLUE ON AND UNCOMFORTABLE</li>
            <li> The band is so difficult to apply and it&#x27;s a hard band.</li>
            <li> these lashes and soooo thin you can&#x27;t tell you&#x27;re wearing them at all</li>
            <li> not what I thought they are two thin.</li>
            <li> These are the worse lashes i have ever seen.</li>
            <li> So addicted to this product.</li>
            <li> the lashes are thin and too thin to put glue on to put on your eyelids&lt;</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re a bit thin.</li>
            <li> to thin for my liking</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re all thin and identical.</li>
            <li> I AM NOT HAPPY</li>
            <li> They were thin</li>
            <li> but of course you have to be with any false eyelash.</li>
            <li> If you are going for a dramatic eye this is not the lash for you.</li>
            <li> The lashes are to dramatic for my liking.  </li>
            <li> If you added mascara and eyeliner then it gives you dramatic look.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, wrong style sent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually a little disappointed by the length.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of these lashes because of the price</li>
            <li> I so thin, I can almost get away with wearing the lash without liner!</li>
            <li> It goes on weird.  </li>
            <li> Aside from my experience, the product was flimsy and difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> but they still look fake...</li>
            <li> Flashy, lashy bat your eyes.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I received the wrong lashes.</li>
            <li> so it looked silly.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t mind, but the eye lashes aren&#x27;t tapered by the time I&#x27;m done, making the eyelashes look fake.</li>
            <li> I tried to cut a tapered edge, but then it looks weird.</li>
            <li> but beware, the photo sample posted is fake.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing fake eyelashes for over 6 years.</li>
            <li> Ill just keep on buying my ELF eyelashes.</li>
            <li> got the wrong box of lashes.</li>
            <li> These lashes are very thin.</li>
            <li> Very, very thin.</li>
            <li> Looks nothing like the photo, and very poor quality.  </li>
            <li> Very poor quality.  </li>
            <li> so you can see how they look , and they ain&#x27;t eyelashes for dramatic looks !</li>
            <li> I hate the thick bands on eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Unhappy customer, and</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong with these!</li>
            <li> Rather mad the picture shows a verity of lashes</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I ordered these because they were so inexpensive!</li>
            <li> no one will know theyre fake!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to write a review when I&#x27;m having a bad experience.</li>
            <li> The lashes aren&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> There not to bad  </li>
            <li> Im disappointed because I did not get what&#x27;s in the picture.</li>
            <li> So disappointed oh well</li>
            <li> but i have never been so disappointed with customer service issues.</li>

            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed...</li>
            <li> The worst!  </li>
            <li> These are probably the worst eyelashes I&#x27;ve ever seen in my life.</li>
            <li> Annoying!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so horrible.</li>
            <li> They look horrible once on and getting them on is a nightmare.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Got them faster than I expected. Can&#x27;t wait to try them out.</li>
            <li> These are probably the most natural looking lashes I have purchased.</li>
            <li> No glue !  Mea Culpa.</li>
            <li> It took about one week which was really good. And the box was in good condition. And lastly I love the lashes I got!! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> these lashes and soooo thin you can&#x27;t tell you&#x27;re wearing them at all, I guess that&#x27;s what some people are going for but it looks like you have nothing on your eyes, not worth the dollar if you ask me</li>
            <li> i prefer large, thick and dramatic eyelashes. these are not what i was expecting to get.</li>
            <li> Did not get the eyelashes displayed. I received different eyelashes I didn&#x27;t order. Didn&#x27;t get what I wanted</li>
            <li> These have very long bands for those of us with large eyes who can&#x27;t get the standard ones to fit corner to corner.  They are so pretty and you get soooo many of them! I can&#x27;t figure out why anyone would purchase any of the eyelashes at a store-you get 10 pair of these for the price of one pair from a store!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty put I didn&#x27;t order these. I wanted the variety bundle that came with 10 different pairs... But whatever they&#x27;re only a couple bucks! 😁 and they&#x27;re pretty soft which I like!!</li>
            <li> The lashes were very fragile and and break easily.  I would definitely say these are bad quality. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Good lashes, shipped pretty fast, but not at all like the picture. They are all the same unlike the picture where various styles are shown</li>
            <li> not what I thought they are two thin. did not come as the picture seen here.</li>
            <li> Perfect size.. Not to thick or long and don&#x27;t look super fake, just looks like I have longer fuller lashes!!</li>
            <li> They arrived quicker than I had anticipated. I order things from HK for nail art pretty frequently, and it has taken up to 2 months, these came in about 3 weeks. The lashes themselves are pretty and comfortable, but obviously synthetic, which is fine, most lashes are. I put a pair of these on my mom for Halloween and she said they felt very comfortable, it was her first time wearing lashes. I sanitize and re-wear all my lashes up to 4 times, but most of mine are 100% Human Hair. I can get 2 wears out of a pair of these, if I&#x27;m careful, which is fine for the price. My problem is with the customer service. I placed my order and the next day woke up to an email about how they were only making .20 cent from my purchase. DO NOT LIST THEM THAT CHEAP THEN!!! It is not my problem, and I found that very unprofessional. They had the same product listed for around $11 and $1 and some change, just why would I pay more for the exact same product if I can get it cheaper??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I can recommend this product to you all, quality wise, but I hope they don&#x27;t treat all of their customers this way. My favorite lash is Red Cherry #213, which I can get 6 pair, 4 wears each out of for around $10 on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Takes a while to get package but great quality</li>
            <li> These really don&#x27;t stick on with any type of eyelash glue.  I think the eyelash itself is a bit too synthetic. However, you do get what you paid for</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift. She loved them!</li>
            <li> Not the lashes on pic I got all natural looking ones not a mix. Owell still not bad for $2.00 but would have loved to try different styles</li>
            <li> These eyelashes feel just like any others I&#x27;ve ever tried, kiss, ardell, etc. They are a tad long, but if anything that&#x27;s a good thing, better than them being too short!</li>
            <li> Im disappointed because I did not get what&#x27;s in the picture. I received 10 pairs of the same lashes. However, they&#x27;re very natural looking and the perfect compliment to more subtle makeup.</li>
            <li> At first I was not sure about the quality of the product how ever when it got here I was surprise by the quality of it. the package was in perfect conditions, it got here about two weeks before it was suppose to. the eyelashes look and feel real, I expected them to feel like plastic but they don&#x27;t. I am going to order at least two more boxes.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic better than described</li>
            <li> Bought these thinking that they were like the picture shown (multiple different eyelashes).&lt;br /&gt;This is a scam. These are the worse lashes i have ever seen. My own eyelashes are better quality!!!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re nice. But should have listened to other reviews cuz they&#x27;re NOT like the picture. All the same and more of a natural look. Not really what I wanted but eh...</li>
            <li> I received my lashes a few days ago!&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited!&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re beautiful, light and very,very natural looking! My friends thought they were my real lashes😀..and that was the look I was going for!&lt;br /&gt;Yes it took about a month, but I knew that when I order them. So it wasn&#x27;t a problem for me. I love these lashes and I can honestly say I didn&#x27;t think they would be so awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Will be ordering more!!!!!!</li>
            <li> doesnt look like that pic.</li>
            <li> The order was based on the picture and the lashes received were NOT them! I received the same style with NO VARIATIONS!&lt;br /&gt;Also they need to be bent around the finger several times beofre they conform to eyelash. Adding insult to injury the ashesives I alreay use for other brands barely make thses tacky.&lt;br /&gt;What gives?&lt;br /&gt;They are pretty I will say this much and natural looking, but that is the only nice thing I can say.</li>
            <li> great, takes forever to clear customs but worth it for the price</li>
            <li> So addicted to this product. I&#x27;d say there better than the red cheery brand. Natural looking and can be wearable more than twice.</li>
            <li> Great lashes for the price.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made. Will not conform to eyelid shape. Will never buy again.</li>
            <li> The pack of lashes I received were all the same they were not thin ones and thick ones it was two rows of the same size and color lashes</li>
            <li> I like these lashes, their like a natural but long. They are reuseable also. I just wish they could come quicker with shipping.</li>
            <li> LOVE these lashes! Although the shipping did take a while defiantly worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I was nervous about ordering these since its hard to tell what they look like from a picture, but I was speechless at the product! They are the perfect lashes for me! The strip continues off of the lashes which you have to cut, not a big deal at all. I had to trim the lashes because I have small eyes, but better longer than shorter! Such a great price for a great product! I would always use ardell 110 lashes which were like $3 for one pair. I like these lashes way more than the ardell and I love these way more. Definitely would recommend. They arent too dramatic, but have enough of a wow factor which is what I was looking for!!</li>
            <li> Be careful these lashes are not what are shown. They are are all the same style, a soft, natural looking lash. If you are going for a dramatic eye this is not the lash for you.</li>
            <li> Wanted to return but it&#x27;s only few dollars so I didn&#x27;t bother. Too long and it doesn&#x27;t look so natural.</li>
            <li> These are perfect. I&#x27;ve been buying lashes from China for years and tried many different companies, but these ones are so far the best quality. They aren&#x27;t too bulky or plastic, the bands are very bendable and stay on really really well. PLEASE READ: A lot of the reviews are negative because the product isn&#x27;t as pictured, these are very NATURAL looking not bulky. If you&#x27;re looking for a variety find it elsewhere. These are fantastic for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping! Super cute ! Looks just like the picture! Wears well! Super soft ! Would def buy more of these!</li>
            <li> nice , it&#x27;s like the real thing</li>
            <li> The lashes are wonderful and beautiful will definitely buy again! The only problem I had was it took a REALLY long time to ship to me. But I&#x27;m so happy with them I don&#x27;t mind and will buy them again :)</li>
            <li> Quality is worse than I expected</li>
            <li> I got the lashes all right--but they were NOT as pictured here.  Instead of a variety of lash types, what I got were boxes of all identical lashes.  Every one of them was the same. :(</li>
            <li> Why does it show variety lashes when they are all the same. So disappointed oh well at least  they got here on time</li>
            <li> Shipping wasn&#x27;t super quick, but it came at a decent time! For the price, these lashes are the most natural looking ones I&#x27;ve ever used! Definitely will be buying these again since they are so affordable! A great buy!</li>
            <li> Total worth the price! If you want a more dramatic effect, layer the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be ordering a thicker lashes next time.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t curve to a natural eye shape. Good for price</li>
            <li> These lashes are good and got here in the time stated.  The lashes are to dramatic for my liking.  But the band is very flexible and clear!</li>
            <li> just the right size for a person who wears glasses. Curls easily, light weight. Look very natural. I reused these .</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of these lashes because of the price but, I&#x27;m more than happy with what I got! These lashes look great and they look so natural. I usually wear eyeshadow when I wear false lashes but with these ones I can wear by itself and it looks like my natural lashes! I highly recommend these!!</li>
            <li> Very flimsy lashes have to apply enough glue for it to cake for them to set will not use on clients pretty disappointing ...</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Just like the pic. Love how they are so natural looking if you want that natural look. Cannot beat this price.</li>
            <li> Mine came all the same eyelash style.  Took a long time to receive. They are on extra long bands. I just can&#x27;t get the hang of getting lashes on, but glad that I didn&#x27;t spend a lot of money trying to learn to put on fake lashes.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, wrong style sent.</li>
            <li> Dident receive the correct ones</li>
            <li> I was very suprised when my lashes arrived sooner then expected, I was also very happy about the condition of the lashes. I did not like the plastic the lashes are connected to but other then that they are all in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Got these today, been waiting forever, but worth it, they look sooo natural and they are definitely soft. The package I just like it looks. Great.</li>
            <li> i bought these as my first false eye lashes, just to give them a try. I really liked how they looked, very natural. and they are reusable.</li>
            <li> Love this those are super Natural, my clients are happy with them, the final result looks glam.  I recomend this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been over two months and I still have not gotten these lashes! Very disappointed. It was shipped since August 31st and today is November 2. Don&#x27;t waste your money on these lashes.</li>
            <li> Not what is pictured at all.  The ones I received are all the same &amp; very light.  Not pleased.</li>
            <li> I ordered these lashes, when I got them they were in great shape. When the product was applied they look naturally beautiful and very soft on the eyelid.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but i have never been so disappointed with customer service issues. I Ordered lashes from them a month ago. Didn&#x27;t receive them. When I emailed them about the lashes they said that they were in Hong Kong I believe and that the lashes would be in but not till the end of the month. At that point I had already written a review about them so they emailed me asking if I could write a better comment and that they just shipped out the lashes. I said sure but as soon as i receive the lashes I would write a good review. The next day they called me asking if I could write a better review and even emailed me with steps. I&#x27;m not going to write a review when I&#x27;m having a bad experience. I had told them that once I receive the lashes that I was charged for I would gladly write a good review. Today I checked my a count and the lashes aren&#x27;t even there? I still want the lashes and seems as though all they want are good reviews</li>
            <li> These are decent for the price. A little long so you may need to trim them down. Just a good basic natural lash.</li>
            <li> So stiff and plastic they wont bend to your eyelid with 10 tons of glue. This is definitely a very cheap product</li>
            <li> I got it faster than I thought, and the product is so natural. This eyelash is exactly what i want.</li>
            <li> They are perfect for ppl that have thin lashes. I love how they look. I will order more soon. Thx</li>
            <li> these are completely natural looking and great quality, I wore these out to a formal and I got so many compliments!</li>
            <li> THEY WORTH FOR THE VALUE.</li>
            <li> I bought this product, and as a girl who wear false eyelashes on a daily basis, I love them. The part that attach to your eyelids are translucent and it makes for easy wear. I went to Macys to buy some eye shadow and asked the lady at the M.A.C counter to put a sample of the eye shadow on me. She asked if I was wearing extensions. I will be re-ordering from this company.</li>
            <li> They are not like the picture but they are very natural looking, The order arrived within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes are.very beautiful ! i love them very much ! they were exactly what i was looking for !</li>
            <li> I really like these, they are wispy, not very thick but still thicker than my real lashes. They fit 97% of my eyelid which is perfect for me. They are the closest looking to real lashes, and can be built up just like real lashes with a few coats of mascara.... however they are a bit fragile....if you are gentile with them you can re-wear them.</li>
            <li> I just received them and they are better than what I expected.........for me. . I am new to the false eyelashes so I am NO expert. I bought them with the intention of using them for practice only  BUT I was shocked to find that they are sooooo natural looking that I WILL be wearing them daily. I have a pair of $10.00 J.cat lashes that I haven&#x27;t worn yet because they are very bold and dramatic and I haven&#x27;t gotten up the nerve. But these........10 pair for less than $2.00?????? They are NOT dramatic,they are very natural looking. I could wear these anytime and they will blend in with my own lashes and just enhance them, not look like I am on stage. This is what I wanted. I don&#x27;t want to look like I am wearing lashes but I believe I won&#x27;t need eyeliner with these. They are just perfect for me. I am going to order a few more right now before they raise the price once everyone tries them and raves about them. Really happy with these NAILS GAGA 10 Pairs of Reusable Natural and Regular Long False Eyelashes.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for cheap product falls apart</li>
            <li> Gorgeous! These lashes are so beautiful, so much better than shelling out 10 bucks for ONE pair at a drug store</li>
            <li> I hate giving reviews on product but  this false lash I buy from this seller is a waste of money.It&#x27;s look too plastic, well u get wat u pay for.</li>
            <li> Look and feel very real</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty hard to work with them since they&#x27;re not flexible and I always have to cut the silicon edges because they are too long</li>
            <li> Way too thin and too long I had to put 3 together for fullness and trim it down so I didn&#x27;t look like I had caterpillars over my eyes</li>
            <li> Awesome product is Awesome looks very natural I will buy more I would recommend this product or any 1 that once the natural look.</li>
            <li> they were a little too long for my eyes so i had to cut them but for the price and how often I wear them thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> Perfect for everyday and going out! They are super light and cute. I wear these basically everyday. They are so easy to wear as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it cause of the pokey plasic, but i think if you have bigger eyes and not so hooded or close then they might feel better. and plus i have sensitive eyes. and not so used to the plastic yet, but i just gave them to my sister, she said she liked them, then again she does have way biger eyes than me. so yeah. i think thats it. just the bottom plastic.</li>
            <li> seriously, these are the best lashes I&#x27;ve tried yet. They are so natural looking and blend well into my real lashes. I actually just ordered 3 more. You just cant beat the price.</li>
            <li> So Comfortable and Pretty .The lashes are very natural looking. If you want something that is natural looking .i love it</li>
            <li> Really looks natural and light weight and cheap price. I love this eyelashes. I don&#x27;t use mascara anymore.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I ordered the natural lashes and got a set of crisscross dramatic ones. they were pretty but more difficult to apply and not what I was looking for. But they are still good.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed... I already noticed that it would take about a month from the moment I clicked &#x27;order&#x27; until it arrives at my house. I actually lost track of the days, and I was suppose to get it THREE weeks ago. Almost two months and still no lashes! I know they are just a dollar and some cents, but the fact that I decided to not buy other lashes, etc....</li>
            <li> so cheap bought two types to try but started breaking out around my eyes every time i wore them. Had to toss them all. Not sure whats in them.</li>
            <li> You really get what you pay for with this.  Will never purchase and will not recommend.</li>
            <li> These are a great value. They aren&#x27;t the greatest quality but they look nice and go on easily. I recommend them.</li>
            <li> Just what i was looking for, love them and love the price. The band isnt thick and hard to apply so makes it east to put them on. And they are more of a natural look</li>
            <li> Fun, fast service good quality</li>
            <li> Like the product, like the results, love how they look, easy to put on  but just Received half of my order,</li>
            <li> These lashes are very thin. Very, very thin. They are my use and throw away lashes. Not something I would order again.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price, but with my cataract I can&#x27;t see to apply them. Maybe in a month or so!!!</li>
            <li> They are great for a natural look. However, you need to apply two at the same time bc it&#x27;s barely noticeable. Fibers hold well on the tread.</li>
            <li> Received ones not as pictured, but very close!And they&#x27;re even more gorgeous!</li>
            <li> I like these lashes. They are very cheap for the decent quality.</li>
            <li> The lashes are as descibed, natural-looking.  So for myself I found them to be too natural looking.  I personally like fuller/longer  looking lashes.  However, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for then I highly recommend them.  Also the main reason why I am giving them four stars is because they had really fast shipping, more then three weeks prior to the estimated shipping date.</li>
            <li> Omg very good they are amazing</li>
            <li> They are okay, not great. They are a bit stiff so it takes a lot of glue to hold them in place and they still come off a lot faster then they should. but for the price I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> there okay you cant bend them too much but if you like to wear eyelashes in a every day occasion than this would work but I tried to curl them and they just fell apart but that&#x27;s why there so cheap I would buy again</li>
            <li> Could not have purchased any better sets of lashes. These are so great for different clients. I will HAVE to keep these stocked up.</li>
            <li> I love the clear band on these and the lash I so thin, I can almost get away with wearing the lash without liner! These are great everyday lashes for when you want to enhance without doing too much! I love these and would give more stars, if I could.</li>
            <li> Waited for three weeks to get these lashes and was so excited because I read some pretty awesome reviews about them. I&#x27;m on day two attempting to wear them (and I&#x27;ve been wearing false lashes for quite some time), and am unable to keep them on because they are in a straight line. They have NO curve whatsoever. The curve pictured is because they are taped down with the small round stickers. Unless you have straight eyes or slits, do not buy these. I am Caucasian with naturally rounded eyes, these lashes are useless to me. Wasted money.</li>
            <li> Nice lashes!! The band is clear so they do not look fake at all. The order came within 2 weeks, much faster than I was quoted. I will be ordering these again!</li>
            <li> Good enough for the price I paid, and I know they&#x27;ll last.</li>
            <li> I purchase eyelashes usually from a beauty store and only wear them on special occasions. I like to get a more natural look so I cute them and half and these worked wonderfully (I trimmed the thread off of the ends and cut right in the middle leaving a pair that match perfectly) easy to apply (well as easy as any fake lash) and they look the most natural of any I have tried.  If you are looking for high drama I would not recommend.  But for a natural lash, easy to use and not break your bank - they are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They take forever to get (around a month) so I tried them and recently ordered 4 more boxes.</li>
            <li> they look really natural, just how i like it.. i will definitely order again. i suggest this to everyone girl out there</li>
            <li> These are so beautiful! They aren&#x27;t too dramatic and can be used for everyday wear, they are light weight and feel just like human hair. I am a makeup artist and find that they add a little something extra to the face. Great buy!!!!</li>
            <li> They are super flexible and can be made to fit to your individual eyes. The box they come in is adorable (white box, with see-through white cutout)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Service was as fast as it can come from China and I was very satisfied with the service! Am currently considering buying two more boxes, 10/10 would reccommend.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product It last more than any one, look so much natural and the price is fantastic!! Yup yup yup</li>
            <li> not what I expected at all but they are still nice natural lashes, thought they would be just a little longer... Didn&#x27;t have different lengths in the lashes like shown but still ok.... They are natural looking lashes, like I&#x27;m talking very natural lashes</li>
            <li> Lashes came in the mail wish they had come sooner but came I a reasonably  amount of time they are very natural and nice I love them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a newbie when it comes to lashes but these were so easy to put on and they look so natural and beautiful I&#x27;m sold for life</li>
            <li> I love wearing false lashes, as my own  are very thin &amp; sparse. I&#x27;ve purchased another set several months ago &amp; was very happy with the quality of these lashes. I decide to try this style, because I wanted something a little more natural looking. These are perfect! I just add a little Mascara for definition &amp; go on my way! My only complaint, shipping - They are shipped from China, so logically, their going to take a while to get shipped from over seas. The first set I bought, took about 4 weeks to arrive. This pair actually came a lot quicker! I only wanted 2 weeks this time around!  All in all, I&#x27;ve been very happy with this brand of lashes &amp; I love the box they come in - Easy storage &amp; cute heart cut out in the front.  For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong with these! Where else are you going to get 10 pairs of lashes for this price!?  For me, it&#x27;s very much worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I had purchased several other types of eyelashes all at the same time on Amazon. These were by far my favorite! I use these as every day eyelashes. They arrive in a kind-of sketchy package, but I had found out that every pair I ordered from different people did as well. The boxes that they are in were kind of squished, but there was no harm to the lases at all! The eyelashes were long and looked very natural. The base of them were a clear band, and if you applied them with a clear adhesive then there is no need of any eyeliner and your eyelashes look real and tremendous! If you added mascara and eyeliner then it gives you dramatic look. I loved being able to have that variety! I definitely will be buying these, and only these, again!</li>
            <li> thinner than i expected, and not as long as i figured they would be, guess good enough for price. wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Love my Lashes there light weight no one knows there not mine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad this came with 10 prs.  I have had so much fun with the compliments I have been receiving.  I wish I knew about these while I was going thru Chemo treatment.  Love them!</li>
            <li> I love these lashes, the only bad thing is they took Forever to get here, more than 4 weeks, so if you need some for a special occasion order in advance, they also look so natural not to curled up or thick, perfect for everyday use!</li>
            <li> Love theses lashes! They are the perfect length and they aren&#x27;t too thick or thin I love them and I will definitely order more ☺️</li>
            <li> This is good product as this price, but this is thin and long eyelash. With mascara is better. I will buy more.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, Top Quality, Threaded For A More Natural Appearance !!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a pro makeup artist and will order these again and again</li>
            <li> Wonderful. Not too thick and just the right length. Also was delivered WAY before it was supposed to be. Definitely WILL be ordering more.</li>
            <li> They came in on time, which I was a bit surprised about because of there being some reviews from people who never got them or got them very late. As for the lashes, they&#x27;re okay. For the price, I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything amazing. The band and the lashes are really soft, which is something I have to get used to. I&#x27;m used to more dramatic lashes with a stiffer band. Some of the eyelashes were a bit bent out of shape, but a little mist with water fixed that. My biggest problem is that they don&#x27;t really look natural on me because my real eyelashes are thicker than these. However, they are still very pretty lashes that I intend to use for daytime occasions (but I don&#x27;t use falsies on a regular basis).</li>
            <li> Very natural looking.</li>
            <li> Not sure what it is...  It goes on weird.  each one goes on with different angles. After trying 5 of them and I could not put them on evenly for right and left eyes, I gave up.  I wasted a lot of time and glue just trying to get them on right...&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like these lashes because they look so natural and light weight. But when I applied mascara on my real lashes and put these on the glue would not stick on my real lashes. It never happened to me before. The shipping also took a month to get here in the US.</li>
            <li> These lashes are natural looking and they are inexpensive. These are a MUST BUY if you are looking for natural lashes. The only problem I had was it took a little longer to get to me; even though it comes from China ( I believe) I ordered these lashes with some other things that came from China and I got those before I received these. But I do love them!!!!</li>
            <li> Very beautiful! They do take a while to get but for that price and especially how lovely they look they are worth it.</li>
            <li> I really love these lashes, they look so natural you don&#x27;t even have to wear&lt;br /&gt;mascara with them. put them on and be on you way. BEAUTIFUL</li>
            <li> love these eyelashes im the kind of person that like the more natural look and these look super natural do not look fake at all!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am rating this product a 3 simply because I only received 1 of the 3 boxes I ordered. I communicated with the company. They took full responsibility for the mix up, and promised my money back. I was contacted by Amazon about my refund, but never received any money back or the 2 missing packages. Aside from my experience, the product was flimsy and difficult to apply. I know alot of people that enjoy these lashes, but they simply were not for me. I will not be reordering.</li>
            <li> These lashes are really nice and easy to apply. They don&#x27;t come with glue, but I have plenty from other lashes.</li>
            <li> nice product wife is buying more</li>
            <li> For being so ridiculously cheap and not any kind of name brand, these are awesome! After cutting the long ends they are the perfect natural lashes. Shipping time was good also. Will definitely be ordering these again.</li>
            <li> Great lashes, great price. I suggest people who have smaller eyes is for them.  Took a little longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> Very good price but it took a very long time for shipping. It is coming from China. Probably would not buy again because I don&#x27;t usually use top liner but with this you must because if the string.</li>
            <li> got here a lot sooner than expected. it isnt a set of various falsies, theyre all the same - but its fine because they were only a dollar :P definitely a nice lil cheap gift.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look like the ones in the picture.😈</li>
            <li> the lashes are thin and too thin to put glue on to put on your eyelids&lt;br /&gt;they have stems on each end so you will have to clip them off&lt;br /&gt;very disappointed</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re a bit thin. Came in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> Good Deal! I always get asked if they&#x27;re real or lash extentions</li>
            <li> Lashes aren&#x27;t as long as they appear in picture.  Hard to work with putting them on.  Quality of product cheap.  Reusable is a stretch.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t look real that&#x27;s for sure but you can trim them too as long as you are careful</li>
            <li> I recommend this lashes to people who want or like natural looking lashes it doesn&#x27;t look fake at all. Pretty long and nice I really liked them they look natural, arrivd on time and was not damaged.</li>
            <li> OK, so I love fake lashes and the look they give my eyes...however I am a professional and it is important that I do NOT look like I am wearing fake lashes.  It would NOT go over well in my profession at all.  So I was never able to wear lashes during the day, only when we went out at night and it was OK to look a little more &amp;#34;glam.&amp;#34;  But these lashes are incredible.  They really are so natural looking that I can actually wear them during the day!  That is saying something!  I do usually snip just a tiny bit off the length, so they are still alot longer than my natural lashes but not so long that they draw too much attention and have people wondering.  The interesting thing is, I have used other &amp;#34;shorter&amp;#34; lashes  but they still look fake...it is something about the band and the way they are made.  But these are made so well and blend so well that they are great for everyday wear.  Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> These are very pretty but would be best for a person just beginning to wear lashes as they are quite thin but quite long from corner of eye to end so they need to be&lt;br /&gt;trimmed before application.  Quality is good, however, just not thick as I wear.</li>
            <li> Other then the length they perfect. I thought they would be longer. But they look really pretty &amp; natural!!!!! :)</li>
            <li> I got 10 of the same lashes. There weren&#x27;t 10 different pairs ugh. Incredibly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not anything like the picture. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> VERY thin,but on lazy days I just throw them over my normal lashes &amp; pack on some mascara &amp; it makes a great,simple,beautiful look of full lashes</li>
            <li> One of the best sets of lashes I have bought</li>
            <li> WOW.  Eye Love it.  Flashy, lashy bat your eyes.  Soft, lush and lengthy lashes.  Give a wink...</li>
            <li> love these a lot for a cheap price</li>
            <li> Great everyday lashes</li>
            <li> These are nice lashes, the only thing is when you apply them you need to use a lot of glue.</li>
            <li> Rather mad the picture shows a verity of lashes and I receive a plain Jane type of lashes and all the same kind. I also read the description and it gave me no reason to think that the picture shown was not the incorrect item. I would not purchase again knowing now what I was going to get and who I was going to get them from I feel like I&#x27;ve been scammed.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected from the photo</li>
            <li> These are so cute and great!!! This is my first time ordering from these people. Nothing was damaged it even came a bit early!!</li>
            <li> Only one style , but still nice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving ese lashes 4 stars because the are exactly what I wanted. They are really natural looking, have a clear band , and are really soft  but I haven&#x27;t had the chance to actually where them yet because I&#x27;m out  of glue . The box that it cam it was a little bent as well but the lashes weren&#x27;t damaged at  all. DEFFENTLY WORTH THE PRICE !!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously obsessed with these lashes!! So glad I got these because they look so natural no one can&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;m wearing falsies these just make my lashes look fuller which that&#x27;s what ice been looking for..</li>
            <li> Honestly these are good but not great. the clear plastic that the individual hairs are attached to is a little too long so you have to snip it before applying which is an unnecessary extra step. Also, they don&#x27;t have the right curve to lay right on your eyelash line which makes you have to apply extra dots of glue on the ends which can get messy. With all that said, if you&#x27;re careful and patient (which you have to be inorder to apply lashes in the first palce) you should be OKAY. Bottom line is you&#x27;re paying under $2 for 10 pairs of eyelashes.... so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> These were very cheaply made. I never used the rest after trying the 1st pair. Disappointed. .. but they are eyelashes non the less .. so I guess I will give then 2 stars</li>
            <li> I love the lashes but they are all natural looking :)</li>
            <li> I love how natural these lashes looks. I wear them for any occasion. Going to the movies, to work, a date, or just when I want to refresh my look for the day before heading to the grocery store.</li>
            <li> This looks absolutely nothing like the picture</li>
            <li> They just came in the mail wayy sooner than estimated. They look beautiful. I can&#x27;t wait to try them out.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to recieve these and was disappointed.  The eyelashes weren&#x27;t the same as the image. There was only one variety of lashes. They were all exactly the same one style of lashes which was didisappointing being the only reason I bought the lashes was try out different styles. Also the lashes dont have a normal band its band is made out of thread.</li>
            <li> Omg best eye lashes ever. Will be stocking up very soon.</li>
            <li> Its okay. worth the cheap price. Looks natural on my eyes. Not really my style</li>
            <li> Superb value for money though when you consider what you get. The lashes are middle of the road, just okay. Work fine. Unremarkable.</li>
            <li> Very good. &#x3D;) I like them</li>
            <li> Thin and cheap. The band is super thick and cheaply made. It took like  a month yo get.Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> These are nice natural false lashes. The lashes are soft enough and the band is pretty flexible so they are easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I use eyelashes for special occassions because I am honestly not that great at applying them, but these are amazing! I have no problem getting these on, they have a very thin line and are extremely flexable. They are super light and I don&#x27;t really notice them on, I will say this is probably the best lashes that i have purchased and that includes the $18 form MAC Makeup. They are very natural looking as well. I will continue buying these.</li>
            <li> They look way bigger in the picture. The ones I receieved are very small. Theyre half the size of what it shows in the picture. I really was excited to get this one too.</li>
            <li> Comes with no glue and are not that long. My eyelashes are short &amp; these just come above my eyelashes. Would&#x27;ve liked something more intense!!</li>
            <li> They were not what was in the picture</li>
            <li> like i mentioned before in another comment these eyelashes are so, so soft they were my first fast shipping eyelashes that i received out of the other 60 pairs i order , they are also thin and long , meaning they will give you a natural long eyelash look . i am not a person that will want this kind of look but you can see right away in the picture they look THIN so i dont see why people comment and say they wasn&#x27;t what they were looking for if they show you the picture so you can see how they look , and they ain&#x27;t eyelashes for dramatic looks ! the only reason why i order these is because they are reusable and i want these for my everyday look at school and ofcourse i am not going to purchase 365 pairs of eyelashes for school ! but i repeat these aint for a party night or any festival or any kind of place where you will want your eyes to be the center of attention these eyelashes wont work for that look .</li>
            <li> I wish I didn&#x27;t buy these. I thought they&#x27;d be different styles of lashes, as the pic would have one believe, instead I received a box full of identical, poorly made lashes. I have a hard understanding how these got any positive reviews. They are not good. I feel mislead about what I was buying. The quality of theese identical lashes is very bad as well.</li>
            <li> The worst!  Waste of money</li>
            <li> three months later...nothing</li>
            <li> They are PERFECT! These lashes are natural looking which I love. I don&#x27;t like heavy thick lashes. My lashes are very short so they don&#x27;t stand out even with Mascara on. So I like to have light lash enhancements like these to give my eyes that flirty look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are bound by a black thread instead of clear plastic. The thread is more flexible and for me I find it makes them easier to apply. I use my fingers to initially place them, then use my tweezers to help press them in and do fine adjustments before the glue sets up. They have stayed in place all day perfectly without a bit of fuss. Plastic strip lashes give me all sorts of trouble wanting to pop up on the edges. I wore them all day and they are still looking great! They are much more comfortable as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few of the lashes, appear more split in the center. The lashes are not missing, they just split to the sides more. So if you want coverage from edge to edge, you may need to finesse the lashes into place (if that&#x27;s possible). I only want an accent so for me they will work because I cut one lash strip right in the center and use one for both eyes. Only a few lashes were split though so if you don&#x27;t mind a few being accents and most being full wear, you are all set with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lashes are the longest in the center and taper down on both sides to the same size. Most strip lashes I have used before only taper in on the inner edge and are the longest at the outer edge. This is what makes it possible to cut one strip in half. Just to give you an idea on what this looks like, I placed them at the outmost edge of my eye, where the natural lashes begin, it reaches the center of my pupil. So it is what I would call an accent size. I could get away with cinching in just a &amp;#34;hare&amp;#34; (LOL) so that it would go to the inner edge of my pupil. For full coverage, I would not have to snip much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They arrived over two weeks sooner than the estimated ship date. I received them onOct 1st and the window of arrival was October 15th - November 5th.  The padded envelope arrived in perfect shape with it&#x27;s contents unharmed in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely order them again!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered. Loved them.</li>
            <li> On time and just as described</li>
            <li> I did not receive the lashes that were described nor did they look like the ones in the picture,but I&#x27;m okay with that the ones that I received were even better they were all the same natural lashes! Just the fact that my delivery went to my neighbors 2 streets down but I blame my post office for that mistake! Otherwise very happy with that lashes this is my 3rd time ordering and would order again!</li>
            <li> to thin for my liking</li>
            <li> So I bought these and they are so great!  They don&#x27;t have the dark line like eyeliner.....and for me I like that,.  I bought the clear glue strips and they stay on.  I like making my own liner on my eyes and I don&#x27;t look like a hooker.  (ooops I didn&#x27;t say that)</li>
            <li> They arrived waaay before expected due date which is fantasttic but the problem is that its waaay too light not enough lashes but overall not bad.</li>
            <li> This product came rapidly and they are really nice, better than my natural eyelashes.  Yes, I do like them and recommend them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quit surprised by these, I don&#x27;t like the real big gaudy eyelashes I like natural and these are perfect. I have smaller eyes so I do have to cut them down as these are pretty long, which is good for others is they have larger eyes.  Easy to use I don&#x27;t reuse them so I can&#x27;t say how they hold up 2nd use but I love them.</li>
            <li> They are long a gorgeous.  I can wear them without make up they look so natural.  You can&#x27;t tell they are fake, but they have so much length!! great buy!</li>
            <li> Love these lashes, they are nice size, not too long or too short, easy to apply, can be used several times, they are very affordable and come with 10 pairs. they do take close to a month to receive when you order, so i suggest you order more boxes to have extra. They also look like your real lashes. Will continue to buy in future, my first order was 5 boxes. :)</li>
            <li> These are probably the worst eyelashes I&#x27;ve ever seen in my life. They are so cheaply made and they are not even in length. I guess it was just too good to be true. I will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Light, fluffy, small.  Great for beginners.  I recommend these for the folks who are &amp;#34;bothered&amp;#34; by the weight of the lash &amp; glue.  These are so light, you will forget they are there!  Nice &amp; soft lash look too.  Great steal for only a couple bucks!!!</li>
            <li> The exact same pair of lashes.  Looks nothing like the photo, and very poor quality.  Pieces of the lashes were falling out and the ends would poke me in the eye.  The lashes would also glue on really low so it covered my eyes instead of framing it.  Very poor quality.  Though not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> The band is clear and bends easily. The volume is just a step lighter than my Red Cherry #80 and my Ardell 105. They hold mascara really well if you want to build them up.They are so light weight I forgot I had them on.A full eight hours later and still comfy. The clear band blends so easily. I love eyelashes with clear bands so this was a bonus. I plan on ordering more :)</li>
            <li> Dissapointed is an understatement! I was really upset when I took the plastic lashes out of the box but even more upset that all 10 of the glue tubes were dried up.  Total rip-off!</li>
            <li> Such a great product for the price... Well worth it!  I am extremely happy with them and plan on buying again</li>
            <li> I love them so much that I purchase 6 packs. They are easy to attach and looks 100% natural.</li>
            <li> they are a little hard to get on the first time and they began to look tattered after only 2 uses. Not impressed. But I suppose for the price there is nothing to complain about.</li>
            <li> Been about a month, still no product.</li>
            <li> love. they look so natural but help define and lengthen.</li>
            <li> Really awful and cheaply made but I guess that&#x27;s what you get for the price.</li>
            <li> What i received was not what it was supposed to be. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I received the wrong lashes. They were very short and way shorter than my real lashes. No way was I gonna ship it back to China so I ended up giving them to my daughter to play with on her dolls.</li>
            <li> they look really natural so if you&#x27;re looking for everyday lashes they&#x27;re perfect! now if you&#x27;re looking for something more dramatic these are not for you!</li>
            <li> I Love these! They are perfect for someone with short eyelashes, they make them long and gorgeous! They are so natural looking not one person was able to tell they were fake! They are very light on your eyelids too. The price is amazing, shipping super fast, and I would definately recommend! They are a bit hard to put on due to the featherweight of them but with much practice they&#x27;ll look great!</li>
            <li> I bought these a month ago....still don&#x27;t have them. I needed them for Christmas, new years, but no. Unhappy customer, and they better be worth the wait. I&#x27;ve bout things from China before and I get them way faster than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have them, my only review is you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> I had to give them one star cause i had noo choice! . They really suckkk.. just took my money and i neverrr got anything its been 2 months now.. so i filed  a complaint. Dont trust these people! .</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about ordering these lashes because they were so inexpensive, but they turned out to be amazing!! The base is invisible, they are the perfect length, and they look completely natural! I will definitely be ordering a lot more!!</li>
            <li> Very pretty lashes but seem like one time use&#x3D;( very fragile so be careful when peeling them off the carton</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I ordered these because they were so inexpensive! I freaking love these lashes, the band is clear which makes them look seamless. The  band is a little longer on the outer and inner part of the lashes, but that part can easily be cut off, in matter of seconds! Great product, very inexpensive! It did take about four weeks for me to receive, but that was expected, knowing that I ordered them from overseas!! Thank you!! :)</li>
            <li> i order these because i  go thru a lot,s of lashes never received this has happen three time just about to give up amozon  do not have time to print a return slip or go to the post office very unhappy</li>
            <li> I bought them to add to my own lashes for an everyday look but they are too thin and super long while my own are medium length and thick. I doubled them together but I am going to have to trim the length down a little bit. They were supposed to come sometime between May 5 and May something when I needed them by April 25. Luckily they reached April 24. I don&#x27;t know if I would recommend but if you do order, you have plenty of lashes to make mistakes with lol</li>
            <li> I like how natural they look, they&#x27;re just very easy to break and a lot thinner then I expected. but they&#x27;re good eyelashes if you want a natural but long look. you just have to be extra careful when applying but of course you have to be with any false eyelash.</li>
            <li> it came in just a lil late but the box was a lil smushed but other then i love it</li>
            <li> I really like these lashes! After cutting and adjusting to my size I put them on and have to say they there very light weight and comfortable to wear. If your looking for a natural looking lash id recommend these.</li>
            <li> The bands are really thin and hard to work with and the display picture is incorrect, they&#x27;re all the same, thin, natural lash style.</li>
            <li> I dont think these were worth the money. They didnt shape to the eye. The whole lash was the same length so it looked silly. Great maybe to practice with but not for much else.</li>
            <li> The lashes aren&#x27;t bad. But they do not come with lash glue so be sure to buy some!</li>
            <li> Very natural looking, though honestly &#x27;natural&#x27; is not a thing I look for from my falsies. Just so long as they look good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the person who said they don&#x27;t hold a shape. No, they do not. But your eyes do. Pull the falsies until they are curving to the shape of your eye. Pretty simple. Or cut them to be demi lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing value!</li>
            <li> They came alot sooner than I thought they would but they are not what&#x27;s pictured. They&#x27;re all thin and identical.</li>
            <li> natural looking and easy to apply!</li>
            <li> They good quality they fit perfect and they look very natural</li>
            <li> Great eyelashes. The eyelashes didnt come like the picture ,they were short and natural looking I use then for my bottom lashes overall I love the eyelashes ,Great customer service , quick shipping &amp; awesome quality !</li>
            <li> Im going to come straight out and warn you that the lashes aren&#x27;t a variety of thick and voluminous and natural. They were all natural. But theyre really good. I mainly bought theese lashes because I want to practice on applying lashes in general better. And if you&#x27;re a beginner this is a good way to get a feel of them. The band is very thin and the lashes are very natural. They look just like your lashes but better. They blend in so good that you cant tell you&#x27;re wearing them. It&#x27;s only 2 bucks so don&#x27;t expect Ardell quality. But if you&#x27;re looking for lashes to add to your collection or if you just want to practice, then this is a good way to do that. The only complaint I have is that the way the lashes are inserted into the box. You have to pull them up out of a little hole and the more you pull you feel as if they&#x27;ll break in half from the tugging. But other than that I would repurchase.</li>
            <li> Very natural look &amp; feel. Bends easily &amp; love the length! Will definitely buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> Very natural looking! Subtle, great for everyday.</li>
            <li> I dont really like these, they are the same length as my normal lashes, not dramatic enough</li>
            <li> All the lashes look the same, but the picture showed them as being different types of lashes. A little upset about that!</li>
            <li> Buying these was pointless; you cant even use them. They don&#x27;t bend to form your eyelid when you try to put them on. This was a waste and wouldn&#x27;t recommend these to anyone!!</li>
            <li> Very cheap, horrible quality makes them harder to put on, Model or Red cherry eyelashes are better.</li>
            <li> Not really impressed with these lashes, they were super thin and got clumpy with every mascara I tried on them.</li>
            <li> Got different lashes from what was ordered. I ordered natural and regular ones and I got regular ones (im assuming). Different from what was pictured.</li>
            <li> Such an incredibly price for what you&#x27;re getting here. The lashes are very natural looking and very lovely. They&#x27;re well worth the wait (because it may take a while for them to show up). Do note, however, that the strip that holds the lashes is longer than the lash area and extends past the lashes a couple milometers, you&#x27;ll have to trim these on either end before applying them. But, if you&#x27;re used to wearing lashes, you will know you usually have to do a little bit of trimming anyway. For this price, and this quality, I highly recommend these. Do the trimming!</li>
            <li> There not to bad  maybe going for a natural look. There not the best quality but you pay for what you get. Get Cheap Price &#x3D;U Get Cheap ____________ &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> These are made quite long, so I have to chop them off on both ends - I wouldn&#x27;t mind, but the eye lashes aren&#x27;t tapered by the time I&#x27;m done, making the eyelashes look fake. I tried to cut a tapered edge, but then it looks weird. Great for the price you pay, but I probably won&#x27;t be buying this kind again due to the width of the actual lash base.</li>
            <li> So cute and it was my first time buying eyelashes ever!! It looks natural and just perfect for me. Very good product.</li>
            <li> I HATED THESE THEY WERE TOO LONG AND DID NOT LOOK NATURAL!!! IT WAS HARD TO GLUE ON AND UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN U HAVE THEM ON.</li>
            <li> First of all I am really impressed by how fast it shipped! It arrived just 3 days after I placed the order. I tried them on and they are great! They are so light and not make of plastic. I really recommend getting these for a great price too</li>
            <li> exactly as i stated in the tittle. the band itself is long and a clear plastic. they take some manipulation but with a good eyeliner base and good glue to slick these bad boys down they will work. just keep in mind these are rather LONG.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re ordering these lashes expect delayed shipping. They take a long time. However, the lashes are fluffy, and while the picture shows a variety you get one style. I have ordered several sets and have now collected several styles. They are all well made, and worth the inexpensive price. I really liked the ones i got in this order. They are light, the band is thin, and the lashes are long and fluffy. They come in a package of 20 and you clip them to the desired length, and glue them on. They are fairly easy to apply if you know how to apply lashes. The quality makes up for the long ship time in my opinion. Now that i know they arent a variety i am informed, and may purchase these again.</li>
            <li> I have worn false eyelashes for months now trying different brands and styles along with thick and thin bands and these are my FAVORITE! They have thin like clear fishing wire as the base which makes them sooo much easier to hide with or without eyeliner and they look natural but definatly gives more oomph I use them for day and night. The key to applying is putting the glue on the false line then blow on it for about 10 seconds while bending it to your natural curve like a horse shoe. it makes the glue set a little so it doesnt just pop right off then hold it there for a couple seconds i do the outer corner 1st then inner. Hope this helps everyone!!! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Beautiful lashes but NO GLUE!! Waited 4 weeks and I have NO GLUE to apply!!! Annoying!</li>
            <li> I AM NOT HAPPY AT ALL WITH THIS!!! THIS IS ABOUT THE 10TH F#!@*^/ TIME THAT I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO ORDER THIS ASSORTED PACK, BUT INSTEAD I RECEIVE THESE LITTLE THIN A$$ KIND THAT ARE THINNER AND SHORTER THAN MY VERY OWN LASHES, AND, HAPPEM TP COST WAY LESS THAN WHAT I PAID! ALSO, DEFINITELY NOT ASSORTED!!!! I WOULD LIKE A REFUND, AS WELL AS HAVE THE ASSORTED PACK SENT TO ME!</li>
            <li> Nice lashes. Really natural looking.</li>
            <li> I love this. It looks so natural. Besides Ardell&#x27;s lashes in 110, this is my absolute favorite natural lashes. If you apply it, you have to hold it downwards for a more natural look.</li>
            <li> i love the eyelashes.  great value for the price.  i will be purchasing a set again. I&#x27;m hooked on these lashes</li>
            <li> The lashes are very natural looking. If you want something that is natural looking but also enhances your lashes at the same time, they are the ones to go to!</li>
            <li> They came early which is a good thing packed in a bubble wrap package nothing was damaged or missed placed looks pretty natural on in my opinion but everyone&#x27;s different for the most part there good for the price</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price!!! They look really natural. They are long and thin and are very attractive. They are a little hard to put on because they don&#x27;t hold their shape.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on these. They looked curved because stickers are holding them in place but they are really straight. They don&#x27;t conform to your eyelid at all. They are cheaply made and there is almost no place for glue to stick to.</li>
            <li> I wear these everyday, doesnt come with glue but thats okay with me because I&#x27;m picky about what glue I use. They look great for an even better price.</li>
            <li> really good price for the quality i like that it blends with my natural lashes and i also like that they are not thick</li>
            <li> So thin and natural. love them</li>
            <li> There pretty and natural</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t packaged properly and my lashes arrived smashed but hey..you get what you pay for! I&#x27;m happy with the lashes overall. You have to cut applicator ends.</li>
            <li> Love love love these lashes. For cheap they make your lashes look natural and long. Just buy the good kind eyelash glue. And these lashes will stay on longer.</li>
            <li> I have only bought one pack of these and I THOROUGHLY ENJOY THEM.  They are cheap, and you get a lot for the small price.  I wear mine more than once.  The first two times they are easy to clean, but sometimes if you pull to hard the lashes will slide off the band, which is okay with me because I always have to trim mine anyways.  Sometimes I can&#x27;t tell which side goes to which even when they are paired, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me much either.  They look really natural and I am able to wear them without hiding the band with eyeliner.  I don&#x27;t sometimes wear eyeliner at all with it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a costume party with friends but beware, the photo sample posted is fake. What i received from china is only one kind of lashes, all the same style and size, no varieties at all and not as many as the one in photo.</li>
            <li> These are basuc lashes and give a very natural look they are good quality for the cost</li>
            <li> double stack these and you get the best natural looking lashes ever! great price and no one will know theyre fake!</li>
            <li> I love,is beautiful ....&amp;#60;3.the shipping was so fast. Have a good quality and the Deliver iwas so fast for the price came a lot eyelashes  it&#x27;s very very good I recommend</li>
            <li> For the cost- these are awesome. I do have to trim the ends but I can get about 4-5 uses out of each pair and for that price?? Definitely worth it if you use lashes regularly!</li>
            <li> Faster shipping than I expected and now I see why.. Not different pairs all of the same design. Yes they&#x27;re long and but I like a full lash. Guess I&#x27;m triple stacking for a bit!! Never again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually a little disappointed by the length. It looked a little bit longer in the photo. Oh well you live and learn. They are very flimsy and I have trouble trying to get the lashes to curve with my eye. I even bought those tweezers that are meant to help put on eyelashes but it doesn&#x27;t help. Good thing the eyelashes aren&#x27;t that expensive. I still use them since it comes with 10 pairs. No point in wasting it but I probably will not purchase these again in the future</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use them, we had a small hiccup and the company quickly responded and took care of the issue :) !!</li>
            <li> the only thing that sucks is that the part where you put the glue on is thread...&lt;br /&gt;other than that the eyelashes are nice, they look long but not too dramatic, you could wear them everyday :)</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Really good lashes, comfortable and natural looking.</li>
            <li> Love them! They are beautiful and wear just as good as a $14 pair of lashes! Such a great deal!</li>
            <li> Not too bad good for people who have big eye, small eye have to cut it</li>
            <li> Ordered these August 30th just received then October 1that&#x27;s ridiculous and the box was ask bent up other than that seems to be a nice product.</li>
            <li> I like these lashes a lot, although they are a little tough to put on. Maybe because I just started wearing falsies. They&#x27;re very soft, which is why I think I have trouble with it. One thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the band is white so I have to cover it up with black eyeliner. Over all it&#x27;s a good buy, would recommend. They came very fast too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the whole eye lash look and i bought these to see if i can teach myself how to use them. They are very soft and im not sure if they work for me because i still havent figured out how to do it correctly :( I&#x27;ll just keep practicing! They Shipped right on time and came in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I buy these eyelashes. Loved them the first time and I cant wait to receive these! I will be buying so many more soon, I can never have enough eyelashes!!!!!</li>
            <li> These were packaged well and came on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are exactly like the picture and work well! I cant wait to use them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super cute- I will be purchasing again at a later date!</li>
            <li> Not as describe in picture.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing fake eyelashes for over 6 years. They are natural looking. I use weave bonding glue to attach them. All you need to do is hold each end and curve them a bit.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so long and have a more natural look, I&#x27;m in LOVE!!! Bought 3 boxes and glad I did! :)</li>
            <li> I ordered these lashes (Color \\&quot;Black\\&quot;) on June 15th and received these lashes today through USPS (a week ahead than the estimated time). Three weeks was a lot faster than I excepted as generally orders from Hong Kong and Asia in general can take a lot longer. I was a bit worried from the past reviews that I wouldn&#x27;t be receiving these lashes, but thankfully I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box came in just a plastic mailing bag, so it&#x27;s slightly squished on the edges, so those who are picky might not appreciate that. However, I don&#x27;t mind because the box is a fairly sturdy glossy cardboard, and the lashes are in tact (which is all that matters).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These lashes are made in Taiwan and are super comfortable and I don&#x27;t need to trim the length! The band is fairly straight (due to the packaging; it has two extended threads that are taped down by the stickers) and it&#x27;s a bit difficult to manipulate it into a nice curve for easy application. I will try to find an eyelash case to see if holding them in there will help mold it into that nice curve. However, it&#x27;s easy to apply with the fingers. The lashes are nice, long, and very natural yet \\&quot;doll\\&quot; like on me (if that makes sense). I appreciate the clear band so that I don&#x27;t have to apply a very thick application of eyeliner to blend the color of the band with the rest of my eye look (as I&#x27;ve had to with some Daiso lashes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I do recommend these lashes for the quality and price! They do not include glue (I recommend buying duo lash glue dark toned) and you do need to use sharp scissors to snip off the excess thread, but each pair of lashes will be able to last multiple uses (the pair I wore earlier still feels very sturdy even after I removed it and picked off the glue). If you do order this, I recommend you wait a week or two after the estimated delivery time. Sometimes USPS delivers the products later than usual (as I&#x27;ve experienced in the past from different buyers). :)</li>
            <li> They are great they came early than I thought</li>
            <li> Comes with a variety of lashes for different kinds of events there are bold ones and even thin ones for an everyday use. You have to purchase the glue separate but for the incredibly low price of the lashes you can&#x27;t really complain! This is not only a great bargain but an amazing product</li>
            <li> no where near natural lashes these are big full dramatic lashes that most girls wear that make your eyes look heavy and sleepy.but great for fun and dress up</li>
            <li> Love the look of these...little hard getting them out package due to stickers on lashes but otherwise great</li>
            <li> love them. they look very natural once on. they shipped fast which was awesome.price great,great product. I will definitely purchase from this company again. thank you.</li>
            <li> the main reason why i ordered these was so that i could save up some money because i usually wear ELF eyelashes they last a month and they only cost me $1 for one pair, so you can see my reason to buy these lashes. these were supposed to save me money and time to be honest. when i got them they seemed good and i was exited but then i started to notice that they arent all the same size some were longer than others and they are really really thin it is really challenging to put them on .  i know that they are supposed to look natural but they feel like fabric rather than lashes due to the thinness of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wont ever order these again. Ill just keep on buying my ELF eyelashes.</li>
            <li> these are the most natural lashes ive ever had the pleasure of wearing. next time i plan on ordering bundles of them!</li>
            <li> They are in a smaller box than what I though but I loved the eyelashes easy to put on great buy for sure...</li>
            <li> They sent me the wrong ones /: I really wanted the ones in the photo for different events, I like the daily look and the dramatic look. The ones they sent were just the average natural looking ones. I can still use them though.  You get what you pay for I guess</li>
            <li> These are very thin and look natural even with mascara on them. Easy to apply and easy to remove Fast shippment!</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I wanted, but works.  Easy to get glue from.  Not the desired length it seems.  Just OK</li>
            <li> Order twice a year...twice of day</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used these yet. But they look pretty natural are not too dense or whacky. Exactly what I was looking for. Hopefully application  would  be easy.</li>
            <li> These lashes are nice but way to thin for me</li>
            <li> They are okay for the price I guess. Not much longer than my actual eyelashes though. They are very fragile so I don&#x27;t think they are really reusable.</li>
            <li> I wanted the thick version but received thin lashes.</li>
            <li> If it let me rate this with no star, I would, with negative.</li>
            <li> Very natural looking! ♡</li>
            <li> Took forever and flimsy lashes</li>
            <li> Honestly, they were not different eyelashes they were all the same, they are super natural and light if thats what you wanted but i wanted a variety, kinda dispointed.</li>
            <li> perfect for everyday use as this are super natural looking. Not too thick and too long. I like the thread band, it&#x27;s lightweight and comfy. I hate the thick bands on eyelashes.</li>
            <li> They were very thin and short wasn&#x27;t what I seen in the picture so disssapointed never again</li>
            <li> got the wrong box of lashes. But the ones I did get I loved. They were thin but when I double them the were perfect looked almost just like mink lashes. So 5 stars for the unknown box?!?! I&#x27;m in love with them</li>
            <li> they are not really that good to m e</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so horrible. They&#x27;re not even good if you&#x27;re trying to learn how to put on lashes. It&#x27;s a waste of money. They look horrible once on and getting them on is a nightmare. The band is so difficult to apply and it&#x27;s a hard band. I didn&#x27;t even know that was possible, it broke when I try to bend to shape to my lash line. Multiple times! Just buy red cherry lashes. Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.</li>
            <li> These are great and looks very natural.  It&#x27;s a great bargain and I will definitely buy these again.  I can also reuse each pair a few times.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap compare to other eyelashes that are out there, but it&#x27;s not very natural looking when I use it.</li>
            <li> I love to wear eyelashes. This product makes it easy for me to wear them everyday. They were also a great price. Even my grandmother puts them on now.</li>
