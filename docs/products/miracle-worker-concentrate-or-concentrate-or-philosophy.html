            <li>Makes my face feel so smooth and has helped with brown spots and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>- this feels so smooth going on -</li>
            <li>and I have fabulous looking skin.  </li>
            <li>said my skin was so smooth...</li>
            <li>But forget buying it from Sephora and paying the full price.</li>
            <li>I turned 60 this year and have been using this product for about 18 months in conjunction with full of promise moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love Philosophy&#x27;s fragrances and bath products and had high hopes for this serum.</li>
            <li>The skin on my face is smooth and supple thanks to this product</li>
            <li>I went along with thinking this product line was safe and somewhat natural.</li>
            <li>You only need to pump the top 2 times...</li>
            <li>First of all do I like what this product did for my face wrinkles and condition?</li>
            <li>This product did lessen the wrinkles and make my face feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>When I first purchased this product and began using it I wanted to see overnight, immediate results. .</li>
            <li>.that did not happen for me; however with repeated and consistent use I have began to see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I use two pumps for my whole face and apply first thing after washing with philosophy microdelivery.  </li>
            <li>Received it fast and it was exactly as described</li>
            <li>This is rather amazing a for me as I scare heavily.  </li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to trying this product.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t worry about my skin too much...</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t really for me...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I can see any real results from it, but I like to think it is helping with aging.</li>
            <li>Must try, really works.</li>
            <li>I use many other Philosophy products</li>
            <li>It is not heavy, though at first it feels a bit sticky, your face won&#x27;t be sticky after you rub it in.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this for 6 years now and many people think I am younger than I actually am.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny, too, as you only use a drop the size of a pencil eraser for your whole face.</li>
            <li>but it even surpassed my high expectations.  </li>
            <li>I was tired of ordering and paying for shipping, so it was a good time to switch.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this - it is not heavy or oily - I do not like to run out of it!</li>
            <li>It is pretty expensive just as a face cream, but it is the only thing that works for my and Philosophy is a reliably great brand.</li>
            <li>However after reading Suzanne Somers new book which talks about all the toxins we ingest and smear on ourselves I went and looked at the ingredient list in my philosophy products ( I have EVERYTHING they sell)</li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft.  </li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive skin and go to a dermotologist regularily for skin problems.  </li>
            <li>Regular use does have a positive effect on fine wrinkles and age spots and does help with other skin issues.  </li>
            <li>I can see smoothness in my skin and fine lines less visible and also</li>
            <li>not so fine lines are less visible.</li>
            <li>I cannot afford a face lift, but any of Philosophy Miracle Worker products do make my face look less wrinkly and more younger looking.</li>
            <li>I know this is not what the purpose of the concentrate is for, but it is really the only thing that keeps my skin moist and soft without being oily.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t surprised at</li>
            <li>feels so soft.</li>
            <li>I have used this product before via direct purchase from Philosophy.  </li>
            <li>My wife looks just as old as she did before she got this product.  </li>
            <li>I used it on my large surgery scars and they are flat and not particularly noticeable.  </li>
            <li>anyway, so, i&#x27;m late for work but thought i should share this with others, which i really don&#x27;t want to b/c i want to be the prettiest gurl in the whole world...shuddit.</li>
            <li>Not worth it that much.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> At least she does not look older.</li>
            <li> you only need a little bit, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 53 and have very dry skin with wrinkles around my mouth and eyes.</li>
            <li> And yes I started to look up each ingredient and was shocked at how toxic many of these are.</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;ve used this product in the past and decided I needed to get back to it.</li>
            <li> I try other serums from time to time, but I always return to this.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to other people.</li>
            <li> This serum is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have had issues with dry skin since I was in my late teens.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t want to waste it and don&#x27;t forget your neck.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about the effectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li> and now you can at least think about this.</li>
            <li> ; I have used this for at least four years.  </li>
            <li> I even occasionally use it on really bad spots on my hands in winter.</li>
            <li> This product works for all skin types and I recommend it highly,  sad</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> just didnt think about how bad some of these things could be for your body like me</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product. Makes my face feel so smooth and has helped with brown spots and fine lines.  You only need to pump the top 2 times...you don&#x27;t want to waste it and don&#x27;t forget your neck.</li>
            <li> I cannot afford a face lift, but any of Philosophy Miracle Worker products do make my face look less wrinkly and more younger looking. I have been wearing this for 6 years now and many people think I am younger than I actually am.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to trying this product. I love Philosophy&#x27;s fragrances and bath products and had high hopes for this serum. However, I have used it for one month and have found no difference in my skin. It has not helped with clarity,fine lines, or elasticity. I found the same with Hope in a Jar. I know that it seems to work for many, but not at all for me. This serum is not worth the price. I have gotten better results for L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code and Roc products for a fraction of the price. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Tried this product for the first time and love it!  I use many other Philosophy products so I wasn&#x27;t surprised at how well I like this one but it even surpassed my high expectations.  It keeps my skin soft and moist throughout the day which is wonderful since I have to work outdoors quite a bit.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My skin started looking firmer and brighter in a couple days.  I&#x27;ve used it for 2 weeks now and the difference is really great.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about the effectiveness of this product. I love the feel of the product on my skin, however, I was expecting more from it. Amazon offers a great price. But forget buying it from Sephora and paying the full price. Not worth it that much.</li>
            <li> This product works for all skin types and I recommend it highly,  sad you can no longer get it in the stores</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this in hopes that maybe someone will get enlightened like I&#x27;ve been. First of all do I like what this product did for my face wrinkles and condition? YES....it does work and for me it worked better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;m 53 and have very dry skin with wrinkles around my mouth and eyes. This product did lessen the wrinkles and make my face feel smooth and soft. However after reading Suzanne Somers new book which talks about all the toxins we ingest and smear on ourselves I went and looked at the ingredient list in my philosophy products ( I have EVERYTHING they sell) and I was horrified. I went along with thinking this product line was safe and somewhat natural. I was wrong. The ingredient list for this product alone is only partially listed on this website.    this is what I found to be the ingredient list on makeupalley.com which has always had the most up to date info on items.    miracle worker miraculous anti-aging concentrate: water (aqua), cyclopentasiloxane, glycerin, dimethicone crosspolymer, ascorbyl glucoside, hexyldecanol, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cocoyl hexapeptide 23, myristoyl pentapeptide-9, haematococcus pluvialis extract, lysolecithin, brassica campestris (rapeseed) sterols, dimethicone, tropolone, squalane, polysorbate 60, hydroxyethylcellulose, retinyl palmitate, camellia sinensis leaf extract, glutathione, beta-glucan, tocopheryl acetate, arginine, bisabolol, stearic acid, cetylhydroxyproline palmitamide, sd alcohol 40b, 1,2 hexanediol, caprylyl glycol, sodium hydroxide, citric acid, disodium edta, methylisothiazolinone. miracle worker retinoid pads: ethyl trisiloxane, methyl perfluorobutyl ether, methyl perfluoroisobutyl ether, ethoxydiglycol, tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, hexyldecanol, hydroxypinacolone retinoate, brassica campestris (rapeseed) sterols, tocopherol, camellia sinensis leaf extract, bisabolol, cetylhydroxyproline palmitamide, stearic acid, laureth-4, cyclopentasiloxane,bht. miracle worker miraculous anti-aging moisturizer: water (aqua), cyclopentasiloxane, glycerin, dimethicone, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, ascorbyl glucoside, behenyl alcohol, propanediol, resveratrol, hexyldecanol, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, zea mays (corn) oil, glutathione, macadamia integrifolia seed oil, olea europaea (olive) fruit oil, sesamum indicum (sesame) seed oil, linum usitatissimum (linseed) seed oil, bisabolol, stearic acid, cetylhydroxyproline palmitamide, brassica campestris (rapeseed) sterols, beta-glucan, butylene glycol, cyclohexasiloxane, benzyl alcohol, arginine, polysorbate 20, tetrapeptide-21, sodium hydroxide, phenoxyethanol, chlorphenesin, ethylhexylglycerin, disodium edta.    And yes I started to look up each ingredient and was shocked at how toxic many of these are. If you dont care thats fine but maybe some of you do and just didnt think about how bad some of these things could be for your body like me and now you can at least think about this.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and I really like it!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I put it on at night, and the next morning I can see a big difference. My skin is more supple and youthful looking.</li>
            <li> I love Philosphy - this feels so smooth going on - I love it.  I put this on every morning followed by my moisturizer - face feels so soft.</li>
            <li> I turned 60 this year and have been using this product for about 18 months in conjunction with full of promise moisturizer. Most people comment I look 45 and I have fabulous looking skin.  This works for me!</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;ve used this product in the past and decided I needed to get back to it. It leaves your face with a nice smooth look.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a 36 asian female...in my 20s i didn&#x27;t worry about my skin too much...now, i want a kid (and i don&#x27;t even like kids) and every time i see my face, i see wrinkles...i&#x27;ll hold off on the kid for maybe another 60 years but the skin?...i tried everything in every dept store...sephora is currently running a contest:  best anti-aging skin product...philosophy miracle worker concentrate was one of the products featured...i tried others before this one (such as ole henriksen vitamin c booster) and i&#x27;m telling you...after 2 weeks, my face is smoother, firmer and miraculously flawless...i went to bloomingdales to get a some cellulite begone cream (eh, why not--cheaper than a nyc gym membership) and the cosmetic counter woman thought i was wearing foundation--said my skin was so smooth...she didn&#x27;t believe it i didn&#x27;t wear any...wanted to touch my face until i threatened to break her fingers....anyway, so, i&#x27;m late for work but thought i should share this with others, which i really don&#x27;t want to b/c i want to be the prettiest gurl in the whole world...shuddit.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t really for me... I have oily skin and this just made me feel more oily....this would be wonderful for dryer skin.  Jmo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for three months and can see a reduction in fine lines and wrinkles.  My skin feels very soft.  I use two pumps for my whole face and apply first thing after washing with philosophy microdelivery.  I try to use it twice a day.  It lasts a long time.  Avoid the eye area as for me it makes the area puffy.  I use the philosophy miracle worker eye concentrate there</li>
            <li> Works great - like nothing else!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite beauty products.  It feels so good on the skin.  I can&#x27;t say I can see any real results from it, but I like to think it is helping with aging.</li>
            <li> This is really a great product.  I highly recommend this - it is not heavy or oily - I do not like to run out of it!</li>
            <li> I use this every morning under philosophy Hope Oil-Free Moisturizer SPF 30. They work so well together. Very smooth serum and I just need 2 pumps which makes it last longer. I will recommend it to everyone looking for a great serum.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before via direct purchase from Philosophy.  It is wonderful!!  Regular use does have a positive effect on fine wrinkles and age spots and does help with other skin issues.  I used it on my large surgery scars and they are flat and not particularly noticeable.  This is rather amazing a for me as I scare heavily.  The skin on my face is smooth and supple thanks to this product and I have tried many things--this worked.  I&#x27;m 60 and have a fair amount of sun damage; you&#x27;d never know it.  Worth every penny, too, as you only use a drop the size of a pencil eraser for your whole face. It is not heavy, though at first it feels a bit sticky, your face won&#x27;t be sticky after you rub it in.</li>
            <li> Must try, really works.</li>
            <li> Works Great! I can see smoothness in my skin and fine lines less visible and also not so fine lines are less visible.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this product and began using it I wanted to see overnight, immediate results. . .that did not happen for me; however with repeated and consistent use I have began to see a difference in my skin. Will probably purchase again!!!</li>
            <li> i love the philosophy products.  the concentrate is good. you only need a little bit, so it lasts a long time. i would recommend this</li>
            <li> I love love this product....!!! Been using it for over 5 years....It&#x27;s for the face...but it&#x27;s been the best Eye gel I have ever used....!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have had issues with dry skin since I was in my late teens. I know this is not what the purpose of the concentrate is for, but it is really the only thing that keeps my skin moist and soft without being oily. I apply it once in the morning and my skin is great all day. I even occasionally use it on really bad spots on my hands in winter. It is pretty expensive just as a face cream, but it is the only thing that works for my and Philosophy is a reliably great brand.</li>
            <li> Received it fast and it was exactly as described</li>
            <li> I first saw this \\&quot;Miracle Worker\\&quot; on the Today Show and it received the best review. I was tired of ordering and paying for shipping, so it was a good time to switch.  It works great for me and I have very sensitive skin and go to a dermotologist regularily for skin problems.  This is a miracle for me.</li>
            <li> Very good product; I have used this for at least four years.  I try other serums from time to time, but I always return to this.</li>
            <li> An excellent product.  It does everything it says it will do and more.  I would recommend this product to other people.</li>
            <li> My wife looks just as old as she did before she got this product.  At least she does not look older.</li>
