            <li>Much better to buy Swisspers cotton rounds.</li>
            <li>cotton falls apart too easily when using it to apply diaper creme.</li>
            <li>rip off easily.</li>
            <li>However, they were cheap and get the job done.</li>

            <li>I like this brand of cotton squares because they are nice and sturdy (not too thin) and do not tear apart easily!</li>
            <li>I ordered these to take off my eye makeup; cotton balls didn&#x27;t really do the trick.  </li>
            <li>Much better quality than I expected.</li>

            <li>They fall apart easily when wet, even on a recently shaved and smooth face.</li>
            <li>They are average sized (think like a Saltine) and nice and soft; I have had some brands that &#x27;scratch&#x27; like the cotton wasn&#x27;t cleaned well.  </li>

            <li>You may have to use multiple squares at a time to adequately wipe down your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These pads are thin &amp; tear apart easily.</li>
            <li>When they don&#x27;t fall apart, I feel as though I can cover a large amount of my face with only a few swipes.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> big and absorbent.  these are my favorite for using toner and removing nail polish</li>
            <li> Great for removing makeup or applying face powder.  They are soft enough to clean a childs skinned knee.  A good thing to keep in your bath cabinet.  We are happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> They fall apart easily and aren&#x27;t very sturdy. They tend to ball and bunch up. One square doesn&#x27;t go as far as other comparable items I&#x27;ve used before. However, they were cheap and get the job done.</li>
            <li> These pads are thin &amp; tear apart easily. They are completely useless. Buy a name brand. Better yet, go to the Dollar Store. That&#x27;s what I should have done in the first place. You will get a better product there.</li>
            <li> Meh. Not the sturdiest. Rips kind of easily but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Normal cotton squares, they work good for me.</li>
            <li> Too thin and leave residue.</li>
            <li> If your using to take off eye makeup be prepared to get the fuzzies in your eye. Very cheaply made, not like the drug store brands.</li>
            <li> solid product. I like this brand of cotton squares because they are nice and sturdy (not too thin) and do not tear apart easily! Good stuff.</li>
            <li> cotton falls apart too easily when using it to apply diaper creme.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality. Breaks down into pieces instantly.</li>
            <li> I ordered these to take off my eye makeup; cotton balls didn&#x27;t really do the trick.  They are average sized (think like a Saltine) and nice and soft; I have had some brands that &#x27;scratch&#x27; like the cotton wasn&#x27;t cleaned well.  Not these.  I will definitely purchase these again.</li>
            <li> I love these cotton squares as opposed to cotton balls.  Maybe it&#x27;s because I have big hands, but the cotton balls always feel so tiny in my hands.  These are, for me, easier to use and manipulate.</li>
            <li> Way better than cotton balls!</li>
            <li> I use them to apply toner and remove makeup. Good size, feels smooth, is effective. Cotton can tend to spread out and stick though.</li>
            <li> Happy with product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Soft and absorbent. Much better quality than I expected.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the product. It was delivered when promised and advertised.</li>
            <li> Good value for the price but the edges are a lil rough and can scratch your face.</li>
            <li> After using these with astringent on my face for a few months, I can say I&#x27;m not impressed. They fall apart easily when wet, even on a recently shaved and smooth face. They are more difficult to use if there is a little bit of stubble. They often leave a cotton trail on the face or roll on the actual square. You may have to use multiple squares at a time to adequately wipe down your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite that, I do like the size of the cotton square. When they don&#x27;t fall apart, I feel as though I can cover a large amount of my face with only a few swipes. Unfortunately, they fall apart approximately 90 percent of the time, so it&#x27;s not enough to really warrant their use or purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been using these pads for about a week now.  They work great. They hold together and are soft to the touch.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Very well described.  Use them to remove nail polish.  They hold up very well.  I will rebut again when I need more</li>
            <li> rip off easily. Very bad quality. You get what you pay for I guess</li>
            <li> Swisspers is a good brand. Nice price for the amount of squares.</li>
            <li> WYSiWYG, cotton squares, lots of cotton squares.  made well. for most jobs you can cut them smaller, or tear them in half.</li>
            <li> Nice basic cotton squares for BHA liquid exfoliants.</li>
            <li> I use this product to apply toner to my face. Each square has a striped appearance and when I use a wet square it falls apart into separate strips. Much better to buy Swisspers cotton rounds. They stay in one piece.</li>
