            <li> The bracelet is fora very large wrist. No adjustments can be made. Cute and simple but not the right size.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering a black watch.</li>
            <li> excellent product, I&#x27;m very happy and satisfied. I recommend this seller to the community amazon</li>
            <li> Too big for my 9 yr old daughter&#x27;s wrist</li>
            <li> The watch looks very nice but the band is so large! :(</li>
            <li> Pretty cheap quality.</li>
            <li> Nice and springy-looking. Gave as a gift, she loved it too. She doesn&#x27;t wear watches, but will wear this one. The black one will be given as a gift in August. Hope she will like it, oh she will!</li>
            <li> The watch is cute! I purchased it for my daughter. It took a long time to arrive and when it finally came it was not working. I am yet to take it for the battery to be replaced. Not sure if it will even work after that. For the price I paid it is not worth sending it back. Just think it should be tested before being shipped.</li>
            <li> Very nice, cheap and good looking!!!</li>
            <li> Very cute one. Price and the item were amezing. A lot of people asked me where did I buy this one! I like it :)</li>
            <li> hate it , arrived broken and they will not take it back</li>
            <li> OK for the price. Cheap in Price and Quality.</li>
            <li> Like the watch, but when I received it, the back of it was missing. It was also very large. I can probably slide it on and off with out even opening it! Beautiful but huge!</li>
            <li> Looks so cheap.  If there was a return address i would have shipped it back to China!</li>
            <li> Love the watch beautifully made and everyone likes it, I get so many compliments and all my kids at work and my colleges love the watch too</li>
            <li> Super pretty but too big for my wrist. No removable link so I will need to fiddle with this to make it fit</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very beautiful. It&#x27;s a little big, but it&#x27;s ok I still wear it. Just beautiful.</li>
            <li> bought this for my sister and shipped it to her. She just got it, and she loves it! :-)</li>
            <li> Ordered it in gold, came in a rose gold and way too big</li>
            <li> Worst purchase ever .. Cheap looking watch.I bought this to give as a gift and seeing the poor quality I decided against the gifting idea.</li>
            <li> Watch strap was pretty hard to lock/unlock. After multiple mail chains with sellr and even after sending out a picture of the lock for their satisfaction, they replied saying I have to pay for the return. Please avoid the product if you value your time and money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice and beautiful!! Great for the price!!</li>
            <li> The color is more pink-ish than in the picture, and the bracelet is a little bit large. However is very cute :)</li>
