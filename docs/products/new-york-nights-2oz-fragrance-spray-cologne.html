            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>so I wanted to buy more.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the real New York Nights.  </li>
            <li>he now smells spicy and masculine (nice Drakkar scent) and we as parents appreciate this very much!!!</li>
            <li>and it is cheap........</li>
            <li>its more than well worth it..</li>
            <li>It has a good lasting scent, but it&#x27;s not overly strong.</li>
            <li>I found this at Target originally for my husband which he likes.</li>
            <li>The body spray version of New York Nights smells amazing to me, and I notice it on me for a while.</li>
            <li>price is right too!</li>
            <li>And it shipped really quickly</li>
            <li>Right price and delivered on time</li>
            <li>among others are pretty darn close..</li>
            <li>This has perfect base notes and top notes..</li>
            <li>Ready to order again.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and it&#x27;s getting harder to find.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>New York Nights Really smells just like Drakkar Noir</li>
            <li>I will pay twice as much the next time and get the real stuff.</li>
            <li>Arrived before expected and was exactly what description said</li>
            <li>Long lasting, easy on the budget, very little amount required and lasts all day.</li>

            <li> The fragrance is similar but it doesn&#x27;t last very long once applied.  </li>
            <li> After searching for a very long time, I finally found it on here.</li>
            <li> Everything that I expected..</li>
            <li> The base note of sandalwood and top notes of lavender..</li>
            <li> If you are looking for this product, don&#x27;t be afraid if the package change the image, is the right one...</li>
            <li> For an after shave that&#x27;s less than twenty bucks.</li>
            <li> I usually buy BOD but after reading these bogus reviews i decided to try this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $$$!!</li>
            <li> If you purchased the Jordache Drakkar Noir No. 10 and thought it was horrible, you were right.  </li>
            <li> Not the previous quality...looks like someone&#x27;s cutting corners somewhere!!</li>
            <li> This smells nothing like the other ones I&#x27;ve purchased smells awful like I sprayed my son with a toxic insecticide!!</li>

            <li> Bought this for my husband years ago. I loved the way it smelled so I wanted to buy more. After searching for a very long time, I finally found it on here. He likes it and it still is one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> Another purchase for my son at Christmas...he now smells spicy and masculine (nice Drakkar scent) and we as parents appreciate this very much!!!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is good.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t seem that noticeable. The body spray version of New York Nights smells amazing to me, and I notice it on me for a while.</li>

            <li> I usually buy BOD but after reading these bogus reviews i decided to try this. An hour after spraying you don&#x27;t smell it.  BOD will last you ALL DAY...  Don&#x27;t waste your $$$!!</li>
