            <li>and I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this ointment but</li>
            <li>This was a good price for a large tube.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best on the market to protect babies from diaper rash and other skin uses.</li>
            <li>It rubs in easily on baby&#x27;s tushie and cleans off easily as well.</li>
            <li>Love this ointment so much I special order it on amazon.  </li>
            <li>Fougera A&amp;D is the best and only one that will work consistently.</li>
            <li>Basic A and D ointment, great for nails overnight</li>
            <li>A and D original ointment jar diaper rash and all-purpose</li>
            <li>This Vitamin A&amp;D ointment has excellent healing properties for small cuts or scraps.</li>
            <li>on smooth, no odor, helps protect and heal the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Product!  highly recommended.</li>
            <li>My husband and I still apply ointment with every diaper change, and while I&#x27;ve used other brands of A&amp;D, this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>It is more of a clear cream than the white diaper creams (sort of a Vaseline consistency), and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>So if you are running low - pay extra for faster shipping, otherwise the product itself is amazing!</li>
            <li>I got this for my mum, I should say first.</li>
            <li>I got it first from the hospital where my daughter was born.</li>
            <li>, I ordered more than one, because is the only one my baby use</li>
            <li>I especially think the scent is unique and pleasant comparing to the other A+D ointment.</li>
            <li>My baby is 6 months old and never had a diaper rush yet  !!!!</li>
            <li>but I feel like you get to pretty much all the ointment unlike some tubes.</li>
            <li>No smell like the other A&amp;D ointment available over the counter and really helps my baby stay rash free.  </li>
            <li>Goes on so smooth and is SO much nicer than the standard ad ointment or vaseline.  </li>
            <li>it get lost very easly</li>
            <li>Irritation clears up significantly from one diaper change to the next.</li>
            <li>I want the seller to make sure that they send the ointment properly packed to avoid such mishaps.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This product allows me to keep them safe from chaffing or getting rushes on their little butts from their diapers.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s now 6 months old and NEVER had any diaper rash!</li>
            <li>tried using Johnson&#x27;s baby lotion, but it didn&#x27;t help clear up her face as efficient as Fougera&#x27;s Emollient.</li>
            <li>My son is 14 months old and we have been using this paste till he born.</li>
            <li>They used this on my son in the hospital when he was 5 weeks old.  </li>
            <li>- I really wish I would have paid extra for shipping.</li>

            <li>This was the only tube and brand left in the store, so didn&#x27;t think much.</li>
            <li>The only down side is once there isn&#x27;t much in the tube</li>

            <li> that is dry cracked or scaly..</li>
            <li> Ordered this because we had limited time out shopping with a newborn.</li>
            <li> I rubbed a little bit of the emollient on her face and, literally, by the next morning - her face had cleared up and her skin was</li>
            <li> The only thing I dislike about it is the cap, its hard to screw back on</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My only complaint is the size.  I use this as a lip gloss and I did not know that 4 oz. would be a lifetime supply - my fault, not the supplier.</li>
            <li> The product is just great for baby diaper rash... but when you are changing your baby it&#x27;s very dangerous to have the tinny lid around it! it get lost very easly and you don&#x27;t want to get it lost in your baby&#x27;s mouth, do you!  I end up buying the same product but the 1lb big pot [[ASIN:B001BAA2FG A and D original ointment jar diaper rash and all-purpose skincare formula by fougera - 1 lb]]</li>
            <li> I received a sample pack of Fougera Vitamin A&amp;D Ointment Emollient from the hospital when I gave birth. I was saving it for diaper rashes, but my daughter&#x27;s face was suffering from \\&quot;infant acne\\&quot; when we were released from the hospital. Her face had angry red bumps and she kept trying to rub her face (since it was itchy). I rubbed a little bit of the emollient on her face and, literally, by the next morning - her face had cleared up and her skin was baby smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using Johnson&#x27;s baby lotion, but it didn&#x27;t help clear up her face as efficient as Fougera&#x27;s Emollient. The great thing about this product is how versatile it is - newborns can use it virtually everywhere and mothers can use it on their skin as well!</li>
            <li> I got this for my mum, I should say first. She&#x27;s in the UK and had her eyebrows tattooed (something quite popular amongst women, I&#x27;m told). She was given some of this by the beauty therapist to help the tattoo heal. You can&#x27;t get this stuff in the UK, so I got it over here, and sent it over (I know, I&#x27;m a good son). She loves the stuff. This was a good price for a large tube.&lt;br /&gt;She also swears by it as the best lip balm she has ever used.&lt;br /&gt;So, my mum is happy, I&#x27;m in her good books, and I&#x27;m not broke from ordering this. Everyone&#x27;s happy!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product expecting that the ingredients would match the description - they do not.  The description is describing Cracked Skin Cream while this product is simply A &amp; D ointment.</li>
            <li> I work with small children. This product allows me to keep them safe from chaffing or getting rushes on their little butts from their diapers. I also use the cream my self. :$ (not the diapers yet! hehehe).</li>
            <li> The hospital used this stuff on my daughter when she was born.  They applied it with every diaper change, and we&#x27;ve had no sign of diaper rash.  My husband and I still apply ointment with every diaper change, and while I&#x27;ve used other brands of A&amp;D, this is by far the best.  No odor like the others I&#x27;ve tried, which have cod liver oil in them and they are a horrible brown color.  I&#x27;d recommend this ointment to any new/veteran mom to keep a diaper-rash free baby!</li>
            <li> The hospital I delivered at used to give out samples of this.  Love this ointment so much I special order it on amazon.  Goes on so smooth and is SO much nicer than the standard ad ointment or vaseline.  Makes for easier diaper changes if applied prior.  Makes and keeps skin healthy.  But for nasty diaper rashes I usually switch to a zinc oxide or nystatin (depending..)</li>
            <li> Basic A and D ointment, great for nails overnight</li>
            <li> Best diaper cream available.  No smell like the other A&amp;D ointment available over the counter and really helps my baby stay rash free.  I apply a thin layer after her bath every night and she hasn&#x27;t had a diaper rash in 17 months.</li>
            <li> So Happy to find this on Amazon!  I looked everywhere for this product, and could only find it here - Thank goodness!&lt;br /&gt;goes on smooth, no odor, helps protect and heal the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Product!  highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My son is 14 months old and we have been using this paste till he born. It worked like a charm every time my kid had diaper rash.</li>
            <li> They used this on my son in the hospital when he was 5 weeks old.  I found it here on Amazon, and bought some.  I apply it to the &amp;quot;diaper area&amp;quot; with every diaper change.  My son is 4-1/2 months and hasn&#x27;t had any signs of diaper rash since.  And it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
            <li> This is the best in class medicine for diaper rash. This takes  &lt;br /&gt;away the diaper rash in few hours.</li>
            <li> The same results for lesser price.  Can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I got it first from the hospital where my daughter was born. She&#x27;s now 6 months old and NEVER had any diaper rash! It works so much better than those fancy packaged baby diaper creams. The only thing I dislike about it is the cap, its hard to screw back on and if you lose it, you will find ointment all over the places.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and will always keep it in my house. It has been difficult to find throughout the years snd I am  pleased to be able to buy it online.</li>
            <li> Been using this probably twenty years the best stuff for chapped lips and cheap. Keep one at home and one at work.</li>
            <li> i want buy more ，can you give some discounts</li>
            <li> I received the product in a timely manner.  I us it on my skin. I have a lose pigment problem.  I put it on the affected area a couple times a week.  The color has come back into those areas.  It takes a month or 2 to show results.  But it happens.</li>
            <li> This stuff works the best for diaper rash and prevention of rash.  Believe me, I have 4 kids and went thru many products.  This is hte best by far</li>
            <li> This ointment is the only thing that works for my baby and it is not available at the drug store so we had to order online - I really wish I would have paid extra for shipping. It took 10 days to arrive (assuming we get it today) and of course my daughter had a diaper rash that flared. So if you are running low - pay extra for faster shipping, otherwise the product itself is amazing! Irritation clears up significantly from one diaper change to the next.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin A&amp;D ointment has excellent healing properties for small cuts or scraps.</li>
            <li> This ointment is the best baby diaper rush I ever see !!!!!! They brought that for my baby in the hospital when he was just born and I start using it then and even though that I had other brand name creams at home I stick to this till today !!! My baby is 6 months old and never had a diaper rush yet  !!!! Not even a redness !!!</li>
            <li> This therapeutic ointment it&#x27;s the best on the market to protect babies from diaper rash and other skin uses. Is used and recomended by mayor hospitals around the US.</li>
            <li> Like how this feels works very well for dry skin.</li>
            <li> We have tried everything for our baby&#x27;s diaper rash.  Fougera A&amp;D is the best and only one that will work consistently.</li>
            <li> We bought Fougera&#x27;s A+D in local drugstore when my doctor suggested me to start applying it to my nipples to prepare for breastfeeding. This was the only tube and brand left in the store, so didn&#x27;t think much. After we used it, we loved it! It works on cracks, and diaper rash for my daughter, also bug bites and minor cuts. My daughter loves using it too. I especially think the scent is unique and pleasant comparing to the other A+D ointment. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I used this in the hospital after my delivery and really liked it.  It is more of a clear cream than the white diaper creams (sort of a Vaseline consistency), and smells nice.  It works great as protection.</li>
            <li> Best ointment I&#x27;ve ever used. Helps with everything.</li>
            <li> I have a four months old baby and I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot to find it in baby stores, like Babys R Us, or others.&lt;br /&gt;So, I ordered more than one, because is the only one my baby use and he is always very good.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it!!! It is the best for your baby and your own skin. I trust this brand completely. I was introduced to it in the  the hospital when my son was born and have been using it for the entire family  ever since. I also  use it instead of lip balm. It is the best thing!!!</li>
            <li> I use this ointment for my newborn and its been 2 months of usage now and I see no trace of rash in my baby. I love this ointment but the condition in which I received the ointment was horrible. One of the ointment had open holes in it and half of the ointment came out and the entire package was sticky. I want the seller to make sure that they send the ointment properly packed to avoid such mishaps. I would have given 5 stars if the ointments arrived in a proper condition.</li>
            <li> Great a&amp;d used on newborn boy circumcision (all 3) as it &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t sit there like a clump. It rubs in easily on baby&#x27;s tushie and cleans off easily as well. The only down side is once there isn&#x27;t much in the tube I rolled it to get to the ointment it does get hard to squeeze it out but I feel like you get to pretty much all the ointment unlike some tubes.</li>
            <li> I have used other viltamin a% d ointments that just reek of fish oil or taste fishy. I like to use this stuff on my lips when i go to bed at night or anyother place that is dry cracked or scaly..it heals it up superfast. This is the stuff they use in a lot of nursing homes and its awesoe</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve always used A+D Ointment found in all the local stores. Ordered this because we had limited time out shopping with a newborn.</li>
