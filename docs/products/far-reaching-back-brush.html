            <li>I&#x27;ve used many back brushes over the years.</li>
            <li>The ribbed handle really works for gripping when wet, so I have found no reason to deduct stars from this item.</li>

            <li>Its long enough, soft on your back but yet not too soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles are stiff feeling on the back, but flexible on the hand, which tells me that it is probably just right for cleaning &amp; stimulating the pores.</li>
            <li>the brush is not long enough to reach the middle of my back, never mind the ergonomic handle.</li>

            <li> Long enough to reach everywhere.</li>
            <li> i should have measured but when the ad said far-reaching I thought it would be long enough.</li>

            <li> The brush is firm enough to do the brushing but not so hard it hurts or damages the skin  </li>

            <li> Of course it&#x27;s an individual thing, but my wife found the bristles on this brush too stiff and harsh to use on her back. I bought the brush for her at her request. I never use these things myself, so I cannot comment personally. On the palm of my hand the bristles seem soft enough. She needed a replacement for a similar brush no longer made. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Just a heads up that others might find the brush too stiff to use. I gave the brush 4 stars because otherwise it seems like a good product. But the harshness is, of course, a deal breaker.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s going to buy a brush at a store so she can check the bristles first hand -- probably a good idea for anyone.</li>
            <li> Only complaint I have is that the brush head cracked after one week, still usable though. Long enough to reach everywhere.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and long enough reach. This was my first one so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to but whenever I need another one I&#x27;d buy this one again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many back brushes over the years. This one is very nice and has very soft bristles. But the wood in the head of the brush is turning black with mold. Also turning black where the bristles attach to the brush. Gross. I&#x27;ve only had it about a month. I hang it in the same place as all the other brushes I&#x27;ve had, but no others have ever turned black.</li>
            <li> Great scrubber for your back, Just remember to keep it dry mine started to get dark since I take showers about twice a day not sure if it was mold or not.</li>
            <li> This body brush has a nice long handle with good rubber grip. Like was mentioned in other reviews, mine cracked quite quickly but isn&#x27;t that expected with a wood brush? To avid it cracking I would say not to leave it in the shower and make sure its dried off after use. Even though mine is cracked it still works great and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Im shore its nice when I use it I will let you know how it is</li>
            <li> the brush is not long enough to reach the middle of my back, never mind the ergonomic handle. i get pain in the wrists trying to reach the middle of my back. the brush bristles are fine;they hold soap. i should have measured but when the ad said far-reaching I thought it would be long enough. I ama six foot male with a wide back and average lenght arms so I would say the brush needs to be another 3\\&quot; to 4\\&quot; longer.</li>
            <li> The name really says it all, nice long handle with non slip grip, natural bristles, top quality.  Maybe you could spend more, but I doubt you would get a better brush.  Buy with confidence.  Trust Me</li>
            <li> After years of searching, I ended my quest with the help of Amazon.  I knew my son didn&#x27;t have one of these because he always wanted to use mine when he visited me.  Wouldn&#x27;t you know?  Amazon had a choice of many fine bath brushes and my son loves the one I chose for him.    I also very much appreciate the friendly help I receive when I shop at Amazon.  I&#x27;m learning that I can find just about anything I need and have it at my door in a few days at most.  For those of us who live in the country, this is a miracle!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at the quality of this back brush. The bristles are soft and it is very easy to reach the difficult areas on your back. Great value for the money!!!!</li>

            <li> The brush is solid, well made and exactly as described. I am 6&#x27;3\\&quot; (and have a small shower :( )if I had been able to find another brush of this type that was 3-4\\&quot; longer I would have gone with it and given 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This product broke after a week of using it. I was able to fix it though.</li>
            <li> item used 2 times and  it split  along  the handel and  brissels  lost</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush for dry skin brushing.  It works very well and the handle is long enough to reach all over.  The brush is firm enough to do the brushing but not so hard it hurts or damages the skin  [[ASIN:B000NCYZXI Earth Therapeutics Far Reaching Back Brush]]</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles that hold lather well.  The extra long handle with comfort grip works well to hit the entire back area without extensive reaching.</li>
            <li> Purchased Far Reaching\\&quot; Back Brush with Ergonomic Grip Handle . Brush BROKE IN HALF within 6- weeks. Only used it about 9- times. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase this DANGEROUS wooden edged product again.</li>
            <li> I never knew how fabulous a brush like this was while taking a bath or shower.  Not to hard... not to soft... just fabulous. That says it all. I would have ordered one years ago had I known.  Eric</li>
            <li> We are pleased with this brush. It is as it was described. Its long enough, soft on your back but yet not too soft.</li>
            <li> Looks good but cracked after one use. Bristles falling out. contacted seller but no reply.  Don&#x27;t buy..</li>
