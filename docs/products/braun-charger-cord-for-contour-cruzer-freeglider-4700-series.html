            <li>Works fine, no problems.</li>
            <li>which doesent exactly fit in with the color scheme...</li>
            <li>This is a genuine Braun product.</li>
            <li>This cord fits the shaver better than the original and these people ship very fast.</li>
            <li>It looks and works just like the original.</li>
            <li>I lost my original charger while on vacation</li>
            <li>Original and work well.</li>
            <li>While this seems pricey, it is the original configuration.</li>
            <li>plugs into the shaver like the original, and charges the shaver rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dropped</li>
            <li>have also determined that while the original was made in China, this replacement is made in Germany.</li>
            <li>Save some money by buying it here on amazing and instead of buying it from Braun directly.</li>
            <li>almost and it feels like something is going to burn out quickly somewhere.  </li>
            <li>Product is well made and arrived quickly from shipper.</li>
            <li>The description stated it was compatible with CruZer models so I quickly made the order.</li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>The cord charges super fast, just as the original product did.</li>
            <li>I have never seen a blue Braun shaver, and I own three of them.    </li>
            <li>So far it works ok</li>
            <li>Thought I was getting the right charger.  </li>
            <li>The cord is hot and the shaver is hot.  </li>
            <li>Not too hot to pick up, but</li>
            <li>I like the razor a lot, so just to be safe, I only use it as a corded razor.  </li>
            <li>But after I plugged it in and monitored the charging for the first 15 minutes, there were NO issues and worked as advertised.</li>
            <li>This is the exact replacement for the charger cord that I lost.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Not a imitation, this is the exact Braun charger cord that came with in the original box with my razor.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect match.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s entirely Braun&#x27;s fault for maintaining such a high premium on such a cheap accessory, so I have to level my complaints against the company&#x27;s policy more than the actual piece of equipment, which does its job perfectly fine and doesn&#x27;t get too hot in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d throw the shaver away and just get a whole new package, fresh shaver, battery, charger, and cartridge in all.</li>
            <li>Did the job very well.  </li>
            <li>Maybe this is normal for a charger cord, I don&#x27;t know, but this one runs REALLY hot.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for nothing.</li>
            <li>What I received was a charger identical to the one I had lost, so in that respect I am very</li>
            <li>Certainly much cheaper than replacing the accessories piecemeal.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly very timely delivery.</li>
            <li>the original in a cup of coffee, and it never functioned properly after that</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I am still a bit sore that the price was so high on this when there is really nothing to justify the cost.</li>
            <li>Huge waste of time, wish they were more specific with what items are compatible.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re well on your way to just buying a whole new shaver.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and would purchase again.</li>
            <li>Still can&#x27;t shave and now I need to buy a new trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Found just what I was looking for after a new puppy decided the cord was &#x27;food&#x27;.</li>
            <li>The cord had to be physically altered to fit the electrical connection after which it did charge properly.</li>
            <li>I found that when I left the cord plugged in and recharging my old Braun razor, the cord got a little warm.  </li>
            <li>AFTER I received this one - guess one can&#x27;t have too many chargers :/</li>
            <li>Not only did this charger stop working on first charge, it broke my trimmer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly the same as the one I threw away.</li>
            <li>I found the old one</li>
            <li>This was a MUCH cheaper solution than replacing my entire shaver.</li>
            <li>This changer cord allows a light on the shaver to turn off when it&#x27;s fully charged, while other generic charger cords do not do this.</li>
            <li>you double check if you have an older shaver</li>
            <li>The product shipped very fast, arriving three days before the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li>but when I received the item I was forced to shave some plastic away with a knife to get it to fit because I couldn&#x27;t wait for the turn around time for a return.  </li>
            <li>I left my charger in a hotel room a few weeks ago and quickly purchased this one as my replacement.</li>
            <li>At first I was a little hesitant to use it based on the female plug only having two openings versus the three male prongs on my shaver.</li>

            <li> Wish it was black, but knew it might be blue.  </li>
            <li> I received the Braun charger cord ahead of the promised time and it works exactly as I expected it to.</li>
            <li> It arrived sooner than expected and allows me to continue using my shaver.</li>
            <li> This charging cord for my Dad&#x27;s Braun shaver (shaver color silver and black, black case) was colored blue-</li>
            <li> It does not have any sort of features to it like an LED, a surge protection switch, a swivel plug to accommodate for multiple configurations, and is not even a particularly small or \\&quot;travel convenient\\&quot; size.</li>
            <li> I had to get this to replace a cord lost in shipping due to a hotels inept return process.</li>
            <li> So four stars, black cord gets five stars.</li>
            <li> The cord did not fit series 5 Braun shavers and equipment.</li>
            <li> Waste of $25.</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;re not stuck with a dead one.</li>
            <li> It is not made of particularly thick or high-quality wire.</li>
            <li> wrong cord - description of product # incorrect.</li>
            <li> Too bad</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Nothing spectacular its just a replacement for my charger that was lost by the airlines. If, you ask me I think one of those baggage handlers took it.</li>
            <li> I left my charger at a hotel and needed a replacement.  This cord fits the bill 100%, I have had no problems with it at all.</li>
            <li> Did the job very well.  Wish it was black, but knew it might be blue.  So be it.  It Works!</li>
            <li> Maybe this is normal for a charger cord, I don&#x27;t know, but this one runs REALLY hot.  The cord is hot and the shaver is hot.  Not too hot to pick up, but almost and it feels like something is going to burn out quickly somewhere.  Could be it&#x27;s a defective cord.  If the vendor is reading this, please comment.</li>
            <li> The cord did not fit series 5 Braun shavers and equipment. The cord had to be physically altered to fit the electrical connection after which it did charge properly. I dont recommend this product out of the box for series 5 equipment.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun charger cord ahead of the promised time and it works exactly as I expected it to.</li>
            <li> Now I can recharge my Braun shaver.  Too bad I found the old one AFTER I received this one - guess one can&#x27;t have too many chargers :/</li>
            <li> I found that when I left the cord plugged in and recharging my old Braun razor, the cord got a little warm.  I like the razor a lot, so just to be safe, I only use it as a corded razor.  It&#x27;s only plugged in while I&#x27;m shaving.  For my purposes the cord and razor work fine.</li>
            <li> This charging cord for my Dad&#x27;s Braun shaver (shaver color silver and black, black case) was colored blue- which doesent exactly fit in with the color scheme... I have never seen a blue Braun shaver, and I own three of them.    However it was priced well and it works.    So four stars, black cord gets five stars.</li>
            <li> The cord arrived within ten days and works perfectly with my Braun 320s-4.  This is a genuine Braun product.</li>
            <li> This cord works perfectly with my father&#x27;s older Braun electric shaver. This changer cord allows a light on the shaver to turn off when it&#x27;s fully charged, while other generic charger cords do not do this.</li>
            <li> The razor was a gift but didn&#x27;t have the cord! I was pleased to find one online. Perfect fit and affordable!</li>
            <li> This razor charger charges my razor, what can I say more?  I plug it into my wall outlet and the electricty goes from the outlet, through the charging chord, and into my razor battery.  Its amazing!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement cord for my Braun series 3 razor. It looks and works just like the original.</li>
            <li> Not only did this charger stop working on first charge, it broke my trimmer. Waste of $25. Thanks for nothing.</li>
            <li> 3-4 Min. that&#x27;s all it takes,  for my Braun Shaver to be fully charges .I&#x27;m happy it is so quick .</li>
            <li> Resurrected my Shaver !!!</li>
            <li> I had to replace a charger that was lost. This charger work great with my Braun electric razor.</li>
            <li> Works as said. Save some money by buying it here on amazing and instead of buying it from Braun directly.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect replacement for the one I lost. It works great and hopefully I won&#x27;t lose this one.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little hesitant to use it based on the female plug only having two openings versus the three male prongs on my shaver. But after I plugged it in and monitored the charging for the first 15 minutes, there were NO issues and worked as advertised. This was a MUCH cheaper solution than replacing my entire shaver.

            <li> Nice product.. It works perfec on my braun series 3, I am happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> The braun charger was exactly what I wanted, works great, and I got it faster than I thought! I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
            <li> So far it works ok but you cannot plug it on 220 v because it will burn out. The 220 V. power in US is quite weaker than the one in Europe or Brazil</li>
            <li> worked flawless just like the original witch I left in our trailer 400 miles away</li>
            <li> Not a imitation, this is the exact Braun charger cord that came with in the original box with my razor.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect match.</li>
            <li> I was hunting around to try to find a charger for my seemingly archaic Braun 300 series. This puppy did the trick no hassle and no hunting endlessly through department stores hoping they have my old charger in stock.</li>
            <li> I lost my original charger while on vacation and I waffled for literally years on buying a replacement because it seemed more than a bit silly to pay close to $30 for a replacement which probably costs the manufacturer less than $5. What I received was a charger identical to the one I had lost, so in that respect I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I am still a bit sore that the price was so high on this when there is really nothing to justify the cost. It is not grounded. It is not made of particularly thick or high-quality wire. It does not have any sort of features to it like an LED, a surge protection switch, a swivel plug to accommodate for multiple configurations, and is not even a particularly small or \\&quot;travel convenient\\&quot; size. Given that the replacement screen and blade cartridge is another $30, if you have to replace them both you&#x27;re well on your way to just buying a whole new shaver. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s entirely Braun&#x27;s fault for maintaining such a high premium on such a cheap accessory, so I have to level my complaints against the company&#x27;s policy more than the actual piece of equipment, which does its job perfectly fine and doesn&#x27;t get too hot in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I ever buy another one of these? No. I&#x27;d throw the shaver away and just get a whole new package, fresh shaver, battery, charger, and cartridge in all. Certainly much cheaper than replacing the accessories piecemeal.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly very timely delivery.</li>
            <li> This is the exact replacement for the charger cord that I lost. It arrived sooner than expected and allows me to continue using my shaver.</li>
            <li> I took my braun shaver on a trip and thought I left it in the hotel so I threw away the charger seeing is how I didn&#x27;t need it.  Well over a year later, my son found the shaver in on of my luggage bags.  It&#x27;s exactly the same as the one I threw away.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly &amp; as described.</li>
            <li> Product is well made and arrived quickly from shipper.</li>
            <li> It was as described. Perfect. Will buy from them again if I need another. But hopefully I&#x27;ll hang on to this one lol</li>
            <li> It fit perfect. Just what I was looking for when i bought it. Couldnt be happier with my purchase! The best!</li>
            <li> I left my charger in a hotel room a few weeks ago and quickly purchased this one as my replacement. The description stated it was compatible with CruZer models so I quickly made the order. Unfortunately when the item arrived it didn&#x27;t fit as described. Huge waste of time, wish they were more specific with what items are compatible. Otherwise, it arrived on time and well packaged.</li>
            <li> This overheated my 5 series shaver (listed on page as compatible) and broke it.  Still can&#x27;t shave and now I need to buy a new trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update*  I added a star because of good customer service. They promptly issued a refund when I informed them about what happened</li>
            <li> Original and work well. We will come back in one or two year on the quality of the product....Well packed and on time.</li>
            <li> Found just what I was looking for after a new puppy decided the cord was &#x27;food&#x27;. It arrived in a timely fashion, 2-3 days, and kept the peace in my house. I would recommend amazon.com to find anything you are looking for at great prices and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Thought I was getting the right charger.  The Series number list seemed to include my Series 5 Electric shaver but when I received the item I was forced to shave some plastic away with a knife to get it to fit because I couldn&#x27;t wait for the turn around time for a return.  Make sure you double check if you have an older shaver so you&#x27;re not stuck with a dead one.</li>
            <li> Lost the original, just as good! Came quickly. Thanks!</li>
            <li> wrong cord - description of product # incorrect.</li>
            <li> It fit&lt;br /&gt;My husband&#x27;s razor.</li>
            <li> This is a genuine Braun cord, so there are no problems with compatibility! The product shipped very fast, arriving three days before the expected delivery date. The plug has two holes and still works with my 3-pronged Series 3 shaver. The cord charges super fast, just as the original product did. The shaver battery holds its life just as before, so no issues here!</li>
            <li> I bought this cord, because I lost the original, It works perfect and the price is very good. I recommend it 100%.</li>
            <li> Works fine, no problems.</li>
            <li> While this seems pricey, it is the original configuration. There are a lot of after-market substitutes for sale, but I have never found those to be satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This plugs into the shaver like the original, and charges the shaver rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dropped the original in a cup of coffee, and it never functioned properly after that (well, it did work, but even while charging coffee would leak out of it; I&#x27;m amazed it didn&#x27;t short out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also determined that while the original was made in China, this replacement is made in Germany. A pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> I had to get this to replace a cord lost in shipping due to a hotels inept return process. This cord fits the shaver better than the original and these people ship very fast.</li>
