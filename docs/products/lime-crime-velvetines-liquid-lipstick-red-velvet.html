            <li>The color on this lipstick is the best I&#x27;ve ever found, but there are a couple minor problems.</li>
            <li>I love it, it so easy to apply</li>
            <li>This is the perfect matte lipstick and it doesnt leave your lips dry.  </li>
            <li>my prayers were answered true red color is just flawless application</li>
            <li>The product arrived super fast and great price.</li>
            <li>I love how rich it is</li>
            <li>Smears way to easy.  </li>
            <li>It also dries on chalky so if you rub your lips together or drink anything it will rub off, but even with that it doesn&#x27;t come off easily around the</li>
            <li>drys lips, smears easily, fades</li>
            <li>easy to apply.</li>

            <li>The color is really pretty and it does look nice</li>
            <li>It goes on perfectly smooth and easy and drys to a dreamy matte bloodred.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super seductive and sexy color.</li>
            <li>I have bought many red lipsticks in my time and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>AND I DON&#x27;T SEE WHERE THIS IS ANY MORE COLORFUL</li>
            <li>going to just use it as a light stain on my lips by putting on then</li>
            <li>It would be worth the price if the company produced more in the tube.</li>
            <li>Seriously this is the most beautiful lipstick ever!</li>
            <li>Great special occasion Red!</li>
            <li>and I love how soft it is :)</li>
            <li>If you are attending a special event where pictures will be taken this is a must have.</li>
            <li>and I fell lucky</li>
            <li>I love that it dries out matte and does not smear, but you must make sure not to have dry lips.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect, but it is definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li>just right or its a hassle to fix or take off</li>
            <li>The packaging was a little different than what I had seen online, there wasn&#x27;t the cool box with the pretty packaging and directions inside; but the product itself was ideal.</li>
            <li>It goes on very well!</li>
            <li>It is more like and orange red</li>
            <li>My favorite red lipstick</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this Lime Crime !!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>The amplified color with matte formulation was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>This lipstick is very pretty as long as you use a lip pencil and make sure you put chapstick on prior.</li>
            <li>Deep rich color, that goes on creamy and somewhat glossy and then turns matte and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>Spectacular color and extremely long lasting wear.</li>
            <li>True red.</li>
            <li>Classic color.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>: does dry matte, goes on smoothly, rich color&lt;br /&gt;Cons:</li>
            <li>The only thing I like about this is the color,it is a rich bold blue based that provides the truest of red lips.</li>
            <li>it sets, it won&#x27;t get on your teeth or on your significant other&#x27;s lips.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had the intense red bleeding beyond my lip line and for that I don&#x27;t like the product.</li>
            <li>you only have to apply very minimum lipstick to freshen up.</li>
            <li>It bled outside my lips way too much for my liking.</li>
            <li>I got the Red Velvet and it is a true blue red!</li>
            <li>very Opaque after it dries but will dry out your lips even with chap stick underneath.</li>
            <li>Love this product, it last for long time and doesnt smear but little drying you have apply lip balm or moisturizer before using it</li>
            <li>and it is a true red just a little pricy for me</li>
            <li>Does not dry out your lips and will not come off until you take it off.</li>
            <li>However, if it is introduced to too much moisture, it becomes sticky, and if not enough, it&#x27;s extremely drying, and flakes off.</li>
            <li>A little tricky to put on as it is a liquid but just have your liner ready.</li>

            <li> long lasting.</li>
            <li> at last the only thing you have arround your mouth is a red mess</li>
            <li> I applied it one time and it stayed on all nigh long.</li>
            <li> To dry</li>
            <li> Naturally after eating or drinking you do have to touch up a bit, but no more than that.</li>
            <li> It dries super dark and bleeds on the lip line and has a thick heavy feel when dry</li>
            <li> If you are worried you can&#x27;t pull off a deep red color, worry no more.</li>
            <li> it goes on wet and dries in seconds.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait for this company to come out with other velvetine colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning to purchase the other colors in the Velvetine line.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Check out the other colors too!  </li>
            <li> and there is no trace of it left behind when I kiss my husband.</li>
            <li> The applicator holds a lot of the product, which makes it hard to put on.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry as advertised, and it tasted and smelled awful in general.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it as a lip stain, however it might stain a little too well, so if you get it around your mouth and try to wipe it away it will stain your skin leaving you with a very sloppy looking lip stain.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> you put it on really thin, it stains your lips for hours.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best/coolest lipstick ever!</li>
            <li> /con: difficult to take off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Lime Crime.</li>
            <li> This product was terrible.</li>
            <li> but it was still drying ,and it looked horrible after about 30 mim because of the feathering.</li>

            <li> The Package came a day early which was the best news ever, and the product makes my lips look better than they ever have before!! I will definitely be buying this again when I run out!!</li>
            <li> I LOVED IT!!!! It lasts forever! You can eat, drink, kiss and its still there. The colour is awesome, but i think should have more product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this should be prices more than $12 but hey. I like it. It looks great! very Opaque after it dries but will dry out your lips even with chap stick underneath. The color is not like it is shown on the picture. It is more like and orange red but I still love the color a lot.</li>
            <li> I love the lipstick, it&#x27;s really nice.  It actually lasts a while, but the color fades a bit. It doesn&#x27;t stain though!</li>
            <li> Perfect love this color and texture.i fall in love.absolute gorgeus.Batom lindo de acabamento mate e fixa por horas,recomendo.vale a pena</li>
            <li> Best red lipstick ever! Stays on all day or night! I wish they had more colors. I get so many compliments when I wear it!</li>
            <li> I dont like it at all.  It doesn&#x27;t keep on you lips at all and the color is not the one at the picture and at last the only thing you have arround your mouth is a red mess</li>
            <li> I ORDERED TWO OF THESE BUT WISH I HADN&#x27;T NOW.&lt;br /&gt;I DON&#x27;T SEE WHAT THE HYPE IS ALL ABOUT. I HAVE BEEN WEARING RED&lt;br /&gt;BY SOMEBODY SINCE I STARTED WEARING LIPSTICK.  LOREAL, MAC, MAYBELLINE,&lt;br /&gt;YOU NAME IT AND I DON&#x27;T SEE WHERE THIS IS ANY MORE COLORFUL, STAYS LONGER ETC ETC.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the this lipstick at all. To dry and I ordered Red Velvet but when I put it on it was Orange! Not happy with this product. Will be sending it back.</li>
            <li> Awesome lipstick! One of the best lipsticks I have. Does not dry out your lips and will not come off until you take it off.</li>
            <li> The color on this lipstick is the best I&#x27;ve ever found, but there are a couple minor problems. The applicator holds a lot of the product, which makes it hard to put on. It also dries on chalky so if you rub your lips together or drink anything it will rub off, but even with that it doesn&#x27;t come off easily around the she&#x27;s of the lips unless you have water or some liquid. The color is really pretty and it does look nice but I would not buy again</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing. The packaging was a little different than what I had seen online, there wasn&#x27;t the cool box with the pretty packaging and directions inside; but the product itself was ideal. I can&#x27;t get over how awesome this lipgloss is! It goes on perfectly smooth and easy and drys to a dreamy matte bloodred. It&#x27;s the coolest thing I have ever used. Beware though if you get it any where else it will stay there.</li>
            <li> I love the Lime Crime Velvetine line.&lt;br /&gt;If you put it on really thin, it stains your lips for hours.&lt;br /&gt;Once it sets, it won&#x27;t get on your teeth or on your significant other&#x27;s lips.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;Check out the other colors too!  I have them all...&lt;br /&gt;My favorite lip product ever.</li>
            <li> Ok, so, I do and dont love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: does dry matte, goes on smoothly, rich color&lt;br /&gt;Cons: drys lips, smears easily, fades&lt;br /&gt;Pro/con: difficult to take off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my yes n nos, make ur own decision</li>
            <li> This product was terrible. It didn&#x27;t dry as advertised, and it tasted and smelled awful in general. I would recommend it as a lip stain, however it might stain a little too well, so if you get it around your mouth and try to wipe it away it will stain your skin leaving you with a very sloppy looking lip stain.</li>
            <li> great texture, perfect red (not too bright and not too dark), light and untouchable but covering, gorgeous packaging&lt;br /&gt;must try!!</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best/coolest lipstick ever! I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect, but it is definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li> Best lipstick in the world. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Lime Crime.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. I love that it dries out matte and does not smear, but you must make sure not to have dry lips. Very sexy lips and perfect color!</li>
            <li> Bought as a requested gift for my daughter&#x27;s 18th birthday. She absolutely loves it. Deep rich color, that goes on creamy and somewhat glossy and then turns matte and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> I love it, it so easy to apply and it is a true red just a little pricy for me but it&#x27;s totally worth it. My favorite red lipstick</li>
            <li> I adore this color. It&#x27;s super seductive and sexy color. True red. I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for the perfect red for me and I found it!!!!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this Lime Crime !! I got the Red Velvet and it is a true blue red! The only thing I like about this is the color,it is a rich bold blue based that provides the truest of red lips.What I don&#x27;t like about it is everything else that it does! It&#x27;s drying,it bleeds,it fades quickly,it dosen&#x27;t go on lips evenly.I used chapstick underneath but it was still drying ,and it looked horrible after about 30 mim because of the feathering.I thought no lipliner was needed  but you defintely need  lip liner to help with this problem .I&#x27;m going to just use it as a light stain on my lips by putting on then sorta taking off excess,it gives sorta that bitten look.Defintely not good as a full coverage lipstain.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it last for long time and doesnt smear but little drying you have apply lip balm or moisturizer before using it</li>
            <li> Am in love with this is perfect red lips completlt no need for anyother is amazing . best lipstick ever</li>
            <li> You want a staying lipstain ladies this is it!!!!!!!!!!! my prayers were answered true red color is just flawless application</li>
            <li> My favorite lip product! Literally lasts all day, the color pay off is awesome and there is no trace of it left behind when I kiss my husband. Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I feel that this product lives up to its name. It works almost as well as the product is boasted about by make up gurus. The fragrance of the velveteen lipstick is awesome and the application is very defined. You just have to take care and wipe off the extra product before applying. It does not smear and lasts almost all day. I tried it myself and was very satisfied with the results. Naturally after eating or drinking you do have to touch up a bit, but no more than that. The only problem is the amount. It would be worth the price if the company produced more in the tube. I give it 9/10.</li>
            <li> My review is in no way a reflection of the seller!  The product arrived super fast and great price. The product, however, goes on great and an amazing color, but it runs!  I had the intense red bleeding beyond my lip line and for that I don&#x27;t like the product.</li>
            <li> Its kind of like a stain. and yet it rubs off. I love how rich it is and I love how soft it is :)</li>
            <li> This Product exceeded every expectation... I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT....my only regret is not buying the 3 packs they offered at Chrstmas.... it literally stays on all day... I no longer need my Russian Red or Ruby Woo from MAC this totally knocks them out of the park!!!</li>
            <li> the lipsticks stays on even after your done eating. you only have to apply very minimum lipstick to freshen up. i am very pleased. it goes on wet and dries in seconds. this line of lipstick is a really good investment.</li>
            <li> This opaque matte finish red is the brightest most beautiful color you can ever imagine! If you are attending a special event where pictures will be taken this is a must have. The pictures turn out beautiful. If you are worried you can&#x27;t pull off a deep red color, worry no more. This is easy to apply, easy to wear and it gets rave results!</li>
            <li> great color. long lasting. easy to apply. you must like a matte lipstick if you&#x27;re going to get this. need a great lip liner to go with it too.</li>
            <li> This product met my expectations.  The amplified color with matte formulation was exactly what I was looking for.  The color last for several hours. Initially I tried it without a lip liner and liked it however once I applied it with a lip liner I loved it.  I&#x27;m planning to purchase the other colors in the Velvetine line.</li>
            <li> Seeker shiped.fast and did everything rigjt, however lipstick was npt.what I was hoping for. It dries super dark and bleeds on the lip line and has a thick heavy feel when dry</li>
            <li> This lipstick is very pretty as long as you use a lip pencil and make sure you put chapstick on prior. However, if it is introduced to too much moisture, it becomes sticky, and if not enough, it&#x27;s extremely drying, and flakes off.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the right box or lipstick design, but the product was great. Really happy with it, but a shame the design wasn&#x27;t right</li>
            <li> Every one see me wearing this lipstick adore how beautiful this color is!! I get many compliments when i wear this lipstick, i really love it and I fell lucky that I get it before it was sold out, some websites sell this for more than $40, I definetly gonna buy it again. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect matte lipstick and it doesnt leave your lips dry.  I would buy over over and in every color.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Great special occasion Red! Doesn&#x27;t rub off when you smooch or eat. Classic color. A little tricky to put on as it is a liquid but just have your liner ready.</li>
            <li> The lip stick is amazing. I applied it one time and it stayed on all nigh long. I didn&#x27;t have to re-apply and it had a nice moist matte texture.</li>
            <li> Good product. Just not for me.. It bled outside my lips way too much for my liking. Won&#x27;t repurchase</li>
            <li> Great matte look! Gotta get it just right or its a hassle to fix or take off</li>
