            <li>Good product--I find it a lot easier to force myself to floss when using the Glide floss.</li>
            <li>I LOVED THIS FLOSS</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>GOOD STUFF.</li>
            <li>And its very cheap on amazon too!</li>
            <li>I love Glide floss!  </li>
            <li>Great when it works, but breaks too easily.</li>
            <li>Hygienist says it&#x27;s doing a good job; can&#x27;t ask for better than that.</li>
            <li>A nice product for flossing.</li>
            <li>This slides very easily as suggested in the product description.  </li>
            <li>However, this floss is effective without the irritation, so I am satisfied no matter what time of day I use it.</li>
            <li>It slips between teeth very easily, and does a better job cleaning.</li>
            <li>Well I have used this Oral B Glide for many years.  </li>
            <li>The light minty taste is nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pulled more out and again it Broke.</li>
            <li>What more can I say?  </li>
            <li>It breaks and you have to use more than you should to get the job done.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite floss.</li>
            <li>I love the tape-like floss that prevents it from being stringy.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My favorite floss.  </li>
            <li>Remember to floss twice a day :)</li>
            <li>Cleans okay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a ribbon going between your teeth instead of a string.</li>
            <li>Feels much better</li>
            <li>and I have better control of it too.</li>
            <li>Mint taste is refreshing, but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>This is OK floss.  </li>
            <li>This is simply the best dental floss I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Is</li>
            <li>More like tape.</li>
            <li>Love this floss.</li>
            <li>I love to floss</li>
            <li>This has more wax on it than the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My favorite floss.  </li>
            <li>Glide is my favorite floss.</li>
            <li>REALIZE IT COULD GET BETTER.</li>
            <li>clean tooth is healthy for us all!</li>
            <li>Best floss I&#x27;ve tried, glides easily and nice and wide to get the gunk out.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave a nice cool minty taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Plus the cool mint is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this to folks who don&#x27;t enjoy flossing - Glide will change your mind!!!</li>
            <li>Has a tendency to break somewhat easily, but so do most.</li>
            <li>I was originally trying to find the Glide that was in the white container that I think works the best out of the Glide lineup.  </li>
            <li>Cleans great, very gentle on gums, ribbon-like instead of stringy, burst of fresh mint, improves breath, improves health of gums.</li>
            <li>This is easily the most comfortable dental floss I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda pricey, but you do get what you pay for, which is a really smoothy, easy to use, and good tasting floss.</li>
            <li>The Butterweave by GUM gives you more bang for the buck, and is easy to grip, but it&#x27;s not as comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>and I like this floss because it slides in and out easily.</li>
            <li>It works well and does not break easily and that is saying a lot as I have close contacts.</li>
            <li>took one star off my review because it does break easily.</li>
            <li>Easy on the teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>The string is strong.</li>
            <li>This is, hands down, the best floss on the market.</li>
            <li>Comfortable, easy to use, and easy to slide between teeth.</li>
            <li>A bit too fine.</li>
            <li>Smooth and easy to use, and it indeed will &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Excellent floss for tight contacts and</li>
            <li>It moves very smoothly between my teeth and rarely breaks.</li>
            <li>Smooth</li>
            <li>A great value overall.</li>
            <li>I use different varieties of glide floss, and they all work great.  </li>
            <li>Too smooth and slippery.</li>
            <li>This is the best....but make it available in 100m spools and give us a price break please.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh taste this mint floss leaves in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Glide slides ever so smoothly.  </li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t happen with the unflavored, which is totally bizarre.</li>
            <li>However, it is still very effective and the twin pack lasts quite a while in my family (even with twice daily usage).</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t figure out how something so smooth can clean so well, but it does.</li>
            <li>Original review</li>
            <li>Note that these are mint flavored, not the original Glide floss.  </li>
            <li>Also, the mint flavored floss is wider than the original Glide floss.</li>
            <li>but I was looking for the original.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I missed the Mint Flavor when using the Original.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best, so treat yourself to this small luxury.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are too close together and this floss easily slides in between them and rarely breaks.</li>
            <li>Since I brush 5 times a day, I know that floss is still needed to truly clean teeth.</li>
            <li>It appears to clean between my teeth</li>
            <li>It stays true to it&#x27;s name and glides right in between teeth with no problem whatsoever!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fray and goes in between teeth quickly.</li>
            <li>For a while when using some other popular brands, I started to get gum gaps between my front teeth that didn&#x27;t seem to be getting any better.</li>
            <li>Easier and more comfortable to use compared to the original (white colored case), but</li>
            <li>This floss will gently wear through and break, allowing easy removal in that area, without getting stuck.</li>
            <li>This wideband floss is excellent for anyone with tightly spaced teeth in which using the standard floss (i.e. cheap floss or the floss you get from your dentist) gets caught between your teeth and requires removal with scissors and tweezers.  </li>
            <li>I love minty things, things that clean deep, and of course things that are totally cool.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shred when I use it, and the minty fresh flavor keeps my mouth and breath fresh.  </li>
            <li>In fact, for me, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Someone literally told me that I have Anne Hathaway&#x27;s smile, hair, and charm.</li>
            <li>Does it make flossing far more pleasurable?</li>
            <li>IT TASTES FRESH AND FEELS LIKE</li>
            <li>Try the cheaper brands available at you local Target or other store; chances are that purchase will be much better than paying for this &amp;#34;brand name,&amp;#34; which used to be good.</li>
            <li>Excellent flossing tape - wide - flat!  </li>
            <li>Love the way that I can use two strands of this floss to clean some of the big gaps between my teeth.</li>
            <li>B00REYGYBE Glide Original Dental Floss]] that I&#x27;ve purchased before; therefore I don&#x27;t need as much wrapped around my fingers because it almost self-adheres to itself.</li>
            <li>(no fraying or breaking right away like others we have tried)</li>
            <li>Not all flosses seem to get my teeth clean very well, and the dental hygienists let me know when that happens.</li>
            <li>This floss is great for people like myself, who have very little space between their teeth.</li>
            <li>My family use this kind of floss for a long time.  </li>
            <li>It shreds and breaks far too easily.</li>
            <li>The regular floss in the white container is great, but this &amp;#34;deep clean&amp;#34; stuff breaks virtually every time I use</li>
            <li>First try and Broke.</li>
            <li>I have used Oral-B Glide dental floss for years and first time ordered online.</li>
            <li>I have been using this exact product for years.</li>
            <li>THE FIRST TIME I USED IT</li>
            <li>I actually like it better now.</li>
            <li>I have stuck with it ever since my first order arrived.</li>
            <li>Any other kind of floss that isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;tape&amp;#34; irritates my teeth.</li>
            <li>One of the many perfect examples of the products that are pushed on us in America that are inferior in quality, and therefore remind us of a the &amp;#34;corporate culture&amp;#34; we live in, where little but &amp;#34;profits&amp;#34; mean anything.</li>
            <li>If you have very sensitive gums this may be more comfortable that other floss.</li>
            <li>The Original Floss (white container) is a sturdy and more traditional floss material.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have problems with the floss breaking or shredding, seems to work very well.  </li>
            <li>VERY minty, which I like.  </li>
            <li>It really does &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>My teeth are very close together</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve used Glide, it&#x27;s much easier to floss, and Glide slides in-and-out without getting stuck between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>It really does glide between my teeth.</li>
            <li>so much easier then standing in the store searching the multitude of offerings for just the one I want.</li>
            <li>The stuff works, but expect it to cost 2-3 times as much because of the amount you have to use.</li>
            <li>This floss is coated in something that makes your gums tingle and really gives a deep clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s significantly cheaper to purchase these from Amazon than at your local drugstore.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The white containers are Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Original Floss.  </li>
            <li>For several years, I used the Original Glide, as recommended by my Dentist.</li>
            <li>BETTER THAN ANY OTHER FLOSS I&#x27;VE EVER</li>
            <li>This Deep Clean (this ribbon) floss also results in a lot of breakage for me.  </li>
            <li>But after my previous favorite floss was discontinued, I switched to this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It shreds quite easily in comparison to other products.</li>
            <li>Floss can be quite expensive so this pack was a great deal.</li>
            <li>For me, Glide with Mint Flavor is complete, and the price on Amazon for a Twin Pack is reasonable.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get stuck between closely-spaced teeth like your normal dental floss.  </li>
            <li>it worth the extra money?</li>
            <li>The only thing is that they all tend to shred when trying to cut off a piece, but it&#x27;s a minor inconvenience to put up with for the sake of maintaining healthy gums.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really going to get all excited about floss, but it is something I use every day.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Other flosses are too thick for me, but Glide is great.</li>
            <li>Only floss I can use-still my favorite -all other floss I give away.</li>
            <li>I probably pull 30-40% less of this than the cheap floss, because it does not slip.</li>
            <li>Fantastic for tight teeth.</li>
            <li>The grey containers are Oral-B Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You may not have this problem, but if you use Glide specifically because your teeth are tight, stick to the regular kind in the white packaging.</li>
            <li>yet it feels soft on gums and fingers.</li>
            <li>I think that it is old product.</li>
            <li>so Glide is really the only floss I can use.</li>
            <li>This Oral-B glide stuff holds together without a problem and it gentle enough on my gums for my liking.</li>
            <li>I know this is just floss, but I have to say as far as floss goes, this is the bee&#x27;s knees.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are very close together, and I always had a problem with regular dental floss, getting caught between my teeth.</li>
            <li>Now, I feel like Flossing is complete, with a refreshed feeling after using the Mint Flavor.</li>
            <li>, I have sensitive gums, and Glide doesn&#x27;t irritate them, or make them bleed.</li>
            <li>I had to see for myself and WOW was</li>
            <li>Though more expensive than standard floss I would recommend it for cleaning ones teeth, this actually works better for me than using a waterpik.</li>
            <li>I am still searching for a high enough quality floss that will not break in between my teeth.</li>
            <li>As a cheapskate, I was apprehensive about the price and the fact you get less on a roll than most other flosses.</li>
            <li>Even doing this, it is obvious to me, a person who cares a lot about my teeth, this is substandard floss, &amp;#34;tweaked&amp;#34; to the very minimum size and tensile strength to maximize corporate profits.</li>
            <li>Resists breaking better than other kinds, and I have tight teeth, but it can slide between them.</li>
            <li>Go with Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Original Floss: much stronger and almost as thin.</li>
            <li>I find a lot of other floss brands tend to fray while I use them, or are too fine and feel almost sharp.</li>
            <li>do not have those experiences with this floss; it is not &#x27;slippery&#x27; like some of the tape types, it is able to get into those hard-to-reach areas, it seems to be tough</li>
            <li>With other floss, I usually pull out a good 15 inches of floss and wrap it around my fingers many times because with the thin floss, it starts to slip when it gets wet.</li>
            <li>Flavor is nice but irrelevant to me.</li>
            <li>If you have really tight spaces between your teeth like I do , this is the only floss that really works without shredding and getting caught.</li>

            <li> This is my favorite floss.</li>
            <li> I love the tape-like floss that prevents it from being stringy.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> My favorite floss.  </li>
            <li> Remember to floss twice a day :)</li>
            <li> Cleans okay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a ribbon going between your teeth instead of a string.</li>
            <li> Feels much better</li>
            <li> and I have better control of it too.</li>
            <li> Mint taste is refreshing, but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> This is OK floss.  </li>
            <li> This is simply the best dental floss I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Is</li>
            <li> More like tape.</li>
            <li> Love this floss.</li>
            <li> I love to floss</li>
            <li> This has more wax on it than the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> My favorite floss.  </li>
            <li> Glide is my favorite floss.</li>
            <li> REALIZE IT COULD GET BETTER.</li>
            <li> clean tooth is healthy for us all!</li>
            <li> Best floss I&#x27;ve tried, glides easily and nice and wide to get the gunk out.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a nice cool minty taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Plus the cool mint is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this to folks who don&#x27;t enjoy flossing - Glide will change your mind!!!</li>
            <li> Has a tendency to break somewhat easily, but so do most.</li>
            <li> I was originally trying to find the Glide that was in the white container that I think works the best out of the Glide lineup.  </li>
            <li> Cleans great, very gentle on gums, ribbon-like instead of stringy, burst of fresh mint, improves breath, improves health of gums.</li>
            <li> This is easily the most comfortable dental floss I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda pricey, but you do get what you pay for, which is a really smoothy, easy to use, and good tasting floss.</li>
            <li> The Butterweave by GUM gives you more bang for the buck, and is easy to grip, but it&#x27;s not as comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> and I like this floss because it slides in and out easily.</li>
            <li> It works well and does not break easily and that is saying a lot as I have close contacts.</li>
            <li> took one star off my review because it does break easily.</li>
            <li> Easy on the teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> The string is strong.</li>
            <li> This is, hands down, the best floss on the market.</li>
            <li> Comfortable, easy to use, and easy to slide between teeth.</li>
            <li> A bit too fine.</li>
            <li> Smooth and easy to use, and it indeed will &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Excellent floss for tight contacts and</li>
            <li> It moves very smoothly between my teeth and rarely breaks.</li>
            <li> Smooth</li>
            <li> A great value overall.</li>
            <li> I use different varieties of glide floss, and they all work great.  </li>
            <li> Too smooth and slippery.</li>
            <li> This is the best....but make it available in 100m spools and give us a price break please.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh taste this mint floss leaves in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Glide slides ever so smoothly.  </li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t happen with the unflavored, which is totally bizarre.</li>
            <li> However, it is still very effective and the twin pack lasts quite a while in my family (even with twice daily usage).</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t figure out how something so smooth can clean so well, but it does.</li>
            <li> Original review</li>
            <li> Note that these are mint flavored, not the original Glide floss.  </li>
            <li> Also, the mint flavored floss is wider than the original Glide floss.</li>
            <li> but I was looking for the original.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I missed the Mint Flavor when using the Original.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best, so treat yourself to this small luxury.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are too close together and this floss easily slides in between them and rarely breaks.</li>
            <li> Since I brush 5 times a day, I know that floss is still needed to truly clean teeth.</li>
            <li> It appears to clean between my teeth</li>
            <li> It stays true to it&#x27;s name and glides right in between teeth with no problem whatsoever!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fray and goes in between teeth quickly.</li>
            <li> For a while when using some other popular brands, I started to get gum gaps between my front teeth that didn&#x27;t seem to be getting any better.</li>
            <li> Easier and more comfortable to use compared to the original (white colored case), but</li>
            <li> This floss will gently wear through and break, allowing easy removal in that area, without getting stuck.</li>
            <li> This wideband floss is excellent for anyone with tightly spaced teeth in which using the standard floss (i.e. cheap floss or the floss you get from your dentist) gets caught between your teeth and requires removal with scissors and tweezers.  </li>
            <li> I love minty things, things that clean deep, and of course things that are totally cool.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shred when I use it, and the minty fresh flavor keeps my mouth and breath fresh.  </li>
            <li> In fact, for me, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Someone literally told me that I have Anne Hathaway&#x27;s smile, hair, and charm.</li>
            <li> Does it make flossing far more pleasurable?</li>
            <li> IT TASTES FRESH AND FEELS LIKE</li>
            <li> Try the cheaper brands available at you local Target or other store; chances are that purchase will be much better than paying for this &amp;#34;brand name,&amp;#34; which used to be good.</li>
            <li> Excellent flossing tape - wide - flat!  </li>
            <li> Love the way that I can use two strands of this floss to clean some of the big gaps between my teeth.</li>
            <li> B00REYGYBE Glide Original Dental Floss]] that I&#x27;ve purchased before; therefore I don&#x27;t need as much wrapped around my fingers because it almost self-adheres to itself.</li>
            <li> (no fraying or breaking right away like others we have tried)</li>
            <li> Not all flosses seem to get my teeth clean very well, and the dental hygienists let me know when that happens.</li>
            <li> This floss is great for people like myself, who have very little space between their teeth.</li>
            <li> My family use this kind of floss for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It shreds and breaks far too easily.</li>
            <li> The regular floss in the white container is great, but this &amp;#34;deep clean&amp;#34; stuff breaks virtually every time I use</li>
            <li> First try and Broke.</li>
            <li> I have used Oral-B Glide dental floss for years and first time ordered online.</li>
            <li> I have been using this exact product for years.</li>
            <li> THE FIRST TIME I USED IT</li>
            <li> I actually like it better now.</li>
            <li> I have stuck with it ever since my first order arrived.</li>
            <li> Any other kind of floss that isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;tape&amp;#34; irritates my teeth.</li>
            <li> One of the many perfect examples of the products that are pushed on us in America that are inferior in quality, and therefore remind us of a the &amp;#34;corporate culture&amp;#34; we live in, where little but &amp;#34;profits&amp;#34; mean anything.</li>
            <li> If you have very sensitive gums this may be more comfortable that other floss.</li>
            <li> The Original Floss (white container) is a sturdy and more traditional floss material.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have problems with the floss breaking or shredding, seems to work very well.  </li>
            <li> VERY minty, which I like.  </li>
            <li> It really does &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My teeth are very close together</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve used Glide, it&#x27;s much easier to floss, and Glide slides in-and-out without getting stuck between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> It really does glide between my teeth.</li>
            <li> so much easier then standing in the store searching the multitude of offerings for just the one I want.</li>
            <li> The stuff works, but expect it to cost 2-3 times as much because of the amount you have to use.</li>
            <li> This floss is coated in something that makes your gums tingle and really gives a deep clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s significantly cheaper to purchase these from Amazon than at your local drugstore.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The white containers are Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Original Floss.  </li>
            <li> For several years, I used the Original Glide, as recommended by my Dentist.</li>
            <li> BETTER THAN ANY OTHER FLOSS I&#x27;VE EVER</li>
            <li> This Deep Clean (this ribbon) floss also results in a lot of breakage for me.  </li>
            <li> But after my previous favorite floss was discontinued, I switched to this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It shreds quite easily in comparison to other products.</li>
            <li> Floss can be quite expensive so this pack was a great deal.</li>
            <li> For me, Glide with Mint Flavor is complete, and the price on Amazon for a Twin Pack is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get stuck between closely-spaced teeth like your normal dental floss.  </li>
            <li> it worth the extra money?</li>
            <li> The only thing is that they all tend to shred when trying to cut off a piece, but it&#x27;s a minor inconvenience to put up with for the sake of maintaining healthy gums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really going to get all excited about floss, but it is something I use every day.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Other flosses are too thick for me, but Glide is great.</li>
            <li> Only floss I can use-still my favorite -all other floss I give away.</li>
            <li> I probably pull 30-40% less of this than the cheap floss, because it does not slip.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for tight teeth.</li>
            <li> The grey containers are Oral-B Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You may not have this problem, but if you use Glide specifically because your teeth are tight, stick to the regular kind in the white packaging.</li>
            <li> yet it feels soft on gums and fingers.</li>
            <li> I think that it is old product.</li>
            <li> so Glide is really the only floss I can use.</li>
            <li> This Oral-B glide stuff holds together without a problem and it gentle enough on my gums for my liking.</li>
            <li> I know this is just floss, but I have to say as far as floss goes, this is the bee&#x27;s knees.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are very close together, and I always had a problem with regular dental floss, getting caught between my teeth.</li>
            <li> Now, I feel like Flossing is complete, with a refreshed feeling after using the Mint Flavor.</li>
            <li> , I have sensitive gums, and Glide doesn&#x27;t irritate them, or make them bleed.</li>
            <li> I had to see for myself and WOW was</li>
            <li> Though more expensive than standard floss I would recommend it for cleaning ones teeth, this actually works better for me than using a waterpik.</li>
            <li> I am still searching for a high enough quality floss that will not break in between my teeth.</li>
            <li> As a cheapskate, I was apprehensive about the price and the fact you get less on a roll than most other flosses.</li>
            <li> Even doing this, it is obvious to me, a person who cares a lot about my teeth, this is substandard floss, &amp;#34;tweaked&amp;#34; to the very minimum size and tensile strength to maximize corporate profits.</li>
            <li> Resists breaking better than other kinds, and I have tight teeth, but it can slide between them.</li>
            <li> Go with Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Original Floss: much stronger and almost as thin.</li>
            <li> I find a lot of other floss brands tend to fray while I use them, or are too fine and feel almost sharp.</li>
            <li> do not have those experiences with this floss; it is not &#x27;slippery&#x27; like some of the tape types, it is able to get into those hard-to-reach areas, it seems to be tough</li>
            <li> With other floss, I usually pull out a good 15 inches of floss and wrap it around my fingers many times because with the thin floss, it starts to slip when it gets wet.</li>
            <li> Flavor is nice but irrelevant to me.</li>
            <li> If you have really tight spaces between your teeth like I do , this is the only floss that really works without shredding and getting caught.</li>
            <li> The Deep Clean floss is where the floss is like a thin ribbon of material.  </li>
            <li> It also feels better on the space between your gums, whereas cheap, thin floss might feel like it&#x27;s cutting into your gums at times.</li>
            <li> This really works well if you have small spaces in between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Because the floss is so thick it actually gets more stuff out between your teeth with less effort and less floss.  </li>
            <li> but they are, indeed, grey.  </li>
            <li> 80 Meters goes a long ways</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the gray, blue and green cases and they all seem to work the same for me.  </li>
            <li> with my crazy teeth so close to each other, this is the only floss that feels comfortable.</li>
            <li> This is very thin and easy to get between narrow spaces.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with it is that it&#x27;s sometimes hard to grip, especially with moisture involved (saliva, or wet hands).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thin that it always snaps before I floss all teeth, so I have to use twice as much.</li>
            <li> Just be careful to wash your hands after, so that you aren&#x27;t making your eyes water etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s floss, not much else to say about it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not uncommon for me to need to use three times as much because it&#x27;s always breaking while I use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN THROUGH A WIDE VARIETY OF BRANDS.</li>
            <li> It seems thicker and smoother than other flosses.  </li>
            <li> when you touch other parts of your face.</li>
            <li> Glide works well, and I won&#x27;t use any other floss.</li>
            <li> By using other floss, my gums were sore.</li>
            <li> I prefer Glide to other brands I used to buy.</li>
            <li> well (removes plaque and other debris between teeth) without causing pain or discomfort.</li>
            <li> I do not prefer to use other types of floss in the morning because they leave my gums in discomfort for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> The floss is big and thick, unlike the cheaper waxy string the grocery store tries to unload on you.  </li>
            <li> improvement-- &amp; now my gums are back to how they used to be, as it&#x27;s thin enough to &#x27;glide&#x27; along the teeth &amp; not cause gum damage.</li>
            <li> I have an area that is sharp and which always shreds conventional floss in a way that causes it to get stuck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since discovered you&#x27;ll probably use a lot less of this than other floss.</li>
            <li> ; THAT ARE HARD TO FLOSS WITH REGULAR WAXED FLOSS.</li>
            <li> I use a few strands each time I floss for the upper and bottom teeth, and try to floss at least twice a day.</li>
            <li> My teeth are tightly spaced and this works well for me.</li>
            <li> We all know what happens when you pull too little floss and try and floss with it.</li>
            <li> but stopped using the retainer a couple decades ago, and now there are a few really tight places that make flossing a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The stuff in the green packaging breaks often for me too.</li>
            <li> Refill my supply every few months...</li>
            <li> I WAS USING THE GREEN ONE</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regular floss often (usually) frays and breaks in those tight areas, and some of the floss tapes are so slick that they slip out of my fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth are very tight together</li>
            <li> Been buying Glide products since it first came out and haven&#x27;t been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Have a hard time keeping it wrapped around my fingers and doesn&#x27;t feel like it cleans as well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pull too hard though or you&#x27;ll rip it apart.</li>
            <li> It would be hard for me to use another brand.</li>
            <li> Awful, cheap floss.</li>
            <li> At times these very thin threads get trapped in your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I always thought all floss was the same (how complicated could it be?)-- though after trying a few that got horribly stuck between my teeth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so thin that it feels like it&#x27;s cutting your fingers and gums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> you from cutting into your gums.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this in the past but this batch was HORRIBLE...</li>
            <li> but hate when floss gets stuck between my teeth.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is, hands down, the best floss on the market. Not only that, but it&#x27;s significantly cheaper to purchase these from Amazon than at your local drugstore. It&#x27;s a no brainer... buy it.</li>
            <li> Well I have used this Oral B Glide for many years.  The best thing about it is the softness which&lt;br /&gt;assists you from cutting into your gums.  BUT Glide always pulls apart as the threads pull from the&lt;br /&gt;floss.  At times these very thin threads get trapped in your teeth.  I am guessing that I have swallowed&lt;br /&gt;hundreds of threads over the years.  I am looking for an alternative.  Any ideas?</li>
            <li> **** Updated 07/13/17 ****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back for more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** Original review ****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had braces years ago and things are still fairly well lined up... but stopped using the retainer a couple decades ago, and now there are a few really tight places that make flossing a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regular floss often (usually) frays and breaks in those tight areas, and some of the floss tapes are so slick that they slip out of my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have those experiences with this floss; it is not &#x27;slippery&#x27; like some of the tape types, it is able to get into those hard-to-reach areas, it seems to be tough (no fraying or breaking right away like others we have tried) yet it feels soft on gums and fingers. The light minty taste is nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a similar need, we definitely recommend that you give this floss a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thin that it always snaps before I floss all teeth, so I have to use twice as much. Sometimes the 2nd length snaps before I&#x27;m done. Go with Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Original Floss: much stronger and almost as thin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have problems with the floss breaking or shredding, seems to work very well.  Good price.  VERY minty, which I like.  Good product.</li>
            <li> clean tooth is healthy for us all!</li>
            <li> Good floss.  Smooth so it doesn&#x27;t shred and makes flossing a lot easier.</li>
            <li> My family use this kind of floss for a long time.  Great product! Will keep buying these.</li>
            <li> Broke.  First try and Broke. Pulled more out and again it Broke.</li>
            <li> Pros:  Excellent floss for tight contacts and packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  None</li>
            <li> Best tooth floss in the world. Does not break!</li>
            <li> Excellent flossing tape - wide - flat!  Good price through Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save Program.</li>
            <li> My fav floss, always good..</li>
            <li> I love Glide floss!  What more can I say?  It doesn&#x27;t shred when I use it, and the minty fresh flavor keeps my mouth and breath fresh.  Would highly recommend this to folks who don&#x27;t enjoy flossing - Glide will change your mind!!!</li>
            <li> best floss everrr.  My boyfriend won&#x27;t use anything else</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda pricey, but you do get what you pay for, which is a really smoothy, easy to use, and good tasting floss. Doesn&#x27;t fray and goes in between teeth quickly. The only problem I have with it is that it&#x27;s sometimes hard to grip, especially with moisture involved (saliva, or wet hands). The Butterweave by GUM gives you more bang for the buck, and is easy to grip, but it&#x27;s not as comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this in the past but this batch was HORRIBLE... It breaks and you have to use more than you should to get the job done. I think that it is old product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite floss. And its very cheap on amazon too!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t break, shred, or get caught like a lot of floss does.</li>
            <li> Best floss ever. I love the tape-like floss that prevents it from being stringy. This is a great deal! Saw a 2-pack like this at Target today for $5.49. So you can purchase it here, knowing you&#x27;re getting the best price for the best floss.</li>
            <li> My dentist hands this out as samples after a cleaning. It shreds and breaks far too easily. If you have very sensitive gums this may be more comfortable that other floss.</li>
            <li> My teeth are very tight together so Glide is really the only floss I can use. The regular floss in the white container is great, but this &amp;#34;deep clean&amp;#34; stuff breaks virtually every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may not have this problem, but if you use Glide specifically because your teeth are tight, stick to the regular kind in the white packaging. The stuff in the green packaging breaks often for me too.</li>
            <li> Love it. The best floss I have used.</li>
            <li> Note that these are mint flavored, not the original Glide floss.  Also, the mint flavored floss is wider than the original Glide floss.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done.  My teeth are tightly spaced and this works well for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really going to get all excited about floss, but it is something I use every day. I find a lot of other floss brands tend to fray while I use them, or are too fine and feel almost sharp. This Oral-B glide stuff holds together without a problem and it gentle enough on my gums for my liking.</li>
            <li> I know this is just floss, but I have to say as far as floss goes, this is the bee&#x27;s knees.  The floss is big and thick, unlike the cheaper waxy string the grocery store tries to unload on you.  There&#x27;s just a hint of mint and not overpowering.  It&#x27;s not waxy and doesn&#x27;t get caught or unravel between the teeth.  It&#x27;s one solid strand.  If you plan to floss your pearly whites for the rest of your life, like we are, these are a good investment to your health.</li>
            <li> This is the best dental floss I&#x27;ve used. My teeth are too close together and this floss easily slides in between them and rarely breaks.</li>
            <li> My favorite floss.  Has a tendency to break somewhat easily, but so do most.</li>
            <li> Not all flosses seem to get my teeth clean very well, and the dental hygienists let me know when that happens. But after my previous favorite floss was discontinued, I switched to this. Hygienist says it&#x27;s doing a good job; can&#x27;t ask for better than that.</li>
            <li> I have used Oral-B Glide dental floss for years and first time ordered online. When delivered the packaging was the same as shown online and in tact. I will order in the future.</li>
            <li> I am still searching for a high enough quality floss that will not break in between my teeth.</li>
            <li> Love the way that I can use two strands of this floss to clean some of the big gaps between my teeth. I also like the way that it responds to some irregularities. I have an area that is sharp and which always shreds conventional floss in a way that causes it to get stuck. This floss will gently wear through and break, allowing easy removal in that area, without getting stuck. Can&#x27;t figure out how something so smooth can clean so well, but it does.</li>
            <li> The only dental floss I will use.</li>
            <li> Any other kind of floss that isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;tape&amp;#34; irritates my teeth. This is very thin and easy to get between narrow spaces.</li>
            <li> Best floss I&#x27;ve tried, glides easily and nice and wide to get the gunk out.  Remember to floss twice a day :)</li>
            <li> A bit too fine. Not what my dentist has recommended. Doesn&#x27;t leave a nice cool minty taste in my mouth. Cleans okay.</li>
            <li> A nice product for flossing. The string is strong.</li>
            <li> I was originally trying to find the Glide that was in the white container that I think works the best out of the Glide lineup.  I thought the picture was showing white containers but they are, indeed, grey.  At the time that I ordered I did not appreciate the difference in the names of their flosses.  Here is the difference:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The white containers are Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Original Floss.  The grey containers are Oral-B Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss.  The Original Floss (white container) is a sturdy and more traditional floss material.  It seems thicker and smoother than other flosses.  The Deep Clean floss is where the floss is like a thin ribbon of material.  Some people may prefer this type of floss but I was looking for the original.  This Deep Clean (this ribbon) floss also results in a lot of breakage for me.  I find that maybe 1/3 of all flossings will have a breakage and require me to get another string from the container to finish up.</li>
            <li> I think Glide makes the best floss for those that have crowded teeth. It stays true to it&#x27;s name and glides right in between teeth with no problem whatsoever!</li>
            <li> I like this dental floss. It&#x27;s more like a ribbon going between your teeth instead of a string. Feels much better and I have better control of it too. Plus the cool mint is a nice touch. I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> Great price. I think this is the best floss of the ones that Glide makes.</li>
            <li> As a cheapskate, I was apprehensive about the price and the fact you get less on a roll than most other flosses. I&#x27;ve since discovered you&#x27;ll probably use a lot less of this than other floss. With other floss, I usually pull out a good 15 inches of floss and wrap it around my fingers many times because with the thin floss, it starts to slip when it gets wet. We all know what happens when you pull too little floss and try and floss with it. It just slips off your fingers. I probably pull 30-40% less of this than the cheap floss, because it does not slip. One loop around the finger is all it takes. This might make you think it won&#x27;t be slippery enough to go between your teeth. It slips between teeth very easily, and does a better job cleaning. It also feels better on the space between your gums, whereas cheap, thin floss might feel like it&#x27;s cutting into your gums at times. Like mustard, this is one product it pays to buy the slightly more expensive product.</li>
            <li> I am a Glide only person. If you have really tight spaces between your teeth like I do , this is the only floss that really works without shredding and getting caught. I have been using this exact product for years.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get stuck between closely-spaced teeth like your normal dental floss.  Mint taste is refreshing, but not overpowering.  A great value overall.</li>
            <li> This is the best floss I&#x27;ve tried. It really does &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34;. It moves very smoothly between my teeth and rarely breaks. It&#x27;s not so thin that it feels like it&#x27;s cutting your fingers and gums.</li>
            <li> This is OK floss.  It shreds quite easily in comparison to other products.</li>
            <li> My teeth are very close together and I like this floss because it slides in and out easily. It does not shred or tear. G</li>
            <li> This floss is coated in something that makes your gums tingle and really gives a deep clean feeling.  Just be careful to wash your hands after, so that you aren&#x27;t making your eyes water etc. when you touch other parts of your face.</li>
            <li> This floss is great for people like myself, who have very little space between their teeth. It is one of the only brands that doesn&#x27;t shred while I&#x27;m using it. My only gripe is the mint flavor, as I prefer floss without the additives. However, it is still very effective and the twin pack lasts quite a while in my family (even with twice daily usage).</li>
            <li> Floss can be quite expensive so this pack was a great deal. It works well and does not break easily and that is saying a lot as I have close contacts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s floss, not much else to say about it. 80 Meters goes a long ways</li>
            <li> Who needs to leave the Island anymore? Not us.....</li>
            <li> Good product--I find it a lot easier to force myself to floss when using the Glide floss.</li>
            <li> For several years, I used the Original Glide, as recommended by my Dentist. My teeth are very close together, and I always had a problem with regular dental floss, getting caught between my teeth. Since I&#x27;ve used Glide, it&#x27;s much easier to floss, and Glide slides in-and-out without getting stuck between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I missed the Mint Flavor when using the Original. Now, I feel like Flossing is complete, with a refreshed feeling after using the Mint Flavor. Glide works well, and I won&#x27;t use any other floss. I use a few strands each time I floss for the upper and bottom teeth, and try to floss at least twice a day. Sometimes, 3 times a day to also prevent decay, and fight cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I have sensitive gums, and Glide doesn&#x27;t irritate them, or make them bleed. By using other floss, my gums were sore. For me, Glide with Mint Flavor is complete, and the price on Amazon for a Twin Pack is reasonable. In fact, for me, it&#x27;s worth every penny. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I was skeptical. I love minty things, things that clean deep, and of course things that are totally cool. But all these things in one? Really? I had to see for myself and WOW was I blown away! My teeth are the talk of the town. Someone literally told me that I have Anne Hathaway&#x27;s smile, hair, and charm. I&#x27;m now flossing 4 times per day, 5 times if that day includes poppy seed battered corn on the cob.    As if one pack of floss wasn&#x27;t enough to change the world, Oral-B gives you a twin pack! They are basically spiking the football at this point.    Between two teeth,    Alex</li>
            <li> An excellently designed product. I actually look forward to flossing because of this! Cleans great, very gentle on gums, ribbon-like instead of stringy, burst of fresh mint, improves breath, improves health of gums.</li>
            <li> I LOVED THIS FLOSS THE FIRST TIME I USED IT AND I WILL BUY IT AGAIN  - VERY GOOD FOR &amp;#34;TIGHT CONTACTS&amp;#34; THAT ARE HARD TO FLOSS WITH REGULAR WAXED FLOSS.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best dental floss I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Is it more expensive? Definitely. Does it make flossing far more pleasurable? You bet.&lt;br /&gt;Is it worth the extra money? Only you can ascertain that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took one star off my review because it does break easily.</li>
            <li> More like tape. It really does glide between my teeth. It&#x27;s measured in meters, not yards. Flavor is nice but irrelevant to me.</li>
            <li> This wideband floss is excellent for anyone with tightly spaced teeth in which using the standard floss (i.e. cheap floss or the floss you get from your dentist) gets caught between your teeth and requires removal with scissors and tweezers.  Because the floss is so thick it actually gets more stuff out between your teeth with less effort and less floss.  Though more expensive than standard floss I would recommend it for cleaning ones teeth, this actually works better for me than using a waterpik.</li>
            <li> This really works well if you have small spaces in between your teeth.  Other flosses are too thick for me, but Glide is great.</li>
            <li> I use different varieties of glide floss, and they all work great.  Since I brush 5 times a day, I know that floss is still needed to truly clean teeth.</li>
            <li> Too smooth and slippery. Have a hard time keeping it wrapped around my fingers and doesn&#x27;t feel like it cleans as well.</li>
            <li> Great when it works, but breaks too easily.</li>
            <li> I like glide floss the best</li>
            <li> This is the best floss i have ever used. I will never buy another.</li>
            <li> I always thought all floss was the same (how complicated could it be?)-- though after trying a few that got horribly stuck between my teeth I realize that&#x27;s not the case. For a while when using some other popular brands, I started to get gum gaps between my front teeth that didn&#x27;t seem to be getting any better. When I mentioned it to my hygienist, she suggested using Glide floss, &amp; within a week there was noticeable improvement-- &amp; now my gums are back to how they used to be, as it&#x27;s thin enough to &#x27;glide&#x27; along the teeth &amp; not cause gum damage. I&#x27;ve tried the gray, blue and green cases and they all seem to work the same for me.  The only thing is that they all tend to shred when trying to cut off a piece, but it&#x27;s a minor inconvenience to put up with for the sake of maintaining healthy gums.</li>
            <li> Great! Love this floss. Smooth and easy to use, and it indeed will &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34;. Don&#x27;t pull too hard though or you&#x27;ll rip it apart.</li>
            <li> This is the best....but make it available in 100m spools and give us a price break please.</li>
            <li> The only dental floss I will use. I love to floss but hate when floss gets stuck between my teeth. This won&#x27;t shred or fall apart. Great minty flavor, too. Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh taste this mint floss leaves in my mouth. I have had no problem with it shredding. Perhaps that is because all my teeth are capped? This has more wax on it than the [[ASIN:B00REYGYBE Glide Original Dental Floss]] that I&#x27;ve purchased before; therefore I don&#x27;t need as much wrapped around my fingers because it almost self-adheres to itself. I prefer Glide to other brands I used to buy. Been buying Glide products since it first came out and haven&#x27;t been disappointed. Even my Dentist and Hygienist use Glide.</li>
            <li> I love it and i always buying it</li>
            <li> Excellent. The best dental floss.</li>
            <li> Easier and more comfortable to use compared to the original (white colored case), but I couldn&#x27;t feel anything different on &amp;#34;deep clean&amp;#34; aspect.</li>
            <li> Easy on the teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Best floss on the market! Does not tear for me or get stuck between my teeth like others.</li>
            <li> No fishing wire here.  Glide slides ever so smoothly.  It&#x27;s the best, so treat yourself to this small luxury.  You deserve it!</li>
            <li> I used to always use Reach floss but I couldn&#x27;t get it anymore on my subscribe service so I decided to try this since it was. I actually like it better now. Doesn&#x27;t cut your gums and makes flossing a breeze. I have stuck with it ever since my first order arrived.</li>
            <li> with my crazy teeth so close to each other, this is the only floss that feels comfortable. I love it. Can&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> My favorite floss.  Resists breaking better than other kinds, and I have tight teeth, but it can slide between them.</li>
            <li> Refill my supply every few months... so much easier then standing in the store searching the multitude of offerings for just the one I want. Glide is my favorite floss.</li>
            <li> Glide floss is generally great. Comfortable, easy to use, and easy to slide between teeth. For some reason though, the mint flavor version breaks constantly. It&#x27;s not uncommon for me to need to use three times as much because it&#x27;s always breaking while I use it. This didn&#x27;t happen with the unflavored, which is totally bizarre. But Amazon dropped the unflavored from the Subscribe and Save program so now you can only get mint. The stuff works, but expect it to cost 2-3 times as much because of the amount you have to use.</li>
            <li> Awful, cheap floss. Breaks, again and again, after doing only two or three teeth. My dental hygienist encouraged me to move to different points of the floss, so that the floss would not break. Even doing this, it is obvious to me, a person who cares a lot about my teeth, this is substandard floss, &amp;#34;tweaked&amp;#34; to the very minimum size and tensile strength to maximize corporate profits. One of the many perfect examples of the products that are pushed on us in America that are inferior in quality, and therefore remind us of a the &amp;#34;corporate culture&amp;#34; we live in, where little but &amp;#34;profits&amp;#34; mean anything. Try the cheaper brands available at you local Target or other store; chances are that purchase will be much better than paying for this &amp;#34;brand name,&amp;#34; which used to be good.</li>
            <li> This is easily the most comfortable dental floss I have ever used. It appears to clean between my teeth well (removes plaque and other debris between teeth) without causing pain or discomfort. I do not prefer to use other types of floss in the morning because they leave my gums in discomfort for the rest of the day. However, this floss is effective without the irritation, so I am satisfied no matter what time of day I use it. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> excellent product.very effective.</li>
            <li> Only floss I can use-still my favorite -all other floss I give away.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery. Good product.</li>
            <li> best floss, truly glides</li>
            <li> Fantastic for tight teeth.</li>
            <li> This slides very easily as suggested in the product description.  However I did not sense its minty taste as advertised.</li>
            <li> BETTER THAN ANY OTHER FLOSS I&#x27;VE EVER USED. I&#x27;VE BEEN THROUGH A WIDE VARIETY OF BRANDS. I WAS USING THE GREEN ONE AND I DIDN&#x27;T REALIZE IT COULD GET BETTER. IT TASTES FRESH AND FEELS LIKE ITS GETTIN IN THERE. GOOD STUFF.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s floss, this brand just seems smoother to me. It would be hard for me to use another brand.</li>
