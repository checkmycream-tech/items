            <li>I love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>nicely hydrating.</li>
            <li>and I like how it feels and the nice scent</li>
            <li>They loved, mostly because it&#x27;s organic (that&#x27;s all we use)</li>
            <li>Quick shipping from a great dealer.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend!</li>
            <li>It is SO NICE to your skin, and the scent is delightful - fresh and REAL!</li>
            <li>I love the feel and its not too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the way it feels.</li>
            <li>and I really love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I make most of my products, but I have been struggling with a face moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out.  </li>
            <li>Love that it is organic.</li>
            <li>Smell is not my favorite, but when I ran out and switched to a backup product, I realized how much better this one is.</li>
            <li>Interesting cream.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and feel.</li>
            <li>but I am not running out and buying 10 more.  </li>
            <li>During winter my skin becoes a lil more testy</li>
            <li>Great for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It does however, tighten the skin and help with fine lines.</li>
            <li>It also is gentle and leaves a nice non-greasy/non-shiny finish on my face.  </li>
            <li>I would think that the company would offer a more &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; size, which I would certainly buy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still looking for that perfect moisturizer, since I don&#x27;t use the one I used to use, due to the high score it got.</li>
            <li>It goes on so  smoothly and my skin absorbs it right up.</li>
            <li>Super moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling on my face for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>it is said our skin just expresses what goes on internally, so drinking more water as well!</li>
            <li>Smells freshly tantalizing.</li>
            <li>So far I have enjoyed this moisturizer and the Juice Organics brand.  </li>
            <li>and she has sensitive skin, this seems to be the right balance, really clean scent, light.</li>
            <li>Initially found this at TJ Maxx, loved it so much I am buying from Amazon, layer it on top of other moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty tall order</li>
            <li>Surely if you add a serum before it will be enough hydration for all day in drier climates.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got low scores on the EWG Skin Deep website, which is really good.</li>
            <li>But I am also starting to get wrinkles, fine lines with telltales signs of too much sun in my youth.  </li>
            <li>No strong smell, easy to apply, my face feels smooth.  </li>
            <li>The lotion doesn&#x27;t really do much for me.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for carrying products like this.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer works very well and keeps my face moisturized throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>Did not feel as if it soaked into my skin and felt really sticky to the touch.</li>
            <li>After only one day - paired with Pure Seafoam Cleanser - my skin is back to normal (even better than normal)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use anything that scores high on EWG.</li>
            <li>I have definitely noticed that my skin looks healthier and fresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite thick, but nicely penetrates skin.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had it long, and usually prefer lotions, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and the works well for me.</li>
            <li>so incredibly soft, pores are shrinking.  </li>
            <li>Natural, organic, no mineral oil.  </li>
            <li>So far I like it.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see any results and it leaves my skin pretty dry.</li>
            <li>finally found my new moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars because it&#x27;s not enough moisture for my skin in the climate I live in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not horrible, but not great.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for those with dry skin.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the fact that this isn&#x27;t as nearly as chemically as previous moisturizers I have used.</li>
            <li>And it has a very faint pleasant fragrance of juice.</li>
            <li>Still use other more targeted treatment products, but this moisturizes well - a little goes a long way.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really appreciate the fact that this isn&#x27;t as nearly as chemically as previous moisturizers I have used. It&#x27;s been about 3-4 weeks since I started using this product and I do notice that my face is smoother. Unfortunately I have also noticed that my face works overtime to produce even more oil. Not giving up on it yet, I will try the extreme minimal amount and see if that helps.</li>
            <li> Initially found this at TJ Maxx, loved it so much I am buying from Amazon, layer it on top of other moisturizer.  Works great.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and the works well for me. Moisturizes well good product.</li>
            <li> impressed. nicely hydrating. love that this is in a tube not a pot, perfect in travel cosmetic kit. finally found my new moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! It goes on so  smoothly and my skin absorbs it right up. I have definitely noticed that my skin looks healthier and fresh.</li>
            <li> I have used Pompeptide before and I like how it feels and the nice scent, I will continue to use this one it has all the essential ingredients for your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars because it&#x27;s not enough moisture for my skin in the climate I live in. When I&#x27;m in the tropics, it&#x27;s great. But here in Colorado, it&#x27;s not enough moisture. It does however, tighten the skin and help with fine lines. It&#x27;s got low scores on the EWG Skin Deep website, which is really good. I believe it scored a 1, but I&#x27;m not positive. This is why I tried it. I don&#x27;t use anything that scores high on EWG. I&#x27;m still looking for that perfect moisturizer, since I don&#x27;t use the one I used to use, due to the high score it got.</li>
            <li> and she has sensitive skin, this seems to be the right balance, really clean scent, light. Would definitely not hesitate to recommend.</li>
            <li> Recently bought this moisturizer when  I was having allergic reactions to a cleanser and my skin started getting really red, itchy, and started peeling.  After only one day - paired with Pure Seafoam Cleanser - my skin is back to normal (even better than normal) so incredibly soft, pores are shrinking.  It smells just like juice!  I love the feel and its not too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying this again!</li>
            <li> The lotion doesn&#x27;t really do much for me. It&#x27;s not horrible, but not great. Don&#x27;t see any results and it leaves my skin pretty dry.</li>
            <li> Always like to find an organic moisturizer with peptides! Still use other more targeted treatment products, but this moisturizes well - a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Smells freshly tantalizing. Love the way it feels. Quick shipping from a great dealer. Highly recommend for those with dry skin. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is it for me!  All those years trying this and that and never feeling anything was an &amp;#34;oh joy!&amp;#34; until I found this.  Natural, organic, no mineral oil.  My skins drinks this in, but for me it is not oily.  Thanks Amazon for carrying products like this.</li>
            <li> I am now on my second purchase of this and I really love this stuff.  A little goes a long way, even in the dry climate of CO.  I make most of my products, but I have been struggling with a face moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out.  This moisturizer works very well and keeps my face moisturized throughout the day.  I use this after washing my face with Christina Moss Naturals Face Wash, which I also recommend.</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling on my face for the rest of the day. Strongly recommend!</li>
            <li> Really thick and creamy. Did not feel as if it soaked into my skin and felt really sticky to the touch.</li>
            <li> I bought 4, one for each of the ladies in my family. They loved, mostly because it&#x27;s organic (that&#x27;s all we use) and I told them how wonderful it was - I&#x27;ve been using for awhile now.</li>
            <li> Good fragrance. Love that it is organic. Seems to be working well for me.</li>
            <li> This is a very thick, heavy lotion.  I can&#x27;t use it every day, or leave on overnight without fear that it will clog my pores!  I use it as a weekly moisturizer and then wipe off, but I do not use it every day (which is what I was looking for).</li>
            <li> This is my second order of this cream. Good texture, great moisture without being greasy. Smell is not my favorite, but when I ran out and switched to a backup product, I realized how much better this one is.</li>
            <li> Interesting cream.  It&#x27;s quite thick, but nicely penetrates skin.  I&#x27;m concerned about facial cosmetics and their ingredients.  This brand seems conscientious in that regard.  I think the price was fair for this product.  I haven&#x27;t had it long, and usually prefer lotions, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Ughhhhhhhhh need to work on priorities meaning customers  needs I am not happy about my order</li>
            <li> Great for my sensitive skin.  I love the smell and feel.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is perfect for me.  My skin tends to be oily with ocassional hormonal breakouts.  But I am also starting to get wrinkles, fine lines with telltales signs of too much sun in my youth.  So I need something that will moisturize my skin and help prevent wrinkles and work on the ages spots, sun damage without making my skin greasy or making my face breakout.  This is a pretty tall order but I feel like this juice Organics Pompeptide moisturizer fits the bill.  It has quality ingredients  lightens age spots and plumps up and smooths my skin with peptides.  It also is gentle and leaves a nice non-greasy/non-shiny finish on my face.  And it has a very faint pleasant fragrance of juice.</li>
            <li> After almost 60 years of life, I discovered this incredible moisturizer. It is SO NICE to your skin, and the scent is delightful - fresh and REAL! Only problem is that the size is too small. I would think that the company would offer a more &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; size, which I would certainly buy.</li>
            <li> I liek but I am not running out and buying 10 more.  The ingredients are great.  Hydration for my dry skin is mediocre. This would be ideal for spring summer months when there is more humidity in the air.  Another plus is NO parabens, sulfates or made man crap our skin does not need.  During winter my skin becoes a lil more testy and I find redness on nose and cheeks on products I once had no issue with.  TJ Maxx has this same product for only $5.99, which is where I found it.  It has been a week of applying day and night without a serum.  Surely if you add a serum before it will be enough hydration for all day in drier climates.</li>
            <li> So far I have enjoyed this moisturizer and the Juice Organics brand.  I can use this cream and immediately put my makeup on with no problem.  No strong smell, easy to apply, my face feels smooth.  So far I like it.  I still have the occasional breakouts and I wish a product would prevent that, but it is said our skin just expresses what goes on internally, so drinking more water as well!</li>
