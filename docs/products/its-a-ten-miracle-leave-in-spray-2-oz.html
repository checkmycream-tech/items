            <li>but it&#x27;s kind of spendy for me.</li>

            <li>Thank you very process was excellent and</li>
            <li>so it didn&#x27;t leak... very pleased :)</li>
            <li>a very natural look and keeps my hair looking and feeling great!</li>
            <li>This is so far the best leave-in conditioner I have ever used!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take too much and makes your hair incredibly manageable.</li>
            <li>and I got home and my hair was so nice and smelled so lovely..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most amazing product I have found for my hair....and trust me, I have tried tons of products through the years.....</li>
            <li>It has a nice fresh scent and does a good job as a detangler.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice and clean!</li>
            <li>if you haven&#x27;t tried it, it works great- to use when you are using a hot iron</li>
            <li>It is quite pricey, but I love the fact it is a spray.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it was authentic.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>Hair product junkie :)</li>
            <li>xo xo :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it here at this price.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite hair products &amp;</li>
            <li>I love using the leave in product.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light scent and a portable size.</li>
            <li>Make sure you shake it before you use it.  </li>
            <li>I just love this, and its cheaper on the internet then at the hair dressers.  </li>
            <li>Great product and highly recommended by my hair stylist!</li>
            <li>I did have to use a bit more than recommended on the bottle though.</li>
            <li>so normally my hair is in great shape</li>
            <li>I first experienced this product at the salon and loved how soft my hair felt afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week, and I can see an incredible improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li>A easy to use conditioner that you just spay in and brush.  </li>
            <li>Easy buy even though it was listed as a sample and not meant for resale..</li>
            <li>but I prefer product that weighs my hair a bit as it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very soft and smells SOOOO good.</li>
            <li>I always start with a blow out  to smooth hair followed with heat styling  to set curl or straighten with a iron .</li>
            <li>it made my hair smooth and detangled it.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>I also use it on my both of my daughters hair, to fend off tangles making comb outs manageable and tear free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 10 usually smells awesome.</li>
            <li>this is really good for my hair...makes a big difference in the way it looks and feels</li>
            <li>It really did keep the frizzes at bay for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>That true to life \\&quot;Miracle\\&quot; product?</li>
            <li>shipper sent quickly.. packed it well too</li>
            <li>You can control how much you use and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>really well it makes my hair easy to manage and i will purchase it again.</li>
            <li>Pricier than I&#x27;d like, but worth it.</li>
            <li>I have thin curly hair and this product is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>So far it seems ok</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey but to me, well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I love that I can purchase it on Amazon at such a significant savings.</li>
            <li>I can comb right through my hair.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing product if you have long hair and it gets snarly.  </li>
            <li>Considering the length, I didn&#x27;t think I was using very much.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy again, I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>when i first found out about it, it was at a salon.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t buy again and glad I didn&#x27; t purchase a larger bottle.</li>
            <li>Sure it helps a bit with frizz and split ends, but it gets a bit sticky on a second day.</li>
            <li>First time buyer of this product....</li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased and will buy the product again.</li>
            <li>Noticed manageable hair from first use.  </li>
            <li>what would YOU be willing ti pay for a product that does what its supposed to?</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair right before blow drying--it detangles and leaves it super soft.</li>
            <li>I probably use more than most people in a single application (due to my rambunctious hair), so if your hair is more manageable, try less rather than more at first because it may become too conditioned.</li>
            <li>Easy simply and not stick or gooey.  </li>
            <li>the scent is a bit strong when you first spray it, but dissipates after your hair is dry.</li>
            <li>It is very good product but too expensive compared to the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li>This little bottle lasted me about a month, so I will order a larger size, but this one would be great for travel or to keep in your purse or gym bag.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use to much though because it will make your hair greasy.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight and does not make my head feel itchy</li>
            <li>This really helped my hair breakage, caused by over styling.</li>
            <li>and it really defined and softened my curls.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there really is a miracle product for flyaway hairs</li>
            <li>and I have been fast friends for almost a year now.  </li>
            <li>It untangles my hair and that is really saying something.  </li>
            <li>It really helps save my hair from the blow dryer and straightener damage.  </li>
            <li>really recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li>What I received came in a reasonable amount of time, product was not sealed in any way but its not sealed in any way when you buy it at the store.</li>
            <li>This potion really is a miracle.</li>
            <li>My hair is gray and it can get really dried out and kind of frizzy.</li>
            <li>Really did not work any better than other leave in</li>
            <li>Make sure to follow the directions and don&#x27;t over due it</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried alot of diff products on my hair,some are considered pricey others cheap,still most range (to me) about average&amp; really</li>
            <li>I have very fine, long hair that splits easily and often hangs limp after conditining...</li>
            <li>I can see a significant difference, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair flat or greasy</li>
            <li>I have blonde fine Natural curly hair .</li>
            <li>That said, I use less of this product than others, and get better results.</li>
            <li>my hair is vibrant....</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I thought originally this product was also a styling aid, but I find I still need to use mousse to give it some body when I blow dry it.  </li>
            <li>My hairstylist put this on my hair after she cut and colored it the last time and it worked a lot better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The better product from their series was It&#x27;s a 10 miracle leave in potion plus keratin, which works for wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel really soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy</li>
            <li>The product leaves your hair soft, but some what greasy.  </li>
            <li>but personally, the scent is very overpowering for me</li>
            <li>Plus, it makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re sensitive to smells don&#x27;t get this.</li>
            <li>is no small accomplishment when you live in the southern part of the U.S.--humidity capital of America!  </li>
            <li>not sure how it would do with fine hair.)</li>
            <li>If you use the product, you know it works like no other.</li>
            <li>cant say I noticed any major improvements or changes..</li>
            <li>I assumed it would be something I would have to wash out, due to my hair being easily weighed down.</li>
            <li>It returned the shine without looking greasy, made my hair soft, helped some with the flyaways,and overall healthier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll often just shampoo and then use this in place of my regular conditioner and my hair is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Kind of bummed since it is a tad expensive.</li>
            <li>anyways, when i first used it at home, i dried my hair with a blowdryer.</li>
            <li>I like it, but it s a too small bottle; perhaps useful for travel</li>
            <li>It works so well on my fine thin hair.</li>

            <li> This little bottle lasted me about a month, so I will order a larger size, but this one would be great for travel or to keep in your purse or gym bag.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use to much though because it will make your hair greasy.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight and does not make my head feel itchy</li>
            <li> This really helped my hair breakage, caused by over styling.</li>
            <li> and it really defined and softened my curls.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there really is a miracle product for flyaway hairs</li>
            <li> and I have been fast friends for almost a year now.  </li>
            <li> It untangles my hair and that is really saying something.  </li>
            <li> It really helps save my hair from the blow dryer and straightener damage.  </li>
            <li> really recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> What I received came in a reasonable amount of time, product was not sealed in any way but its not sealed in any way when you buy it at the store.</li>
            <li> This potion really is a miracle.</li>
            <li> My hair is gray and it can get really dried out and kind of frizzy.</li>
            <li> Really did not work any better than other leave in</li>
            <li> Make sure to follow the directions and don&#x27;t over due it</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried alot of diff products on my hair,some are considered pricey others cheap,still most range (to me) about average&amp; really</li>
            <li> I have very fine, long hair that splits easily and often hangs limp after conditining...</li>
            <li> I can see a significant difference, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair flat or greasy</li>
            <li> I have blonde fine Natural curly hair .</li>
            <li> That said, I use less of this product than others, and get better results.</li>
            <li> my hair is vibrant....</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I thought originally this product was also a styling aid, but I find I still need to use mousse to give it some body when I blow dry it.  </li>
            <li> My hairstylist put this on my hair after she cut and colored it the last time and it worked a lot better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The better product from their series was It&#x27;s a 10 miracle leave in potion plus keratin, which works for wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel really soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy</li>
            <li> The product leaves your hair soft, but some what greasy.  </li>
            <li> but personally, the scent is very overpowering for me</li>
            <li> Plus, it makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re sensitive to smells don&#x27;t get this.</li>
            <li> is no small accomplishment when you live in the southern part of the U.S.--humidity capital of America!  </li>
            <li> not sure how it would do with fine hair.)</li>
            <li> If you use the product, you know it works like no other.</li>
            <li> cant say I noticed any major improvements or changes..</li>
            <li> I assumed it would be something I would have to wash out, due to my hair being easily weighed down.</li>
            <li> It returned the shine without looking greasy, made my hair soft, helped some with the flyaways,and overall healthier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll often just shampoo and then use this in place of my regular conditioner and my hair is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Kind of bummed since it is a tad expensive.</li>
            <li> anyways, when i first used it at home, i dried my hair with a blowdryer.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it s a too small bottle; perhaps useful for travel</li>
            <li> It works so well on my fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair soft and frizzless and actually cuts down on drying time.</li>
            <li> Worked wonders on my hair after washing it leaves a shine and after blow drying and flat iron</li>
            <li> This one is only 2 oz which is not very large</li>
            <li> The smell almost overpowers you and annoys you all day long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair out long and</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair manageable and shiny, especially if I put it on while my hair is wet and then dry it with a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff enough to try some of the other Miracle products.</li>
            <li> It is infinitely easier to pack to bring places, and works so well that I put it in my hair when wet, blow dry, and then flat iron, and there are no bumps/tangles or any frizz.</li>
            <li> i needed something for my hair because it was stringy and dry.</li>
            <li> I have to blow dry my hair when I use this stuff otherwise my hair looks greasy.</li>
            <li> then, i decided to put it in and let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> In allows my hair to dry with a silky finish.  </li>
            <li> Then I brush and either straighten or let air dry.</li>
            <li> Or you will only get half way through the bottle.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t totally blow my mind, worked just the same as other leave in conditioners I&#x27;ve used but nothing bad to say though! :)</li>
            <li> I has got my hair dyed, so i could not really tell if it worked or not.</li>
            <li> Just spray and comb through your wet hair without snags.  </li>
            <li> 2 years, don&#x27;t need, want or even try any other product.</li>
            <li> i have used other products that have said helps control frizz on the cover, but has just made my hair greasy, unlike this product.</li>
            <li> I did find that spraying it as the directions say left my bathroom floor slick.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll prob see me on reviews of other products.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricy, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was shocked how light weight this product was.</li>
            <li> I spray this product a few times on my wet hair each time I get out of the shower, and the comb just glides through.</li>
            <li> (I have thick hair that is medium to coarse...</li>
            <li> This has been a go-to product for me for years because it doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> so by weighing it down I get rid of majority of that problem.</li>
            <li> After a few uses I thought about using a little less, but I hadn&#x27;t noticed any other difference in my hair</li>
            <li> I usually divide my hair in halves, then distribute one pump on each side, while wet.</li>
            <li> Its about 20 dollars for a little one.</li>
            <li> I found it to be a little bit heavy</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve had trouble with wiry and frizzy hair, give this a try.</li>
            <li> my hair is dried out from winter and medication</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy either.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy at all and doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of how well this product would do but was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I ordered from Amazon this time because it was a little cheaper than where i usually get it.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this for her thick course hair to tame it down</li>
            <li> and i love the scent and how it makes my boring, color treated hair feel!</li>
            <li> The product didn&#x27;t work or smell like it usually does when I&#x27;ve bought it in store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use it everyday for life!</li>
            <li> Have used this forever, and needed a small bottle for travel.</li>
            <li> I am also a firm believer of your location/environment affecting how your hair \\&quot;behaves\\&quot; see ya!</li>
            <li> I thought it was a rather thick product to be in a pump spray bottle</li>
            <li> Do not understand the prior bad review.</li>
            <li> I have thin but a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this product but do not air dry with this product in your hair!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Expensive but needed</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really annoying</li>

            <li> Really did not work any better than other leave in I have tried. I have blonde fine Natural curly hair . To style my hair I always start with a blow out  to smooth hair followed with heat styling  to set curl or straighten with a iron . I did notice that after curling hair with a wand that after using this product that my curls seemed looser.</li>
            <li> I first experienced this product at the salon and loved how soft my hair felt afterwards.  It is a little pricy, but a little goes a long way. It has a nice fresh scent and does a good job as a detangler.  My hair looks and feels healthier, smoother, and shinier.  I thought originally this product was also a styling aid, but I find I still need to use mousse to give it some body when I blow dry it.  I like this stuff enough to try some of the other Miracle products.</li>
            <li> this is really good for my hair...makes a big difference in the way it looks and feels</li>
            <li> My hairstylist put this on my hair after she cut and colored it the last time and it worked a lot better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. My hair is wiry, frizzy, and color-treated, and I have to flat-iron it to get it under control. I purchased the product in the 4oz bottle from her, but bought this 2oz bottle for traveling. If you&#x27;ve had trouble with wiry and frizzy hair, give this a try. I probably use more than most people in a single application (due to my rambunctious hair), so if your hair is more manageable, try less rather than more at first because it may become too conditioned. That said, I use less of this product than others, and get better results.</li>
            <li> Great product...my hair is dried out from winter and medication I&#x27;m on and this is the only thing that helps it not look fried!!</li>
            <li> Best product you could ever use on your hair. Use it after washing your hair as a stay in conditioner. Will get rid of those frizzys!!!!!! I have been using this approx. 2 years, don&#x27;t need, want or even try any other product. It&#x27;s the best!! I have thin but a lot of hair. Makes it silky &amp; has lots of body. AND NO FrizzY s !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars because of the chemicals it contains.</li>
            <li> i needed something for my hair because it was stringy and dry. this stuff is a miracle. it made my hair smooth and detangled it. don&#x27;t use to much though because it will make your hair greasy.</li>
            <li> This is so far the best leave-in conditioner I have ever used! I have shoulder length hair, and I use the product every 2 days after I shower. I recently got a cut and wanted something to help my post-pregnancy hair. It returned the shine without looking greasy, made my hair soft, helped some with the flyaways,and overall healthier. It is quite pricey, but I love the fact it is a spray. You can control how much you use and is easy to apply. Spray on, brush-in!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually a 20 in my book. Smells wonderful and works magnificently. Very lightweight and does not make my head feel itchy</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair manageable and shiny, especially if I put it on while my hair is wet and then dry it with a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and long. I like to use this conditioner before I comb out my hair. It combs through with ease after I use it. It isn&#x27;t heavy either.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser friend made me buy this and I&#x27;m glad I did. It&#x27;s SO moisturizing yet so lightweight. It makes my hair feel really soft. Pricier than I&#x27;d like, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for some time now. My hair dresser has always used it on my hair and i love the scent and how it makes my boring, color treated hair feel! It doesn&#x27;t take too much and makes your hair incredibly manageable. I ordered from Amazon this time because it was a little cheaper than where i usually get it. This one is only 2 oz which is not very large but it only takes me about 3-4 sprays in my hand, massaged into my ends to work. I have shoulder length hair right before blow drying--it detangles and leaves it super soft.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size to make sure you have this awesome product with you when you travel!  If you use the product, you know it works like no other.</li>
            <li> THe label looked Intentionally scratched out. The product didn&#x27;t work or smell like it usually does when I&#x27;ve bought it in store. I threw it out. I don&#x27;t think it was authentic.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff been using for a year now works great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipper sent quickly.. packed it well too so it didn&#x27;t leak... very pleased :)</li>
            <li> Worked wonders on my hair after washing it leaves a shine and after blow drying and flat iron my hair is vibrant....</li>
            <li> I was shocked how light weight this product was. I assumed it would be something I would have to wash out, due to my hair being easily weighed down. This really helped my hair breakage, caused by over styling. My hair is naturally wavy and it really defined and softened my curls. I also noticed the difference when i straighten my hair. A must try</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and its always great. I have thin curly hair and this product is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff but it&#x27;s kind of spendy for me. I have to blow dry my hair when I use this stuff otherwise my hair looks greasy.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff for your hair. My hair feels wonderful. I don&#x27;t even need a conditioner with It&#x27;s a 10.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this for her thick course hair to tame it down</li>
            <li> i like miracle 10 it works really well it makes my hair easy to manage and i will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Best thing to happen to my hair! Love this stuff! Will repurchase again. Hair product junkie :) xo xo :)</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy again, I love the way it makes my hair feel. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week, and I can see an incredible improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. i have used other products that have said helps control frizz on the cover, but has just made my hair greasy, unlike this product. when i first found out about it, it was at a salon. I has got my hair dyed, so i could not really tell if it worked or not. I saw it on amazon one day, and had to get it because it smells amazing. That is the only thing i remembered about it-haha. anyways, when i first used it at home, i dried my hair with a blowdryer. my hair looked gorgeous!!! then, i decided to put it in and let my hair air dry. it did not work so well. it felt like there was hairspray in my hair, and it was greasy. Sooooo..... i highly recommend this product but do not air dry with this product in your hair!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It did help eliminate frizz but it left a sticky feeling on my scalp amd hair.  I won&#x27;t buy again and glad I didn&#x27; t purchase a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there really is a miracle product for flyaway hairs but this one works well. I can see a significant difference, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair flat or greasy so yes, I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Amazing! This stuff is great. I&#x27;m glad I bought it here at this price. I&#x27;ll use it everyday for life!</li>
            <li> ... The product leaves your hair soft, but some what greasy.  It smells really nice like a Paris Hitlon perfume.</li>
            <li> A easy to use conditioner that you just spay in and brush.  Easy simply and not stick or gooey.  a very natural look and keeps my hair looking and feeling great!</li>
            <li> Miracle Leave In and I have been fast friends for almost a year now.  It untangles my hair and that is really saying something.  On those days when I don&#x27;t feel like styling, the Miracle Leave In allows my hair to dry with a silky finish.  With the 2-oz size I can take it through airport security.</li>
            <li> It works great to detangle and condition the hair but personally, the scent is very overpowering for me so I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I bought a big bottle of this stuff at Target (because I want it now!) about 2 or 3 months ago. I had read so many wonderful reviews I had to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is to the middle of my back, and it is quite kinky and frizzy. I usually divide my hair in halves, then distribute one pump on each side, while wet. Then I brush and either straighten or let air dry. This stuff made my hair feel SO oily. Considering the length, I didn&#x27;t think I was using very much. After a few uses I thought about using a little less, but I hadn&#x27;t noticed any other difference in my hair so now it just sits under my cabinet.  Kind of bummed since it is a tad expensive.</li>
            <li> cant say I noticed any major improvements or changes..but others say it works for them</li>
            <li> This product is great.  It really helps save my hair from the blow dryer and straightener damage.  I did find that spraying it as the directions say left my bathroom floor slick.  It helped to spray the product in the palm of my hand and massage in the ends working up.  This way I also know it&#x27;s all going in my hair and not on the floor!</li>
            <li> Puts damage hair back to health</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite hair products &amp; I love that I can purchase it on Amazon at such a significant savings.</li>
            <li> I love using the leave in product. It makes my hair looks great, beautiful, and feeling softer. Itg&#x27;s a 10 leave in product is what&#x27;s happening.</li>
            <li> Do not understand the prior bad review. This product has replaced two hair products for me (gel and finishing spray/shine). It is infinitely easier to pack to bring places, and works so well that I put it in my hair when wet, blow dry, and then flat iron, and there are no bumps/tangles or any frizz. Plus, it makes my hair so soft. Buy this!!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried different it&#x27;s a 10 products, and this one wasn&#x27;t the best for me. Sure it helps a bit with frizz and split ends, but it gets a bit sticky on a second day. The better product from their series was It&#x27;s a 10 miracle leave in potion plus keratin, which works for wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this product and found it cheaper on amazon!</li>
            <li> looooooove this stuff..my hairdresser used it on me once and I got home and my hair was so nice and smelled so lovely..really recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> My hair dresser used this when doing my hair and suggested I get it also. My hair feels like I left a salon every day. Make sure to follow the directions and don&#x27;t over due it or it will leave your hair feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> It works great! It makes my hair very soft and smells SOOOO good.</li>
            <li> It is very good product but too expensive compared to the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a couple times now &amp; I like it but it didn&#x27;t totally blow my mind, worked just the same as other leave in conditioners I&#x27;ve used but nothing bad to say though! :)</li>
            <li> Best hair product ever!!!</li>
            <li> good product, nice size for travel</li>
            <li> Just spray and comb through your wet hair without snags.  Leaves hair silky smooth.  It has a nice light scent and a portable size.</li>
            <li> This truly is a miracle product! My hair has never looked so good!! My hair is bouncing, shiny and smells great!! I&#x27;m buying more ASAP!</li>
            <li> I will not travel without this product.  I have the larger bottle for home.  But I need the travel size to fly.  Make sure you shake it before you use it.  Or you will only get half way through the bottle.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to another product. This stuff acts as a detangler, smoother, defrizzer, and leave in conditioner. I bought the travel size because I won&#x27;t ever travel without it.</li>
            <li> First time buyer of this product.... So far it seems ok but i have to come back after a month of testing...</li>
            <li> I like it, but it s a too small bottle; perhaps useful for travel</li>
            <li> Thank you very process was excellent and</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product if you have long hair and it gets snarly.  I just spray a couple times after my shower....and SHAZAM I can comb right through my hair.  It&#x27;s the most amazing product I have found for my hair....and trust me, I have tried tons of products through the years.....</li>
            <li> I just love this, and its cheaper on the internet then at the hair dressers.  Its about 20 dollars for a little one.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for traveling. This has been a go-to product for me for years because it doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down. I have very fine, long hair that splits easily and often hangs limp after conditining...I&#x27;ll often just shampoo and then use this in place of my regular conditioner and my hair is soft and manageable. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My barbar turned me on to it and from that my daughter and wife have ordered it for their use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 usually smells awesome. This stuff stinks! If you&#x27;re sensitive to smells don&#x27;t get this.</li>
            <li> The smell almost overpowers you and annoys you all day long.  I used it once, that was enough, don&#x27;t know if it works or not.</li>
            <li> great transaction. Product as described</li>
            <li> Great product and highly recommended by my hair stylist!</li>
            <li> Easy buy even though it was listed as a sample and not meant for resale..</li>
            <li> if you haven&#x27;t tried it, it works great- to use when you are using a hot iron</li>
            <li> This stuff is THE BEST! I spray this product a few times on my wet hair each time I get out of the shower, and the comb just glides through. It isn&#x27;t heavy at all and doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy. (I have thick hair that is medium to coarse... not sure how it would do with fine hair.)</li>
            <li> I love this brand!!! It works so well on my fine thin hair. My bottle does not spray so it&#x27;s really annoying but it&#x27;s prob a bottle issue. The product is amazing and smells great! Smells nice and clean!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of how well this product would do but was pleasantly surprised. It really did keep the frizzes at bay for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;This is no small accomplishment when you live in the southern part of the U.S.--humidity capital of America!  I did have to use a bit more than recommended on the bottle though. Overall, I am pleased and will buy the product again.</li>
            <li> Have used this forever, and needed a small bottle for travel. Now I just refill from the big one. It always comes along.</li>
            <li> The best product for hair. Noticed manageable hair from first use.  Expensive but needed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10, is a 10. I have been using this product in my hair off and on for years, and can count on it to rebuild and repair the damage that my tresses encounter. I also use it on my both of my daughters hair, to fend off tangles making comb outs manageable and tear free. the scent is a bit strong when you first spray it, but dissipates after your hair is dry. This little bottle lasted me about a month, so I will order a larger size, but this one would be great for travel or to keep in your purse or gym bag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried alot of diff products on my hair,some are considered pricey others cheap,still most range (to me) about average&amp; really what would YOU be willing ti pay for a product that does what its supposed to? That true to life \\&quot;Miracle\\&quot; product? What I received came in a reasonable amount of time, product was not sealed in any way but its not sealed in any way when you buy it at the store. I thought it was a rather thick product to be in a pump spray bottle but, overall this product does all that it claims. I found it to be a little bit heavy but I prefer product that weighs my hair a bit as it&#x27;s fine so it tends to be flyaway,so by weighing it down I get rid of majority of that problem. You&#x27;ll prob see me on reviews of other products. My hair is brunette, there&#x27;s alot of it but the hair itself is medium-fine &amp; long(mid to lower back length). I am also a firm believer of your location/environment affecting how your hair \\&quot;behaves\\&quot; see ya!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey but to me, well worth it.  I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair out long and the rinse out conditioners I use didn&#x27;t seem to keep my hair manageable.  I use this leave in and sometimes the It&#x27;s a 10 Hair Mask and have noticed a great improvement in my hair texture.  It works as a de-tangler and has also restored the spring and luster in my hair.  I&#x27;m Asian so normally my hair is in great shape but I think that the years of coloring, blow drying and curling may be taking their toll.  This product has helped it to rebound back.</li>
            <li> My hair is gray and it can get really dried out and kind of frizzy. This potion really is a miracle. it makes my hair soft and frizzless and actually cuts down on drying time.</li>
