            <li>With this I end up with nice curls and it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or hard/crunchy.  </li>
            <li>: You will receive too many compliments on how good ur hair smells (enter conceited strut).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>

            <li>Shipping was fast and the product was great!!!</li>
            <li>My wife claims this to be the absolute best curly-hair product on the market.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>They make my hair look and feel nice.</li>
            <li>(To each his own.)  </li>

            <li>Nice curls without the crunch.  </li>
            <li>The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff and sticky, and like all DevaCurl products, it smells great!</li>

            <li>No other product can make my curls as beautiful as this gel does!</li>
            <li>The curls look great at first, but with movement, they separate and become frizzy and tangled.  </li>

            <li>They are always shipped quickly and are a good price compared to salons.</li>
            <li>has worked better than DevaCare Arc Angell.  </li>
            <li>Even better is that my hair isn&#x27;t sticky, nor does it have that plastic hair gel look to it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad this is now being offered at Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love the Deva Care products.  </li>
            <li>Love the Gel but the containers top doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>

            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I was also impressed that this company had the gel arrive in the same amount of time that I was told it would.</li>
            <li>The bonus with this gel is its lovely citrus-y scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a favorite of mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does hold my curls better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used and can be reactivated by spritizing with water.</li>
            <li>If you try it this way or have Devachan teach you, I am sure you will love it.  </li>
            <li>if Free\\&quot; and adding more One Condition.  </li>
            <li>If you try it this way or have Devachan teach you, I am sure you will love it.  </li>
            <li>if Free\\&quot; and adding more One Condition.  </li>
            <li>I must simply stick to the Deva Curl Ultra defining gel (which is awesome &amp; works as described with my curls).</li>
            <li>of warning the Deva Curl and Deva Care are different so see what will work best with your hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t curl her hair, but it makes her hair look fuller and lay better.  </li>
            <li>More than one pump makes it sticky.</li>
            <li>Go to their website for more info on product use.</li>
            <li>Love  love love this gel.</li>
            <li>I learned about Deva Care products through a Deva Curly hair stylist about 2 years ago and now love my curly hair again.</li>
            <li>My favorite gel.</li>
            <li>been using this for a year now, still in love with it.</li>
            <li>hair has never looked better or been healthier than when I started using this product line.  </li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this gel.  </li>
            <li>big bottle is perfect with the pump.  </li>
            <li>I love this gel.</li>
            <li>Always been safe on my hair color.&lt;br /&gt;Can</li>
            <li>and I love this gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many brands and formulations of hair gels</li>
            <li>I like this product it works better than any gel product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Could be better.</li>
            <li>Who could ask for anything more.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember how many times I&#x27;ve bought this...</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>But there&#x27;s just about nothing better for curls.</li>
            <li>I surely won&#x27;t use them ever again.  </li>
            <li>I love DevaCurl products.</li>
            <li>I do love the DevaCurl line, however.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had and am having much better luck  with cheaper gels that aren&#x27;t even specifically made for curly hair.</li>
            <li>No Frizz foam better for the results I want.</li>
            <li>so my wavy hair is even more wavy curly.</li>
            <li>I had the experience that most of the one star reviewers had.</li>
            <li>I love this gel.</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>Needs to be packed better from the start.</li>
            <li>Love the product though.</li>
            <li>OK?</li>
            <li>I suggest buying from them to make sure you get a quality product.</li>
            <li>and you will love it</li>
            <li>Love this stuff been using it for a year and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found my magic hair solution in</li>
            <li>but I was using more.  </li>
            <li>I love these products for my curly hair.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used many.</li>
            <li>If you have curly hair you cannot get any better than the Deva products.  </li>
            <li>I had no idea how good this product was til I tried it the first time.  </li>
            <li>For best results, on humid days, I use the gel liberally and let air dry or diffuse.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, the salon product did not make my hair look any better than the Amazon product.  </li>
            <li>I can use whatever shampoo and conditioner I want--including the cheap stuff from the drug store--and as long as I follow with Arc Angell my hair looks great!  </li>
            <li>Works best when applied to dripping wet hair.  </li>
            <li>this is a great gel that does not leave a film and makes my natural curl hold with no frizz.</li>
            <li>This gel smells great, doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling sticky and tames wild curls.</li>
            <li>I also love that it is paraben and sulfite free product.</li>
            <li>How cool is that!).  </li>
            <li>best when you use it on very wet hair.</li>
            <li>out\\&quot;  extremely easily without causing frizz.</li>
            <li>their Kinkier mousse is strong but not crunchy and the hold lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>With Arc Angel, I only need one styling product to get beautiful curl formation.  </li>
            <li>My curls are beautiful and bouncy all day (and often into the next).  </li>
            <li>My hair turns out beautifully and my curls last.</li>
            <li>and it was fine for part of my hair</li>
            <li>While it did define my curls just fine, the frizz was horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s less than $10 a month for the best gel ever!)</li>
            <li>so it was squeezed and bit goopy when it arrived, but I rinsed it off and it was fine.  </li>
            <li>This is the BEST product for my tight, curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using this gel for many years and glad I can find the large size here.  </li>
            <li>I was pumped when I saw that Arc Angel came in a huge bottle with a pump.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>I a, a huge fan of Deva products and have used Arcangel before.</li>
            <li>I use several of Deva&#x27;s products and they work well for my hair, a great line of products.</li>
            <li>I have used the light hold</li>
            <li>Who knew a cut was that important.  </li>
            <li>and you have smooth curls all day without being too crunchy.  </li>
            <li>and it leaves my hair feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>Sulfate and silicone free.</li>
            <li>I prefer the light defining gel.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this by mistake, thinking that I was ordering the light gel.  </li>
            <li>This product still works for me, in combination with the light gel.  </li>
            <li>and it just ended up smelling cheap.</li>
            <li>the second day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never understand why this product has received such great reviews because my experience was anything but great.</li>
            <li>If you want a firm hold, this product is great!  </li>
            <li>It work FABULOUS if you follow the directions &amp; use the correct towel &amp; technique.</li>
            <li>I use it primarily as a hair gel after the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using Deva&#x27;s Light Defining Gel when a friend recommended Arc Angel.</li>
            <li>As a side note I have been trying many hair products as of late and have had the best luck the jane carter products.</li>
            <li>but my right side curls are stubborn and more frizzy than anywhere else on my head</li>
            <li>My hair is very curly and these products are the bomb for my hair!!!</li>
            <li>The delivery this time was particularly speedy - which I sincerely appreciate because I don&#x27;t use anything else except my WEN Fig Cleansing Conditioner. :)</li>
            <li>I am not sure it&#x27;s 100% as good as what I used before, but it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>Arc Angel is a very strong hold for very curly hair.</li>
            <li>Made by the original \\&quot;curly girl\\&quot; lady.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>I love this product-have used it for years-but first time from this buyer.</li>
            <li>So far, my best regiment has been to use L&#x27;Anza Hair Repair leave-in condidtioner, followed by Arrojo Styling Creme, finishing up with TIGI Massive Shine Hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy its mild, citrus scent, too.</li>
            <li>My order was quick and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this gel so much, it really helps create nice curls, smells really herbal and fresh, and adds shine.</li>
            <li>It holds and defines my 2-3b wavy-swavy hair perfectly without being hard or crunchy.</li>
            <li>It works Every time to tame the curls and make me love love love having curly curls!</li>
            <li>This gel is great no more crunchy hair:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fun a devacurl products.</li>
            <li>As expected -  Great product</li>
            <li>I love the whole line of this product because it defines my curls so my hair is not frizzy</li>
            <li>Using this along with WEN Sweet Almond Mint</li>
            <li>It is shiny, full of body and bounce and there is not a flake in sight.</li>
            <li>I know this was a good deal and will last me months.</li>
            <li>The whole line of Deva products is top notch</li>
            <li>Also, the packaging people put a very sticky tape over the top of the cap.  </li>
            <li>For a girl with very curly hair, I love this product.</li>
            <li>Leaves a nice, soft, curly style, without the frizz.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the Deva line of products.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m out $60 and have almost full bottles stashed in my hall closet that I have no intention of using again.  </li>
            <li>Having curly hair means trying a store full of products.</li>
            <li>Maybe it holds really curly hair much better</li>
            <li>I was not in the least impressed with this gel.</li>
            <li>After it is well-distributed, I gently scrunch my hair up from the tips toward the roots, squeezing out the excess water, and promoting my waves to look a bit more curl-ish.</li>
            <li>I absolutely fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I have been trying many generic and other brand gel, that claim to be alcohol free, but this one is far my favorite and best product.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I don&#x27;t look like a wet poodle anymore!  </li>
            <li>My two daughters&#x27; have super curly hair.</li>
            <li>Works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried so far to keep my curl separated and frizz free.</li>
            <li>Skip this line, there&#x27;s nothing worthy of the expense.  </li>
            <li>more frizz had built up and it just wasn&#x27;t even remotely decent.</li>
            <li>but then why would you need the gel if your hair was already super curly???</li>
            <li>Free or Mist-er Right, and my hair looks freshly styled.</li>
            <li>This is the 1st time I ever wore hair products where I didn&#x27;t saturate my hair and wait HOURS for my hair to dry before looking good.  </li>
            <li>This gel is the first gel I have ever used that doesn&#x27;t leave my hands sticky or my hair crunchy!  </li>
            <li>In the shower, I scrunch my hair a couple times with my hands to get most of the water out and put a towel over my hair to dry my hair more.</li>
            <li>It made my straight fine hair look wavy, almost like I had a body perm.  </li>
            <li>The entire DevaCurl line is amazing, I recommend it to anyone with curly hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I enjoy the whole product line of Deva products.</li>
            <li>The Deva Care Arc Angel Firm Hold Defining Gel works great on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, I love that this doesn&#x27;t leave your hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;,  my hair remainsremains soft and pliable.</li>
            <li>My curls are much more defined and soft to the touch...</li>
            <li>but now that I am an adult I have learned to love and embrace what nature gave me.</li>
            <li>It took me 2 tries before I was like, ok I can do this confidently.  </li>
            <li>It took me 2 tries before I was like, ok I can do this confidently.  </li>
            <li>What I do like about this gel, is that when used as instructed, my curls hang more naturally, and I have cork screw curls towards the bottom.  </li>
            <li>Spend your money on a nice bottle of perfume or some such luxury.  </li>
            <li>This product is worth the try if you don&#x27;t mind spending the money on it, but otherwise, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>It may be pricey, but let me tell you it is worth it.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t want to deal worth the hassle.</li>
            <li>have found that this gel works great at getting those spirally curls and does not leave your hair looking stiff or crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great product for keeping curly hair tame.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s good but not super great for slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Angel applies easily, dries quickly, and shakes out, leaving your natural curls bouncing for days.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, if you cannot afford the shampoo, conditioner, and styling product....</li>
            <li>I found a drugstore spray gel that met all the criteria set out in the Deva inventor&#x27;s book Curly Girl for curly products that cost half this price, smelled a lot better and defined my curls and waves better without the slimy feel or the need to soak your hair in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, we all come in with our own habits and preferences, but to appreciate the product and learn how to use it, you have to really go in with an open mind.  </li>
            <li>A lot of other curly hair product lines require that you use their special shampoo, their special conditioner, their special gel, their special leave-in conditioner, etc.</li>
            <li>After that, this product softens up, and my hair looks amazingly like I&#x27;ve spent hours with a curling iron.</li>
            <li>The bottle did NOT come with a pump, just a regular gel-bottle top.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this on a whim and just bought another 32oz bottle -- it really works well for my hair!  </li>
            <li>I use many of their products and especially like Arc Angel Gel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first gel that does what it says and doesn&#x27;t give you crunchy hair</li>
            <li>My hair has totally changed for the better.</li>
            <li>I went shampoo-free for the first time three years ago and the Deva line helped me do it.&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li>Great for thick hair.</li>
            <li>the first day imagine how it felt/what it looked like</li>
            <li>First, YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE VIDEOS (the 3-step) on their website and use the product exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Although they both have a similar consistency when I put them in my hair, the Arc Angel product just seems to define my curls better without making them crunchy.</li>
            <li>Make sure you learn how to properly use these products through either your salon or online.  </li>
            <li>and it never fails.</li>
            <li>but it works just fine even when it&#x27;s a little more liquid.</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE Arc Angel, but the pump stopped working shortly after purchase making it a real chore to use.</li>
            <li>I will be more careful next time to make sure I get real Deva Curl products!</li>
            <li>and that is exactly how much I paid for them.  </li>
            <li>my hair has so much curl love that if I get low I know where to go thanks</li>
            <li>I highly recommend all of their products and suggest others to visit their website for tips on choosing the right products.</li>
            <li>So long as you follow the directions and let your hair dry without touching it, my hair has never looked more frizz-free or healthier.</li>
            <li>and i still love how my curls hold without getting crunchy or dry.</li>
            <li>I then repeat and add more gel, dry with another dry paper towel and do it one more time.</li>
            <li>and then once it&#x27;s dry, I scrunch a bit more to soften it up.</li>
            <li>It was so hard to find something to replace what I loved for so long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this product to any Curly Girl out there!</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li>Buying on Amazon is much cheaper than the salon stores</li>
            <li>It is very watery</li>
            <li>I follow the whole curly girl hair regime.</li>
            <li>My hair thanks you.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>and it really doesn&#x27;t do well for curly hair.</li>
            <li>I recommend this highly!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This did absolutely zero for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have problems with conditioners giving me rashes if I use too much or leave too much product in my hair, so it is a problem keeping my hair moisturized.</li>
            <li>so I really like the DevaCurl</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Buy the real thing</li>
            <li>it so much cheaper through Amazon</li>
            <li>And it works really well with curly hair.</li>
            <li>Anyone with curly hair really needs this in their bathroom.</li>
            <li>I really prefer Arc Angel now.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than anywhere else.</li>
            <li>My curls dry frizz free for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Best of all its not full of toxic and harsh  ingredients!</li>
            <li>It lasts longer than most other products, even in humid weather.</li>
            <li>My curls and hair felt better with the other gel.</li>
            <li>It works better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The gigantic bottle last me about 4 months and is worth every penny (hello! -</li>
            <li>enough hold to give me the definition and volume that I like, non-sticky, no residue, really clean orange-ey smell.</li>
            <li>I recommend this for anyone with curly hair that is dry and breaks easy.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair, is not too heavy on the hair</li>
            <li>The gel has a light, fresh scent and can be reactivated later in the day by simply misting with water if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With traditional gels, I&#x27;ve been able to wear my hair at least 2-3 days just doing some touching up, but with this product, one day is all I get.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything for Curly Hair for South FL weather and this stuff really works against normal &amp;#34;BAD HAIR DAYS&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It was meant for exactly the purpose of defining curls softly.</li>
            <li>Although I love this product and have used it for years when I purchesded it through this seller it came watered down.</li>
            <li>For my fine, thin, curly hair, this gel performs better than anything else I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>To get the same shine as others I scrunch with a light layer of sweet almond oil once my hair is 1/2 dry.</li>
            <li>The new bottle I received is very watery and does not hold.  </li>
            <li>This product had so many good reviews I decided to try it ignoring the bad reviews.</li>
            <li>Important to scrunch it and break cast once dry.</li>
            <li>I have wavy, not super curly hair, but I find I prefer this to the more flexible hold hair gel.  </li>
            <li>My hair is thin for curly hair, so I have had better results with the light gel.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, including the Nopoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using deva curl products.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone with curly hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who asks me about what I use on my hair (and I am asked or complimented often).  </li>
            <li>Unless I saw this product highly discounted, I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to any &amp;#34;curly girl&amp;#34; out there.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Shine Serum controls frizz even in high humidity and</li>
            <li>I have used Curlisto and some other high end curl products but nothing gives me soft, magical curls like this gel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Deva products for a little over a year and love them.</li>
            <li>this gel really tames my frizz without completely discouraging my curls.</li>
            <li>Preserves soft curls very well.</li>
            <li>, this is far from the real product.</li>
            <li>so I bought this firm hold gel, used it on my stubborn side and got much better results.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say how long that would last, but will update my review as I try more styles.</li>
            <li>I normally have add a shine serum to it.</li>
            <li>I started using DevaCurl products a few months ago, and my hair has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>Came in a box with 2 other items that were fine ~</li>
            <li>For second day or third day hair, Arc Angel is easily reactivated with DevaCurl Set It</li>
            <li>Recommended by my hairdresser who also gave me instructions how to use on my new curly &#x27;do.  </li>
            <li>The company no longer exists so I had to find a new gel.</li>
            <li>For someone with a thick and very curly hair I think that the Ausie gels that you can buy conveniently from any store will  do a better job.</li>
            <li>When I take it down, I have thick strands of beautiful curls that hold their shape all day.  </li>
            <li>Sunsilk Hydra TLC and my hair is very soft and manageable, even on rainy days.</li>
            <li>Produces a very natural curl.</li>
            <li>This leaves your hair soft, controlled and with no frizz!</li>
            <li>While this product is more expensive it really does the job and is worth it.</li>
            <li>I then use a diffuser to partially dry my hair, or allow my hair to air dry WITHOUT TOUCHING IT.</li>
            <li>my hair has to be super wet and it drips all over me for about an hour.  </li>
            <li>I can not say enough positive things about the Deva Care system.  </li>
            <li>To get this effect I have to use a significant amount of product (my hair is down to my bottom)</li>
            <li>My curls are tight and maintain their shape all day, no matter how many times I push my hair back.</li>
            <li>never stiff and works well for touch ups.</li>
            <li>Amazon lists the reviews of the product from all sellers and clearly quality varies by re-seller.  </li>
            <li>It looks natural and soft.</li>
            <li>My curls look product-free, soft, and hold all day.  </li>
            <li>My hair is not quite as shiny and soft as it was before.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and have always had to put lots of gel in it to keep it in check.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely recommended for ladies with natural curls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I have since purchased this product again and noticed that the quality is different -- the gel seems thinner and does not have as much hold as before.  </li>
            <li>I have ridiculously soft curly hair.</li>
            <li>A hair stylist told a friend of mine with short straight hair that Deva Curl products would make her hair curl.  </li>
            <li>And, seriously soft.  </li>
            <li>My curls are soft and defined with no frizz.</li>
            <li>Now my curls look natural and defined.</li>
            <li>It was a completely different color and much thicker.  </li>
            <li>It also worked well when I was in a very humid region recently -- no frizzies.</li>
            <li>I feel it&#x27;s worth the money to purchase the big bottle since I use this product daily.</li>
            <li>was thick and my bottle came with a pump top.  </li>
            <li>This holds better than the regular angel gel yet doesn&#x27;t feel stiff.</li>
            <li>I have spent decades trying to find the right mix of products to tame the curls and keep them soft, shiny and frizz free.  </li>
            <li>This product is light and does not leave your hair feeling stiff and &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;, though it holds quite well.  </li>
            <li>as my bottle is still half full.  </li>
            <li>Product came fast, but it was shipped with zero protection with a 10 pound toilet seat</li>
            <li>first the sides then back then over the outside of hair.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty sure the one I purchased from Amazon was fake.  </li>
            <li>bought this gel because there were many 5 star reviews that specifically mentioned that it did not dry hard or sticky.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend all of their product, it&#x27;s the only stuff I use!</li>
            <li>I live in the Pacific north west so I am battling frizz on a near daily basis.</li>
            <li>I have long, straight caucasian hair.  </li>
            <li>mother has shoulder length, straight, thin, baby fine caucasian hair that is damaged and color treated.  </li>
            <li>great product for curly hair - this has lasted me quite a few months as you only need a small amount!</li>
            <li>Not authentic Deva Care product, made my head itch and hair became very crunchy!!!</li>
            <li>I have 3A hair and was looking for a new gel and after reading raving reviews and having countless curly haired people recommend it, I was ecstatic to try it out.</li>
            <li>Designed for those who scrunch their curls and air dry their hair, it also works very well with a hair dryer and diffuser.</li>
            <li>This system seems to do really well on my hair which is naturally dry to begin with and bleached.</li>
            <li>This is the only gel I use on my natural curls!</li>
            <li>No other gel on the market can compare (and believe me---I&#x27;ve tried them all).</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected thank you!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only redeeming quality about this gel is that I can use it on days that I don&#x27;t shampoo to help revive my curls, otherwise, this stuff is pretty much useless in my hair routine.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair from getting frizzy in humid weather and holds the curls firmly or loosely in place depending on how much product I use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have super kinky curls at all, in fact they&#x27;re usually quite soft and bouncy, but this gel made my hair frizzier than I&#x27;ve seen in years</li>
            <li>I truly thought only I knew how to style my hair (naturally, after all my hair disasters).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a woman over 40 with naturally curly, mixed race hair.  </li>
            <li>Washes out of the hair almost completely with only water.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use Deva Care&#x27;s No or Low Poo because of breakouts/rashes, but I have really sensitive skin and lots of allergies to all kinds of products.</li>
            <li>and I have tired many items.  </li>
            <li>a hint, the reason you don&#x27;t need so many products is these really hold the curls into thick clumps of voluminous large curls rather than thin strands of curls.  </li>
            <li>I even tried to incorporate this gel with my usual line-up to see if it would work better with some of my other well-performing products..</li>
            <li>Really - just read my other reviews</li>
            <li>Recently decided to go back to my natural curls.  </li>
            <li>my curls are pretty lifeless and hair gets a little frizzy.</li>
            <li>The gel I ordered from Amazon seemed a little “watered down” because it was thinner and the smell was not as strong.</li>
            <li>I generally squeeze out extra water from my hair and then scrunch lots of this gel into my hair</li>
            <li>My teenage daughter has extremely curly hair and has much healthier looking and feeling hair since using DevaCurl products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of other Deva products, though, and this is really the only one I like.</li>
            <li>- don&#x27;t keep playing with it while it&#x27;s still wet or damp), I scrunch it with my bare hands, it removes the &#x27;cast&#x27; and I have soft, shiny (not wet looking), bouncy curls.  </li>
            <li>I am convinced this is a watered down version of the real Devacurl product.</li>
            <li>This is the only gel I will use on my long, naturally wavy hair and it does not leave my hair feeling crunchy.  </li>
            <li>However, for the past few years I have been living on a budget and have not been able to afford to buy all of their products.</li>
            <li>Once dry, simply scrunch hair for soft and defined curls.  </li>
            <li>I just wash my scalp everyday with conditioner (I use Lanza Healing Color Care Conditoner since I have a HUGE gallon and don&#x27;t want to waste it.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> everything arrived in great condition, so I am strictly reviewing the product itself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, with that in mind, this is a great gel.  </li>
            <li> This gives great definition and hold, without being sticky or otherwise crunchy.  </li>

            <li> MY ANGEL FOR SURE!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product was also packaged very nicely so that there was no spill and</li>
            <li> The cap was damaged in shipping and Amazon customer service was amazing!  </li>
            <li> I have used many DevaCurl products and have been very happy with them</li>
            <li> A great product for sure!</li>

            <li> and I have loved every product I have tried.</li>
            <li> The best part is it is sulfa free</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended No-Poo, Set It Free and Arc Angel and I, foolishly, purchased all three products because he assured me that for best results I should use all three in conjunction with one another.  </li>
            <li> It smells good too.</li>

            <li> Love the product, just not always the price tag!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> It made them shiny and by using the Deva No-poo and conditioner also, their hair was amazingly manageable and hydrated.</li>
            <li> A lot of their products are amazing.</li>
            <li> and it was amazing.</li>

            <li> in order for your hair to look good (and each of these things can cost $20 or more).  </li>
            <li> With this I end up with nice curls and it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or hard/crunchy.  </li>
            <li> : You will receive too many compliments on how good ur hair smells (enter conceited strut).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>

            <li> Absolute best products for curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and the product was great!!!</li>
            <li> My wife claims this to be the absolute best curly-hair product on the market.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice.</li>
            <li> They make my hair look and feel nice.</li>
            <li> (To each his own.)  </li>
            <li> More economical and smells great!</li>
            <li> Nice curls without the crunch.  </li>
            <li> The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff and sticky, and like all DevaCurl products, it smells great!</li>
            <li> It gets frizzy very easily.</li>

            <li> Perfect product, exactly as I described and exactly what I was looking for!!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love!</li>
            <li> No other product can make my curls as beautiful as this gel does!</li>
            <li> The curls look great at first, but with movement, they separate and become frizzy and tangled.  </li>
            <li> gel has a strong hold and gives nice body.  </li>
            <li> They are always shipped quickly and are a good price compared to salons.</li>
            <li> has worked better than DevaCare Arc Angell.  </li>
            <li> Even better is that my hair isn&#x27;t sticky, nor does it have that plastic hair gel look to it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad this is now being offered at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love the Deva Care products.  </li>
            <li> Love the Gel but the containers top doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I was also impressed that this company had the gel arrive in the same amount of time that I was told it would.</li>
            <li> The bonus with this gel is its lovely citrus-y scent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a favorite of mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does hold my curls better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used and can be reactivated by spritizing with water.</li>
            <li> If you try it this way or have Devachan teach you, I am sure you will love it.  </li>
            <li> if Free\\&quot; and adding more One Condition.  </li>
            <li> If you try it this way or have Devachan teach you, I am sure you will love it.  </li>
            <li> if Free\\&quot; and adding more One Condition.  </li>
            <li> I must simply stick to the Deva Curl Ultra defining gel (which is awesome &amp; works as described with my curls).</li>
            <li> of warning the Deva Curl and Deva Care are different so see what will work best with your hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t curl her hair, but it makes her hair look fuller and lay better.  </li>
            <li> More than one pump makes it sticky.</li>
            <li> Go to their website for more info on product use.</li>
            <li> Love  love love this gel.</li>
            <li> I learned about Deva Care products through a Deva Curly hair stylist about 2 years ago and now love my curly hair again.</li>
            <li> My favorite gel.</li>
            <li> been using this for a year now, still in love with it.</li>
            <li> hair has never looked better or been healthier than when I started using this product line.  </li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this gel.  </li>
            <li> big bottle is perfect with the pump.  </li>
            <li> I love this gel.</li>
            <li> Always been safe on my hair color.&lt;br /&gt;Can</li>
            <li> and I love this gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many brands and formulations of hair gels</li>
            <li> I like this product it works better than any gel product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Could be better.</li>
            <li> Who could ask for anything more.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember how many times I&#x27;ve bought this...</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> But there&#x27;s just about nothing better for curls.</li>
            <li> I surely won&#x27;t use them ever again.  </li>
            <li> I love DevaCurl products.</li>
            <li> I do love the DevaCurl line, however.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had and am having much better luck  with cheaper gels that aren&#x27;t even specifically made for curly hair.</li>
            <li> No Frizz foam better for the results I want.</li>
            <li> so my wavy hair is even more wavy curly.</li>
            <li> I had the experience that most of the one star reviewers had.</li>
            <li> I love this gel.</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> Needs to be packed better from the start.</li>
            <li> Love the product though.</li>
            <li> OK?</li>
            <li> I suggest buying from them to make sure you get a quality product.</li>
            <li> and you will love it</li>
            <li> Love this stuff been using it for a year and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found my magic hair solution in</li>
            <li> but I was using more.  </li>
            <li> I love these products for my curly hair.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used many.</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair you cannot get any better than the Deva products.  </li>
            <li> I had no idea how good this product was til I tried it the first time.  </li>
            <li> For best results, on humid days, I use the gel liberally and let air dry or diffuse.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly, the salon product did not make my hair look any better than the Amazon product.  </li>
            <li> I can use whatever shampoo and conditioner I want--including the cheap stuff from the drug store--and as long as I follow with Arc Angell my hair looks great!  </li>
            <li> Works best when applied to dripping wet hair.  </li>
            <li> this is a great gel that does not leave a film and makes my natural curl hold with no frizz.</li>
            <li> This gel smells great, doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling sticky and tames wild curls.</li>
            <li> I also love that it is paraben and sulfite free product.</li>
            <li> How cool is that!).  </li>
            <li> best when you use it on very wet hair.</li>
            <li> out\\&quot;  extremely easily without causing frizz.</li>
            <li> their Kinkier mousse is strong but not crunchy and the hold lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> With Arc Angel, I only need one styling product to get beautiful curl formation.  </li>
            <li> My curls are beautiful and bouncy all day (and often into the next).  </li>
            <li> My hair turns out beautifully and my curls last.</li>
            <li> and it was fine for part of my hair</li>
            <li> While it did define my curls just fine, the frizz was horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s less than $10 a month for the best gel ever!)</li>
            <li> so it was squeezed and bit goopy when it arrived, but I rinsed it off and it was fine.  </li>
            <li> This is the BEST product for my tight, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this gel for many years and glad I can find the large size here.  </li>
            <li> I was pumped when I saw that Arc Angel came in a huge bottle with a pump.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> I a, a huge fan of Deva products and have used Arcangel before.</li>
            <li> I use several of Deva&#x27;s products and they work well for my hair, a great line of products.</li>
            <li> I have used the light hold</li>
            <li> Who knew a cut was that important.  </li>
            <li> and you have smooth curls all day without being too crunchy.  </li>
            <li> and it leaves my hair feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> Sulfate and silicone free.</li>
            <li> I prefer the light defining gel.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this by mistake, thinking that I was ordering the light gel.  </li>
            <li> This product still works for me, in combination with the light gel.  </li>
            <li> and it just ended up smelling cheap.</li>
            <li> the second day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never understand why this product has received such great reviews because my experience was anything but great.</li>
            <li> If you want a firm hold, this product is great!  </li>
            <li> It work FABULOUS if you follow the directions &amp; use the correct towel &amp; technique.</li>
            <li> I use it primarily as a hair gel after the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using Deva&#x27;s Light Defining Gel when a friend recommended Arc Angel.</li>
            <li> As a side note I have been trying many hair products as of late and have had the best luck the jane carter products.</li>
            <li> but my right side curls are stubborn and more frizzy than anywhere else on my head</li>
            <li> My hair is very curly and these products are the bomb for my hair!!!</li>
            <li> The delivery this time was particularly speedy - which I sincerely appreciate because I don&#x27;t use anything else except my WEN Fig Cleansing Conditioner. :)</li>
            <li> I am not sure it&#x27;s 100% as good as what I used before, but it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> Arc Angel is a very strong hold for very curly hair.</li>
            <li> Made by the original \\&quot;curly girl\\&quot; lady.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I love this product-have used it for years-but first time from this buyer.</li>
            <li> So far, my best regiment has been to use L&#x27;Anza Hair Repair leave-in condidtioner, followed by Arrojo Styling Creme, finishing up with TIGI Massive Shine Hairspray.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy its mild, citrus scent, too.</li>
            <li> My order was quick and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this gel so much, it really helps create nice curls, smells really herbal and fresh, and adds shine.</li>
            <li> It holds and defines my 2-3b wavy-swavy hair perfectly without being hard or crunchy.</li>
            <li> It works Every time to tame the curls and make me love love love having curly curls!</li>
            <li> This gel is great no more crunchy hair:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fun a devacurl products.</li>
            <li> As expected -  Great product</li>
            <li> I love the whole line of this product because it defines my curls so my hair is not frizzy</li>
            <li> Using this along with WEN Sweet Almond Mint</li>
            <li> It is shiny, full of body and bounce and there is not a flake in sight.</li>
            <li> I know this was a good deal and will last me months.</li>
            <li> The whole line of Deva products is top notch</li>
            <li> Also, the packaging people put a very sticky tape over the top of the cap.  </li>
            <li> For a girl with very curly hair, I love this product.</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice, soft, curly style, without the frizz.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the Deva line of products.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m out $60 and have almost full bottles stashed in my hall closet that I have no intention of using again.  </li>
            <li> Having curly hair means trying a store full of products.</li>
            <li> Maybe it holds really curly hair much better</li>
            <li> I was not in the least impressed with this gel.</li>
            <li> After it is well-distributed, I gently scrunch my hair up from the tips toward the roots, squeezing out the excess water, and promoting my waves to look a bit more curl-ish.</li>
            <li> I absolutely fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying many generic and other brand gel, that claim to be alcohol free, but this one is far my favorite and best product.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I don&#x27;t look like a wet poodle anymore!  </li>
            <li> My two daughters&#x27; have super curly hair.</li>
            <li> Works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried so far to keep my curl separated and frizz free.</li>
            <li> Skip this line, there&#x27;s nothing worthy of the expense.  </li>
            <li> more frizz had built up and it just wasn&#x27;t even remotely decent.</li>
            <li> but then why would you need the gel if your hair was already super curly???</li>
            <li> Free or Mist-er Right, and my hair looks freshly styled.</li>
            <li> This is the 1st time I ever wore hair products where I didn&#x27;t saturate my hair and wait HOURS for my hair to dry before looking good.  </li>
            <li> This gel is the first gel I have ever used that doesn&#x27;t leave my hands sticky or my hair crunchy!  </li>
            <li> In the shower, I scrunch my hair a couple times with my hands to get most of the water out and put a towel over my hair to dry my hair more.</li>
            <li> It made my straight fine hair look wavy, almost like I had a body perm.  </li>
            <li> The entire DevaCurl line is amazing, I recommend it to anyone with curly hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I enjoy the whole product line of Deva products.</li>
            <li> The Deva Care Arc Angel Firm Hold Defining Gel works great on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, I love that this doesn&#x27;t leave your hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;,  my hair remainsremains soft and pliable.</li>
            <li> My curls are much more defined and soft to the touch...</li>
            <li> but now that I am an adult I have learned to love and embrace what nature gave me.</li>
            <li> It took me 2 tries before I was like, ok I can do this confidently.  </li>
            <li> It took me 2 tries before I was like, ok I can do this confidently.  </li>
            <li> What I do like about this gel, is that when used as instructed, my curls hang more naturally, and I have cork screw curls towards the bottom.  </li>
            <li> Spend your money on a nice bottle of perfume or some such luxury.  </li>
            <li> This product is worth the try if you don&#x27;t mind spending the money on it, but otherwise, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> It may be pricey, but let me tell you it is worth it.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t want to deal worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> have found that this gel works great at getting those spirally curls and does not leave your hair looking stiff or crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great product for keeping curly hair tame.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s good but not super great for slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Angel applies easily, dries quickly, and shakes out, leaving your natural curls bouncing for days.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, if you cannot afford the shampoo, conditioner, and styling product....</li>
            <li> I found a drugstore spray gel that met all the criteria set out in the Deva inventor&#x27;s book Curly Girl for curly products that cost half this price, smelled a lot better and defined my curls and waves better without the slimy feel or the need to soak your hair in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, we all come in with our own habits and preferences, but to appreciate the product and learn how to use it, you have to really go in with an open mind.  </li>
            <li> A lot of other curly hair product lines require that you use their special shampoo, their special conditioner, their special gel, their special leave-in conditioner, etc.</li>
            <li> After that, this product softens up, and my hair looks amazingly like I&#x27;ve spent hours with a curling iron.</li>
            <li> The bottle did NOT come with a pump, just a regular gel-bottle top.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this on a whim and just bought another 32oz bottle -- it really works well for my hair!  </li>
            <li> I use many of their products and especially like Arc Angel Gel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first gel that does what it says and doesn&#x27;t give you crunchy hair</li>
            <li> My hair has totally changed for the better.</li>
            <li> I went shampoo-free for the first time three years ago and the Deva line helped me do it.&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li> Great for thick hair.</li>
            <li> the first day imagine how it felt/what it looked like</li>
            <li> First, YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE VIDEOS (the 3-step) on their website and use the product exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Although they both have a similar consistency when I put them in my hair, the Arc Angel product just seems to define my curls better without making them crunchy.</li>
            <li> Make sure you learn how to properly use these products through either your salon or online.  </li>
            <li> and it never fails.</li>
            <li> but it works just fine even when it&#x27;s a little more liquid.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE Arc Angel, but the pump stopped working shortly after purchase making it a real chore to use.</li>
            <li> I will be more careful next time to make sure I get real Deva Curl products!</li>
            <li> and that is exactly how much I paid for them.  </li>
            <li> my hair has so much curl love that if I get low I know where to go thanks</li>
            <li> I highly recommend all of their products and suggest others to visit their website for tips on choosing the right products.</li>
            <li> So long as you follow the directions and let your hair dry without touching it, my hair has never looked more frizz-free or healthier.</li>
            <li> and i still love how my curls hold without getting crunchy or dry.</li>
            <li> I then repeat and add more gel, dry with another dry paper towel and do it one more time.</li>
            <li> and then once it&#x27;s dry, I scrunch a bit more to soften it up.</li>
            <li> It was so hard to find something to replace what I loved for so long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this product to any Curly Girl out there!</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li> Buying on Amazon is much cheaper than the salon stores</li>
            <li> It is very watery</li>
            <li> I follow the whole curly girl hair regime.</li>
            <li> My hair thanks you.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> and it really doesn&#x27;t do well for curly hair.</li>
            <li> I recommend this highly!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This did absolutely zero for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have problems with conditioners giving me rashes if I use too much or leave too much product in my hair, so it is a problem keeping my hair moisturized.</li>
            <li> so I really like the DevaCurl</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Buy the real thing</li>
            <li> it so much cheaper through Amazon</li>
            <li> And it works really well with curly hair.</li>
            <li> Anyone with curly hair really needs this in their bathroom.</li>
            <li> I really prefer Arc Angel now.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> My curls dry frizz free for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Best of all its not full of toxic and harsh  ingredients!</li>
            <li> It lasts longer than most other products, even in humid weather.</li>
            <li> My curls and hair felt better with the other gel.</li>
            <li> It works better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The gigantic bottle last me about 4 months and is worth every penny (hello! -</li>
            <li> enough hold to give me the definition and volume that I like, non-sticky, no residue, really clean orange-ey smell.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for anyone with curly hair that is dry and breaks easy.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair, is not too heavy on the hair</li>
            <li> The gel has a light, fresh scent and can be reactivated later in the day by simply misting with water if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With traditional gels, I&#x27;ve been able to wear my hair at least 2-3 days just doing some touching up, but with this product, one day is all I get.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything for Curly Hair for South FL weather and this stuff really works against normal &amp;#34;BAD HAIR DAYS&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It was meant for exactly the purpose of defining curls softly.</li>
            <li> Although I love this product and have used it for years when I purchesded it through this seller it came watered down.</li>
            <li> For my fine, thin, curly hair, this gel performs better than anything else I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> To get the same shine as others I scrunch with a light layer of sweet almond oil once my hair is 1/2 dry.</li>
            <li> The new bottle I received is very watery and does not hold.  </li>
            <li> This product had so many good reviews I decided to try it ignoring the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> Important to scrunch it and break cast once dry.</li>
            <li> I have wavy, not super curly hair, but I find I prefer this to the more flexible hold hair gel.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thin for curly hair, so I have had better results with the light gel.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, including the Nopoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using deva curl products.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone with curly hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who asks me about what I use on my hair (and I am asked or complimented often).  </li>
            <li> Unless I saw this product highly discounted, I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to any &amp;#34;curly girl&amp;#34; out there.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Shine Serum controls frizz even in high humidity and</li>
            <li> I have used Curlisto and some other high end curl products but nothing gives me soft, magical curls like this gel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Deva products for a little over a year and love them.</li>
            <li> this gel really tames my frizz without completely discouraging my curls.</li>
            <li> Preserves soft curls very well.</li>
            <li> , this is far from the real product.</li>
            <li> so I bought this firm hold gel, used it on my stubborn side and got much better results.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say how long that would last, but will update my review as I try more styles.</li>
            <li> I normally have add a shine serum to it.</li>
            <li> I started using DevaCurl products a few months ago, and my hair has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> Came in a box with 2 other items that were fine ~</li>
            <li> For second day or third day hair, Arc Angel is easily reactivated with DevaCurl Set It</li>
            <li> Recommended by my hairdresser who also gave me instructions how to use on my new curly &#x27;do.  </li>
            <li> The company no longer exists so I had to find a new gel.</li>
            <li> For someone with a thick and very curly hair I think that the Ausie gels that you can buy conveniently from any store will  do a better job.</li>
            <li> When I take it down, I have thick strands of beautiful curls that hold their shape all day.  </li>
            <li> Sunsilk Hydra TLC and my hair is very soft and manageable, even on rainy days.</li>
            <li> Produces a very natural curl.</li>
            <li> This leaves your hair soft, controlled and with no frizz!</li>
            <li> While this product is more expensive it really does the job and is worth it.</li>
            <li> I then use a diffuser to partially dry my hair, or allow my hair to air dry WITHOUT TOUCHING IT.</li>
            <li> my hair has to be super wet and it drips all over me for about an hour.  </li>
            <li> I can not say enough positive things about the Deva Care system.  </li>
            <li> To get this effect I have to use a significant amount of product (my hair is down to my bottom)</li>
            <li> My curls are tight and maintain their shape all day, no matter how many times I push my hair back.</li>
            <li> never stiff and works well for touch ups.</li>
            <li> Amazon lists the reviews of the product from all sellers and clearly quality varies by re-seller.  </li>
            <li> It looks natural and soft.</li>
            <li> My curls look product-free, soft, and hold all day.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not quite as shiny and soft as it was before.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and have always had to put lots of gel in it to keep it in check.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely recommended for ladies with natural curls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I have since purchased this product again and noticed that the quality is different -- the gel seems thinner and does not have as much hold as before.  </li>
            <li> I have ridiculously soft curly hair.</li>
            <li> A hair stylist told a friend of mine with short straight hair that Deva Curl products would make her hair curl.  </li>
            <li> And, seriously soft.  </li>
            <li> My curls are soft and defined with no frizz.</li>
            <li> Now my curls look natural and defined.</li>
            <li> It was a completely different color and much thicker.  </li>
            <li> It also worked well when I was in a very humid region recently -- no frizzies.</li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s worth the money to purchase the big bottle since I use this product daily.</li>
            <li> was thick and my bottle came with a pump top.  </li>
            <li> This holds better than the regular angel gel yet doesn&#x27;t feel stiff.</li>
            <li> I have spent decades trying to find the right mix of products to tame the curls and keep them soft, shiny and frizz free.  </li>
            <li> This product is light and does not leave your hair feeling stiff and &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;, though it holds quite well.  </li>
            <li> as my bottle is still half full.  </li>
            <li> Product came fast, but it was shipped with zero protection with a 10 pound toilet seat</li>
            <li> first the sides then back then over the outside of hair.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty sure the one I purchased from Amazon was fake.  </li>
            <li> bought this gel because there were many 5 star reviews that specifically mentioned that it did not dry hard or sticky.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend all of their product, it&#x27;s the only stuff I use!</li>
            <li> I live in the Pacific north west so I am battling frizz on a near daily basis.</li>
            <li> I have long, straight caucasian hair.  </li>
            <li> mother has shoulder length, straight, thin, baby fine caucasian hair that is damaged and color treated.  </li>
            <li> great product for curly hair - this has lasted me quite a few months as you only need a small amount!</li>
            <li> Not authentic Deva Care product, made my head itch and hair became very crunchy!!!</li>
            <li> I have 3A hair and was looking for a new gel and after reading raving reviews and having countless curly haired people recommend it, I was ecstatic to try it out.</li>
            <li> Designed for those who scrunch their curls and air dry their hair, it also works very well with a hair dryer and diffuser.</li>
            <li> This system seems to do really well on my hair which is naturally dry to begin with and bleached.</li>
            <li> This is the only gel I use on my natural curls!</li>
            <li> No other gel on the market can compare (and believe me---I&#x27;ve tried them all).</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected thank you!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only redeeming quality about this gel is that I can use it on days that I don&#x27;t shampoo to help revive my curls, otherwise, this stuff is pretty much useless in my hair routine.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair from getting frizzy in humid weather and holds the curls firmly or loosely in place depending on how much product I use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have super kinky curls at all, in fact they&#x27;re usually quite soft and bouncy, but this gel made my hair frizzier than I&#x27;ve seen in years</li>
            <li> I truly thought only I knew how to style my hair (naturally, after all my hair disasters).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a woman over 40 with naturally curly, mixed race hair.  </li>
            <li> Washes out of the hair almost completely with only water.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use Deva Care&#x27;s No or Low Poo because of breakouts/rashes, but I have really sensitive skin and lots of allergies to all kinds of products.</li>
            <li> and I have tired many items.  </li>
            <li> a hint, the reason you don&#x27;t need so many products is these really hold the curls into thick clumps of voluminous large curls rather than thin strands of curls.  </li>
            <li> I even tried to incorporate this gel with my usual line-up to see if it would work better with some of my other well-performing products..</li>
            <li> Really - just read my other reviews</li>
            <li> Recently decided to go back to my natural curls.  </li>
            <li> my curls are pretty lifeless and hair gets a little frizzy.</li>
            <li> The gel I ordered from Amazon seemed a little “watered down” because it was thinner and the smell was not as strong.</li>
            <li> I generally squeeze out extra water from my hair and then scrunch lots of this gel into my hair</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter has extremely curly hair and has much healthier looking and feeling hair since using DevaCurl products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of other Deva products, though, and this is really the only one I like.</li>
            <li> - don&#x27;t keep playing with it while it&#x27;s still wet or damp), I scrunch it with my bare hands, it removes the &#x27;cast&#x27; and I have soft, shiny (not wet looking), bouncy curls.  </li>
            <li> I am convinced this is a watered down version of the real Devacurl product.</li>
            <li> This is the only gel I will use on my long, naturally wavy hair and it does not leave my hair feeling crunchy.  </li>
            <li> However, for the past few years I have been living on a budget and have not been able to afford to buy all of their products.</li>
            <li> Once dry, simply scrunch hair for soft and defined curls.  </li>
            <li> I just wash my scalp everyday with conditioner (I use Lanza Healing Color Care Conditoner since I have a HUGE gallon and don&#x27;t want to waste it.</li>
            <li> I just wash my scalp everyday with conditioner (I use Lanza Healing Color Care Conditoner since I have a HUGE gallon and don&#x27;t want to waste it.</li>
            <li> I would have to say this is my least favorite because it is so stiff...</li>
            <li> The gel is very much like a liquid, so even though my hair usually takes about 3-3.5 hours to dry, this product prolonged it.</li>
            <li> it will be hard, just crunch the stiffness out of your hair and your ready to go!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t get the large bottles without the pump and the pump stops working when you get to the last 2 inches of the gel.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, it holds my curls while it combats frizz all day-my curls can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have flat head.  </li>
            <li> A big bottle like this lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> For day 2, all I do is spritz plain old water with a little coconut oil and gently finger comb and re-scrunch.  </li>
            <li> ONLY thing, you should probably use a leave in creme or conditioner if your hair is naturally dry.</li>
            <li> And the product is so expensive too, so I really thought I would like the product (and I really did try to like this product).</li>
            <li> It always looked messy when left natural until I found this product.</li>
            <li> Having read other reviews the key is to buy from a specific reseller.</li>
            <li> Third item in the last month packaged by Amazon to arrive damaged due to inept packaging.</li>
            <li> If I use too much it can make my curls hard and crunchy</li>
            <li> AFTER YEARS OF TRYING CHEAP TO EXPENSIVE GEL, LEAVE IN CONDITIONER, MOUSSE..</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if its old or if the vendor is diluting it to make it last since its been discontinued.</li>
            <li> Drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t hold for a long time- by the end of the day</li>
            <li> She has no natural curl at all, but I have some</li>
            <li> Holds curls all day long.</li>
            <li> So, initially, it is &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; and wet looking.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strange</li>
            <li> I use a lot initially, then on day 2 and 3 I dampen my hair with wet hands, add one squirt of gel, and re-scrunch.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and leaves your hair soft and curly without weighing it down or looking wet.</li>
            <li> I have better luck with the much less expensive brands of hair gel.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Perhaps those with curlier hair benefit in some way, but there are less expensive products that work much better.  </li>
            <li> Occasionally I try other curl gels or creams, but I always wind up rinsing them out and applying Arc Angel.  </li>
            <li> The other is, well, not quite enough for me.  </li>
            <li> I have had curly curly curls for a very long time...</li>
            <li> After using this product my hair felt so dry.</li>
            <li> scrunch with a microfiber cloth and try to let it air dry after that.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> its completely dry</li>
            <li> It makes the hair look dry.</li>
            <li> I use DevaCurl no poo shampoo, leave in conditioner, scrunch dry with a t-shirt, apply gel then clip to dry.</li>
            <li> I use metal clips at the roots to give lift, the DevaFuser to dry it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a way to wrap your hair and let it dry without stretching out your curl.)  </li>
            <li> Dry with Deva Dryer or let air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once your hair is dry you can scrunch your hair again and there is never any crunchiness to this product like some.</li>
            <li> I had to wait forever for my hair to dry.</li>
            <li> LET IT DRY ...</li>
            <li> My hair hadn&#x27;t felt that dry in years.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> I then scrunch my hair with a dry piece of a paper towel.</li>
            <li> so it dosent dry my hair out</li>
            <li> There is a step to take after your hair is dry to avoid the wet-look.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t expect my hair to look amazing, but this product made my hair super greasy and just plain nasty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little less expensive, totally non-drying, and holds a lot better.</li>
            <li> This time, there wasn&#x27;t a single difference in texture.  </li>
            <li> Second day hair is never a success for me</li>
            <li> Then flip my hair upside down &amp; scrunch water out, especially @</li>
            <li> The product I received was watered down and did not do the same job.</li>
            <li> It was such a let down.</li>
            <li> My hair is no longer dry and frizzy since using Deva Care products!  </li>
            <li> I have curly hair and too lazy to hairspray it straight everyday.  </li>
            <li> I apply ArcAngel to soaking wet hair, and either air dry, plop, or diffuse.  </li>
            <li> I checked other reviews and saw other people had the same problem with this seller.</li>
            <li> I previously gave it 2 stars because I thought I noticed a big difference between the product I got at the salon and the product I got from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Far less than the salons, though not cheap by any means.  </li>
            <li> I hope this helps someone!of voluminous large curls rather than thin strands of curls.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a little and it bring curls.  </li>
            <li> This last batch was a little runny</li>
            <li> I have very very thick very curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out the hair the way that other gels do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other gels, but they tend to dry my hair out or look flaky after drying.</li>
            <li> the shower after finger combing your hair with conditioner, lightly rinse with cold water.&lt;br /&gt;Scrunch</li>
            <li> I put it in my soaking wet hair &amp; then scrunch the water out the sides with a men&#x27;s wife beater.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Deva products for a few years now and I&#x27;ll never look back.</li>
            <li> load up when I want really individual defined curls without being too heavy</li>
            <li> is still really wet</li>
            <li> It has a firm hold that will carry over for a second day if desired.  </li>
            <li> I use it on wet hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched to only using the firm hold.</li>
            <li> Spend the extra few bucks and buy it from an authorized vendor.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t wet looking or crunchy.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I scrunch this in my hair while it&#x27;s still wet</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use any other product on my wet hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was super frizzy, gross, dried, and it felt dirty.</li>
            <li> Last time I had highlights my hair felt like straw (highlights and curls don&#x27;t usually mix).  </li>
            <li> This gel is intended for curly hair, and holds extremely well.  </li>
            <li> I chose to use the ArcAngell over Angell due to the porosity of my hair.</li>
            <li> DevaCare Arc Angel is different from any ordinary hair gels.  </li>
            <li> When she recommended Arc Angel and used it on my hair it held without the stiffness of the other over the counter one I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With summer around the corner, I opted to order the ArcAngel gel for its more \\&quot;controlling\\&quot; formula than the other DevaCurl gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying it out, I am truly disappointed in how this stuff performs.</li>
            <li> Whether with this gel or any other, ever.&lt;br /&gt;- NO COMBING OR FINGER-COMBING</li>
            <li> I have vey thick very coarse very dry curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long, curley and heavy.</li>
            <li> Leaves them slightly crunchy so that i can fluff my curls to arrange them while still maintaining the spiral.</li>
            <li> but something is not right with the one purchased thru here.</li>
            <li> My hair always looked tiger stripey (and silly, really)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products for my thick, unruly, curly hair and nothing</li>
            <li> After it actually dried, I expected miraculous curls after being put through that 5 hour or so ordeal, but nope.</li>
            <li> I flip my hair upside down &amp; scrunch it in from the bottom up.</li>
            <li> However, it IS a heavier product that did make my hair feel as though it was being \\&quot;weighed\\&quot; down.</li>
            <li> Never leaves my hair weighed down or crunchy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel sticky or weighed down.</li>
            <li> It tends to weigh my hair down if I use it alone.  </li>
            <li> After a couple minutes, I take my towel off and apply gel to my hair upside down.</li>
            <li> When I received the gel from Amazon it seemed watered down.  </li>
            <li> so I put a half dollar coin size in my hand.</li>
            <li> When I let my curls out they hold their curl all day and less frizz.  </li>
            <li> but I think I prefer the less firming gel.</li>
            <li> Out of fairness, I have to edit my previous review.</li>
            <li> I do use less but not that much less.</li>
            <li> and if I succeed, it is a poofy mess.</li>
            <li> It defines curls, keeps the frizz down, and isn&#x27;t sticky or heavy at all.</li>
            <li> you just have to shake the curls out a little bit</li>
            <li> and when I&#x27;m bumming around a little bit does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;Deva</li>
            <li> My hair puffed out and looked huge (which is not something that my already enormous hair benefits from) with awful curls that looked like I had a</li>

            <li> washing everyday.</li>
            <li> washing everyday.</li>
            <li> i have been using these products for a few years now</li>
            <li> After using the cleanser and conditioner, I dried my hair with a towel and combed it out.  </li>
            <li> It can also give that slightly messy, wind blown look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not to heavy but holds well.</li>
            <li> iit leaves my hair firm but not sticky ...</li>
            <li> What a waste.  </li>
            <li> Again, what a waste.  </li>
            <li> but like I mentioned, if a firm hold is what you&#x27;re looking for...</li>
            <li> So it arrived in a messy condition and is messy to use, but I like the gel itself.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy a feel on the hair.</li>
            <li> Once dried, I tip my head upside-down, scrunch my hair again, and sometimes give myself a llittle scalp massage to release the &#x27;crunchiness&#x27;.</li>
            <li> waste your money buying this from the salon.</li>
            <li> This is the firm hold</li>
            <li> but she gave me golden blonde highlights and broke up my base (it took 5 MINUTES to break my almost black base to a golden brown, unbelievable).  </li>
            <li> It does not leave your hair stiff and brittle.  </li>
            <li> Hair was sticky, stiff and still frizzy which has never happened when purchased elsewhere.</li>
            <li> My hair dries in a strange curl and is very hard and sticky.</li>
            <li> Formula seems different, unpleasant texture to my hair and curls not as defined as with prior use</li>
            <li> ALTHOUGH, when mine shipped, the pump top was broken :-(</li>
            <li> I also exaggerated when I said that I only had to use half the amount of the salon product.</li>
            <li> Unlike other gels that seriously makes your hair feel like a package of spiral noodles (and then on windy days, you get wacked with them in the face???</li>
            <li> I do not trust my curls with any other gel!!!</li>
            <li> but I got past it.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of it but not sure if I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why I am having no luck with it.</li>
            <li> Definetly not pleased with this product from this seller and will not purchase again from this seller.</li>
            <li> so I have the small Deva bottles to refill so this helps with that, but also, this lasts me over a year.  </li>
            <li> It takes a small amount, as this is a firm-hold gel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on my hair for the past 2 years.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of cash!  </li>
            <li> NO MORE FIZZ....</li>
            <li> so not sure what happened there?  </li>
            <li> NO MORE DRYING YOUR HAIR WITH A TOWEL.  </li>
            <li> Devacurls Arc angel Firm Hold defining Gel!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a gel that would work on a wash and go as well as twist outs and braid outs without making my hair look stiff and dull.</li>
            <li> The No-Poo is no better than VO5 Kiwi Lime conditioner (I secret I discovered from a beauty review website) and is ten times less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical that a gel could dry crunchy, but scrunch out to the softest curls ever.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the 32 oz bottle and having very thick, tightly coiled 4a hair</li>
            <li> Before my stylist introduced me to the DevaCurl line, I felt I had two choices: Frizzy hair or hard hair from products claiming to be \\&quot;for curly hair.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Unlike drug store hair gels intended for curly hair, I do not end up with crinkle curls or hard like glue curls.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides the frizz issue, my hair looked dull, felt like straw, and was crunchy and hard.</li>
            <li> Not too stiff and defined curls!!</li>
            <li> The smell is a little weird</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got the curly hair that&#x27;s rather difficult to tame.  </li>
            <li> It is NOT worth the money!!!!</li>
            <li> Sent it back. :(</li>
            <li> I have a tough time scrunching the crunch out</li>
            <li> NO MORE FRIZZ BALL!!  </li>
            <li> And, some gels give this whitish, dusty, ashy look if you accidentally &amp;#34;break&amp;#34; the cast...not this.  </li>
            <li> By the afternoon, my hair felt even dirtier and it looked even worse than it did in the morning:</li>
            <li> I have gone through 40 years having to wash my hair every day because the hair products I was using was making my hair dirty, frizzy and and dried out.  </li>
            <li> I have other products in my hair and sometimes gels can react badly with creams, this does not.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There is a difference but not as bad as I previously mentioned.  </li>
            <li> I hated my curly hair when I was younger (who didn&#x27;t?)</li>
            <li> I HATED this gel back when I used to style my hair by twisting each strand around my fingers, (making me look like apoodle, what choice did I Have?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to describe the smell, I guess you can describe it as an artificial citrus smell (obviously it&#x27;s artificial), but I think this product tried so hard to make the gel smell citrus-y</li>
            <li> Dissapointed Amazon has not looked into this, will be returning this bottle as it is useless.</li>
            <li> It is misleading and it made me sad.  </li>
            <li> According to the videos, I don&#x27;t even need a gel, but they&#x27;re wrong.  </li>
            <li> and I have been addicted to deva curl!</li>
            <li> It works wonders on my hair and it&#x27;s not sticky / difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when a hairdresser tried to sell it to me.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I was still disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus pump was broken- do not buy from this buyer!</li>
            <li> It is either fake or from a bad batch.  </li>
            <li> This is disappointing because I specifically ordered from this post because it showed the pump and others did not.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m no spring chicken.)</li>
            <li> My hair felt greasy and dirty</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a bad hair day since I started using these products two years ago.</li>
            <li> SO FAKE!!</li>
            <li> I bought it and hate the smell of it but did not notice the name until another poster pointed it out.  </li>
            <li> Ouid*d in NYC).I hated the result.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> so I was very disappointed in the gel.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I would have given 5 stars but my product leaked during mailing. Otherwise, I love that this doesn&#x27;t leave your hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;,  my hair remainsremains soft and pliable. Best of all its not full of toxic and harsh  ingredients!</li>
            <li> I use this daily, even with washing only 1 or 2 times a week there is no buildup and no crunch.  I like the look of silicone gels but not the junk.  To get the same shine as others I scrunch with a light layer of sweet almond oil once my hair is 1/2 dry.</li>
            <li> DevaCurl angel is the best product that I have found for my curly hair..and I have tired many items.  I love the whole line of this product because it defines my curls so my hair is not frizzy the curls are bouncy and shiny.</li>
            <li> Made by the original \\&quot;curly girl\\&quot; lady. this gel really tames my frizz without completely discouraging my curls. It lasts longer than most other products, even in humid weather. Love it!</li>
            <li> I do not trust my curls with any other gel!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!! Its the best stuff for my curly hair. Leaves them slightly crunchy so that i can fluff my curls to arrange them while still maintaining the spiral. I&#x27;ve used this for 5 years now.</li>
            <li> Product smells so good and does everything it states it will do! So long as you follow the directions and let your hair dry without touching it, my hair has never looked more frizz-free or healthier. My curls are much more defined and soft to the touch...ONLY thing, you should probably use a leave in creme or conditioner if your hair is naturally dry. Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> A lot of other curly hair product lines require that you use their special shampoo, their special conditioner, their special gel, their special leave-in conditioner, etc. in order for your hair to look good (and each of these things can cost $20 or more).  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products for my thick, unruly, curly hair and nothing has worked better than DevaCare Arc Angell.  I can use whatever shampoo and conditioner I want--including the cheap stuff from the drug store--and as long as I follow with Arc Angell my hair looks great!  Even better is that my hair isn&#x27;t sticky, nor does it have that plastic hair gel look to it.  It looks natural and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad this is now being offered at Amazon. Great price for a great product. I wish I had known about it years ago!</li>
            <li> I have been using this gel for many years and glad I can find the large size here.  I have very very thick very curly hair.  With this I end up with nice curls and it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or hard/crunchy.  I use several of Deva&#x27;s products and they work well for my hair, a great line of products.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter has extremely curly hair and has much healthier looking and feeling hair since using DevaCurl products. Highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> Have used this product before.  The new bottle I received is very watery and does not hold.  I see several reviews with the same comment.  It is either fake or from a bad batch.  Dissapointed Amazon has not looked into this, will be returning this bottle as it is useless.</li>
            <li> I have used the light hold Deva gel and it was fine for part of my hair but my right side curls are stubborn and more frizzy than anywhere else on my head (!) so I bought this firm hold gel, used it on my stubborn side and got much better results.  No crunch, good curl definition and lots of shine.  Love the Deva Care products.  After 53 years, I&#x27;m finally liking my curls; what a relief!</li>
            <li> Holds curls well and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  Works best when applied to dripping wet hair.  Drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t hold for a long time- by the end of the day my curls are pretty lifeless and hair gets a little frizzy.</li>
            <li> Love the Gel but the containers top doesn&#x27;t work.  It wouldn&#x27;t turn to use the pump to get the gel out.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my hairdresser who also gave me instructions how to use on my new curly &#x27;do.  Using this along with WEN Sweet Almond Mint Repleninshing Mist is helping me rock the curly girl look.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Best gel ever! I keep trying to find cheaper options but I always end up coming back to this gel! No other product can make my curls as beautiful as this gel does! I love it and I will continue to buy it!</li>
            <li> I used this on damp hair for a twist out and must say I am very pleased. Nay - ecstatic! I have been looking for a gel that would work on a wash and go as well as twist outs and braid outs without making my hair look stiff and dull. I used the smallest amount and have perfectly cork-screwed hair. It is shiny, full of body and bounce and there is not a flake in sight. I have other products in my hair and sometimes gels can react badly with creams, this does not.&lt;br /&gt;I did add the gel to damp hair on one section and let semi-dry to see how my curls would look with a wash and go and the gel elongated and defined my curls. I cannot say how long that would last, but will update my review as I try more styles. I purchased the 32 oz bottle and having very thick, tightly coiled 4a hair I know this was a good deal and will last me months. The scent is pleasant and not over powering and the results are amazing. Definitely worth a try if you want something versatile that will give great hold and beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. According to curlmart.com I have 3a/b type curls or Botticelli curls according to Deva Curl. I like this product because it gives me definition without making my curls feel greasy or sticky. If I use too much it can make my curls hard and crunchy so I put a half dollar coin size in my hand. I flip my hair upside down &amp; scrunch it in from the bottom up. I also use moose &amp; gloss drops before I add this product into my hair.</li>
            <li> This gel is the first gel I have ever used that doesn&#x27;t leave my hands sticky or my hair crunchy!  I have curly hair and will never buy another gel again.  My curls look product-free, soft, and hold all day.  The cap was damaged in shipping and Amazon customer service was amazing!  Great product, good price, fabulous customer service!</li>
            <li> I love this gel so much, it really helps create nice curls, smells really herbal and fresh, and adds shine. The whole line of Deva products is top notch</li>
            <li> This is is great gel!!! I use it with the No Poo shampoo and conditioner and they work great together. I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> My hair is no longer dry and frizzy since using Deva Care products!  I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have learned to embrace and show off my curls now.</li>
            <li> This is the best gel for curly hair.  It is lightweight and leaves your hair soft and curly without weighing it down or looking wet.</li>
            <li> Love.Love.Love. I have used this for years and have no desire to try anything else!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE Arc Angel, but the pump stopped working shortly after purchase making it a real chore to use. Wish they provided caps as an alternative to the pump.</li>
            <li> Love this gel, great product for curly hair</li>
            <li> I hated my curly hair when I was younger (who didn&#x27;t?) but now that I am an adult I have learned to love and embrace what nature gave me. This Gel has transformed my mane!  Before my stylist introduced me to the DevaCurl line, I felt I had two choices: Frizzy hair or hard hair from products claiming to be \\&quot;for curly hair.\\&quot;  The entire DevaCurl line is amazing, I recommend it to anyone with curly hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The photo of the item showed the pump.  The bottle did NOT come with a pump, just a regular gel-bottle top.  This is disappointing because I specifically ordered from this post because it showed the pump and others did not.</li>
            <li> I am a curly girl.  I like Deva products.  I use Deva products.  I was pumped when I saw that Arc Angel came in a huge bottle with a pump.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000TKH6FI Deva Care Arc Angel Firm Hold Defining Gel, 32-Ounce Bottle]]&lt;br /&gt;When the bottle arrived at my doorstep, I took everything out of the box, but there was no pump. Please do not add accessories, like a pump, to the picture if that is not what is actually going to be sent.  It is misleading and it made me sad.  Also, the packaging people put a very sticky tape over the top of the cap.  That made me slightly more sad.</li>
            <li> Pay close attention....it looks like this is NOT Deva Curl but it is named Deva Care.  It does not feel, look or smell like Deva Curl.  I bought it and hate the smell of it but did not notice the name until another poster pointed it out.  My hair is not quite as shiny and soft as it was before.  Can&#x27;t believe they can sell this with the name and look so similar to Deva Curl.  I guess that is why it is cheaper.  I will be more careful next time to make sure I get real Deva Curl products!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It defines curls, keeps the frizz down, and isn&#x27;t sticky or heavy at all. I don&#x27;t have to use any other product on my wet hair. Before I started using this I was using a gel, mousse, and anti-frizz. And I never got the results I do now! I&#x27;d highly recommend this product to any Curly Girl out there!</li>
            <li> The only gel that works for my hair without leaving it crunchy and sticky. I always recommend DevaChan to my friends with curly hair.</li>
            <li> After using this product my hair felt so dry. It also didn&#x27;t reduce volume enough for me and I used a lot of it. For someone with a thick and very curly hair I think that the Ausie gels that you can buy conveniently from any store will  do a better job.</li>
            <li> Best product on the market for curly hair</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Deva products for a little over a year and love them. The gel holds my curls and are no longer \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot;. I also use curly hair solutions in conjunction with the Deva gel to help with frizz. Wouldn&#x27;t go back to \\&quot;regular\\&quot; products.</li>
            <li> This is the best gel for curly hair out there! Trust me! I am a curly hair stylist and have tried A LOT! This leaves your hair soft, controlled and with no frizz! Works great with Deva Curl Set it Free also! See a curly hair specialist to get more tips on using! [...]</li>
            <li> Very very happy with this product.  I use this with Sunsilk Hydra TLC and my hair is very soft and manageable, even on rainy days.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for keeping curly hair tame. I was also impressed that this company had the gel arrive in the same amount of time that I was told it would.</li>
            <li> This product defines my curls better than ever! Wouldn&#x27;t style my hair without it.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and have always had to put lots of gel in it to keep it in check.  I purchased this on a whim and just bought another 32oz bottle -- it really works well for my hair!  I generally squeeze out extra water from my hair and then scrunch lots of this gel into my hair (sides, back, flipped)then wrap up my curls in a long-sleeved shirt for a while (sometimes even overnight).  When I let my curls out they hold their curl all day and less frizz.  The bonus with this gel is its lovely citrus-y scent.  It&#x27;s a favorite of mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended for ladies with natural curls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have since purchased this product again and noticed that the quality is different -- the gel seems thinner and does not have as much hold as before.  I&#x27;m taking one star off for this.  I think I may purchase it again in the future in the hopes that I just got a \\&quot;dud\\&quot; bottle.</li>
            <li> Deva is great for curly hair. I use many of their products and especially like Arc Angel Gel. I am constantly asked which products I use on my hair, and I always recommend Deva!</li>
            <li> This is the only gel I use on my natural curls!</li>
            <li> If your hair gets poofy, Deva Arc Angell may help.  My coworkers and friends commented that my hair looked curlier after using this product. It does hold my curls better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used and can be reactivated by spritizing with water. However, it IS a heavier product that did make my hair feel as though it was being \\&quot;weighed\\&quot; down. On humid days, it felt sticky.</li>
            <li> I HATED this gel back when I used to style my hair by twisting each strand around my fingers, (making me look like apoodle, what choice did I Have?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I booked a cut with Ana on a whim in Dec 08.  Who knew a cut was that important.  I&#x27;ve been to another curly hair salon (am I allowed to name?  Ouid*d in NYC).I hated the result.  At Devachan, I was TAUGHT how to use the products and it&#x27;s changed my ritual.  I truly thought only I knew how to style my hair (naturally, after all my hair disasters).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I style with One Condition (yes, it can be used as a styler! How cool is that!).  I put it in my soaking wet hair &amp; then scrunch the water out the sides with a men&#x27;s wife beater.  Then flip my hair upside down &amp; scrunch water out, especially @ the roots so I don&#x27;t have flat head.  Then I SCRUNCH this gel INTO my hair, first the sides then back then over the outside of hair.  This is the 1st time I ever wore hair products where I didn&#x27;t saturate my hair and wait HOURS for my hair to dry before looking good.  I am so happy I don&#x27;t look like a wet poodle anymore!  Oh and ESMERELDA highlighted my hair using the Pintura method (like balayage, hair painting the highlights on).  She is like an artist.  My hair always looked tiger stripey (and silly, really) but she gave me golden blonde highlights and broke up my base (it took 5 MINUTES to break my almost black base to a golden brown, unbelievable).  Also, I wasn&#x27;t nickel and dimed.  I was told my highlights were $189 and that is exactly how much I paid for them.  And she styled me afterwards, no surprise add ons.  Last time I had highlights my hair felt like straw (highlights and curls don&#x27;t usually mix).  This time, there wasn&#x27;t a single difference in texture.  I feel so purdy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: You will receive too many compliments on how good ur hair smells (enter conceited strut).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a hint, the reason you don&#x27;t need so many products is these really hold the curls into thick clumps of voluminous large curls rather than thin strands of curls.  If you try it this way or have Devachan teach you, I am sure you will love it.  It took me 2 tries before I was like, ok I can do this confidently.  OH AND I USE THE CLIPS AT MY ROOTS WHILE I DO MY MAKEUP. I can even wake up and go by spraying in a lil \\&quot;Set if Free\\&quot; and adding more One Condition.  And I No-Poo once a week instead of washing everyday. I just wash my scalp everyday with conditioner (I use Lanza Healing Color Care Conditoner since I have a HUGE gallon and don&#x27;t want to waste it. It works really good).  I hope this helps someone!of voluminous large curls rather than thin strands of curls.  If you try it this way or have Devachan teach you, I am sure you will love it.

            <li> I have used this product for almost a year and I love it! I have curly hair and it helps make my curls defined and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have ridiculously soft curly hair. It gets frizzy very easily. This product helps maintain the shape and frizz in a way I never thought possible. My curls are tight and maintain their shape all day, no matter how many times I push my hair back. I highly recommend this product, including the Nopoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> i have been using these products for a few years now and i still love how my curls hold without getting crunchy or dry.</li>
            <li> The Arc Angel was not what I was expecting in a &amp;#34;firm holding gel&amp;#34;. My hair was just as frizzy as if I used NO holding gel what-so-ever. I must simply stick to the Deva Curl Ultra defining gel (which is awesome &amp; works as described with my curls). The seller was awesome though in understanding so I did receive a refund.&lt;br /&gt;Word of warning the Deva Curl and Deva Care are different so see what will work best with your hair.</li>
            <li> this product is one of Devachan&#x27;s best-especially for curly hair. It doesn&#x27;t dry out the hair the way that other gels do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was also packaged very nicely so that there was no spill and the pump worked like a charm to the last drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;because of the great quality of the product and packaging method I am giving this 5 stars</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair, Deva products are the products to use.  My curls dry frizz free for the first time.  Love, love, love!</li>
            <li> I know this product is supposed to be for people with curly hair, but I just had to give it a try.  I have long, straight caucasian hair.  A hair stylist told a friend of mine with short straight hair that Deva Curl products would make her hair curl.  She tried it and it worked. It gave her waves and body.  So, I had to give it a try.  I have hair where a couple pieces curl in the rain but that&#x27;s about it.  I bought Deva Curl Low Poo, Deva Curl One Conditioner, and Deva Care Arc Angel Gel.  After using the cleanser and conditioner, I dried my hair with a towel and combed it out.  I could see waves starting to happen.  I scrunched in the Arc Angel Gel, and I had waves and body.  I really couldn&#x27;t believe it.  It made my straight fine hair look wavy, almost like I had a body perm.  It can also give that slightly messy, wind blown look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel has a strong hold and gives nice body.  Your hair still has bounce and freedom to move.  It does not leave your hair stiff and brittle.  I plan to use it when I use my rollers to curl my hair next time.  I think it will give it great hold without that crunchy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother has shoulder length, straight, thin, baby fine caucasian hair that is damaged and color treated.  She is hooked on this gel.  It gives her hair fullness and body.  It doesn&#x27;t curl her hair, but it makes her hair look fuller and lay better.  Without it, her hair looks stringy and uncombed.  She has no natural curl at all, but I have some and I think that&#x27;s why it curls my hair and not hers.</li>
            <li> If I just use one pump on my shoulder-length hair, it&#x27;s perfect. Gives body. Holds curl. Prevents frizz. Looks good 2-3 days! More than one pump makes it sticky. I&#x27;ve had it since November and I&#x27;ve used only about 5-6 oz.  My 32oz bottle my last longer than I do! (I&#x27;m no spring chicken.)</li>
            <li> You have to know how to use it..&lt;br /&gt;In the shower after finger combing your hair with conditioner, lightly rinse with cold water.&lt;br /&gt;Scrunch this through your hair, and use A LOT!&lt;br /&gt;Then scrunch with a microfiber cloth and try to let it air dry after that.&lt;br /&gt;Once its completely dry it will be hard, just crunch the stiffness out of your hair and your ready to go!</li>
            <li> I night this for my kids who have curly hair. The smell is a little weird but I got past it. Pop  What I do t like is that I feel like it dries out the hair and it does not add any shine. It makes the hair look dry. I normally have add a shine serum to it. I like the consistency of it but not sure if I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product - wouldn&#x27;t go out of the house without it! Buying on Amazon is much cheaper than the salon stores</li>
            <li> Deva Curl products have changed my life! Go to their website for more info on product use. Arc Angel is a very strong hold for very curly hair. If yours is not &amp;#34;very&amp;#34; curly, try a gel a step or two lighter. Great products!! ALTHOUGH, when mine shipped, the pump top was broken :-( It is cheaper on Amazon, but to not risk it, I buy mine at Ulta.</li>
            <li> Love  love love this gel. Important to scrunch it and break cast once dry. I highly recommend using deva curl products.</li>
            <li> Best hair gel for curly girls! It&#x27;s been my favorite for years!!</li>
            <li> I like the product but I think I prefer the less firming gel. My curls and hair felt better with the other gel.</li>
            <li> this is a great gel that does not leave a film and makes my natural curl hold with no frizz.</li>
            <li> I learned about Deva Care products through a Deva Curly hair stylist about 2 years ago and now love my curly hair again. It keeps my hair from getting frizzy in humid weather and holds the curls firmly or loosely in place depending on how much product I use. I highly recommend this for anyone with curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have used many DevaCurl products and have been very happy with them so I was very disappointed in the gel. It is very watery and I need a lot to keep my hair from getting frizzy. My hair dries in a strange curl and is very hard and sticky. I have a tough time scrunching the crunch out and if I succeed, it is a poofy mess. I follow the whole curly girl hair regime. I use DevaCurl no poo shampoo, leave in conditioner, scrunch dry with a t-shirt, apply gel then clip to dry. I have better luck with the much less expensive brands of hair gel.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this gel because there were many 5 star reviews that specifically mentioned that it did not dry hard or sticky. I am not sure why I am having no luck with it.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to the devacurl line about 10 years ago and I have loved every product I have tried. However, for the past few years I have been living on a budget and have not been able to afford to buy all of their products. The arc angel gel is the only product that I cannot do without. No other gel on the market can compare (and believe me---I&#x27;ve tried them all). Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this product. Your hair will never look better!</li>
            <li> My favorite gel. Not to heavy but holds well.</li>
            <li> been using this for a year now, still in love with it.</li>
            <li> This gel is intended for curly hair, and holds extremely well.  Designed for those who scrunch their curls and air dry their hair, it also works very well with a hair dryer and diffuser.</li>
            <li> Love this gel! Holds curls all day long. Never leaves my hair weighed down or crunchy. Defiantly recommend for anyone with curly hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever tried&lt;br /&gt;, and to get it at such a great price is a super bonus!</li>
            <li> For a girl with very curly hair, I love this product. I enjoy the whole product line of Deva products.Its not sticky. My hair thanks you.</li>
            <li> This product is not sticky and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair crunchy. I feel it&#x27;s worth the money to purchase the big bottle since I use this product daily.</li>
            <li> For my fine, thin, curly hair, this gel performs better than anything else I&#x27;ve used.  Previously I needed to use a &amp;#34;cocktail&amp;#34; of products to get decent results.  With Arc Angel, I only need one styling product to get beautiful curl formation.  I was skeptical that a gel could dry crunchy, but scrunch out to the softest curls ever.  It really works.</li>
            <li> This hair gel is the best I&#x27;ve used.  It is lightweight once it dries - you just have to shake the curls out a little bit and you have smooth curls all day without being too crunchy.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Great product.  It provides support for curly hair without making my hair feel sticky or like it has product on it.</li>
            <li> I a, a huge fan of Deva products and have used Arcangel before. I am convinced this is a watered down version of the real Devacurl product. Buyers beware!</li>
            <li> I am a woman over 40 with naturally curly, mixed race hair.  I have spent decades trying to find the right mix of products to tame the curls and keep them soft, shiny and frizz free.  This product blows me away.  My curls are beautiful and bouncy all day (and often into the next).  For best results, on humid days, I use the gel liberally and let air dry or diffuse.  Once dry, simply scrunch hair for soft and defined curls.  (I would also recommend using the techniques in the Curly Girl book - you can find here on Amazon).  The gel has a light, fresh scent and can be reactivated later in the day by simply misting with water if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has never looked better or been healthier than when I started using this product line.  I will not go back to silicone, paraben or sulfate based products ever.  I highly recommend this to anyone who asks me about what I use on my hair (and I am asked or complimented often).  I can&#x27;t say enough about this gel...it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this last week and been using it for almost a week and it really doesn&#x27;t do well for curly hair. If your hair type is dry,wavy,frizzy and curly pass on this product.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day. I wash my hair one or two times a week and condition every day. This arc angel gel holds my curls nicely and all day with no frizz. Love. I do wish the Deva curl products were cheaper but Amazon has the best prices I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I have been trying every product under the sun to get my hait to \\&quot;behave.\\&quot;  The fact that you&#x27;re reading these reviews demonstrates you&#x27;re same journey.  I decided to try the DevaCurl/Care line because NOBODY has trashed the line, and almost every product has had great reviews.  In watching the Deva videos, I determined that I have the Botticelli curly hair type.  According to the videos, I don&#x27;t even need a gel, but they&#x27;re wrong.  I purchased this gel because it was said to give a stronger hold than the DevaCurl gel.What I do like about this gel, is that when used as instructed, my curls hang more naturally, and I have cork screw curls towards the bottom.  To get this effect I have to use a significant amount of product (my hair is down to my bottom) my hair has to be super wet and it drips all over me for about an hour.  The curls look great at first, but with movement, they separate and become frizzy and tangled.  I&#x27;ve been using TIGI Massive Shine Hairspray to help to minimize this problem.  With traditional gels, I&#x27;ve been able to wear my hair at least 2-3 days just doing some touching up, but with this product, one day is all I get.  But this gel is not as drying on my hair, so I guess its a trade off.  Unless I saw this product highly discounted, I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. So far, my best regiment has been to use L&#x27;Anza Hair Repair leave-in condidtioner, followed by Arrojo Styling Creme, finishing up with TIGI Massive Shine Hairspray.  It&#x27;s a little less expensive, totally non-drying, and holds a lot better.</li>
            <li> I chose to use the ArcAngell over Angell due to the porosity of my hair. ArcAngell provides my hair with additional moisture while still helping to maintain my curl. Unlike drug store hair gels intended for curly hair, I do not end up with crinkle curls or hard like glue curls. My hair is not sticky or gross after using this product.</li>
            <li> Great product for curly hair. Leaves a nice, soft, curly style, without the frizz.</li>
            <li> Gel hold works well. Not as well as Holdon gel. Bit I still like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. It holds, reduces frizziness, yet doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.</li>
            <li> I regularly purchase this product from ulta and have never had a problem. For some reason this formula that I recieve from this seller does not work the same. My curls do not look hydarated and I have lots of frizz going on. Definetly not pleased with this product from this seller and will not purchase again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the Deva line of products.  Really - just read my other reviews and you&#x27;ll get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this gel.  Unlike other gels that seriously makes your hair feel like a package of spiral noodles (and then on windy days, you get wacked with them in the face??? OUCH!), this gel creates a cast.  So, initially, it is &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; and wet looking.  But, once my hair fully dries (that&#x27;s the trick - don&#x27;t keep playing with it while it&#x27;s still wet or damp), I scrunch it with my bare hands, it removes the &#x27;cast&#x27; and I have soft, shiny (not wet looking), bouncy curls.  And, seriously soft.  I had a girl touch my hair yesterday because she didn&#x27;t believe I put gel in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix this with the Styling Cream.  It is perfect.  I use metal clips at the roots to give lift, the DevaFuser to dry it.  On days I am just hanging around home, I use the clips alone.  I leave them in to keep the roots lifted and when my hair is done air drying, I take the clips out, scrunch and it&#x27;s still beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big bottle is perfect with the pump.  I travel a lot so I have the small Deva bottles to refill so this helps with that, but also, this lasts me over a year.  I actually purchased this bottle for my mom to use (who is now hooked on the Deva line once she saw all the compliments I got!) as my bottle is still half full.  I recommend this highly! It&#x27;s the first gel that does what it says and doesn&#x27;t give you crunchy hair (once you remove the cast).  And, some gels give this whitish, dusty, ashy look if you accidentally &amp;#34;break&amp;#34; the cast...not this.  This is a cast meant to be broken! :)</li>
            <li> I started using DevaCurl products a few months ago, and my hair has never looked better.  After I wash, condition, and comb my hair with a wide-tooth comb, I use a cotton t-shirt to remove excess moisture.  Then I flip my hair over (upside-down) and apply Arc Angel, scrunching it from ends to roots.  It takes a small amount, as this is a firm-hold gel.  Then, I plop my hair.  (You can look up videos to show you how to do this.  It&#x27;s a way to wrap your hair and let it dry without stretching out your curl.)  When I take it down, I have thick strands of beautiful curls that hold their shape all day.  The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff and sticky, and like all DevaCurl products, it smells great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on my hair for the past 2 years.  The delivery this time was particularly speedy - which I sincerely appreciate because I don&#x27;t use anything else except my WEN Fig Cleansing Conditioner. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely reorder in the future.</li>
            <li> Best thing ever for my hair.  I have curly hair and too lazy to hairspray it straight everyday.  This works incredibly!</li>
            <li> I love this gel. It works better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. My curls are soft and defined with no frizz.</li>
            <li> I swear by anything Deva.  Absolute best products for curly hair.  Their website also has great tips.  This is the only gel I will ever use!</li>
            <li> This was a gift to my daughter who loves this products</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;ve tried everything for Curly Hair for South FL weather and this stuff really works against normal &amp;#34;BAD HAIR DAYS&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Holds curl with out making hair all crunchy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Deva products for a few years now and I&#x27;ll never look back. My hair has totally changed for the better. I went shampoo-free for the first time three years ago and the Deva line helped me do it.&lt;br /&gt;Has enough hold to give me the definition and volume that I like, non-sticky, no residue, really clean orange-ey smell. Always been safe on my hair color.&lt;br /&gt;Can load up when I want really individual defined curls without being too heavy and when I&#x27;m bumming around a little bit does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;Deva for life!!!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and I have been addicted to deva curl! This gel is great no more crunchy hair:) Just follow the directions on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have had curly curly curls for a very long time...and I love this gel. It works Every time to tame the curls and make me love love love having curly curls!</li>
            <li> Great hold for 3b hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many brands and formulations of hair gels I couldn&#x27;t remember them if I tried.  DevaCare Arc Angel is different from any ordinary hair gels.  I apply ArcAngel to soaking wet hair, and either air dry, plop, or diffuse.  That&#x27;s it.  My hair turns out beautifully and my curls last. For second day or third day hair, Arc Angel is easily reactivated with DevaCurl Set It Free or Mist-er Right, and my hair looks freshly styled. Occasionally I try other curl gels or creams, but I always wind up rinsing them out and applying Arc Angel.  My hair just likes it best.  It gives me definition, hold, shine, and moisturization.  Even if dew points are extremely low, this keeps dryness and frizz at bay! The best part about this gel is it never gets crunchy or crispy.  It solidifies, creating a a pliable gel coating that doesn&#x27;t flake or crack. It \\&quot;scrunches out\\&quot;  extremely easily without causing frizz. I enjoy its mild, citrus scent, too. Arc Angel is a must have for me to feel like my hair looks its best.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist introduced me to the Deva product line for my curly hair.  When she recommended Arc Angel and used it on my hair it held without the stiffness of the other over the counter one I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> I love this product-have used it for years-but first time from this buyer. Shipping was fast and the product was great!!!</li>
            <li> Not authentic Deva Care product, made my head itch and hair became very crunchy!!!</li>
            <li> Everything was great and just as ordered....</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever used for naturally curly hair!  Shampoo &amp; conditioner are AWESOME, too!</li>
            <li> if you have curly hair deva products are a must.  been using for 6 years and still get compliments on my curly hair</li>
            <li> My wife claims this to be the absolute best curly-hair product on the market.  She&#x27;s been using, and thus I&#x27;ve been ordering, it regularly for a while now.</li>
            <li> I like this product it works better than any gel product I&#x27;ve ever used. However, it does leave a sticky residue on my hands. Could be better.</li>
            <li> My two daughters&#x27; have super curly hair. They are white and African American.  This product was wonderful for their curls.  It made them shiny and by using the Deva No-poo and conditioner also, their hair was amazingly manageable and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Deva products 2 yrs ago.  I will never switch!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Use No Poo Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;2. Follow with One Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;3. Style with the BEST GEL ... Arc Angel&lt;br /&gt;4. Dry with Deva Dryer or let air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all you will ever need to make your curls look their best.&lt;br /&gt;People will stop you and comment on how great your hair looks.  Who could ask for anything more.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember how many times I&#x27;ve bought this... It works wonders on my hair and it&#x27;s not sticky / difficult to apply. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fun a devacurl products. I highly recommend all of their products and suggest others to visit their website for tips on choosing the right products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the one the hair salon is using. It&#x27;s strange</li>
            <li> My wife bought this product and she is writing this review.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this product.  This gel holds my curls just as advertised on the side of the bottle.  I highly recommend to any &amp;#34;curly girl&amp;#34; out there.</li>
            <li> My order was quick and smooth. Recieved my Deva Products within a week. I use alot of Deva products and have been happy with all that I have tryed. The best part is it is sulfa free and it leaves my hair feeling smooth. I recommend this for anyone with curly hair that is dry and breaks easy.</li>
            <li> Great product for my curly hair...iit leaves my hair firm but not sticky ...i used it for years and will continue using it</li>
            <li> I started using this after going to a stylist that was taught to cut curly hair by the creator of the Deva line and I am now a fan. I had always put gel on after getting out of the shower but I was told to lock in the curl its best to apply it while still in the shower and hair is still really wet, I definitely see a big difference and recommend this method.</li>
            <li> Sulfate and silicone free. Perfect for curly hair. It has a firm hold that will carry over for a second day if desired.  No lingering scent. Washes out of the hair almost completely with only water.  I use No-poo in the shower but sometimes I don&#x27;t think I need it because I use this gel.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, it holds my curls while it combats frizz all day-my curls can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> great service and I get lots of compliments on my hair</li>
            <li> Great for thick hair. Preserves soft curls very well. I was skeptical when a hairdresser tried to sell it to me. But there&#x27;s just about nothing better for curls.</li>
            <li> great product for curly hair - this has lasted me quite a few months as you only need a small amount!</li>
            <li> Works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried so far to keep my curl separated and frizz free. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it smells incredible. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel sticky or weighed down. I love it!</li>
            <li> I use this as the third step in my Curly Girl regimen. It sets my curls beautifully. Once your hair is dry you can scrunch your hair again and there is never any crunchiness to this product like some.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got the curly hair that&#x27;s rather difficult to tame.  This gel smells great, doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling sticky and tames wild curls.</li>
            <li> great hair product for curly hair! some of the best!</li>
            <li> This did absolutely zero for my hair.  It didn&#x27;t hold my hair at all and didn&#x27;t control frizz.  What a waste of cash!  My stylist recommended No-Poo, Set It Free and Arc Angel and I, foolishly, purchased all three products because he assured me that for best results I should use all three in conjunction with one another.  Hogwash!  Now I&#x27;m out $60 and have almost full bottles stashed in my hall closet that I have no intention of using again.  What a waste.  I don&#x27;t know what all the hype about this hair care line is about.  Perhaps those with curlier hair benefit in some way, but there are less expensive products that work much better.  Got2be Shine Serum controls frizz even in high humidity and their Kinkier mousse is strong but not crunchy and the hold lasts all day.  I have no idea what I&#x27;ll do with what&#x27;s left of the Deva products.  Perhaps someone with curly hair will come into my life and I can offload them on someone else.  I surely won&#x27;t use them ever again.  The No-Poo is no better than VO5 Kiwi Lime conditioner (I secret I discovered from a beauty review website) and is ten times less expensive.  Again, what a waste.  Spend your money on a nice bottle of perfume or some such luxury.  Skip this line, there&#x27;s nothing worthy of the expense.  I definitely don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works great. Smells nice. Have noticed that it can be a bit drying on the hair ends over time. I have problems with conditioners giving me rashes if I use too much or leave too much product in my hair, so it is a problem keeping my hair moisturized. I can&#x27;t use Deva Care&#x27;s No or Low Poo because of breakouts/rashes, but I have really sensitive skin and lots of allergies to all kinds of products.</li>
            <li> I love Deva Curl products like nobody&#x27;s business! I highly recommend all of their product, it&#x27;s the only stuff I use!</li>
            <li> I love DevaCurl products. I have 3c curls and they are at times uncontrollable. While this product is more expensive it really does the job and is worth it. I would advise buying it at Ulta or wherever they sell it and spend the extra 10 dollars. The product I received was watered down and did not do the same job. The consistency was even watery, gel should not be watery.</li>
            <li> I have been trying many generic and other brand gel, that claim to be alcohol free, but this one is far my favorite and best product. It really brings out my curls after it has dried up and doesn&#x27;t make it flaky.</li>
            <li> I prefer the light defining gel.  I ordered this by mistake, thinking that I was ordering the light gel.  This product still works for me, in combination with the light gel.  It tends to weigh my hair down if I use it alone.  My hair is thin for curly hair, so I have had better results with the light gel.  I do love the DevaCurl line, however.  A lot of their products are amazing.</li>
            <li> I do not understand how this product has managed to win over my fellow curly haired people. I have 3A hair and was looking for a new gel and after reading raving reviews and having countless curly haired people recommend it, I was ecstatic to try it out. It was such a let down. I don&#x27;t know how to describe the smell, I guess you can describe it as an artificial citrus smell (obviously it&#x27;s artificial), but I think this product tried so hard to make the gel smell citrus-y and it just ended up smelling cheap. The gel is very much like a liquid, so even though my hair usually takes about 3-3.5 hours to dry, this product prolonged it. I had to wait forever for my hair to dry. After it actually dried, I expected miraculous curls after being put through that 5 hour or so ordeal, but nope. My hair was super frizzy, gross, dried, and it felt dirty. By the afternoon, my hair felt even dirtier and it looked even worse than it did in the morning: more frizz had built up and it just wasn&#x27;t even remotely decent. Second day hair is never a success for me and I don&#x27;t expect my hair to look amazing, but this product made my hair super greasy and just plain nasty. My hair felt greasy and dirty the first day imagine how it felt/what it looked like the second day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never understand why this product has received such great reviews because my experience was anything but great. And the product is so expensive too, so I really thought I would like the product (and I really did try to like this product). I&#x27;ve had and am having much better luck  with cheaper gels that aren&#x27;t even specifically made for curly hair. This product is worth the try if you don&#x27;t mind spending the money on it, but otherwise, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected thank you!</li>
            <li> Having curly hair means trying a store full of products. This is the BEST product for my tight, curly hair. It controls it without making it look &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; or frizzy! I use a lot of it, so this size is perfect. It may be pricey, but let me tell you it is worth it. I use it on wet hair. It smells good too.</li>
            <li> If you want a firm hold, this product is great!  I purchased several Devacurl products.  I would have to say this is my least favorite because it is so stiff...but like I mentioned, if a firm hold is what you&#x27;re looking for...it&#x27;s great.  I found I like  a softer curl so I really like the DevaCurl No Frizz foam better for the results I want.</li>
            <li> AFTER YEARS OF TRYING CHEAP TO EXPENSIVE GEL, LEAVE IN CONDITIONER, MOUSSE.. YOU NAME IT... THIS WORKS BEAUTIFUL ON MY CURLS.. NO MORE FRIZZ BALL!!  I USE THE NO POO AND THE ONE CONDITIONER.. I LEAVE SOME OF THE CONDITIONER ON AND MIX IT WITH THE ANGELL.. LET IT DRY ... CRUNCH AND VIO&#x27;LA !! BEAUTIFUL HEALTHY CURLS ... NO MORE FIZZ.... MY ANGEL FOR SURE!!</li>
            <li> This holds better than the regular angel gel yet doesn&#x27;t feel stiff. I&#x27;ve switched to only using the firm hold.</li>
            <li> Finally, I have found a product that I can control my curls with. No grease, no &amp;#34;crunchies&amp;#34;, no separation.  Don&#x27;t need to apply a lot of it either!</li>
            <li> This smells so good and I get complements all the time about how good my hair smells whenever I use this. This is the only gel I will use on my long, naturally wavy hair and it does not leave my hair feeling crunchy.  I also love that it is paraben and sulfite free product.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s product, so I&#x27;ll write my review and hers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hers: she loves it, it helps with her curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine: it&#x27;s shampoo. It cleans her hair. Makes her look beautiful.</li>
            <li> Finally found something that my curly hair loves without drying it out.  I can not say enough positive things about the Deva Care system.  I have gone through 40 years having to wash my hair every day because the hair products I was using was making my hair dirty, frizzy and and dried out.  Someone recommend I try the deva care system, said &amp;#34;You need to stop treating your hair like it is Caucasian as it isn&#x27;t).  I started using deva care and I get continuous compliments as well as only having to wash my hair every 4 days.  My hair hasn&#x27;t been happier since!</li>
            <li> It def makes a cast but once scrunched to release the cast, it doesn&#x27;t hold as well as I had hoped. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s good but not super great for slightly wavy hair. Maybe it holds really curly hair much better but then why would you need the gel if your hair was already super curly???</li>
            <li> Good product, but the pump attachment doesn&#x27;t work. It also arrived with some leakage from the bottle and the plastic wrap was punctured by the tip of the pump, it seemed. So it arrived in a messy condition and is messy to use, but I like the gel itself.</li>
            <li> You know if you&#x27;re a &amp;#34;Curly Girl&amp;#34;.  It WORKS.  I don&#x27;t think anyone would buy it if their hair stylist hasn&#x27;t tried it on them.  DON&#x27;T assume you know how to use it if no one has shown you.  It work FABULOUS if you follow the directions &amp; use the correct towel &amp; technique.</li>
            <li> I had no idea how good this product was til I tried it the first time.  It works!  I have wavy curly hair and it defines and hydrates the curl and so my wavy hair is even more wavy curly.</li>
            <li> Works well with the Deva Curl no poo and conditioner.  This system seems to do really well on my hair which is naturally dry to begin with and bleached.</li>
            <li> Nothing against Amazon or the seller here...everything arrived in great condition, so I am strictly reviewing the product itself. This gel was recommended to me by my hair stylist. With summer around the corner, I opted to order the ArcAngel gel for its more \\&quot;controlling\\&quot; formula than the other DevaCurl gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying it out, I am truly disappointed in how this stuff performs. I don&#x27;t have super kinky curls at all, in fact they&#x27;re usually quite soft and bouncy, but this gel made my hair frizzier than I&#x27;ve seen in years (ZERO no frizz control what-so-ever). While it did define my curls just fine, the frizz was horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the frizz issue, my hair looked dull, felt like straw, and was crunchy and hard. I even tried to incorporate this gel with my usual line-up to see if it would work better with some of my other well-performing products..Sadly, I was still disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only redeeming quality about this gel is that I can use it on days that I don&#x27;t shampoo to help revive my curls, otherwise, this stuff is pretty much useless in my hair routine. I definitely do not recommend this line.</li>
            <li> I was not in the least impressed with this gel. I found a drugstore spray gel that met all the criteria set out in the Deva inventor&#x27;s book Curly Girl for curly products that cost half this price, smelled a lot better and defined my curls and waves better without the slimy feel or the need to soak your hair in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d pass this one by.</li>
            <li> I have used Curlisto and some other high end curl products but nothing gives me soft, magical curls like this gel.  A must for curly girls.</li>
            <li> I had the experience that most of the one star reviewers had. I have been looking for a miracle  hair product to keep my hair in line. I have vey thick very coarse very dry curly/wavy hair. I live in the Pacific north west so I am battling frizz on a near daily basis. This product had so many good reviews I decided to try it ignoring the bad reviews. Well this is what happened:&lt;br /&gt;1. My hair felt like I poured glue all over it.&lt;br /&gt;2. My hair hadn&#x27;t felt that dry in years.&lt;br /&gt;3. My hair puffed out and looked huge (which is not something that my already enormous hair benefits from) with awful curls that looked like I had a perm.&lt;br /&gt;4. I had to wash my hair twice to remove all the product ruining the months it took to normalize the oils in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is worse than the really cheap hair products I used years ago. It is NOT worth the money!!!! AVIOD. As a side note I have been trying many hair products as of late and have had the best luck the jane carter products. They make my hair look and feel nice.</li>
            <li> I love this gel. It holds and defines my 2-3b wavy-swavy hair perfectly without being hard or crunchy. I use a lot initially, then on day 2 and 3 I dampen my hair with wet hands, add one squirt of gel, and re-scrunch. Flawless! I&#x27;ve tried lots of other Deva products, though, and this is really the only one I like. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Recently decided to go back to my natural curls.  Tried several products, and this is my preferred curley hair gel.</li>
            <li> THE best for curly hair. Not sticky. Produces a very natural curl.I use all the Deva products and they are the best!</li>
            <li> I have been using Deva products purchased at my salon for years and I love it! This is NOT it. Spend the extra few bucks and buy it from an authorized vendor. This is essentially a 32 oz scented bottle of thickened water. SO FAKE!!</li>
            <li> love this product. made such a difference for my curly hair</li>
            <li> Formula seems different, unpleasant texture to my hair and curls not as defined as with prior use</li>
            <li> Product came damaged. Needs to be packed better from the start. Sent it back. :(</li>
            <li> Bottle lid was damaged and gel was spilled everywhere when I opened the package.  Came in a box with 2 other items that were fine ~ so not sure what happened there?  Love the product though.</li>
            <li> First, YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE VIDEOS (the 3-step) on their website and use the product exactly as described.  Yes, we all come in with our own habits and preferences, but to appreciate the product and learn how to use it, you have to really go in with an open mind.  OK? ---  It&#x27;s like learning the rules of grammar before intentionally breaking them a la ee cummings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following two tips from the videos have forever changed my hair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- NO MORE DRYING YOUR HAIR WITH A TOWEL.  Whether with this gel or any other, ever.&lt;br /&gt;- NO COMBING OR FINGER-COMBING ONCE YOU&#x27;VE RINSED OUT YOUR CONDITIONER.  None.  At this point, you are only scrunching out the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, with that in mind, this is a great gel.  I have wavy, not super curly hair, but I find I prefer this to the more flexible hold hair gel.  The other is, well, not quite enough for me.  This gives great definition and hold, without being sticky or otherwise crunchy.  For day 2, all I do is spritz plain old water with a little coconut oil and gently finger comb and re-scrunch.  Good to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gigantic bottle last me about 4 months and is worth every penny (hello! - that&#x27;s less than $10 a month for the best gel ever!)</li>
            <li> Having read other reviews the key is to buy from a specific reseller. Amazon lists the reviews of the product from all sellers and clearly quality varies by re-seller.  I used C Beauty and the gel was thick and my bottle came with a pump top.  I suggest buying from them to make sure you get a quality product.</li>
            <li> Best gel out there for curly tendrils!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Great service!!</li>
            <li> A product that I have been using for 10 years. I use it primarily as a hair gel after the shampoo and conditioner. Not too heavy a feel on the hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair, is not too heavy on the hair and you can combine any number of different shine products with it.</li>
            <li> I was born with curly hair and always did everything I could to straighten it out. It always looked messy when left natural until I found this product. Now my curls look natural and defined. The added plus of staying in place.</li>
            <li> Although I love this product and have used it for years when I purchesded it through this seller it came watered down. I checked other reviews and saw other people had the same problem with this seller. Buy the real thing and you will love it, this is far from the real product.</li>
            <li> the greatest hair product ever for us curly heads</li>
            <li> My hair was starting to lose some of its curls until my hairdresser introduced me to the DevaCurl line. I haven&#x27;t had a bad hair day since I started using these products two years ago. They are all amazing, but the Arc Angel provides the best hold for my curls. My hair isn&#x27;t wet looking or crunchy. It&#x27;s just beautiful bouncy curls all day. A great product for sure!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff been using it for a year and it so much cheaper through Amazon my hair has so much curl love that if I get low I know where to go thanks</li>
            <li> For almost 10 years I used Graham Webb Making Waves Curl Defining Gel and it was amazing. The company no longer exists so I had to find a new gel. It was so hard to find something to replace what I loved for so long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying countless gels from the store, I tried this one based on reviews. I am not sure it&#x27;s 100% as good as what I used before, but it&#x27;s good enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my routine and it works great for me: In the shower, I scrunch my hair a couple times with my hands to get most of the water out and put a towel over my hair to dry my hair more. After a couple minutes, I take my towel off and apply gel to my hair upside down. I then scrunch my hair with a dry piece of a paper towel. I then repeat and add more gel, dry with another dry paper towel and do it one more time. After that, I spray my hair with KMS Curl Up Spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that this gel works great at getting those spirally curls and does not leave your hair looking stiff or crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I used it yesterday and my hair came out great. I have the Angel light hold, which works great too. I needed alttle extra hold. My hair is very long, curley and heavy. It gives me a curl from root to end and it&#x27;s not crunchy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found my magic hair solution in Devacurls Arc angel Firm Hold defining Gel!</li>
            <li> I use arc angel as the final step in my 3 part Deva Curl hair care regimen. Nearly 1/2 a handful of this product is worked into my wet hair after washing and conditioning. After it is well-distributed, I gently scrunch my hair up from the tips toward the roots, squeezing out the excess water, and promoting my waves to look a bit more curl-ish. I then use a diffuser to partially dry my hair, or allow my hair to air dry WITHOUT TOUCHING IT. You must let the product sit in your hair until it dries. Yes, it will initially feel crunchy, but that is a temporary state. Once dried, I tip my head upside-down, scrunch my hair again, and sometimes give myself a llittle scalp massage to release the &#x27;crunchiness&#x27;. After that, this product softens up, and my hair looks amazingly like I&#x27;ve spent hours with a curling iron. Also, it smells amazing. I&#x27;ve used other gels, but they tend to dry my hair out or look flaky after drying. Arc Angel never looks flaky. It was meant for exactly the purpose of defining curls softly. It&#x27;s a great product for wavy to curly girls.</li>
            <li> My favorite product to use on my beautiful curls. My husband loves them!</li>
            <li> This product is a godsend. It is expensive, but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money buying this from the salon. They will charge you 40$ or more! Amazon is the cheapest I have found the Deva products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arc Angel applies easily, dries quickly, and shakes out, leaving your natural curls bouncing for days.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, if you cannot afford the shampoo, conditioner, and styling product....spring for the Arc Angel Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Perfect product, exactly as I described and exactly what I was looking for!!</li>
            <li> Far less than the salons, though not cheap by any means.  This product is light and does not leave your hair feeling stiff and &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;, though it holds quite well.  Love the product, just not always the price tag!  What we pay for beauty...</li>
            <li> I love this gel, although it doesn&#x27;t smell as great as it could.  (To each his own.)  It holds my stubborn hair without making it &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent for my frizzy curly hair!&lt;br /&gt;No alcohol in it so it dosent dry my hair out</li>
            <li> perfect for curly hair. never stiff and works well for touch ups. best product on the market for curly hair.</li>
            <li> I initially trialed the Deva Care line at my local Ulta.  I absolutely fell in love with it.  Purchasing on Amazon has always been way more cost effective.  When I received the gel from Amazon it seemed watered down.  Didn&#x27;t think anything of it but I was using more.  I then purchased the same product from Ulta again and compared.  It was a completely different color and much thicker.  I am pretty sure the one I purchased from Amazon was fake.  Buyer beware</li>
            <li> It is amazing how my curly hair works with the &amp;#34;deva&amp;#34; hair cut and this product. Watch the curls grow!</li>
            <li> As expected -  Great product</li>
            <li> This gel is great. And it works really well with curly hair. Anyone with curly hair really needs this in their bathroom.</li>
            <li> Out of fairness, I have to edit my previous review. I previously gave it 2 stars because I thought I noticed a big difference between the product I got at the salon and the product I got from Amazon. There is a difference but not as bad as I previously mentioned.  The gel I ordered from Amazon seemed a little “watered down” because it was thinner and the smell was not as strong. I also exaggerated when I said that I only had to use half the amount of the salon product. I do use less but not that much less. Most importantly, the salon product did not make my hair look any better than the Amazon product.  Buying this again on Amazon is not out of the question.</li>
            <li> This was an awesome product, but was delivered in a \\&quot;bag\\&quot;. Some of the product had leaked out into the \\&quot;bag\\&quot;. I would h e sent it back but I didn&#x27;t want to deal worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using Deva&#x27;s Light Defining Gel when a friend recommended Arc Angel. I really prefer Arc Angel now. Although they both have a similar consistency when I put them in my hair, the Arc Angel product just seems to define my curls better without making them crunchy. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> The Deva Care Arc Angel Firm Hold Defining Gel works great on my hair.  Good hold, not crunchy. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair, these products are great. Between my Wen shampoo and this gel, that&#x27;s all I use. I scrunch this in my hair while it&#x27;s still wet and then once it&#x27;s dry, I scrunch a bit more to soften it up. This is the firm hold and I would recommend it over the softer hold gels. But then, my hair is only wavy so I have to put some effort into getting curls. This also works well with a diffuser. It also worked well when I was in a very humid region recently -- no frizzies.</li>
            <li> I love these products for my curly hair.  They are always shipped quickly and are a good price compared to salons. Make sure you learn how to properly use these products through either your salon or online.  It isn&#x27;t as simple as putting on and walking away.  There is a step to take after your hair is dry to avoid the wet-look.</li>
            <li> When I buy this product at Ulta it works awesome but something is not right with the one purchased thru here. Hair was sticky, stiff and still frizzy which has never happened when purchased elsewhere.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than anywhere else. If you use this gel, get it here.&lt;br /&gt;Works best when you use it on very wet hair.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Have used deva curl for years. Received a product that looked like arc angel but that was not what was inside! Plus pump was broken- do not buy from this buyer!</li>
            <li> My only product to keep my curls form getting frizzy.</li>
            <li> I like this.  It only takes a little and it bring curls.  A big bottle like this lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This works great! Not too stiff and defined curls!!! My hair is very curly and these products are the bomb for my hair!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best gel on the market for curly hair and I&#x27;ve used many. I&#x27;ve used it for years and it never fails. My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t get the large bottles without the pump and the pump stops working when you get to the last 2 inches of the gel. I open the bottle and get it all out .. sometimes the gel is not as &#x27;gelled&#x27; as it should be but it works just fine even when it&#x27;s a little more liquid.</li>
            <li> Not quite as good as Aveena (sp?) for defining curls but it will do for the money..More economical and smells great!</li>
            <li> Great for frizz control for curly hair. Nice curls without the crunch.  This last batch was a little runny so I&#x27;m not sure if its old or if the vendor is diluting it to make it last since its been discontinued.</li>
            <li> This gel works great for my curly/wavy hair.  I like all the Deva products.  I have no allergy problems with their products like I do others.</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair you cannot get any better than the Deva products.  Product came fast, but it was shipped with zero protection with a 10 pound toilet seat so it was squeezed and bit goopy when it arrived, but I rinsed it off and it was fine.  Third item in the last month packaged by Amazon to arrive damaged due to inept packaging.</li>
            <li> I HAVE VERY GOOD LUCK WITH THIS PRODUCET IN GETTING MY HAIR TO DO WHAT I WANT IT TO DO,.</li>
