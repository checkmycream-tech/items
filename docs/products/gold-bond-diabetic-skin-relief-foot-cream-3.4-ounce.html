            <li> It is very thick, but my skin absorbs it quickly.</li>
            <li> Although very thick, it is quickly absorbed and not greasy.  </li>
            <li> wearing cleats for so long also hurts my feet.</li>
            <li> After long games they burn.</li>
            <li> Due to my diabetes, my skin on my legs and feet is extra dry.  </li>
            <li> My feet and ankles  are extremely dry because I have swelling and lymphedema in them and some of the oil glands have been permanently destroyed, according to a doctor.  </li>
            <li> i do recommend this product to anyone who has dry skin on their feet</li>
            <li> Started using in summer 2013 in the mountains when I had seriously dry feet.</li>
            <li> I got relief from dry, cracked heels and soles in a single application.  </li>
            <li> feet  needed a little extra attention.</li>
            <li> My father, who has swollen feet due to diabeties loves this product.  </li>
            <li> She isn&#x27;t diabetic but has problems with her feet, atharitis, cracked heels among other things.</li>
            <li> It relieves any dryness that occurs due to hours of feet being soaked in chlorine.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised and I can personally vouch for that not just for diabetic feet but for feet that have a tendency to be tough due to other medical conditions.</li>
            <li> Missing a day of application will definitely dry out your feet.</li>
            <li> commercial says you will likely notice a difference in 1 hour ,Believe it or Not Lol</li>
            <li> Seems thick enough to do the job of softening the skin from dryness.</li>
            <li> I have been using all Gold Bond for years and find it&#x27;s very helpful (and less expensive on Amazon than any where else</li>
            <li> I previously used a prescription formula which never gave me this level of satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Both products exceeded my expectations and are FAR less expensive than other creams and lotions I have tried that did not do the job at all.</li>
            <li> Also, she&#x27;s had a hard time even finding it.</li>
            <li> (In case this helps anyone - I have a hard time reaching all around my ankles, so I use a spatula, put the cream on it and apply and rub it in that way).</li>
            <li> It is a bit thick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick cream</li>
            <li> This is a thick cream lotion and I will say it is doing the job it says it does.  </li>
            <li> So I take it very seriously.</li>
            <li> Kudos to amazon for carrying these products that are difficult to find in some areas.</li>
            <li> I hate to feel greasy, and this doesn&#x27;t.  </li>

            <li> I do not have diabetes, but it does run in my family. I take very very good care of my skin. Well do my best! It is the only one you have... Lol! I purchased this lotion because I wanted to take a break from the cocoa butter. It is a bit thick I wear it at night after showering and put socks immediately... Feet feel squishy, but I guess that is the point to keep them soft :-)</li>
            <li> My father, who has swollen feet due to diabeties loves this product.  His feet looks more healthier and he says that the pain has minimalized.  My mom uses it too.  She says that it soothes her feet even though she does not have diabeties.  I make sure they get this product thru Subscribe and Save every few months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked the Gold Bond products and now their diabetic line is here for me. I can&#x27;t praise it enough! Very effective product line.</li>
            <li> This diabetic foot cream keeps the souls of my feet moist for a longer period of time than ordianary foot cream. Gold bond should think of a travel size that is acceptable to the airline security system. Missing a day of application will definitely dry out your feet. For those who sweat, a foot powder should also be used.</li>
            <li> Due to my diabetes, my skin on my legs and feet is extra dry.  This lotion is wonderful for softening dry skin.</li>
            <li> Seems thick enough to do the job of softening the skin from dryness. While applying one can tell this is a heavy cream, and maybe that is the reason for its success according to many amazon reviewers. Will require continuous usage in order to work, for most skin conditions require ongoing treatment. 4 Stars.</li>
            <li> I use this cream twice a day on my feet.  As well as softening them, it stopped the prickling, burning, and itching caused by my diabetes.  I always went barefoot, but now I wear something on my feet at all times.  I wear socks to bed.  I use this cream on my legs and arms as well.  It works so much better than regular lotions.  I hate to feel greasy, and this doesn&#x27;t.  It is very thick, but my skin absorbs it quickly.</li>
            <li> Great for dry heels and toes, nice consistency and not greasy at all. Hoping it will help my brother&#x27;s feet, not just for diabetics, either.</li>
            <li> it sure helps, I don&#x27;t have diabetes but feet  needed a little extra attention. it is all they say it is</li>
            <li> I heard about the diabetic cream first then decided to order this one too.  It really works fast. Luv it!</li>
            <li> I used the Gold bond Diabetic Foot Cream on the backs of my cracked heels and after applying twice my heels are smooth.  It has been a week or so since applying and will do again to make sure that my heels stay smooth.</li>
            <li> I have been using all Gold Bond for years and find it&#x27;s very helpful (and less expensive on Amazon than any where else</li>
            <li> this new gold bond diabetes products will rock the market once people try them .like commercial says you will likely notice a difference in 1 hour ,Believe it or Not Lol</li>
            <li> This product is working well.  I had bought this for my best friend who is a diabetic and often has trouble with his legs and feet being itchy and dry (he often scratches).  He said this cream was great and has purchased it himself as he liked it so well.  If you are a diabetic prevention of any problems with legs and feet is important and this product and be helpful to moisturize and stop any itching you may be experiencing.</li>
            <li> Works really well for diabetic feed.  My feet feel nice and moisturized all day when I put this on in the morning.</li>
            <li> Creams are better for me than lotions. And these diabetic foot creams r the best. They are the thickest I&#x27;ve ever found. Which is important with nerve damage so you can get traction on fingers that have trouble gripping.</li>
            <li> This is the best hand cream that I have ever used.  It was the first winter that I had no thumb cracks.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO, I AM REALLY GLAD I GOT IT. WHAT A DIFFERENCE IN MY FEET. TOOK AWAY THE DRYNESS AFTER ABOUT 1 WEEK. NICE AND SMOOTH AND SOFT. SOME OF MY SKIN WAS CRACKED TO, AND SORE. TOOK AWAY ALL OF THAT TO. I WILL BE BUYING THIS FROM NOW ON. SMELLS GOOD TO. GOOD GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says.  Hydrates my feet and help with the peeling which reduces pain.  But it does not last long, so a tube goes very quickly.</li>
            <li> still trying the new product and it really seems to work well for my dry skin. I will buy this in the future.</li>
            <li> This cream is the best foot cream I have ever tried.  I put it on overnight and my feet are soft and hydrated in the morning.</li>
            <li> I am not diabetic but I have been using this skin cream on my feet.  My feet and ankles  are extremely dry because I have swelling and lymphedema in them and some of the oil glands have been permanently destroyed, according to a doctor.  After a few days, I have noticed a real difference.  I put it on after my shower in the morning and (when I remember) before bed at night.  (In case this helps anyone - I have a hard time reaching all around my ankles, so I use a spatula, put the cream on it and apply and rub it in that way).</li>
            <li> As a diabetic, I am very anxious to keep my feet in good condition. This cream helps me to do that.</li>
            <li> This is the first cream that has healed the dryness in my feet, including loosening all the dead skin right down to the new skin.</li>
            <li> the best for dry feet you see the diffeent righ away i do recommend this product to anyone who has dry skin on their feet</li>
            <li> I got relief from dry, cracked heels and soles in a single application.  After applying three nights my feet were completely healed. You can apply liberally. Although very thick, it is quickly absorbed and not greasy.  I especially liked that it is fragrance free. This is a great, no nonsense, product that delivers results quickly.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my mother. She isn&#x27;t diabetic but has problems with her feet, atharitis, cracked heels among other things. She had been looking for a cream that would help her for quite a while including some creams form Ireland, Swiserland and Poland. This one so far has proven the best! She loves it and her feet fell much better! I guess it works for some and some it doesn&#x27;t, people won&#x27;t know until they trie it - it worked for my mother and she She loves it!</li>
            <li> I like this cream very, very much and it has already proven to smooth out my really dry Arizona feet and toes.  My one con is that it&#x27;s only 3.4 ounces.  If you use it daily, it&#x27;s gone in a very short time.  It&#x27;s a thick cream and I think tha&#x27;s&#x27; why it works so well.  But to cover your feet and toes, you need a pretty good glob of it.</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that it contained urea. I was surprised when it arrived and did not contained urea. I tried using it for several day, and my nerve pain worsened. I had to go to a drug store and buy a product containing urea.</li>
            <li> has nothing more in common with &amp;#34;diabetic&amp;#34; than any other moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;with that it is moderately effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it had more aggressive action.</li>
            <li> This is a thick cream lotion and I will say it is doing the job it says it does.  I would buy it even if I wasn&#x27;t a diabetic, simply because it seems to smooth out rough feet quiet nicely.</li>
            <li> The foot cream is a good product and makes my feet feel very soft.  It&#x27;s better than some other foot creams I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best diabetic foot cream available. It begins working almost immediately. It really worls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charles Rowland</li>
            <li> Great for thew diabetes skin. I like it and hope it will be good for others too.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;John</li>
            <li> Started using in summer 2013 in the mountains when I had seriously dry feet. It goes on easily, absorbs quickly, feels great, and within 3 days, you couldn&#x27;t tell I&#x27;d ever had dry feet. Great product for diabetics.</li>
            <li> Gold Bond Diabetic Foot Cream is an incredible product that does what no other foot cream has done for me. Footcare is essential to every diabetic in order to prevent infection, which can lead to amputation. So I take it very seriously. The long lasting quality of this product and the immediate softening is just amazing. I use a &amp;#34;sanding&amp;#34; devise to remove callouses during my home pedicure. When I put this cream on following the callous removal, I have baby feet for days. This is not only a great relief in how my feet feel, but it is an essential protection against cracking of the skin and subsequent infection. I also highly recommend Gold Bond Diabetic Lotion, also sold on amazon.com. Both products exceeded my expectations and are FAR less expensive than other creams and lotions I have tried that did not do the job at all. Kudos to amazon for carrying these products that are difficult to find in some areas. And kudos to Gold Bond for producing a product that WORKS at a more affordable price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to aid my wife in skin pain relief from diabetes. It assists her in dealing with the skin problems associated with diabetes.</li>
            <li> personally it worked well for me and my mother ordered it here first. It works as advertised and I can personally vouch for that not just for diabetic feet but for feet that have a tendency to be tough due to other medical conditions. Great!</li>
            <li> MAKES MY FEET FEEL BRAND NEW. GOOD STUFF. WILL ORDER AGAIN. DOES NOT LEAVE MY FEET STICKY AND THEY DO FEEL BETTER.  SEEMS TO TAKE THE ACHE OUT OF MY FEET WHEN I HAVE BEEN DOING TO MUCH. SHIPPING WAS FAST AND WE WILL ORDER AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I play about 4 soccer games a week and I am also a lifeguard. My feet are more often than not mistreated. I am always wearing cleats or have my feet in water. The chlorine from the pool really hurts my feet. it leaves them irritated for hours after I leave the pool. wearing cleats for so long also hurts my feet. After long games they burn. Gold Bond Diabetic Skin Relief Foot Cream is not just for diabetics. It relieves any dryness that occurs due to hours of feet being soaked in chlorine. For this I give them 5stars, they really deserve it!!!&lt;br /&gt;keep up the good work Gold Bond!!!</li>
            <li> So happy the Gold Bond has come out with a line of lotion and foot cream for diabetic.  It is wonderful and soothing for those of us who have to be careful what we use on our feet.  Thank you Gold Bond.</li>
            <li> I had some very rough skin on top of my feet.  Two applications pretty much solved the problem.  The price makes it even greater.</li>
