            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Looks great even by itself.</li>
            <li>I would use the two faced version of this that is not candlelight they do have another one that works great too.</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>Good for a night out maybe.</li>
            <li>I wear the Candlelight version alone a lot honestly because its just gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of eye shadow bases to prevent eye shadow creases, and this one is the best by far.</li>
            <li>Probably best for younger skin.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite eye product to use under my eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>I really love it, but keep in mind I am a sparkle fan and it enhances the metallic shadows</li>
            <li>I love this eye shadow primer, it adheres my eyeshadow and liner to my lids.  </li>
            <li>Love This Product.</li>
            <li>The packaging is cute &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have the original Too Faced Shadow Insurance and I love it, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
            <li>No problem with the company itself and it shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>Light and shimmery.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny and more.</li>
            <li>Shadow Insurance applies smoothly.</li>
            <li>I am more of a barely there type of girl, but this is an AMAZING product that should be in every make up kit.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>My coloring is on the cool side, so it clashed and was not covered by the eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li>This is the same good stuff without a change in effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Gives a soft light shimmer to your eyes and makes sure that no creasing happens throughout the day...or night.</li>
            <li>I find you need to spread quickly because once it sets, it can be blotchy.</li>
            <li>I normally use the Too Faced eye shadow primer in the blue tube and it works great.</li>
            <li>Good consistency and doesn&#x27;t dry up before applied.</li>
            <li>I really like the light shimmer</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;ve been blessed with really good skin, so i never really HAD to cover anything up.  </li>
            <li>anyway, this stuff is pretty cool.  </li>
            <li>Next time, I may prefer something more matte for everyday use, but this is a great product and does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>The product is a light yellow cream with fine glitter.</li>
            <li>It Really Helps This 51 Year Old Eyes Look Nicer :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I will be ordering my make up from Amazon unless I can try it out at store first.</li>
            <li>and I like it better than the Too Faced and Urban Decay primers.</li>
            <li>like many eye shadows tend to be, but just shimmery enough to give a glow.  </li>
            <li>it definitely keeps your shadow in place all day no creasing no smudging fool proof for sure there...</li>
            <li>so it will last forever and it lovely.  </li>
            <li>I like this primer even better than I do the urban decay ones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a person who sticks to certain brands, but this actually keeps my eyeshadow on all day-sometimes for 13 or 14 hours and it comes off easily with a eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I got a free sample initially</li>
            <li>Really don&#x27;t like the highlighting effect.</li>
            <li>Much prefer my benefits no stray or eltamd tinted sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The shimmer and color of the primer really brightens my eye shadow also.  </li>
            <li>This works better than any other eye primer I have tried.  </li>
            <li>and this gives a GREAT base to anything you add on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t particularly care for this because of all the gold shimmer in it.  </li>
            <li>i grew up with all older brothers.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and it&#x27;s a good value for the size/price.</li>
            <li>a little too light and cakey looking for me.  </li>
            <li>I put it on for the first time &amp; put on my powder eye shadow &amp; wore it ALL DAY LONG</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t just create a canvas for applying color, it is a very shiny yellow.  </li>
            <li>now i&#x27;m getting old, boo.  </li>
            <li>Used to come in black circular compact single with goldish color poking  out the top.</li>
            <li>am now using Bare Escentials&#x27;s primer</li>
            <li>It also offers very limited use because it is so obvious.  </li>

            <li> now i&#x27;m getting old, boo.  </li>

            <li> am now using Bare Escentials&#x27;s primer</li>

            <li> It does make for a long lasting eye.  </li>
            <li> (I was cautious at first), but you only use a very small amount</li>
            <li> &amp; so I wore it ALL NIGHT LONG TOO &amp;</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what my tired mom eyes needed.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected</li>
            <li> I would have to guess it&#x27;s old because it is not as thick as it should be and dries out so even with a shadow applied ontop, it flakes off.</li>
            <li> so I find this is a little too yellow for me, which makes me a little washed out.</li>
            <li> I also like the little pearl finish that it has when you wear it by itself.</li>
            <li> This product does help to bring out the vibrancy of eyeshadows but creases a little after 5 hours on my hooded eyelids.</li>
            <li> and it just makes me look like i&#x27;ve just been crying, or just woke up, or just...puffy.  </li>
            <li> The product works, but I can&#x27;t get past the shimmer it has.</li>
            <li> Used to use hard candy primer</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for it because the consistency causes tugging on the delicate skin on my lid when I apply.  </li>
            <li> #34;soak up&amp;#34; my eyeshadow.. like if the wind blows it will blow off my shadow and my eyelid will be looking thick pastey and shimmery.</li>
            <li> Can be worn alone to lighten the eyelids and give a subtle shimmer, or you can use under eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li> This is a very thick and shiny primer.  </li>
            <li> my eye shadow stays on worse than if I didn&#x27;t use the primer at all.  </li>
            <li> I can wear eyeshadow all day long, and if I have used this as a base, there is NO crease, even after a late night out!</li>
            <li> i think its stupid.  </li>
            <li> I hate spending money on eye lid primer</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I swear this is counterfeit. Works nothing like the same product bought in Sephora.</li>
            <li> Good consistency and doesn&#x27;t dry up before applied. Light and shimmery. Next time, I may prefer something more matte for everyday use, but this is a great product and does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what my tired mom eyes needed. Gives a soft light shimmer to your eyes and makes sure that no creasing happens throughout the day...or night. I slept with my makeup on just for one night and no creasing when I woke up. Amazing!</li>
            <li> Can be worn alone to lighten the eyelids and give a subtle shimmer, or you can use under eyeshadow.  I&#x27;ve never had the creasing problem with eyeshadow since I started using this several years ago.  Great product!</li>
            <li> it has a creamy shimmery look that brightens the eye area before you add your eye shadow and liner.  I use it every day.</li>
            <li> a little too light and cakey looking for me.  Probably best for younger skin.  A little goes a long way, and it&#x27;s a good value for the size/price.</li>
            <li> Best primer. Nothing else works on my eyelids to keep my eyeshadow from creasing like this product does. It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eye product to use under my eyeshadow. I have tried a lot of eye shadow bases to prevent eye shadow creases, and this one is the best by far. I can wear eyeshadow all day long, and if I have used this as a base, there is NO crease, even after a late night out! I also like the little pearl finish that it has when you wear it by itself.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I got a free sample initially and I was hooked. I&#x27;m not a person who sticks to certain brands, but this actually keeps my eyeshadow on all day-sometimes for 13 or 14 hours and it comes off easily with a eye makeup remover. I haven&#x27;t had creases since I started using this. Sometimes I just wear it by itself, too! Love. Love. Love.</li>
            <li> This product is just oky. Nothing special. Really don&#x27;t like the highlighting effect. Much prefer my benefits no stray or eltamd tinted sunscreen. Good for a night out maybe. I don&#x27;t think I will be ordering my make up from Amazon unless I can try it out at store first. no problem with buyer. Arrived sooner than expected</li>
            <li> I normally use the Too Faced eye shadow primer in the blue tube and it works great. To save a couple bucks, I decided to try this one and my eye shadow stays on worse than if I didn&#x27;t use the primer at all.  I gave it to my mom and she said it works well for her, so who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now using Bare Escentials&#x27;s primer and I like it better than the Too Faced and Urban Decay primers.</li>
            <li> My eyelids are oily, and I don&#x27;t notice any creases in my shadow even at the end of the night when I have this on.  This works better than any other eye primer I have tried.  I really like the light shimmer, it&#x27;s not overly shimmery like many eye shadows tend to be, but just shimmery enough to give a glow.  Looks great even by itself.</li>
            <li> I really love it, but keep in mind I am a sparkle fan and it enhances the metallic shadows I use regularly it definitely keeps your shadow in place all day no creasing no smudging fool proof for sure there... however, if you don&#x27;t care for a sparkle look I would use the two faced version of this that is not candlelight they do have another one that works great too.</li>
            <li> This stuff (Too Faced Candlelight Shadow Insurance) is Awesome!!!! I put it on for the first time &amp; put on my powder eye shadow &amp; wore it ALL DAY LONG &amp; then i even fell asleep in my makeup (I know, big no no) &amp; so I wore it ALL NIGHT LONG TOO &amp; the next morning I looked at my eyeshadow &amp; IT STILL LOOKED LIKE I HAD JUST PUT IT ON!!!!!!!!!!! No creases, No fading or anything!!!!! This stuff is SO GREAT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone!!!!</li>
            <li> I am definitely not a person who cakes on makeup.  I am more of a barely there type of girl, but this is an AMAZING product that should be in every make up kit.  I wear the Candlelight version alone a lot honestly because its just gorgeous.  But I am also trying to experiment with some colors and this gives a GREAT base to anything you add on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the price might seem steep (I was cautious at first), but you only use a very small amount so it will last forever and it lovely.  Worth every penny and more.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Shadow Insurance in Candlelight for years and worn it as my only shadow but I&#x27;ve always bought it from Ulta. This time I ordered it online and it&#x27;s horrible. I would have to guess it&#x27;s old because it is not as thick as it should be and dries out so even with a shadow applied ontop, it flakes off. If you like this product, don&#x27;t buy here.</li>
            <li> I love this eye shadow primer, it adheres my eyeshadow and liner to my lids.  The shimmer and color of the primer really brightens my eye shadow also.  I like this primer even better than I do the urban decay ones.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t particularly care for this because of all the gold shimmer in it.  My coloring is on the cool side, so it clashed and was not covered by the eyeshadow.  The product works, but I can&#x27;t get past the shimmer it has. No problem with the company itself and it shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a very thick and shiny primer.  I don&#x27;t care for it because the consistency causes tugging on the delicate skin on my lid when I apply.  It also offers very limited use because it is so obvious.  It doesn&#x27;t just create a canvas for applying color, it is a very shiny yellow.  It does make for a long lasting eye.  I used it on Halloween.</li>
            <li> Used to use hard candy primer so i tried this. I feel like it takes away the pigment of the color of your eyeshadow. seemed like it wouldn&#x27;t &amp;#34;soak up&amp;#34; my eyeshadow.. like if the wind blows it will blow off my shadow and my eyelid will be looking thick pastey and shimmery.</li>
            <li> I have the original Too Faced Shadow Insurance and I love it, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. The packaging is cute &amp; easy to use. The product is a light yellow cream with fine glitter. I find you need to spread quickly because once it sets, it can be blotchy. I have yellow undertone so I find this is a little too yellow for me, which makes me a little washed out. This product does help to bring out the vibrancy of eyeshadows but creases a little after 5 hours on my hooded eyelids.</li>
            <li> Shadow Insurance applies smoothly. It holds eyeshadow in place from morning into the evening. When I leave for work in the morning, I can be assured that my eyeshadow will not fade after an hour or two. This is one of the best products that I have used.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know how to wear makeup.  i think its stupid.  i grew up with all older brothers. and i&#x27;ve been blessed with really good skin, so i never really HAD to cover anything up.  now i&#x27;m getting old, boo.  anyway, this stuff is pretty cool.  i don&#x27;t use it by itself because i have asian, hooded eyes and it just makes me look like i&#x27;ve just been crying, or just woke up, or just...puffy.  but if i HAVE to wear makeup, i like this stuff because it keeps it on all night.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have oily eye lids and it is the ONLY product that keeps that at bay and allows my eye makeup to stay on my eyes!</li>
            <li> Love This Product. It Really Helps This 51 Year Old Eyes Look Nicer :)</li>
            <li> Only one that works. Used to come in black circular compact single with goldish color poking  out the top. This is the same good stuff without a change in effectiveness. I hate spending money on eye lid primer but they give me no choice but to buy this one over and over sometimes not on sale.</li>
