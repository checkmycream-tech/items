            <li>This cream is  decadent and luxurious with a smell that you almost want to drink it:)</li>
            <li>It is one of the most soothing lotions I have ever used, and is the only lotion that has ever made my skin look wonderfully hydrated after hours gardening in the sun.</li>
            <li>This moisturizing cream smells awesome and keeps my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Just have not found anything better.</li>
            <li>It was still winter in Minnesota when we took our trip, and were so eager to soak up some of those wonderful warm rays from the sun, that we went from bright white to lobster red over night.</li>
            <li>I will buy more if it is available when I run out.</li>
            <li>She feels this lotion is the most hydrating one she has found and the lime scent is cool and refreshing as well.</li>
            <li>best instance to use this for after sun purposes is for tanned, or even mild to moderate sun burned skin.  </li>
            <li>it feels really soothing on my skin, makes us feel nice after a day in the Sun.</li>
            <li>Great for after-sun and just as a regular lotion.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product</li>
            <li>Oh the relief it was when we combined this lotion with the cool rental car air conditioning.</li>
            <li>i love the smell of this lotion, It makes my skin real soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite summertime lotion.</li>
            <li>product doesn&#x27;t seem to do much in the way of extending my tan, but I enjoy the smell, and lay out often, so I don&#x27;t care.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Good product that lasts all day without a slick feel or strong scent.  </li>
            <li>I would say any sunburn more than moderate might be irritated by the scents.  </li>
            <li>I got a sample of this when it first came out, and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.  </li>
            <li>like that it is fast absorbing &amp; non-greasy, &amp; leaves my skin really</li>
            <li>It has a very tropical, coconut-ty scent.  </li>
            <li>very appealing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very tropical and citrus, not floral.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes really well, and</li>
            <li>When I ordered this I was hopeful but not too optimistic that it would moisterize my skin and keep me from peeling after allowing myself to get too much sun.</li>
            <li>I use it every day, all year long, adding a drop or two of Neutrogena body oil (light sesame formula) to&lt;br /&gt;it for nourished and soothing skin.</li>
            <li>It made our burns feel so much better, that 2 days later we were actually venturing back onto the beach for more time in the sun, only this time we were covered in sun block and took along a beach umbrella.</li>
            <li>So the next day we hobbled our sun burned bodies into a nearby drug store, looking for something with aloe to calm the burn.</li>
            <li>My husband CANNOT live without this lotion...</li>
            <li>It is the best thing I&#x27;ve found so far for painful sunburn</li>
            <li>By the time we drove back to our little resort, we were ready for more lotion.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t typically burn, but I do tan pretty easily and the sun tends to dry out my chest and arms.  </li>
            <li>We kept adding lotion every few hours, and our skin kept sucking it right in.</li>

            <li> Some people have said they don&#x27;t like the smell, but I prefer it over the $15 Pink Beach summer lotion I recently purchased from Victoria&#x27;s Secret.&lt;br /&gt;It has done well to keep my skin from drying out after outdoor tanner.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it even after the summer is over, as long as I can buy it in the store.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> The bottle has a green tint, but the lotion itself is white.</li>
            <li> A little seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li> have oily skin, &amp; I occasionally use this on my face, but it usually causes me to break</li>
            <li> It is extremely moisturizing, and smells like a margarita(which reminds us of summer and the beach), which is just  a bonus...</li>
            <li> I use it year round.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick lotion, but that helps keep skin feeling moist and it babys your sun burned skin while it&#x27;s healing.</li>
            <li> Prevents peeling even with bad sunburn if you apply daily.</li>
            <li> Like a cold lime drink.</li>
            <li> Was so disappointed when they stopped making it.</li>

            <li> I bought this last year at Target and was totally bummed when they didn&#x27;t have it again this summer, so I bought it on Amazon! I love the smell, and how it nourishes my skin after being in the sun. I will buy more if it is available when I run out.</li>
            <li> it feels really soothing on my skin, makes us feel nice after a day in the Sun.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever purchase sun products online.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item from a chain retailer for about $8.&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell.  It has a very tropical, coconut-ty scent.  Some people have said they don&#x27;t like the smell, but I prefer it over the $15 Pink Beach summer lotion I recently purchased from Victoria&#x27;s Secret.&lt;br /&gt;It has done well to keep my skin from drying out after outdoor tanner. (I don&#x27;t use tanning beds).  Sometimes I just use it when I have dry skin, even if I haven&#x27;t been out in the sun.  I will continue to use it even after the summer is over, as long as I can buy it in the store.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is fast absorbing &amp; non-greasy, &amp; leaves my skin really soft.&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin, &amp; I occasionally use this on my face, but it usually causes me to break out.&lt;br /&gt;The best instance to use this for after sun purposes is for tanned, or even mild to moderate sun burned skin.  I would say any sunburn more than moderate might be irritated by the scents.  In that case I would go for the ICE aloe stuff that Hawaiian Tropic makes.  It is the best thing I&#x27;ve found so far for painful sunburn care.&lt;br /&gt;This product doesn&#x27;t seem to do much in the way of extending my tan, but I enjoy the smell, and lay out often, so I don&#x27;t care.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product, but understanding its limitations is key.</li>
            <li> Prevents peeling even with bad sunburn if you apply daily. I also noticed mosquito&#x27;s do not like this. It works way better then any bug spray I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I use this as a daily face and boy moisturizer. Its amazing and non greasy.</li>
            <li> This was really great! I definitely recommend it to friends. Really good for your skin!</li>
            <li> Bought a bottle of this before my trip to Mexico, and can honestly say that this is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used! Smells incredible, absorbs fast and non-greasy, and leaves skin looking shiny and feeling smooth. Great for after-sun and just as a regular lotion.</li>
            <li> This product is not quite as creamy as the last one they replaced this with.&lt;br /&gt;However, I have gotten used to it now.  I use it every day, all year long, adding a drop or two of Neutrogena body oil (light sesame formula) to&lt;br /&gt;it for nourished and soothing skin.</li>
            <li> i love the smell of this lotion, It makes my skin real soft.  it feels real good to put on.</li>
            <li> My husband and I recently went for a vacation to the beaches of Florida, and like true tourists, we ended up with a terrible sun burn after the very first day. It was still winter in Minnesota when we took our trip, and were so eager to soak up some of those wonderful warm rays from the sun, that we went from bright white to lobster red over night. So the next day we hobbled our sun burned bodies into a nearby drug store, looking for something with aloe to calm the burn. On the shelf was this Hawaiian Tropic After Sun Moisturizer. I saw the words \\&quot;after sun\\&quot; and \\&quot;aloe\\&quot; and grabbed it. We were so burnt we felt crispy, so the idea of a lotion was very appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as we got into our rental car, I started applying it to my legs and arms. Oh the relief it was when we combined this lotion with the cool rental car air conditioning. By the time we drove back to our little resort, we were ready for more lotion. We kept adding lotion every few hours, and our skin kept sucking it right in. We expected to peel like a banana with our burns, but this lotion prevented it. It made our burns feel so much better, that 2 days later we were actually venturing back onto the beach for more time in the sun, only this time we were covered in sun block and took along a beach umbrella. Every day for 10 days we both (my husband and I) used this lotion over and over through out the day. It soothed our sun burns and kept our skin moist, preventing our skin from peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is wonderful. Like a cold lime drink. Very tropical and citrus, not floral. The bottle has a green tint, but the lotion itself is white. A little seems to go a long way. It&#x27;s a thick lotion, but that helps keep skin feeling moist and it babys your sun burned skin while it&#x27;s healing. It&#x27;s my new favorite summertime lotion.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, it smells great! Great for after sun bathing/showering. Moisturizes really well, and did I mention it smells AWESOME?!</li>
            <li> This cream is  decadent and luxurious with a smell that you almost want to drink it:) It is one of the most soothing lotions I have ever used, and is the only lotion that has ever made my skin look wonderfully hydrated after hours gardening in the sun. A ten star product!!</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this when it first came out, and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.  I don&#x27;t typically burn, but I do tan pretty easily and the sun tends to dry out my chest and arms.  This keeps my skin hydrated without that greasy lotion or that sticky aloe gel feeling, and it keeps me from peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have given countless bottles of this away to friends in need, and all the recipients have raved about it.</li>
            <li> My daughter swears by this stuff.  She sits in the sun a lot and tans quite deeply.  She feels this lotion is the most hydrating one she has found and the lime scent is cool and refreshing as well.</li>
            <li> I totally love this product!  I use it year round.  This moisturizing cream smells awesome and keeps my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Our families favorite after sun!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a product from Hawaiian Tropic for 15 years called Aloe After Sun. It was amazing. Was so disappointed when they stopped making it. When I ordered this I was hopeful but not too optimistic that it would moisterize my skin and keep me from peeling after allowing myself to get too much sun. Turns out it does just as good a job. My skin drinks this stuff up and it turns a sunburn into a tan.</li>
            <li> My husband CANNOT live without this lotion... It is extremely moisturizing, and smells like a margarita(which reminds us of summer and the beach), which is just  a bonus... Fantastic product</li>
            <li> Good product that lasts all day without a slick feel or strong scent.  Can be used all year long without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I had a bottle befor and just loved it, It keeps your skin nice and moist even in the winter time, and you don&#x27;t have to do it every day. Just have not found anything better.</li>
