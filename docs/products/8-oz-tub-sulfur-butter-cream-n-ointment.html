    <ol>
            <li>This is the best cream-ointment ever.</li>
            <li>Excellent  product  </li>
            <li>This is the best sulfur product out there...</li>
            <li>I believe this, greatly increasing my water in take, almond oil, and apricot oil have helped me greatly.</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>This is a good ointment</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I had good luck with Pomada de Azulfre acne treatment which is 10% sulfer.</li>
            <li>I am one of those people that is on a never ending quest to find good products for my skin and scalp issues.</li>
            <li>So greasy you&#x27;re better off soaking in a tub of cooking oil!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff !</li>
            <li>THIS IS AN AMAZING OINTMENT.</li>
            <li>The 8 oz tub is by far the best value for the price.</li>
            <li>(it is sulfur butter, after all), but this is more than acceptable given how it works.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying that this is a magic bullet for hair growth</li>
            <li>This is a great product and goes very well with the sulfur soap.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>My condition is visibly getting better with every day of application.</li>
            <li>just love it will buy it again .We</li>
            <li>The more I use it the better my scalp condition gets.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this cream since i seem to have tried other products my scalp itch is so much better will be buying more</li>
            <li>Works perfectly and arrived quicker than expected.</li>
            <li>Superior product, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>also makes it easy to spread.</li>
            <li>It helps stop the itching from scabies and has a mild smell for it to contain sulfer , it also helps with hair growth !</li>
            <li>Yet all soaps inherently are drying to the skin and the sulfur cream helps keep skin comfortably moistened/oiled.</li>
            <li>good natural, non-prescription, alternative to tx for fungal problems or rosacea.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have noticed some significant differences in my skin and shine.</li>
            <li>They were both great killing the mites and giving me relief (in conjunction with sulfur soap) but do so, my skin became increasing dry like  rubber.</li>
            <li>Great for the whole entire family !</li>
            <li>Great stuff, fantastic after using the soap and great for hair and scalp , dandruff , itchy scalp, retarded hair growth etc...  and good for the face and the entire body !</li>
            <li>Thus far, she has indicated that it is doing wonders for the growth of her hair, particularly important since we live in the northeast, where winter tends not to be kind to hair.  </li>
            <li>I simply mixed 1/2 &amp; 1/2 with Cetaphil Cream (any moisturizing cream/lotion will do) and it went on very smoothly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Regardless of the pronounced sulfur smell, this is a very gentle and soothing cream.</li>
            <li>It is now smooth and soft again.</li>
            <li>I love this so much that I have now ordered the 32 oz size and intend to use it on my entire body.</li>
            <li>When I go on vacation to  a few different countries soon, I will be sure to have my handy anti mite/bug kit including (sulfur 8 shampoo, sulfur butter, and sulfur soap).</li>
            <li>Very effective emollient; however, not good for break-outs connected with fungal overgrowth.  </li>
            <li>I was using it as a followup to sulfur soap baths when trying to get some relief from the Invisible Biting Mites which had invaded my apartment, thanks to the rotting tree bark in flower beds (their breeding ground).  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money!&lt;br /&gt;Sealed &amp;#34;tub&amp;#34; arrived 3/4 full!!</li>
            <li>She has been able to grow her hair out several inches all over her head in the last 3 months or so.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone with skin conditions that nothing else seems to correct.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it on my face as a face cream and even though my face is very sensitive I find that this does not break out my face.</li>
            <li>After Chemotherapy the skin on my arms was always rough, full of bumps and prone to bruises.</li>
            <li>And the smell is mild compared to other sulfur products I&#x27;ve used in the pass.</li>
            <li>Thus far the 8oz tub has lasted me for several months of light to moderate daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I will use this as long as it is made.</li>
            <li> (she is doing a number of other things to be and stay healthier), but the sulfur butter has definitely had an impact.</li>
            <li> Finally I came upon tried other sulfur cremes including Scabcil and Mitesil.</li>
            <li> I have ezcema and a dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Our son tends to have dry skin/scalp, so we are using it for him as well.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t rub into skin, so you have to wear something over it to keep from getting on other things.</li>
            <li> I guess it is the coco butter and other other oils</li>
            <li> I had a rough patch on my forehead that has gone down dramatically.</li>
            <li> I medicine, anti fungal dries etc with no success.</li>
            <li> I use it on my scalp and the flaking has slowed down.</li>
            <li> Others include the sulfur soap, pine-tar soap, and &amp;#34;african black soap&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> after a few uses it caused skin irritation</li>
            <li> This Sulfur Butter Cream is a little stiff when trying to cover your body with it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of very few products which help with my problem.</li>
            <li> I have since loaned it to another resident in this complex and he seems to be getting some relief also.</li>
            <li> If you have a serious or ongoing problem, go for the 32oz size.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t get rid of the mites, (that&#x27;s another story) but it does discourage the little buggers for a little while, allowing you to drift off to sleep, which was impossible otherwise.  </li>
            <li> The package was broken.. Horrible!</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t be misled by the price for the amount you get--you will end up with a worthless product if you are an acne sufferer.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> But this is terrible for acne it doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>

            <li> This is a good ointment but it doesn&#x27;t rub into skin, so you have to wear something over it to keep from getting on other things.</li>

            <li> My wife asked me to order this to improve her hair health.  This was one of the kinds of products that she used as a child.  Thus far, she has indicated that it is doing wonders for the growth of her hair, particularly important since we live in the northeast, where winter tends not to be kind to hair.  Our son tends to have dry skin/scalp, so we are using it for him as well.  It has a tiny bit of a smell to it (it is sulfur butter, after all), but this is more than acceptable given how it works.    UPDATE:  I changed the rating from 4 to 5 stars:  my wife is raving about this stuff.  She has been able to grow her hair out several inches all over her head in the last 3 months or so.  I&#x27;m not saying that this is a magic bullet for hair growth (she is doing a number of other things to be and stay healthier), but the sulfur butter has definitely had an impact.</li>
            <li> If you have a serious or ongoing problem, go for the 32oz size.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream-ointment ever. I had some sort of unknown rash on my chest and leg for which I applied this ointment and it completely cleared my skin up. It is now smooth and soft again. I&#x27;m using it on my face as a face cream and even though my face is very sensitive I find that this does not break out my face. I love this so much that I have now ordered the 32 oz size and intend to use it on my entire body. It has no scent except that of cocoa butter which soon dissipates. I highly recommend this for anyone with skin conditions that nothing else seems to correct.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!&lt;br /&gt;Sealed &amp;#34;tub&amp;#34; arrived 3/4 full!! So greasy you&#x27;re better off soaking in a tub of cooking oil! Gets all over EVERYTHING. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very effective emollient; however, not good for break-outs connected with fungal overgrowth.  Possibly the oils in the product promote the growth of fungal elements on the skin.</li>
            <li> THIS IS AN AMAZING OINTMENT. I AM CONSIDERING BUYING THE 32 OUNCE CONTAINER</li>
            <li> I had been dealt with scabies for about 8 weeks. I medicine, anti fungal dries etc with no success. Finally I came upon tried other sulfur cremes including Scabcil and Mitesil. They were both great killing the mites and giving me relief (in conjunction with sulfur soap) but do so, my skin became increasing dry like  rubber. I have only used this creme for two days but  my skin already feels softer. I guess it is the coco butter and other other oils also makes it easy to spread. When I go on vacation to  a few different countries soon, I will be sure to have my handy anti mite/bug kit including (sulfur 8 shampoo, sulfur butter, and sulfur soap).</li>
            <li> This Sulfur Butter Cream is a little stiff when trying to cover your body with it.  I was using it as a followup to sulfur soap baths when trying to get some relief from the Invisible Biting Mites which had invaded my apartment, thanks to the rotting tree bark in flower beds (their breeding ground).

I have since loaned it to another resident in this complex and he seems to be getting some relief also.</li>
            <li> good natural, non-prescription, alternative to tx for fungal problems or rosacea.</li>
            <li> Just bought my second tube! My hair is already growing!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and goes very well with the sulfur soap. Thus far the 8oz tub has lasted me for several months of light to moderate daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of the pronounced sulfur smell, this is a very gentle and soothing cream. I use it for skin eruptions of an undetermined cause, and this relieves itching quite well, and seems to promote healing. It&#x27;s one of very few products which help with my problem. Others include the sulfur soap, pine-tar soap, and &amp;#34;african black soap&amp;#34;. Yet all soaps inherently are drying to the skin and the sulfur cream helps keep skin comfortably moistened/oiled.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this cream since i seem to have tried other products my scalp itch is so much better will be buying more</li>
            <li> Great stuff, fantastic after using the soap and great for hair and scalp , dandruff , itchy scalp, retarded hair growth etc...  and good for the face and the entire body ! Great for the whole entire family !</li>
            <li> I love this product. After Chemotherapy the skin on my arms was always rough, full of bumps and prone to bruises. Since I am using the sulfur cream, I noticed a smoothing out of the skin within 4 applications. My condition is visibly getting better with every day of application. The 8 oz tub is by far the best value for the price. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> The package was broken.. Horrible!</li>
            <li> It seems to have helped somewhat....but I am still suffering from scabies.</li>
            <li> after a few uses it caused skin irritation</li>
            <li> Awesime. Stops the itching on my scalp. I will be ordering it again in the future. It seems to be helping my hair grow back too.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff ! It helps stop the itching from scabies and has a mild smell for it to contain sulfer , it also helps with hair growth ! Great product</li>
            <li> Excellent  product  just love it will buy it again .We still use it on our skin when needed our family loves it.</li>
            <li> Superior product, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and arrived quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> This is the best sulfur product out there...and I tried a lot. I use it on my scalp and the flaking has slowed down. The more I use it the better my scalp condition gets. And the smell is mild compared to other sulfur products I&#x27;ve used in the pass. This is a staple. I will use this as long as it is made.</li>
