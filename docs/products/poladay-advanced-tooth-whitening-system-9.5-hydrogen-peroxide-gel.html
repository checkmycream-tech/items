            <li>Good product .</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as good as the one I got aty dental office</li>
            <li>This whitening system works great and the price is even better.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the result, as is my dentist!  </li>
            <li>have ordered more already for both myself and as a surprise for my sister as a pressie!..</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cheaper and more convenient!</li>
            <li>Amazing, a whitener that delivers what they claim.</li>
            <li>I am meticulous about my teeth being their whitest and PolaDay works amazingly well...</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received so many compliments from friends about how good my teeth look.  </li>
            <li>This product was recommended to me, and i&#x27;m really thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li>Whitens just as effectively as the stuff I purchased at the dentist</li>
            <li>None of them have fallen off (yet) and men always compliment on how great my smile is.</li>
            <li>CONSEQUENTLY THE BEST DEAL IS DIRECT FROM MY DENTIST</li>
            <li>and I have to say this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy about that.</li>
            <li>So to have sparkling white teeth was a very pleasant surprise!</li>
            <li>To be sure I will call again.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even remember how many days this involved, using the product twice a day, (maybe 7-8 days?)</li>
            <li>And since I didn&#x27;t need the trays or the amount of applications, was able to get what I needed at a fraction of what the dentists visit was.  </li>
            <li>My son and his wife both use this product and are more than pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I only used 3 of the 4 syringes with excellent results.</li>
            <li>My teeth look great, not fake, but healthy and free of stains..</li>
            <li>Great product at a greatly discounted price compared to what I&#x27;ve paid to the dental office in the past years.</li>
            <li>Does a great job and does not make my gums sensitive.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and my teeth look great and very white.</li>
            <li>I also just finished a year in braces, and the whitening highlights the great work that was recently completed.  </li>
            <li>This product works wonders and the price is great, I had purchased the same whitening system from my dentist and payed 5x the cost of these.  </li>
            <li>My teeth look great, they are so white, I can&#x27;t believe my eyes.</li>
            <li>I had my teeth molded into plastic molds which cost upwards of $400 and well worth every penny!</li>
            <li>QUANTITY OF BLEACH IN EACH TUBE IS SIGNIFICANTLY</li>
            <li>Noticed significant whitening after three uses.</li>
            <li>My dentist made special trays for me and gave me PolaDay.</li>
            <li>Not as good as Day White</li>
            <li>This really works, Sam as what was prescribe by my dentist at at much better cost</li>
            <li>Though I got a full refund immediately, given by Amazon, what I got was not the 9.5% but 0.5%.  </li>
            <li>Great price, fast delivery, white teeth w/o sensitivity problems (and</li>
            <li>Keep in mind this product works best with trays that fit your teeth very well and to take the process slow so sensitivity doesn&#x27;t become too bothersome.</li>
            <li>Great product at half the cost on my dentist charges.</li>
            <li>I find it not as powerful as the Poladay</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy</li>
            <li>and this product really works, just need to make sure you buy whitening trays or if you have a  tray retainer like I do, then you are all set and ready to start whitening as soon as you receive the product.</li>
            <li>Luckily Amazon carries same brand at half the cost..very happy with this product will recommend!!</li>
            <li>I am glad that I am able to find all kinds of products for less at Amazon.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the quick delivery of the Pola Teeth Whitening Gels.</li>
            <li>Works super fast.</li>
            <li>I now only whiten for two days every six months and my teeth stay very nice and white.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product through Amazon because the tube my dentist gave me didn&#x27;t last, and I didn&#x27;t have the time to get to the dentist&#x27;s office to get more.  </li>
            <li>This is the exact product I received from the dentist.  </li>
            <li>The dentist charges high price!!</li>
            <li>This is a high strength, highest for &amp;#34;take home,&amp;#34; hydrogen peroxide treatment, it bleaches!!</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I already had trays, so the application was made that much easier.  </li>
            <li>and you will be very please with the results.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>(So, it really doesn&#x27;t matter when I eat,  because when I take the trays out is when I should notice.)</li>
            <li>When you get to be 50 or 60 and have consumed alot of coffee and tea for years and years, you probably shouldn&#x27;t expect much from this product.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my teeth color.</li>
            <li>The results have been much better than I expected!  </li>
            <li>If your looking to try something new, I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hurt and whitens better than anything you&#x27;ll likely find at your local drug store.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I was using a opalescence overnight treatment, and this is just as good, if not better since my teeth cone out so white in just 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Not sure why I looked at the very fine print on the tubes</li>
            <li>Although my teeth had never been white since I was a child, they had gotten even more dingy looking as I have aged.  </li>
            <li>From what I&#x27;d read and heard from different dentists, I didn&#x27;t think my teeth would whiten very much.</li>
            <li>Same exact product I paid for at the dentist...</li>
            <li>The dentist later told me it was okay to leave the gel on my teeth overnight, as long as my teeth were not sensitive to it.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth).</li>
            <li>The package was labeled PolaDay 9.5, but the tubes inside were PolaNight, a whole different type of product.</li>
            <li>It rooms few weeks to lighten my teeth to the shade I was comfortable with.</li>
            <li>Also, since the peroxide level is lower than some, it doesn&#x27;t leave me with sensitive teeth and eroded gums.</li>
            <li>only difference is the dentist charges nearly triple!</li>
            <li>The singlet oxygen that splits off of h2o2 is the active component of all whitening products that I am aware of.</li>
            <li>Makes me wonder about dental pricing in general....</li>
            <li>I asked my dentist about a professional whitening and he complied, making personalized forms for my upper and lower teeth.  </li>
            <li>PolaDay is left on too long, it can cause gum irritation which I had a little of when doing the original treatments prescribed by the dentist</li>
            <li>Same product I spent twice as much on from my Dentist.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the tim of the syringe does get a little clogged and too much</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I normally purchase this from my dentist, but discovered that it&#x27;s about half the price online.  </li>
            <li> This product whitens teeth fast and yeilds the same results as the products that I had purchased it from my dentist in the past.</li>
            <li> comes out from pushing the clog out, but that is minor.</li>
            <li> I was finally fed up with my less than white teeth and the over the counter whiteners just didn&#x27;t do the job for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different whiteners through my dental office over the years</li>
            <li> LESS THEN THOSE ACQUIRED AT</li>
            <li> Price for one syringe from my dentist was $30 vs. four from Amazon for about half the price.</li>
            <li> Also, did not produce sensitivity like all the other products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The four syringes don&#x27;t come in the expensive plastic case that I got from the dentist but each syringe is clearly marked with PolaDay and</li>
            <li> Just 30 min per day for a few days, then once per month.</li>
            <li> have a little common sense when using this product and don&#x27;t go overboard</li>
            <li> Not sure if this was a fluke or deliberate</li>
            <li> No one told me that, and I learned the hard way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tempting to over do the treatments but common sense</li>
            <li> It does the trick, albeit slowly.  </li>
            <li> And Amazon is the place to order this product, as it&#x27;s much less expensive than a dental office.</li>
            <li> It works and is less expensive here then at my dentist</li>
            <li> well that&#x27;s impossible, their teeth must be so bad (gray rotten teeth, perhaps?)</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Great product!  The same gel used by dentists.  I purchased this product through Amazon because the tube my dentist gave me didn&#x27;t last, and I didn&#x27;t have the time to get to the dentist&#x27;s office to get more.  The price was reasonable.  I am pleased with the result, as is my dentist!  I highly recommend it.  I&#x27;ve received so many compliments from friends about how good my teeth look.  I also just finished a year in braces, and the whitening highlights the great work that was recently completed.  This product is easy to use.  Remember to screw on the application tip!  No one told me that, and I learned the hard way.  I also was given different instructions.  The dentist later told me it was okay to leave the gel on my teeth overnight, as long as my teeth were not sensitive to it.  The results have been much better than I expected!  From what I&#x27;d read and heard from different dentists, I didn&#x27;t think my teeth would whiten very much. So to have sparkling white teeth was a very pleasant surprise!</li>
            <li> This product whitens teeth fast and yeilds the same results as the products that I had purchased it from my dentist in the past. I already had trays, so the application was made that much easier.  Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the quick delivery of the Pola Teeth Whitening Gels. Service was prompt. I saved heaps of money doing business with you.    To be sure I will call again.</li>
            <li> These arrived in an unmarked plastic bag. They don&#x27;t seem to work as well as Day White or Zoom. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the exact product I received from the dentist.  After the initial trays and 4 syringes, each additional syringe cost $15 and 4 could be purchased for $40 from the dental office!  So by purchasing this 8 pack, I saved $50!  Makes me wonder about dental pricing in general....</li>
            <li> I was finally fed up with my less than white teeth and the over the counter whiteners just didn&#x27;t do the job for me. Although my teeth had never been white since I was a child, they had gotten even more dingy looking as I have aged.  I asked my dentist about a professional whitening and he complied, making personalized forms for my upper and lower teeth.  He then sent me home with a kit of Poliday tooth whitening syringes. I can&#x27;t even remember how many days this involved, using the product twice a day, (maybe 7-8 days?) but I did come out of it with wonderfully whitened teeth.  I knew I couldn&#x27;t afford to redo this process every year and as I had the trays already, went hunting for the product.  Of course, Amazon had it!  And since I didn&#x27;t need the trays or the amount of applications, was able to get what I needed at a fraction of what the dentists visit was.  I now only whiten for two days every six months and my teeth stay very nice and white.  It&#x27;s tempting to over do the treatments but common sense tells one not to do this for teeth and gum health.  One syringe will last almost two days, upper and lowers, but my teeth are small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The four syringes don&#x27;t come in the expensive plastic case that I got from the dentist but each syringe is clearly marked with PolaDay and as I already knew how to apply and the length of time for each use, I needed no instructions.  My son and his wife both use this product and are more than pleased with it.  My son is a coffee consumer of great proportions so his teeth tend to stain but PolaDay takes care of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If PolaDay is left on too long, it can cause gum irritation which I had a little of when doing the original treatments prescribed by the dentist but now that I only use it to refresh the whiteness, I have no problem.  Again I will reiterate.....have a little common sense when using this product and don&#x27;t go overboard and you will be very please with the results.  As instructed by my dentist, I keep the PolaDay Syringes in the refrigerator.eep the PolaDay Syringes in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li> This is the same whitener I get from my Dentist but it&#x27;s 1/3 of the cost. I am happy with the results and packaging. I would recommend this to my family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;CC</li>
            <li> just follow the instructions in your white teeth are a couple weeks away</li>
            <li> Good product . Have to use for a longer period of time but results are great!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  It causes a noticeable whitening effect with just a couple of treatments and it is non-irritating to gums.  Sometimes the tim of the syringe does get a little clogged and too much comes out from pushing the clog out, but that is minor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and my teeth look great and very white. None of them have fallen off (yet) and men always compliment on how great my smile is. Note: do not try to use it on your cat; it won&#x27;t like it and it will scratch you.</li>
            <li> Great product at a greatly discounted price compared to what I&#x27;ve paid to the dental office in the past years. If your looking to try something new, I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a whitening kit from my dentist which included the 7.5 % and was told after I used it I could move to the 9.5. Decided to get it here at Amazon for a third the price and it is identical to the box of 7.5, but the stronger version. Works great. Will buy again. Shipped fast. Great packaging.</li>
            <li> Great product at half the cost on my dentist charges. I had my teeth molded into plastic molds which cost upwards of $400 and well worth every penny! The catch is maintaining your white teeth with the Polady gel. The dentist charges high price!! Luckily Amazon carries same brand at half the cost..very happy with this product will recommend!!</li>
            <li> Not as good as Day White</li>
            <li> It does the trick, albeit slowly.  I find it not as powerful as the Poladay I&#x27;ve used which I purchased from my dentist.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as good as the one I got aty dental office</li>
            <li> Great product. The singlet oxygen that splits off of h2o2 is the active component of all whitening products that I am aware of. Doesn&#x27;t hurt and whitens better than anything you&#x27;ll likely find at your local drug store.</li>
            <li> QUANTITY OF BLEACH IN EACH TUBE IS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THEN THOSE ACQUIRED AT MY DENTIST&#x27;S OFFICE. CONSEQUENTLY THE BEST DEAL IS DIRECT FROM MY DENTIST</li>
            <li> I normally purchase this from my dentist, but discovered that it&#x27;s about half the price online.  I&#x27;m pretty happy about that.</li>
            <li> This really works, Sam as what was prescribe by my dentist at at much better cost</li>
            <li> Same product I spent twice as much on from my Dentist. I already have the trays and saved a lot of money buying online rather than from the dental office.</li>
            <li> I just finished the 4th application  of whitening and see no difference.  Very disappointed. My teeth should be white by now. I&#x27;ve been doing 1/2 hour per evening before I go to bed,  so that I can have 7 hours of no food.  After I took the trays out,  I should have seen an immediate difference. (So, it really doesn&#x27;t matter when I eat,  because when I take the trays out is when I should notice.) Purchased 12% hydrogen peroxide this morning from Amazon,  and I will try that.</li>
            <li> One third of the price my dentist charges. Does a great job and does not make my gums sensitive.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders and the price is great, I had purchased the same whitening system from my dentist and payed 5x the cost of these.  Definitely worth the buy and this product really works, just need to make sure you buy whitening trays or if you have a  tray retainer like I do, then you are all set and ready to start whitening as soon as you receive the product.</li>
            <li> Amazing, a whitener that delivers what they claim. My teeth look great, they are so white, I can&#x27;t believe my eyes. Try it, it works. I am glad that I am able to find all kinds of products for less at Amazon. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Though I got a full refund immediately, given by Amazon, what I got was not the 9.5% but 0.5%.  That is as low as whitening toothpaste!  Because item looked just like the picture in the description, I almost accepted it.  Not sure why I looked at the very fine print on the tubes but I did and discovered the discrepancy.  Not sure if this was a fluke or deliberate but I will not be ordering from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Does a great job and is about 1/2 the cost of the dentists office.  Would recommend and I will buy again.</li>
            <li> When you get to be 50 or 60 and have consumed alot of coffee and tea for years and years, you probably shouldn&#x27;t expect much from this product.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast delivery, white teeth w/o sensitivity problems (and I have sensitive teeth).</li>
            <li> This is a great product that lives up to its promise and even works on &amp;#34;old teeth&amp;#34;. I only used 3 of the 4 syringes with excellent results. I stopped because you can over-whiten resulting in translucent teeth. Recommend a maximum of 30 minutes for each treatment. You&#x27;ll need formed trays for this product and follow the directions. Price for one syringe from my dentist was $30 vs. four from Amazon for about half the price.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me, and i&#x27;m really thrilled with the results.  My teeth look great, not fake, but healthy and free of stains.. have ordered more already for both myself and as a surprise for my sister as a pressie!..</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different whiteners through my dental office over the years and I have to say this one is by far the best. I am meticulous about my teeth being their whitest and PolaDay works amazingly well...And Amazon is the place to order this product, as it&#x27;s much less expensive than a dental office.</li>
            <li> This whitening system works great and the price is even better. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> It works and is less expensive here then at my dentist</li>
            <li> The package was labeled PolaDay 9.5, but the tubes inside were PolaNight, a whole different type of product. SECOND time this has happened.</li>
            <li> Several years ago my dentist made a mold of my teeth and set me up with 4 of these poladay&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;I found them online and they work just the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Say CHEEZE</li>
            <li> Amazing! Noticed significant whitening after three uses. Also, did not produce sensitivity like all the other products I have used in the past. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Works so good!</li>
            <li> Decided to whiten my teeth. My dentist made special trays for me and gave me PolaDay. It rooms few weeks to lighten my teeth to the shade I was comfortable with. I found the same bleaching product here on Amazon. I have bought it twice from this supplier as a back up to keep my teeth the shade I like. Keep in mind this product works best with trays that fit your teeth very well and to take the process slow so sensitivity doesn&#x27;t become too bothersome. Very glad I found this here!</li>
            <li> Same exact product I paid for at the dentist... only difference is the dentist charges nearly triple!</li>
            <li> Whitens just as effectively as the stuff I purchased at the dentist and it&#x27;s cheaper and more convenient! Also, since the peroxide level is lower than some, it doesn&#x27;t leave me with sensitive teeth and eroded gums. Will be purchasing again in the future.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my teeth color.</li>
            <li> Works great. Just 30 min per day for a few days, then once per month. I was using a opalescence overnight treatment, and this is just as good, if not better since my teeth cone out so white in just 30 minutes. I drink 2-3 cups of coffee per day, and a former smoker, so yea my teeth weren&#x27;t so white in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, someone had reviewed that this did nothing for them - well that&#x27;s impossible, their teeth must be so bad (gray rotten teeth, perhaps?) that they can&#x27;t be whitened... This is a high strength, highest for &amp;#34;take home,&amp;#34; hydrogen peroxide treatment, it bleaches!!</li>
            <li> Works super fast. I noticed the difference within a couple of uses.</li>
