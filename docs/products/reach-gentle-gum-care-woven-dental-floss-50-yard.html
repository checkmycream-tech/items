            <li>I don&#x27;t know why everyone doesn&#x27;t sell this great floss</li>
            <li>Maybe, but this stuff is great</li>
            <li>The woven feature makes it a great cleaner of the sides of teeth-- not just pulling junk out of the space where the teeth touch one another.  </li>
            <li>Great floss...</li>
            <li>Johnson and Johnson needs to start doing a better job at meeting the demand for this incredible product!</li>
            <li>Check around before you buy, this the best floss to use and make sure your getting the 50yd pieces with Flouride.</li>
            <li>My experience has always been a pleasant one with Amazon.</li>
            <li>The woven design provides superior cleaning in between teeth.</li>
            <li>Also good for teeth like mine that are prone to cut dental floss.</li>
            <li>Maybe a good opportunity to start a business if jj stopped making it</li>
            <li>The floss is good</li>
            <li>Loved the way this product makes my teeth feel after flossing.</li>
            <li>it tastes good and feels better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good stuff for flossing teeth.  </li>
            <li>My dentist&#x27;s office recommends this type of floss as the best, although the free sample they give you is always the waxed &#x27;tape&#x27; variety.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ability to get the best clean</li>
            <li>Very Satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, I really love it.</li>
            <li>I LoVE this floss!  </li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>I was advised by my dental hygienist to use the gentle gum care floss, so when I ran out of my sample I went online to find the best deal.</li>
            <li>Of all the flosses we have used over the years, this by far is the best.  </li>
            <li>I have yet to find a product of this sort that is more effective in removing inter proximal plaque.  </li>
            <li>All in all, this is excellent floss and the only kind I use now.  </li>
            <li>It has a good flavor, too, and makes your mouth feel fresh when finished.  </li>
            <li>My favorite floss on the market.</li>
            <li>This means that it slides between teeth in a more thorough way, getting out bits of food much better.    </li>
            <li>This makes the flossing really challenging.  </li>
            <li>but no where on this page does it say how many packs come with the order</li>
            <li>When the package arrived, it had a handwritten label on each pack of floss, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if the product had been tampered with.  </li>
            <li>Refreshing cinnamon after taste...</li>
            <li>and I love using it.</li>
            <li>I am glad that Amazon carries this stuff as I know now</li>
            <li>I am glad that Amazon carries this stuff as I know now</li>
            <li>American Wholesale who sells this product has one of the best prices on it.</li>
            <li>I think it does a better job of getting food out between teeth.  </li>
            <li>And I wasn&#x27;t able to get it in any CVS or anything.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite dental floss</li>
            <li>Easy to hold in my fingers and cleans much better than waxed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Flossing is probably the most important procedure you can perform during your oral hygiene routine; in many ways it is even more important than brushing.  </li>
            <li>, it seems to clean better, and has a better mouth &#x27;feel&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Wish it was more available in stores as I had to go online to find it after my sample from the dentist was gone.</li>
            <li>This floss works better for me than others smooth varieties.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and not cumbersome or plastic or waxy.  </li>
            <li>Whoever read this can surely figure out why I returned it for a full refund.</li>
            <li>This floss is the best you can buy, hands down.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best for being gentle and yet strong enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re teeth unless you have huge gaps, it gets stuck</li>
            <li>Used with brushing, it&#x27;s fantastic floss.</li>
            <li>My husband likes this floss as it is gentle, but effective.</li>
            <li>The best description I have read has been \\&quot;other floss just cuts the film on your teeth\\&quot;, exactly!  </li>
            <li>I know why:  I see significant improvement in my gums, and the toothpaste-coating makes my mouth feel even cleaner than brushing.  </li>
            <li>dentist insists this is the best on the market, however very few stores carry it.  </li>
            <li>This stuff not only keeps your teeth healthy, but more importantly, our gums.  </li>
            <li>If you have teeth that are really, REALLY close together, the tape style may suit you better.</li>
            <li>The first pack I opened seemed just fine, however, after about one week of use, the cartridge fell out</li>
            <li>Super.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t mid flossing but using this kind is a huge chore.</li>
            <li>, I was in a panic, it really wouldn&#x27;t come out!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why this particular type of floss is getting so scarce, but it&#x27;s nice to know you can still get a good deal on it here.</li>
            <li>Really cleans between teeth and makes you feel like your really getting somewhere in keeping your gums healthy.</li>
            <li>I have found that using a bit of extra floss to wrap twice around the fingers works nicely or if I tie two loops in either end.  </li>
            <li>floss is definitely worth the money and effort to find.  </li>
            <li>Flossing with this product is quick, effective and easy, so you do it everyday.</li>
            <li>This product really clean my teeth while gentle.</li>
            <li>floss is quite gentle on the gums yet at the same time extremely effective.  </li>
            <li>very gentle on my gums.</li>
            <li>It is a very gentle floss but the woven floss also pulls out all the goop and gunk stuck in your teeth.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on my gums and easier to use than waxed floss</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t need to be waxed because it maneuvers through teeth very gently.  </li>
            <li>This shreds, it&#x27;s STICKY, very, very STICKY</li>
            <li>Amazon had it, so I purchased to find that it is exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t opened it yet, but it looks exactly like what I wanted...:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joanie</li>
            <li>Johnson &amp; Johnson needs to get off their duff and start doing a better job of getting this stuff on local shelves and keeping it there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Johnson &amp; Johnson needs to get off their duff and start doing a better job of getting this stuff on local shelves and keeping it there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;she got a small sample from her dentist and loved it and had been buying it since then.</li>
            <li>With regular good dental hygiene and my floss, I expect to have them a long time.</li>
            <li>and this really \\&quot;cuts to the chase\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Found 3 times the amount at the same price on Ebay with FREE (imagine that) shipping.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve learned to manipulate the woven floss so this doesn&#x27;t happen so much.</li>
            <li>Because it is woven, there is more \\&quot;scrubbing\\&quot; action between teeth which I can definitely feel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll not be going back to using waxed floss that doesn&#x27;t actually clean anything.</li>
            <li>Gentle on my gums, my bottom teeth are fairly tight but this floss is pretty easy to get in between.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t go as far to say that we suffer from an obsessive disorder as to flossing, but I must tell you that we both come pretty close.  </li>
            <li>But the price listed here is too high.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it for people with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>-- it is sturdy and thick but when you pull it taut it glides very easily between teeth.</li>
            <li>Really gets between your teeth well to clean the tight spaces.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using plain old glide for many years.</li>
            <li>Be nice if could get this WITHOUT anything added onto the &amp;#34;string/floss&amp;#34; - why is it necessary put this coating/flavor on things, can&#x27;t someone just make PLAIN UNFLAVORED floss??</li>
            <li>You have to re-floss the same teeth 2, or 3 times in order to get the same level of thorough clean</li>
            <li>so it misses nothing but is easy to pull through the narrow spots between teeth.</li>
            <li>I was somewhat suspicious, because I placed the order with an electronics firm at a really good price, though it seemed odd for a dental product.</li>
            <li>the soft woven came apart when used.</li>
            <li>This is a more expensive floss but worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Sure it is thick as others mentioned.  </li>
            <li>Expensive, but does a good job, especially in areas that have larger than normal spaces.  </li>
            <li>reach if your reading this, what&#x27;s so hard to make a plain waxed kind with fluoride?</li>

            <li> The thread is gentle and not too thin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m having trouble finding it in the store and will order again in the future.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick but soft</li>
            <li> First, is it thicker than the typical flimsy / thin floss.  </li>

            <li> Needless to say I&#x27;m very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : I have previously found it in Walmart and Walgreen&#x27;s carries it also.</li>
            <li> It is slightly waxed.</li>
            <li> Previous floss only &#x27;cut&#x27; the goop due to it being so thin.</li>

            <li> This floss, once slightly wet, is impossible to hold onto, because it gets very slippery.  </li>
            <li> must note, as have other reviewers that this stuff can be sort of difficult to find in local stores.  </li>
            <li> This floss is not cheap and the Amazon price here is just about right...could be that it is a bit less expensive that some we have bought locally.</li>

            <li> I have had a hard time finding this one in stores, too, but haven&#x27;t had a filling since I started using it per my dentist&#x27;s suggestion 6 years ago.</li>
            <li> hard to find in the pharmacy</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> it seems to be common sense to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just never liked that stuff.</li>
            <li> NOT worth the expense of ordering online plus expensive (and wasteful) shipping.  </li>
            <li> But do keep this serious drawback in mind.  </li>
            <li> &quot; it&#x27;s very hard to get this in between</li>
            <li> It is tough to find in stores, so</li>
            <li> I just wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive and so hard to find even on here.</li>
            <li> this floss is a bunch of individual fibers, I hate it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a thin piece of string</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m having to use crappy thin waxed floss, and hating every minute of it.  </li>
            <li> Ridiculously priced item!</li>
            <li> IT took at least 15-20 min to get it out!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s so expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so difficult to find this floss</li>
            <li> my daughter found this on your site; she had been looking for it in stores, but unable to find.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Threads are twisted into a \\&quot;rope\\&quot; with a minty paste.  </li>
            <li> Again, this product is difficult to find in stores--why?</li>
            <li> Expensive.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is also nearly impossible to find it on store shelves.  </li>
            <li> If you hate to floss, claim your fingers hurt while doing so, your mouth gets sore?</li>
            <li> I hate mint floss and unwaxed but gave this a try.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am extremely happy with this product. I have used it for years and have a hard time finding it in the stores. My experience has always been a pleasant one with Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding this one in stores, too, but haven&#x27;t had a filling since I started using it per my dentist&#x27;s suggestion 6 years ago. FYI: I have previously found it in Walmart and Walgreen&#x27;s carries it also.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this to me.  I have a terrible problem with plaque and this really \\&quot;cuts to the chase\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s thick but soft so it misses nothing but is easy to pull through the narrow spots between teeth. Wish it was more available in stores as I had to go online to find it after my sample from the dentist was gone.</li>
            <li> We need this woven type floss and could not find it in the stores.  Gratified to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> The woven design provides superior cleaning in between teeth. When flossing with an abrasive toothpaste you double the cleaning effectiveness in between teeth. Also good for teeth like mine that are prone to cut dental floss.</li>
            <li> this floss is a bunch of individual fibers, I hate it. I wanted a woven floss not this junk. It catches on my fillings etc. and bunches and tears. Itdoesn&#x27;t make sense to have to floss the floss out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken to ordering this floss on line, as I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore due to it&#x27;s being sold out.  It&#x27;s the best for being gentle and yet strong enough to do the job.  It has a good flavor, too, and makes your mouth feel fresh when finished.  My favorite floss on the market.</li>
            <li> Gentle on my gums, my bottom teeth are fairly tight but this floss is pretty easy to get in between.  Because it is woven, there is more \\&quot;scrubbing\\&quot; action between teeth which I can definitely feel.  We&#x27;ll see how it goes at my next check up.</li>
            <li> This floss was recommended by my hygenist.  It looks thicker, but when you pull it tight, its not too thick.  The woven property of this floss traps food between the threads so you can actually see the food particles being pulled out.  My hygenist also told me to ditch the \\&quot;glide\\&quot; floss as it has a tendency to cut into gums since its flat and a bit sharp on edges.  It is tough to find in stores, so when I can, I order a dozen at a time.  After using it for some weeks, my hygenist told me that she sees a big difference.  Thats enough for me to keep using it.</li>
            <li> I like two features of this floss.  First, is it thicker than the typical flimsy / thin floss.  It&#x27;s like a thin piece of string (it&#x27;s woven).  This means that it slides between teeth in a more thorough way, getting out bits of food much better.    Second, it has fluoride along it, which helps for getting fluoride in the hard-to-reach cracks.    All in all, this is excellent floss and the only kind I use now.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the only Floss that I use. All the other&#x27;s just don&#x27;t do the job. Very Satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> At price quoted expected a multi unit pack (same as other Reach products)</li>
            <li> very gentle on my gums. will buy again.</li>
            <li> I LoVE this floss!  The flouride has helped re-calcify a small cavity and it&#x27;s ability to get the best clean has warded off gum disease and gingivitis! Sadly, this product seems to be out of stock most places.  Johnson and Johnson needs to start doing a better job at meeting the demand for this incredible product!</li>
            <li> This floss is the best you can buy, hands down.  Unfortunately, it is also nearly impossible to find it on store shelves.  The best description I have read has been \\&quot;other floss just cuts the film on your teeth\\&quot;, exactly!  This stuff actually removes all that gunk.  I waited too long to order this and I&#x27;m having to use crappy thin waxed floss, and hating every minute of it.  You have to re-floss the same teeth 2, or 3 times in order to get the same level of thorough clean this stuff can do on a once over.  My only gripe is how expensive it is.  At this price, I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s made from the hair of orphaned children, or possibly the mane of a unicorn.  I suppose you get what you pay for though.</li>
            <li> This floss, once slightly wet, is impossible to hold onto, because it gets very slippery.  This makes the flossing really challenging.  Sure it is thick as others mentioned.  But do keep this serious drawback in mind.  Personally, I would recommend other brands because of this flaw.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I really love it.</li>
            <li> recommended by my dentist - works well</li>
            <li> The product I received did not match the product pictured when I made the purchase.  I will not be purchasing anything else from this seller.</li>
            <li> It is a very gentle floss but the woven floss also pulls out all the goop and gunk stuck in your teeth. Previous floss only &#x27;cut&#x27; the goop due to it being so thin. &lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
            <li> This woven floss is the best for removing food debris. The other types don&#x27;t grab the food bit because they are too slippery. But the price listed here is too high. Maybe a good opportunity to start a business if jj stopped making it</li>
            <li> This product really clean my teeth while gentle. I have no sensitivity after using it. I really recommend it for people with sensitive teeth. It worked for me.</li>
            <li> The floss is good but no where on this page does it say how many packs come with the order so I have to assume 1, for $33.50??  I would expect 6 packs but I did a search for &amp;#34;6&amp;#34; and didn&#x27;t find it.  I don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s so expensive.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found it at any local store. Very gentle on my gums and easier to use than waxed floss</li>
            <li> Sent it back - outrageously expensive</li>
            <li> Excellent product and excellent delivery...dentist insists this is the best on the market, however very few stores carry it.  It is woven so attracts plaque and hold onto it rather than push it around.</li>
            <li> This floss works better for me than others smooth varieties.  I was somewhat suspicious, because I placed the order with an electronics firm at a really good price, though it seemed odd for a dental product. When the package arrived, it had a handwritten label on each pack of floss, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if the product had been tampered with.  The first pack I opened seemed just fine, however, after about one week of use, the cartridge fell out and I had to reposition the spool and the thread it back into container.  Not sure if this is a distributer issue or a J &amp; J issue?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so difficult to find this floss so I order it on Amazon. This is the best floss I&#x27;ve ever tried and I hope the company never discontinues it. Flossing with this product is quick, effective and easy, so you do it everyday.</li>
            <li> IMPOSIBLE to find in any store!!. Amazon has everything. This is the best floss on earth. Really cleans between teeth and makes you feel like your really getting somewhere in keeping your gums healthy. I just wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive and so hard to find even on here. Some places say they don&#x27;t sell it anymore. I don&#x27;t know why everyone doesn&#x27;t sell this great floss but next time I&#x27;m buying a half dozen of them.</li>
            <li> Loved the way this product makes my teeth feel after flossing. Will continue to used.  Refreshing cinnamon after taste...</li>
            <li> Maybe, but this stuff is great and I love using it. The thread is gentle and not too thin. Really gets between your teeth well to clean the tight spaces. Awesome taste and even has fluoride. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Ordered only  because I could not find it at any local drug store. NOT worth the expense of ordering online plus expensive (and wasteful) shipping.  Johnson and Johnson will have to get this product out in the local market if I am to purchase again.</li>
            <li> I returned this product.  I bought was I thought was a 6 or 12 pack of this type of floss. What I received was ONE package and I was charged $45.00 for it!!!  Whoever read this can surely figure out why I returned it for a full refund.</li>
            <li> hard to find in the pharmacy&lt;br /&gt;great floss</li>
            <li> If you hate to floss, claim your fingers hurt while doing so, your mouth gets sore? Well this is the product for you. It is difficult to find in local stores in my home town so had to seek out on Amazon--but it was well worth the effort.</li>
            <li> My dental hygenist recommended this brand an now I know why:  I see significant improvement in my gums, and the toothpaste-coating makes my mouth feel even cleaner than brushing.  Used with brushing, it&#x27;s fantastic floss.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I ever bo th e red with regular waxed dental floss. This gets everything out!</li>
            <li> I was advised by my dental hygienist to use the gentle gum care floss, so when I ran out of my sample I went online to find the best deal. Amazon had it, so I purchased to find that it is exactly what it says it is. It was really hard to find locally, until I found it recently at Target for less (but not much).</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t opened it yet, but it looks exactly like what I wanted...:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joanie Musolino</li>
            <li> For the price I paid I expected a case rather than one single item.  Incredible ripoff.</li>
            <li> Best floss ever!  I got tired of cheap dental floss that would shred during use.  This is the solution.  Everything you could want in a luxury dental floss -- it is sturdy and thick but when you pull it taut it glides very easily between teeth.</li>
            <li> Both my wife and I could be considered flossing fanatics.  I won&#x27;t go as far to say that we suffer from an obsessive disorder as to flossing, but I must tell you that we both come pretty close.  We have both been this way since we were wee ones and that was around 70 years ago.  Of all the flosses we have used over the years, this by far is the best.  I have yet to find a product of this sort that is more effective in removing inter proximal plaque.  This stuff not only keeps your teeth healthy, but more importantly, our gums.  As a testimonial to flossing I can tell you that we both still have all of our teeth and neither of us has ever suffered from any sort of gum disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This floss is quite gentle on the gums yet at the same time extremely effective.  We of course keep a container of this in all of our bathrooms but in addition keep a pack in both cars, in my wife&#x27;s purse and indeed, in my \\&quot;man purse.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now there are a couple of things to note.  If you find that this product hangs up on your fillings and such, this probably means that you have defective fillings or that some dentist has done a shoddy job.  It is not the flosses fault.  Secondly, this stuff does get a bit slippery when used.  I have found that using a bit of extra floss to wrap twice around the fingers works nicely or if I tie two loops in either end.  This takes little time and puts a stop to the slipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We personally like the spearmint flavor and the waxed coated variety...it tastes good and feels better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flossing is probably the most important procedure you can perform during your oral hygiene routine; in many ways it is even more important than brushing.  As long as you do it, you might as well use the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must note, as have other reviewers that this stuff can be sort of difficult to find in local stores.  Sometimes they have it on stock, other times they do not. When our stores do have it on their shelves, we tend to buy several containers of the stuff.  This floss is not cheap and the Amazon price here is just about right...could be that it is a bit less expensive that some we have bought locally. I am glad that Amazon carries this stuff as I know now I will not run out due to lack of availability locally.  Johnson &amp; Johnson needs to get off their duff and start doing a better job of getting this stuff on local shelves and keeping it there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don Blankenship&lt;br /&gt;The Ozarksntainers of the stuff.

            <li> Best floss on the market.</li>
            <li> American Wholesale who sells this product has one of the best prices on it. However, once you check out the shipping cost - which is horrendous - you should look elsewhere. After seeing the price for shipping at checkout to be all but $28 for a bulk pack of 6 that weighs only a pound or two, I shopped elsewhere! Found 3 times the amount at the same price on Ebay with FREE (imagine that) shipping. I sent them an email about this and received a short unsatisfying reponse \\&quot;we sell a 6 pack listing to save you on these costs.\\&quot; Well you won&#x27;t see that in the checkout price. Check around before you buy, this the best floss to use and make sure your getting the 50yd pieces with Flouride. Using this floss for 30 years and have not had a cavity in the last 25 years.</li>
            <li> Since finding this floss I have never used another except when I run out of this one!  The woven feature makes it a great cleaner of the sides of teeth-- not just pulling junk out of the space where the teeth touch one another.  It doesn&#x27;t need to be waxed because it maneuvers through teeth very gently.  It is mint flavored but not noticeably so.&lt;br /&gt;This floss is definitely worth the money and effort to find.  I&#x27;ll not be going back to using waxed floss that doesn&#x27;t actually clean anything.</li>
            <li> This is a more expensive floss but worth the price.  I think it does a better job of getting food out between teeth.  My dentist approves too.</li>
            <li> my daughter found this on your site; she had been looking for it in stores, but unable to find.&lt;br /&gt;she got a small sample from her dentist and loved it and had been buying it since then.</li>
            <li> Much to expensive - much cheaper at the markets if you can find it</li>
            <li> Expensive, but does a good job, especially in areas that have larger than normal spaces.  I intend to keep using it as long as I have my teeth.  With regular good dental hygiene and my floss, I expect to have them a long time.</li>
            <li> Good stuff for flossing teeth.  Easy to use and not cumbersome or plastic or waxy.  Tried others and don&#x27;t like waxy finish on teeth from waxy tape products or plastic picks.</li>
            <li> Ridiculously priced item! Buy it in the drugstore for 1/5 the price!</li>
            <li> My husband likes this floss as it is gentle, but effective. It does not shred like some brands. It is slightly waxed.</li>
            <li> This woven floss has two \\&quot;threads\\&quot;, one blue, one white.  Threads are twisted into a \\&quot;rope\\&quot; with a minty paste.  Works almost as well as \\&quot;cleanpaste\\&quot; floss.</li>
            <li> Super.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> The best floss in the market!</li>
            <li> I wanted a floss with fluoride and strangely this was the only one I could find (WHY is that???) I hate mint floss and unwaxed but gave this a try. I&#x27;ve been using plain old glide for many years. This shreds, it&#x27;s STICKY, very, very STICKY it&#x27;s woven and there are two \\&quot;stings\\&quot; it&#x27;s very hard to get this in between you&#x27;re teeth unless you have huge gaps, it gets stuck and you have to use tweezers to get the pieces of string out from in between your teeth. IT took at least 15-20 min to get it out!! I thought I was going to have to go to the dentist to have them fish this floss that was LODGED stuck between too teeth, I was in a panic, it really wouldn&#x27;t come out!! It&#x27;s basically a disaster compared to glide. I really don&#x27;t mid flossing but using this kind is a huge chore. Needless to say I&#x27;m very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking for a floss with fluoride hopefully waxed, PLEASE if you know of any comment me back, thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And reach if your reading this, what&#x27;s so hard to make a plain waxed kind with fluoride? And why did it take years for someone to even come up with this concept it seems to be common sense to me.</li>
            <li> My dentist tell me I should used UNWAXED floss. This is what she recommended. And I wasn&#x27;t able to get it in any CVS or anything. But of course, Amazon had it!</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores. My wife loves them.</li>
            <li> Be nice if could get this WITHOUT anything added onto the &amp;#34;string/floss&amp;#34; - why is it necessary put this coating/flavor on things, can&#x27;t someone just make PLAIN UNFLAVORED floss??</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and have had no cavities. Only floss the teeth you want to keep. Again, this product is difficult to find in stores--why?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this particular type of floss is getting so scarce, but it&#x27;s nice to know you can still get a good deal on it here. My dentist&#x27;s office recommends this type of floss as the best, although the free sample they give you is always the waxed &#x27;tape&#x27; variety. I&#x27;ve just never liked that stuff. If you have teeth that are really, REALLY close together, the tape style may suit you better. But I like the woven floss, it seems to clean better, and has a better mouth &#x27;feel&#x27;. The only downside to this floss (besides the price), it will occasionally shred, leaving little curly cues of fiber between your teeth. Tape-style floss isn&#x27;t immune to this either. But I&#x27;ve learned to manipulate the woven floss so this doesn&#x27;t happen so much.</li>
            <li> the soft woven came apart when used.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite dental floss and I&#x27;m having trouble finding it in the store and will order again in the future.</li>
            <li> Expensive. THought it came in 6, but got one.</li>
            <li> Great floss...but why is it double in cost here at Amazon.  Wow!&lt;br /&gt;Every floss is waxed but this ONE and that&#x27;s the reason I like it so well.  Easy to hold in my fingers and cleans much better than waxed.</li>
