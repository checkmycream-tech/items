            <li>Much better prices than what you find in stores!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great that they are latex free</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t be more pleased!  </li>
            <li>absolutely perfect for professional makeup.</li>
            <li>I find the foundation goes on very smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I use them for every day make up as well as stage make up.  :)</li>
            <li>Also more porous than ones I buy at CVS.</li>
            <li>but these are better</li>
            <li>The brushes work better for me.</li>
            <li>I get a better finish blending with my fingertips.  </li>
            <li>: They don&#x27;t wash off easily, and if using for nail art, it takes off the bottom coat more often than not.</li>
            <li>Will order again, I love that these are latex free</li>
            <li>They are a great sponge for the price and having a whole bag of them is really useful.</li>
            <li>Super cheap and does what it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
            <li>you get a HUGE amount of these for the money.  </li>
            <li>I use these sponges to do foundation applications and to smooth out concealer, etc.</li>
            <li>I have been using sponges for a long time to apply foundation and these are the best I have used so far.</li>
            <li>Good overall.</li>
            <li>They allow me to pick up just the right amount of ink, and lightly blend it into the edges of my card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are also great if you use them slightly damp to blend makeup or mistakes.</li>
            <li>These are essential for makeup application and the large bag of sponges are a good buy.  </li>
            <li>They are smooth but don&#x27;t absorb too much makeup.  </li>
            <li>Cheap for the amount of wedges you get, work easily, very soft.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I told her that was more old fashioned then the sponges.  </li>
            <li>these sponges are worth it.</li>
            <li>Was surprised how many were in the package for the price.  </li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B00C1SMYPS Faber-Castell Mix &amp; Match Gelatos Colors Tropical Creamy Vibrant Water Soluble]] -- they allow a nice soft \\&quot;feathering\\&quot; of colors without shredding the cardstock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>materials are very soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I though these would be great for dabbing over small wall dings and getting into corners, but they made a mockery out of my years of DIY painting.</li>
            <li>While these are a tad bit smaller than others that I have purchased, the size is still adequate and they are made of the good solid foam that prevents the liquid makeup from coming all the way through the sponge.  </li>
            <li>- they are ok - but only that</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and what I needed.</li>
            <li>I am REALLY picky about my sponges!  </li>
            <li>For a light application feathered into one&#x27;s natural skin tone, they might work well...</li>
            <li>These are soft and cheap and plenitful.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed and they have no odor like some brands do.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I found these wedges completely inappropriate for my facepaint; they don&#x27;t hold enough colour, don&#x27;t apply smoothly, and a stippling application leaves very distinct patterns.</li>
            <li>I basically bought these because the price per sponge is much cheaper than you could get pretty much anywhere else.  </li>
            <li>Product seems to be very high quality.</li>
            <li>&quot; the edges of different parts of the card with a light shading of beige or brown ink.  </li>
            <li>I really like these sponges.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These work very well.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>These work really, really well</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear much makeup, but bought these because I do work with a few drama groups and these came in handy to apply face make-up and</li>
            <li>These were purchased in bulk for a high school production make up crew and performed very well.  </li>
            <li>We will likely be purchasing more for the next show.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t have high expectations.</li>
            <li>Seems to absorb and wast a little more of my foundation but applies well.</li>
            <li>Got a few sponges in the store for more money</li>
            <li>Big enough to handle easily and apply evenly.  </li>
            <li>I use these just to clean up makeup mistakes but not really for applying foundation.  </li>
            <li>it feels really soft but doesn&#x27;t work well as make up sponges.</li>
            <li>Being a Juggalo, I apply makeup frequently, so I thought I&#x27;d go for a higher-quality applicator.</li>
            <li>They soak up just enough and blend really well.</li>
            <li>I know they&#x27;re intended for use with make-up, but they definitely are useful for other applications.  </li>
            <li>ok product but not in wedges -- the latex was all jammed together and in a big wad - the &amp;#34;wedges&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t reform even after they were separated (peeled apart) and left to &amp;#34;rest&amp;#34;; they are still in different weird shapes without edges or straight sides.</li>
            <li>I had trouble finding them in the stores near where I live, so I bought them from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Make up doesn&#x27;t run as smooth comparing to other brands I used in the past.</li>

            <li> So tired of washing makeup sponges and running out of clean ones at the most inconvenient time.</li>
            <li> earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> These sponges absorb a lot of product and releases so little back onto my face.  </li>
            <li> Some of them were wet because it was raining</li>
            <li> They are firm and feel solid.</li>
            <li> The sponges expand when wet, which means no rinsing them.</li>
            <li> My only complaint was the bag being ripped and water getting in.</li>
            <li> black face paint for some of our dramas.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that it really sucks product up, which means a lot goes to waste when you apply your foundation/BB cream/whatever.</li>
            <li> This bag of 100 ought to solve that little problem.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of time.</li>
            <li> sponge surface is overly slick.</li>
            <li> Resorted to small paint brushes out of frustration.</li>
            <li> no more acne!  </li>
            <li> I was psyched when I saw this deal and reviews because seemed I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> and it was a bad job of them taping the bag</li>
            <li> but for a full-coverage application, they&#x27;re terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great wedges for makeup.  Cheaper than in the stores.</li>
            <li> I make a lot of hand-crafted greeting cards, and often like to \\&quot;distress\\&quot; the edges of different parts of the card with a light shading of beige or brown ink.  These foam wedges are PERFECT for this purpose!  They allow me to pick up just the right amount of ink, and lightly blend it into the edges of my card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also work well for blending Gelatos, like these: [[ASIN:B00C1SMYPS Faber-Castell Mix &amp; Match Gelatos Colors Tropical Creamy Vibrant Water Soluble]] -- they allow a nice soft \\&quot;feathering\\&quot; of colors without shredding the cardstock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And you get a HUGE amount of these for the money.  I know they&#x27;re intended for use with make-up, but they definitely are useful for other applications.  Very happy with these!</li>
            <li> ok product but not in wedges -- the latex was all jammed together and in a big wad - the &amp;#34;wedges&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t reform even after they were separated (peeled apart) and left to &amp;#34;rest&amp;#34;; they are still in different weird shapes without edges or straight sides. - they are ok - but only that</li>
            <li> Make up doesn&#x27;t run as smooth comparing to other brands I used in the past. I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again!</li>
            <li> These foam wedges work great for applying liquid foundation. I had trouble finding them in the stores near where I live, so I bought them from Amazon. I would definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li> Perfect for Manicure Gradients!</li>
            <li> The actually packed of sponges had been ripped open and taped back up.  Some of them were wet because it was raining and it was a bad job of them taping the bag shut.  The sponges were good quality.  My only complaint was the bag being ripped and water getting in.</li>
            <li> This should be a sanitary product, as it&#x27;s used for the face, but it arrived open and spilled out inside the box. My wife returned the item.</li>
            <li> Big bag! Good quality</li>
            <li> I was psyched when I saw this deal and reviews because seemed I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.  Then this big ol box arrives for these wedges and the bag inside had exploded and wedges were everywhere.  Not the beginning I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> It creates a nicer texture and blending make up</li>
            <li> These foam wedges are smaller than the wedges I have always used. They are soft and do the job, but are a little more difficult to handle because of their size.</li>
            <li> I really like these sponges.  They are smooth but don&#x27;t absorb too much makeup.  I find the foundation goes on very smoothly.  I have been using sponges for a long time to apply foundation and these are the best I have used so far.</li>
            <li> Perfect texture. I use every day.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for makeup sponges or wedges that are not pricey and do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;These work very well. They blend my make up onto my face evenly, and the bag of 100&lt;br /&gt;has lasted me 9 months. Much better prices than what you find in stores!</li>
            <li> got these for my granddaughters makeup... one loved them the other one said they were old fashioned... lol she uses her fingers for base.  I told her that was more old fashioned then the sponges.  lol You just gotta love the grandkids.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased the package of wedges for use as make up applicators.  Exactly what I wanted and what I needed.</li>
            <li> The bag came in today...earlier then expected. I ordered these to try to learn how to do some nail art. I probably will never use them all in my lifetime but will share with my daughter. I have never used these type of sponges but it sure is a lot of sponges and great price.</li>
            <li> Good price. Works very well.</li>
            <li> These are the best foam wedges ever! They are firm and feel solid. It can withstand application of foundation without that flimsy feel.</li>
            <li> good price, nice service. But the wedges are thicker than I like to use, and won&#x27;t be as good as some I bought in the grocery store for what I need them for.</li>
            <li> Life hack of the week! So tired of washing makeup sponges and running out of clean ones at the most inconvenient time. This bag of 100 ought to solve that little problem. Product seems to be very high quality.</li>
            <li> I am REALLY picky about my sponges!  They can&#x27;t be coarse... they have to apply make up well ... and I don&#x27;t like latex!  These work really, really well and I can&#x27;t be more pleased!  I use them for every day make up as well as stage make up.  :)</li>
            <li> While these are a tad bit smaller than others that I have purchased, the size is still adequate and they are made of the good solid foam that prevents the liquid makeup from coming all the way through the sponge.  I&#x27;ll buy them again when this bag runs out.</li>
            <li> it feels really soft but doesn&#x27;t work well as make up sponges.</li>
            <li> these sponges are worth it. you get so many in a great price.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. It serves it&#x27;s purpose quite well! I would recommend this product to others to purchase.</li>
            <li> Not the same material as the ones I&#x27;m used to. Seems to absorb and wast a little more of my foundation but applies well. Good overall.</li>
            <li> These are all jumbled up in a mass, so lost a lot of their shape. Also more porous than ones I buy at CVS.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear much makeup, but bought these because I do work with a few drama groups and these came in handy to apply face make-up and black face paint for some of our dramas.  Big enough to handle easily and apply evenly.  I have a latex allergy, so having latex-free product was essential.</li>
            <li> Good quality and dosent&#x27; feel like plastic.  Have bought more expensive pads but these are better</li>
            <li> The sponges expand when wet, which means no rinsing them. There are a lot of sponges for the price so I didn&#x27;t have high expectations.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat these for the price.  The size works beautifully.  The Wedges are great!</li>
            <li> Being a Juggalo, I apply makeup frequently, so I thought I&#x27;d go for a higher-quality applicator. I found these wedges completely inappropriate for my facepaint; they don&#x27;t hold enough colour, don&#x27;t apply smoothly, and a stippling application leaves very distinct patterns. For a light application feathered into one&#x27;s natural skin tone, they might work well... but for a full-coverage application, they&#x27;re terrible.</li>
            <li> Was surprised how many were in the package for the price.  Got a few sponges in the store for more money</li>
            <li> These were purchased in bulk for a high school production make up crew and performed very well.  We will likely be purchasing more for the next show.</li>
            <li> I use these just to clean up makeup mistakes but not really for applying foundation.  I used to use sponges for that.  Now I use makeup brushes.  The brushes work better for me.</li>
            <li> these are the best foams!!! I am a makeup artist and these are the only sponnges I like to use on my clients! excellent for applying foundation, eye makeup cleanup/touchups, and compact size - makes for comfortable application</li>
            <li> Will order again, I love that these are latex free</li>
            <li> These are soft and cheap and plenitful.  I use them for applying foundation and since doing that (instead of using my fingers) no more acne!  whooo hoooo.... take my tip to heart teens!</li>
            <li> I basically bought these because the price per sponge is much cheaper than you could get pretty much anywhere else.  They just also happen to be great sponges that apply makeup well.  I used these sponges to apply cream makeup for a Halloween look and they blended the makeup flawlessly.  It&#x27;s also great that they are latex free so you don&#x27;t have to worry about a client being allergic to latex.</li>
            <li> These are a great value, are TRULY latex free and are a great value! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought these sponges to replace the last (and fourth) beauty blender i tore and can&#x27;t afford to replace.  These sponges absorb a lot of product and releases so little back onto my face.  I get a better finish blending with my fingertips.  Paint: sponge surface is overly slick. I though these would be great for dabbing over small wall dings and getting into corners, but they made a mockery out of my years of DIY painting. Resorted to small paint brushes out of frustration. Waste of money. Waste of time.</li>
            <li> These are essential for makeup application and the large bag of sponges are a good buy.  Would definitely recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Super cheap and does what it&#x27;s supposed to! The only downside is that it really sucks product up, which means a lot goes to waste when you apply your foundation/BB cream/whatever.</li>
            <li> I use these sponges to do foundation applications and to smooth out concealer, etc. They are a great sponge for the price and having a whole bag of them is really useful. They are also great if you use them slightly damp to blend makeup or mistakes.</li>
            <li> just what i was looking for. absolutely perfect for professional makeup. it does not smell ! materials are very soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Exactly what I needed and they have no odor like some brands do.  Great value.</li>
            <li> Pros: Cheap for the amount of wedges you get, work easily, very soft.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: They don&#x27;t wash off easily, and if using for nail art, it takes off the bottom coat more often than not.</li>
            <li> I think these are great. They soak up just enough and blend really well. Great Value!</li>
            <li> Assorted sizes, but thought they would be bigger</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  Will purchase again.</li>
