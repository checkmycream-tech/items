            <li>This is really awesome.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser seems to keep my acne at bay the best.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive, but nothing impressive.</li>
            <li>but it seems best to stick with Burt&#x27;s Bees or another drugstore brand,</li>
            <li>and this is awesome for me...</li>
            <li>Very good for your skin.</li>
            <li>This would be a good cleanser if you have perfect skin, but it does not treat acne like the salesman told me it would.</li>
            <li>Great product Thank you</li>
            <li>If the seller sent me a replacement that would be great.</li>

            <li>Good product to clean your face.</li>
            <li>For the price paid, I feel,I have received a great value my face feels smoother, and creams are so much better absorbed than before I began using the product.</li>
            <li>Look no damn more.</li>
            <li>I have tried many lotions and hair conditioners to soften but none come close to working as well as this product.</li>
            <li>just ordered two more.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more of a cleanser.  </li>
            <li>but it again but love the product line</li>
            <li>I love it because it&#x27;s not greasy</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Oil of Olay Microdermabrasion works a lot better and you can tell it is working.</li>

            <li>You can feel the clean without it stripping your skin.</li>
            <li>Every product manufactured from the Dead Sea is great and Premier in my opinion ranks on top.</li>
            <li>The product is okay and does not irritate my sensitive skin, but I thought you would be able to feel the exfoliation beads on my face</li>
            <li>My face feels clean after using it.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend buying it here instead of spending about 3 times more at the mall kiosk.</li>
            <li>That is the only thing that feels good.</li>
            <li>Good travel facial cleaner for on the go.</li>

            <li>Have sensitive skin and have looked high and low for the perfect facial cleanser?</li>

            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>This stuff almost melted the makeup away and my skin felt so clean and felt very soft.</li>
            <li>While I like this product very much, I was not quite as impressed as with other Dead Sea Premier products.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Will certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li>jelly soap liquid and not a cleanser,  but the dead sea aromatic diamond body lotion is amazing</li>
            <li>REAL TALK.</li>
            <li>I was very hopeful about this product and really thought it would work, since the guy guaranteed it.  </li>
            <li>With my sonic scrubber this product cleans my face very well.</li>

            <li>Makes skin soft.  </li>
            <li>You see, I have very acne-prone skin and nothing has ever worked, but I thought this would finally be the product.  </li>
            <li>It does make my face soft, but that is not why this product was purchased.  </li>
            <li>I really adore the premeir facial products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of cleansers on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>us sensitive</li>
            <li>If you are a guy with a very tough beard, this stuff is great to soften the whiskers prior to shaving.</li>
            <li>I love the Dead Sea line, but this is a waste of money in my opinion.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Have sensitive skin and have looked high and low for the perfect facial cleanser? Look no damn more. This product smells like heavenly seawater and helps treat acne and leaves your face looking and feeling softer and smoother than a babies bottom. REAL TALK. This is coming from someone who&#x27;s tried every other damn product too which almost always leave me with some degree of noticeable skin irritation and hardly does what its supposed to which is heal and treat my acne.</li>
            <li> Just ok,  not as good as the exfoliating cleanser.</li>
            <li> This product cleans without drying.  Makes skin soft.  You don&#x27;t even feel the micro grains.  While I like this product very much, I was not quite as impressed as with other Dead Sea Premier products.</li>
            <li> Love this, one of the best product for my daily facial wash, will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this facial scrub.  He uses it to also help remove her makeup as well.</li>
            <li> Very nice cleanser. You can feel the clean without it stripping your skin.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way and is very creamy on you face.</li>
            <li> Great product Thank you</li>
            <li> If you are a guy with a very tough beard, this stuff is great to soften the whiskers prior to shaving. I have tried many lotions and hair conditioners to soften but none come close to working as well as this product. My recipe: hot water, this stuff and some shaving cream. It does not take a lot and does not gum-up the razor. No girly smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered two more.</li>
            <li> There are no exfoliating granules in the cleanser.  I was expecting more of a cleanser.  This is very thick and way to creamy.</li>
            <li> This stuff almost melted the makeup away and my skin felt so clean and felt very soft. I would absolutely recommend buying it here instead of spending about 3 times more at the mall kiosk. They have one heck of a scam goin on at the mall so save yourself all the fake sweet talk they sell ya.</li>
            <li> Good product to clean your face.</li>
            <li> was nit a big fan just soap in a tube I use it camping  not a big fan  would not but it again but love the product line</li>
            <li> Exelent,wont stop using it, my face feels clean !!</li>
            <li> I was leery about this product when I first used it.  When I washed my face with it, it didn&#x27;t foam up as I expected.  It remained in it&#x27;s cream form.  After I rinsed it from my face, I immediately felt the difference.  My skin was very smooth and felt clean.  I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this product and related products to care for my face and shaving care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for a few years. I love it because it&#x27;s not greasy but you get a lot from a few drops. Every product manufactured from the Dead Sea is great and Premier in my opinion ranks on top. The only thing is that sometimes it may arrive from the point of origin which is in Hertzelia, Israel so don&#x27;t send it back like I almost did.</li>
            <li> This is so gentle and soft on your face. Very good for your skin. Goes great with the facial serum as well.</li>
            <li> My parents recently bought this product along with a few others because the guy selling it GUARANTEED that it would take care of my acne.

This would be a good cleanser if you have perfect skin, but it does not treat acne like the salesman told me it would.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It smells great, and my face glows after!  I really adore the premeir facial products.  :)</li>
            <li> If you are wanting the micro-beads, this is not what you want. This feels like your putting on lotion then washing it off. That is the only thing that feels good. There seems to be no benefit. Oil of Olay Microdermabrasion works a lot better and you can tell it is working. I love the Dead Sea line, but this is a waste of money in my opinion. Oh, and it smells pretty good. But, thats it.</li>
            <li> Premier Dead Sea Luxury Facial Cleanser with Micro grains is an amazing product!  I can&#x27;t wait to wash my face every day!!!!  Leaves face feeling so soft!</li>
            <li> This is really awesome.  Your face feels so smooth and soft and clean.  You will not want to put anything else on your face after using this cleanser.  Will certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li> Probably this is the only product that I like in the dead sea products. With my sonic scrubber this product cleans my face very well. Not bad at all</li>
            <li> my skin feels really good.  you dont get the bubble effect with this so it takes time to get used to that part but other than that its a real good product.</li>
            <li> This product leaves your face very soft and silky!  I have been using the aromatherapy exfoliating facial scrub with the pink extringent and the problematic face mask instead of proactive like I was using and I love these all natural products that have no chemical side effects. I wanted to also try a hydrating wash and so far its great!</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and have given this facial cleanser a try, very thick and heavy scent. Makes my skin feel soft and clean. Good travel facial cleaner for on the go.</li>
            <li> Wanted to love the product but it came to me in the mail quickly enough but the container had burst in transit.  I only have about half the bottle left.  The product is okay and does not irritate my sensitive skin, but I thought you would be able to feel the exfoliation beads on my face and I definitely could not.  If the seller sent me a replacement that would be great.</li>
            <li> I love the gentle cleansing. The face needs a gentle touch.  It feels luxurious. I evev love the smell. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> thank you it an honour to shop with you. Do add me on instagram: usana9884025</li>
            <li> sorry this wasn&#x27;t for me at all, just felt like jelly soap liquid and not a cleanser,  but the dead sea aromatic diamond body lotion is amazing</li>
            <li> This cleanser seems to keep my acne at bay the best. I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of cleansers on my sensitive skin and I love this one!</li>

            <li> Inexpensive, but nothing impressive. Not bad at all, but it seems best to stick with Burt&#x27;s Bees or another drugstore brand, Oh well.</li>
            <li> it really cleans the skin, my face is brighter after each use, I love the texture and it has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> I JUST STARTED USING IT, IT SEEMS THAT MY SKIN IS PRONE TO GET SOME ERUPCIONS&lt;br /&gt;WITH IT.I WILL SEE.</li>
            <li> Love the product my skin us sensitive and this is awesome for me...</li>
            <li> I really like this product! My face feels clean after using it.I would highly recommend this product to my friends.</li>
