            <li>I was given his beard oil at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>The best beard oil ive used so far!</li>
            <li>Amazing blend, and scent free!</li>
            <li>This was ok as a conditioner, but felt kind of greasy afterwards.</li>
            <li>The dropper also makes for easy application!</li>
            <li>Great stuff, first time taking care of my beard.</li>
            <li>I was very fortunate to purchase this during the company&#x27;s promotion for my unbiased review (in this case, my boyfriend&#x27;s).</li>
            <li>great beard oil - completely scent free!!</li>
            <li>One of my favorite features of this product is the fact that it is made from all organic products.</li>
            <li>Will be getting for sure.</li>
            <li>I like mostly because it&#x27;s unscented</li>
            <li>I would love a scented version of this product as well.</li>
            <li>This helps out a bit with beard grown and thickness, but mostly just helps it shine.  </li>
            <li>so I use way more then they suggest.</li>
            <li>This beard oil is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I also love the ingredients in it that I am wondering if it&#x27;s ok to use it on my hair</li>
            <li>Not at all oily, just healthy.</li>
            <li>My wife has noticed an improvement in the look and shine of my beard and has been stroking it more often so that is another plus in my book.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love this product and would recommend it to anybody .</li>
            <li>Was able to get it at a cheaper price.price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li>I think his beard is so much more softer with him using this oil.</li>
            <li>gonna love that and try it and give an update on that.</li>
            <li>and I love this product ..</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>My husband has been able to use this beard oil which has begun to help.</li>
            <li>Was glad that it was unscented though</li>
            <li>I thank you for the opertunity and the great new friend</li>
            <li>It is great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Great product so far!</li>
            <li>Has made my beard smoother and it really looks good.</li>
            <li>My son loved it thanks</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t drip or run.</li>
            <li>Also really enjoy the fact that it is unscented and is easy to get off in the shower.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>The oil is light and absorbs well.</li>
            <li>It comes in an amber bottle to help protect the contents from light, and the dropper cap helps with dispensing and keeping the bottle free from drips.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff, my beard looks good and feels soft, gf loves how soft it is now.</li>
            <li>We have a winner, in that it isn&#x27;t scented, it does not interfere with good food or tasty adult beverages.</li>
            <li>my husband is constantly primping himself and his beard looks AMAZING after using this stuff!</li>
            <li>States it softened his beard and minimized the dryness, significantly.</li>
            <li>so I cannot comment on how it will help the beard hair over time, but so far, I have been very satisfied.</li>
            <li>It is a good general use beard oil, and I have no complaints.</li>
            <li>The first two applications were to decrease the itching, the remaining applications have been at the request of his lovely girlfriend.  </li>
            <li>I love how I make my beard soft and smooth and more manageable.</li>
            <li>It really leaves your beard smooth and more managable.  </li>
            <li>This oil is done right!</li>
            <li>and he&#x27;s been looking for a good beard oil and trying out different ones.</li>
            <li>That alone is a good sign and a big plus for me</li>
            <li>It really does make it look healthier and better groomed.</li>
            <li>really has helped make my beard softer and my skin more moistened.</li>
            <li>Letting it grow a bit just for fun and enjoy keeping it full.</li>
            <li>but it is so mild</li>
            <li>He said that he will keep on using it and most likely order some more when he runs out.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Barberousse, for the opportunity to try out such an amazing product!</li>
            <li>At first this was the only product I was using for my beard, which is fairly thick/long.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, makes my beard look healthy and slick- not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>A few drops and my beard looks and feels great .. .</li>
            <li>It made his beard look nice and healthy and shiny, instead of dead hair on his face.</li>
            <li>He actually LIKED a present i bought him!</li>
            <li>No crazy smell.</li>
            <li>I use in conjunction with a good quality boars hair brush and beard balm, and that&#x27;s probably the trifecta for somebody looking to maintain a high level of quality in their facial hair.</li>
            <li>He really seems to be enjoying this product and would recommend for a soft, controllable beard!</li>
            <li>The oil goes right on the beard and not in your hand first.</li>
            <li>He really likes this one!</li>
            <li>First time using beard oil</li>
            <li>My beard is so much softer than ever before and it has this shine to it that you just can&#x27;t beat!</li>
            <li>When I first used the product I didn&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li>Would have given higher rating</li>
            <li>but I broke out in a rash the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I have had a chance to use it and my beard is soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>but this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used any that had no scent.</li>
            <li>Larger bottle than most beard oils offered.</li>
            <li>First time beard oil user.</li>
            <li>Even if you are just starting out with manscaping do yourself a favor and buy a good quality oil such as this one.</li>
            <li>Makes it ultra soft and more manageable when I put my wax in to fix the wild hairs.</li>
            <li>As for the product itself, this beard oil was exactly what I needed to help cure the very bothersome beard dandruff that I had been struggling to maintain for years.</li>
            <li>This Beard Oil does not have a strong smell so you can carry-on with your day without having a stench following you.</li>
            <li>I use it on my cuticles and it keeps the nice and moisturized and cuts down on hang nails!</li>
            <li>It does not have a strong scent, and came with a dropper, which most other sellers charge extra for.</li>
            <li>Thanks 😊</li>
            <li>and it is unscented which I highly appreciate!</li>
            <li>Much softer, comb went though much easier, soothing, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a beard for years now, and I really wish I had been using this product all along.</li>
            <li>Recommend this as a great low price beard oil especially if you&#x27;re just starting to use oils.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>After a few minutes it soaks in completely, leaving your beard soft and smelling great.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I got this for my husband and he really likes it.</li>
            <li>very moisturizing no fragrance, no build up.</li>
            <li>A simple and clean feeling Beard Oil - What else can I say?</li>
            <li>plus it is twice as much as you normally get.  </li>
            <li>I tend to have pretty sensitive skin and this stuff hasn&#x27;t given me any problems.</li>
            <li>it has tamed my beard down made it more manageable</li>
            <li>If you have dandruff in your beard, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>So far this has been a very satisfactory beard oil.  </li>
            <li>I was doubtful at first about the fact that they include olive oil in it, but it seems to be the perfect amount to moisturize and hydrate the beard without clogging up skin pores...</li>
            <li>It is a great value and a larger bottle than others I have tired.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my son, when he &amp;#34;thinks&amp;#34; he scratches his beard,  When I saw him &amp;#34;thinking&amp;#34; more frequently, we diagnosed an advancing case of dry skin under all that facial hair.  </li>
            <li>With this product alone I noticed a pretty big difference.</li>
            <li>leaves my beard and skin soft!  </li>
            <li>But, it didn&#x27;t work as near as well as this beard oil!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other oils and have had to use more to get the same results.</li>
            <li>I purchased this oil because of all of the natural oils that make up the product.</li>
            <li>Also with these natural oils my daughter took the liberty of using the product on her itchy hair scalp,it worked for her.</li>
            <li>Keeps my beard soft and eliminates any itch.</li>
            <li>SHE SAID HE&#x27;S KISSABLY SOFT</li>
            <li>Makes my beard really soft.  </li>
            <li>After only 2 weeks my beard is much softer and easier to manage with a brush or comb</li>
            <li>My hubby like it is unscented and it made his beard feel soft.</li>
            <li>Makes your beard feel so soft, and no longer itchy.</li>
            <li>So far I used this beard oil two times since I got it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it in my hair as well to help relax my natural curls.  </li>
            <li>so soft..</li>
            <li>I just take half a dropper&#x27;s full and run it across the langth of my beard and rub it in.</li>
            <li>I love the thickness of the oil and believe me when I say a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Not great for styling but definitely worth having if you want a full beard.  </li>
            <li>Unlike the waxes, which are sometimes hard and must be heated up or scraped in order to use, this product is in liquid form and comes with an easy to use dropper.</li>
            <li>have dry and damaged hair from hair dyeing to much</li>
            <li>I was also concerned with adding anything with any type of scent to my face, so this being unscented was a major selling point for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only a week of use so far so the results will probably gain as time goes on.</li>
            <li>His beard is so soft that I actually like to play with it instead of running away from it</li>
            <li>it keep his beard feeling refreshed and moist and not dry</li>
    </ol>

            <li> great beard oil - completely scent free!!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite features of this product is the fact that it is made from all organic products.</li>
            <li> Will be getting for sure.</li>
            <li> I like mostly because it&#x27;s unscented</li>
            <li> I would love a scented version of this product as well.</li>
            <li> This helps out a bit with beard grown and thickness, but mostly just helps it shine.  </li>
            <li> so I use way more then they suggest.</li>
            <li> This beard oil is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I also love the ingredients in it that I am wondering if it&#x27;s ok to use it on my hair</li>
            <li> Not at all oily, just healthy.</li>
            <li> My wife has noticed an improvement in the look and shine of my beard and has been stroking it more often so that is another plus in my book.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love this product and would recommend it to anybody .</li>
            <li> Was able to get it at a cheaper price.price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li> I think his beard is so much more softer with him using this oil.</li>
            <li> gonna love that and try it and give an update on that.</li>
            <li> and I love this product ..</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> My husband has been able to use this beard oil which has begun to help.</li>
            <li> Was glad that it was unscented though</li>
            <li> I thank you for the opertunity and the great new friend</li>
            <li> It is great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Great product so far!</li>
            <li> Has made my beard smoother and it really looks good.</li>
            <li> My son loved it thanks</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t drip or run.</li>
            <li> Also really enjoy the fact that it is unscented and is easy to get off in the shower.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> The oil is light and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> It comes in an amber bottle to help protect the contents from light, and the dropper cap helps with dispensing and keeping the bottle free from drips.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff, my beard looks good and feels soft, gf loves how soft it is now.</li>
            <li> We have a winner, in that it isn&#x27;t scented, it does not interfere with good food or tasty adult beverages.</li>
            <li> my husband is constantly primping himself and his beard looks AMAZING after using this stuff!</li>
            <li> States it softened his beard and minimized the dryness, significantly.</li>
            <li> so I cannot comment on how it will help the beard hair over time, but so far, I have been very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It is a good general use beard oil, and I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> The first two applications were to decrease the itching, the remaining applications have been at the request of his lovely girlfriend.  </li>
            <li> I love how I make my beard soft and smooth and more manageable.</li>
            <li> It really leaves your beard smooth and more managable.  </li>
            <li> This oil is done right!</li>
            <li> and he&#x27;s been looking for a good beard oil and trying out different ones.</li>
            <li> That alone is a good sign and a big plus for me</li>
            <li> It really does make it look healthier and better groomed.</li>
            <li> really has helped make my beard softer and my skin more moistened.</li>
            <li> Letting it grow a bit just for fun and enjoy keeping it full.</li>
            <li> but it is so mild</li>
            <li> He said that he will keep on using it and most likely order some more when he runs out.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Barberousse, for the opportunity to try out such an amazing product!</li>
            <li> At first this was the only product I was using for my beard, which is fairly thick/long.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, makes my beard look healthy and slick- not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> A few drops and my beard looks and feels great .. .</li>
            <li> It made his beard look nice and healthy and shiny, instead of dead hair on his face.</li>
            <li> He actually LIKED a present i bought him!</li>
            <li> No crazy smell.</li>
            <li> I use in conjunction with a good quality boars hair brush and beard balm, and that&#x27;s probably the trifecta for somebody looking to maintain a high level of quality in their facial hair.</li>
            <li> He really seems to be enjoying this product and would recommend for a soft, controllable beard!</li>
            <li> The oil goes right on the beard and not in your hand first.</li>
            <li> He really likes this one!</li>
            <li> First time using beard oil</li>
            <li> My beard is so much softer than ever before and it has this shine to it that you just can&#x27;t beat!</li>
            <li> When I first used the product I didn&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li> Would have given higher rating</li>
            <li> but I broke out in a rash the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I have had a chance to use it and my beard is soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> but this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used any that had no scent.</li>
            <li> Larger bottle than most beard oils offered.</li>
            <li> First time beard oil user.</li>
            <li> Even if you are just starting out with manscaping do yourself a favor and buy a good quality oil such as this one.</li>
            <li> Makes it ultra soft and more manageable when I put my wax in to fix the wild hairs.</li>
            <li> As for the product itself, this beard oil was exactly what I needed to help cure the very bothersome beard dandruff that I had been struggling to maintain for years.</li>
            <li> This Beard Oil does not have a strong smell so you can carry-on with your day without having a stench following you.</li>
            <li> I use it on my cuticles and it keeps the nice and moisturized and cuts down on hang nails!</li>
            <li> It does not have a strong scent, and came with a dropper, which most other sellers charge extra for.</li>
            <li> Thanks 😊</li>
            <li> and it is unscented which I highly appreciate!</li>
            <li> Much softer, comb went though much easier, soothing, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard for years now, and I really wish I had been using this product all along.</li>
            <li> Recommend this as a great low price beard oil especially if you&#x27;re just starting to use oils.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> After a few minutes it soaks in completely, leaving your beard soft and smelling great.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and he really likes it.</li>
            <li> very moisturizing no fragrance, no build up.</li>
            <li> A simple and clean feeling Beard Oil - What else can I say?</li>
            <li> plus it is twice as much as you normally get.  </li>
            <li> I tend to have pretty sensitive skin and this stuff hasn&#x27;t given me any problems.</li>
            <li> it has tamed my beard down made it more manageable</li>
            <li> If you have dandruff in your beard, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> So far this has been a very satisfactory beard oil.  </li>
            <li> I was doubtful at first about the fact that they include olive oil in it, but it seems to be the perfect amount to moisturize and hydrate the beard without clogging up skin pores...</li>
            <li> It is a great value and a larger bottle than others I have tired.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my son, when he &amp;#34;thinks&amp;#34; he scratches his beard,  When I saw him &amp;#34;thinking&amp;#34; more frequently, we diagnosed an advancing case of dry skin under all that facial hair.  </li>
            <li> With this product alone I noticed a pretty big difference.</li>
            <li> leaves my beard and skin soft!  </li>
            <li> But, it didn&#x27;t work as near as well as this beard oil!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other oils and have had to use more to get the same results.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil because of all of the natural oils that make up the product.</li>
            <li> Also with these natural oils my daughter took the liberty of using the product on her itchy hair scalp,it worked for her.</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard soft and eliminates any itch.</li>
            <li> SHE SAID HE&#x27;S KISSABLY SOFT</li>
            <li> Makes my beard really soft.  </li>
            <li> After only 2 weeks my beard is much softer and easier to manage with a brush or comb</li>
            <li> My hubby like it is unscented and it made his beard feel soft.</li>
            <li> Makes your beard feel so soft, and no longer itchy.</li>
            <li> So far I used this beard oil two times since I got it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it in my hair as well to help relax my natural curls.  </li>
            <li> so soft..</li>
            <li> I just take half a dropper&#x27;s full and run it across the langth of my beard and rub it in.</li>
            <li> I love the thickness of the oil and believe me when I say a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Not great for styling but definitely worth having if you want a full beard.  </li>
            <li> Unlike the waxes, which are sometimes hard and must be heated up or scraped in order to use, this product is in liquid form and comes with an easy to use dropper.</li>
            <li> have dry and damaged hair from hair dyeing to much</li>
            <li> I was also concerned with adding anything with any type of scent to my face, so this being unscented was a major selling point for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only a week of use so far so the results will probably gain as time goes on.</li>
            <li> His beard is so soft that I actually like to play with it instead of running away from it</li>
            <li> it keep his beard feeling refreshed and moist and not dry</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, you really don&#x27;t need to use a lot of the product; a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I happened to stumble upon Barberousse beard oil while on Facebook.</li>
            <li> all organic and keeping it simple with very few ingredients, all of which are easily identifiable.</li>
            <li> A huge bonus for him is the fact that this is all natural, he did not even have a bad reaction to it.</li>
            <li> A little on the heavy side, but better than it being too thin.  </li>
            <li> His beard and mustache feels so soft (he has VERY thick and coarse hair).</li>
            <li> I have used a few different beard waxes before, and none have compared to this product.</li>
            <li> I felt no real difference on my hair</li>
            <li> and then when it is DRY (oil and water don&#x27;t mix) I put a few drops (about eight) in my palm, work my hands together and get it worked through my beard.</li>
            <li> About average beard oil.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since lightened up the amount that I use and only use it a few times a week so no more rash.</li>
            <li> I have really thick, coarse hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week now, and my beard has gotten smoother and less itchy.  </li>
            <li> Less people commenting on the roughness of my beard.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my son because he complained about his beard feeling dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few days now, and I can already tell the difference.</li>
            <li> A few drops is all you need for a heathy looking beard.</li>
            <li> I have never used Beard Oil before and boy was I missing out.</li>
            <li> but after use I noticed my skin didn&#x27;t itch as much as it usually does.</li>
            <li> love it will help for Deer season when the beard is the worst...</li>
            <li> MY SON-IN-LAW LOVES HIS BEARD, AND WAS NOT THRILLED TO SAY THE LEAST ABOUT USING ANYTHING ON IT....</li>
            <li> I have a thick beard</li>
            <li> This is less expensive.</li>
            <li> look forward to using this in the fall/winter when I plan to let my beard grow longer in preparation for those cold hard winter months.</li>
            <li> my hair and mad it</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week now, and my beard has gotten smoother and less itchy.  I prefer to keep my facial hair trimmed short so this product makes a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Got this for my brother and he was thrilled! He actually LIKED a present i bought him!</li>
            <li> I actually use this in my hair.  I quit using regular shampoo and conditioner and this seems to be keeping my hair from drying  out.  I have really thick, coarse hair and it is smoother using this.</li>
            <li> my boyfriend loves it!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend starting growing out his beard earlier this year and he&#x27;s been looking for a good beard oil and trying out different ones. He really likes this one! Think it&#x27;s a keeper. Thanks 😊</li>
            <li> Does what it should. No crazy smell.</li>
            <li> First time using beard oil and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This oil is done right! all organic and keeping it simple with very few ingredients, all of which are easily identifiable. It is great for sensitive skin! and it is unscented which I highly appreciate!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my son because he complained about his beard feeling dry and itchy. He says he&#x27;s quite impressed with the oil. States it softened his beard and minimized the dryness, significantly.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product makes my beard feel and look great.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I love this stuff! Barberousse unscented beard oil is excellent. I have used a few different beard waxes before, and none have compared to this product. Unlike the waxes, which are sometimes hard and must be heated up or scraped in order to use, this product is in liquid form and comes with an easy to use dropper. I have used this for a few days now, and I can already tell the difference. My beard is so much softer than ever before and it has this shine to it that you just can&#x27;t beat! When I saw that I could get this product for a discounted price for my honest opinion in a review, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up! One of my favorite features of this product is the fact that it is made from all organic products. The ingredients are as follows: organic olive oil, organic jojoba oil, and organic argan oil. That&#x27;s it!  Anyone with a beard of any size should give this stuff a try!</li>
            <li> Great oil at a great price. Finally finished the bottle off. Will be getting for sure. I like mostly because it&#x27;s unscented and I can add some bay rum for scent.</li>
            <li> About average beard oil.  Unscented is nice.</li>
            <li> This product is great if you are looking for a thicker and fuller beard. It works like a leave in conditioner, but for your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to using this in the fall/winter when I plan to let my beard grow longer in preparation for those cold hard winter months.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil because of all of the natural oils that make up the product. As stated it is unscented. The cap is a droplet tube,you don&#x27;t need much but the droplet helps although it gets messy at times.When I first used the product I didn&#x27;t like that I felt no real difference on my hair but after use I noticed my skin didn&#x27;t itch as much as it usually does. That alone is a good sign and a big plus for me so I will continue to use the product. The bottle is a good size for 2oz of oil. I have never heard of Barberousse as a company but the experience with this product was good. I would purchase again. Also with these natural oils my daughter took the liberty of using the product on her itchy hair scalp,it worked for her. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  A few drops and my beard looks and feels great .. . plus it is twice as much as you normally get.  The eye dropper to apply the oil is a nice touch too.  The oil goes right on the beard and not in your hand first.</li>
            <li> Great product so far!</li>
            <li> The oil is light and absorbs well. It is unscented as well and these things work great for post shower/pre-bed applications.</li>
            <li> Smells great, I use this as well as does the hubby. There was no tingling, the packaging is great.&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a nominal discount, but the views are mine alone.</li>
            <li> Bought for my son-in-law.  He really seems to be enjoying this product and would recommend for a soft, controllable beard!</li>
            <li> Works as described! Keeps my beard soft and eliminates any itch. It is a great value and a larger bottle than others I have tired. I would love a scented version of this product as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about a week now. At first this was the only product I was using for my beard, which is fairly thick/long.

            <li> My husband is loving this oil. His beard us already looking better!</li>
            <li> Only a week of use so far so the results will probably gain as time goes on. It does leave my beard feeling moisturized and shiny. Less people commenting on the roughness of my beard. It&#x27;s Unscented but my girlfriend says it smells good so that works for me!

            <li> Great stuff, first time taking care of my beard. Letting it grow a bit just for fun and enjoy keeping it full.</li>
            <li> My husband going to love it!  Odorless oil, excellent product</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because his beard is getting out of control. It really does make it look healthier and better groomed.</li>
            <li> MY SON-IN-LAW LOVES HIS BEARD, AND WAS NOT THRILLED TO SAY THE LEAST ABOUT USING ANYTHING ON IT....MY DAUGHTER AND SON-IN-LAW LOVE ME!! SHE SAID HE&#x27;S KISSABLY SOFT NOW!!</li>
            <li> awesome product.  Makes my beard really soft.  Will buy again</li>
            <li> Would have given higher rating but I broke out in a rash the first time I used it. I&#x27;ve since lightened up the amount that I use and only use it a few times a week so no more rash. Has made my beard smoother and it really looks good.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Shipping was fast. I have had a chance to use it and my beard is soft and comfortable. I received this as a test product as I have never used this type of product. I thank you for the opertunity and the great new friend I have now.. BARBEROUSSE  Beard Oil....</li>
            <li> So far this has been a very satisfactory beard oil.  It comes in an amber bottle to help protect the contents from light, and the dropper cap helps with dispensing and keeping the bottle free from drips.  Having an unscented version is very nice.  I have only used for a short time so I cannot comment on how it will help the beard hair over time, but so far, I have been very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a real nice product! I was doubtful at first about the fact that they include olive oil in it, but it seems to be the perfect amount to moisturize and hydrate the beard without clogging up skin pores... I recommend and would get again!!</li>
            <li> leaves my beard and skin soft!  Great value!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several brands of beard oil but this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used any that had no scent. It works great and keeps my beard looking great and keeps my skin feeling great. Definitely recommended and buy some pine tar soap while you&#x27;re at it. The combination of beard oil and pine tar soap will have your face and beard thanking you.</li>
            <li> This helps out a bit with beard grown and thickness, but mostly just helps it shine.  Not great for styling but definitely worth having if you want a full beard.  A lot of oils are scented and I am happy that this one has zero smell</li>
            <li> This stuff works.. moisturizes the bread and skin... nuf said</li>
            <li> After only 2 weeks my beard is much softer and easier to manage with a brush or comb</li>
            <li> My hubby like it is unscented and it made his beard feel soft.</li>
            <li> Larger bottle than most beard oils offered.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my cousin to try (I am a woman, thankfully I don&#x27;t have a beard) HE LOVED IT!!! It made his beard look nice and healthy and shiny, instead of dead hair on his face.</li>
            <li> So impressed, i got another bottle. It does have a sent but it is so mild you won&#x27;t even notice it. I have a thick beard so I use way more then they suggest. I just take half a dropper&#x27;s full and run it across the langth of my beard and rub it in. Makes it ultra soft and more manageable when I put my wax in to fix the wild hairs.</li>
            <li> This beard oil is fantastic! A couple of drops rubbed on the beard THEN brushed in really has helped make my beard softer and my skin more moistened. There is no scent -- my wife likes that!</li>
            <li> The best beard oil ive used so far! Amazing blend, and scent free! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> love it will help for Deer season when the beard is the worst...</li>
            <li> Great product! My husband has been using this for a week now. His beard seems a lot softer. He said that he will keep on using it and most likely order some more when he runs out. I also love the ingredients in it that I am wondering if it&#x27;s ok to use it on my hair coz I keep getting split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**this was sent to me at a discounted price in exchange of my honest opinion. Hubby and I liked it, so it deserves a 5 star.</li>
            <li> My fiancé loves this beard oil. It tames his beard without any overpowering scent. A few drops is all you need for a heathy looking beard.</li>
            <li> It is a good general use beard oil, and I have no complaints. It does not have a strong scent, and came with a dropper, which most other sellers charge extra for.</li>
            <li> My son loved it thanks</li>
            <li> Every morning when i shower I either wash my beard or just give it a rinse and then when it is DRY (oil and water don&#x27;t mix) I put a few drops (about eight) in my palm, work my hands together and get it worked through my beard. There are some You Tube videos showing how to do this properly. This restores the oil in your beard. After a few minutes it soaks in completely, leaving your beard soft and smelling great. Not at all oily, just healthy. My wife has noticed an improvement in the look and shine of my beard and has been stroking it more often so that is another plus in my book. Great product! Love it!!</li>
            <li> Makes your beard feel so soft, and no longer itchy.</li>
            <li> First time beard oil user. And I have to tell you I love it it has tamed my beard down made it more manageable I love this product and would recommend it to anybody .</li>
            <li> My  husband loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> Great beard oil! It&#x27;s unscented so you can wear it with a scented balm or cologne without overpowering your friends and family. The dropper also makes for easy application! Make your skin happy!</li>
            <li> Got this for my son who loves it!! Was able to get it at a cheaper price.price won&#x27;t matter he loves it!!</li>
            <li> Great product! I use it on my cuticles and it keeps the nice and moisturized and cuts down on hang nails! Love it!</li>
            <li> My beard is soften then ever! I tend to have pretty sensitive skin and this stuff hasn&#x27;t given me any problems. Also really enjoy the fact that it is unscented and is easy to get off in the shower. A+ product!</li>
            <li> My husband is in LOVE with this stuff! i got it at a great discount! my husband is constantly primping himself and his beard looks AMAZING after using this stuff!</li>
            <li> Not as good as advertised, still trying!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my bf for his facial hair and thank goodness I did. His beard and mustache feels so soft (he has VERY thick and coarse hair). A huge bonus for him is the fact that this is all natural, he did not even have a bad reaction to it. His beard is so soft that I actually like to play with it instead of running away from it lol. I was very fortunate to purchase this during the company&#x27;s promotion for my unbiased review (in this case, my boyfriend&#x27;s). Keep in mind, you really don&#x27;t need to use a lot of the product; a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A simple and clean feeling Beard Oil - What else can I say? It is a great product and it promotes beard health and growth!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It soothes the skin and softens the beard. It is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t drip or run.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my son, when he &amp;#34;thinks&amp;#34; he scratches his beard,  When I saw him &amp;#34;thinking&amp;#34; more frequently, we diagnosed an advancing case of dry skin under all that facial hair.  The first two applications were to decrease the itching, the remaining applications have been at the request of his lovely girlfriend.  We have a winner, in that it isn&#x27;t scented, it does not interfere with good food or tasty adult beverages.</li>
            <li> This is good beard oil, it does the job, makes my beard look healthy and shiney, and keeps my skin nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Got this for my boyfriend and he loves it! Awesome product and we will buy again!</li>
            <li> Good Product, I have a softer beard</li>
            <li> So far I used this beard oil two times since I got it and already it has made my beard a lot softer and it has a shine to it. I would recommend this if you have a beard.</li>
            <li> My lady couldn&#x27;t keep her hands off my beard.  It&#x27;s never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  A little on the heavy side, but better than it being too thin.  I&#x27;ve used it in my hair as well to help relax my natural curls.  Will definitely look into it again!</li>
            <li> great quality product!</li>
            <li> My husband has a very coarse beard, and when he applied the oil, it made it easier to brush through as well as a bit smoother. He only tried it once, so I think over time it will make his beard softer. Only time will tell....</li>
            <li> Love it!! As good or better than others I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> this is an amazing product and we use it often</li>
            <li> Good stuff, my beard looks good and feels soft, gf loves how soft it is now.</li>
            <li> I have never used Beard Oil before and boy was I missing out. I love how I make my beard soft and smooth and more manageable. This Beard Oil does not have a strong smell so you can carry-on with your day without having a stench following you. I was given his beard oil at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I love the thickness of the oil and believe me when I say a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> great beard oil - completely scent free!!</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and he really likes it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, makes my beard look healthy and slick- not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> it keep his beard feeling refreshed and moist and not dry like it looks it actaully looked oily thank you</li>
            <li> Bought this for hubby beard. He uses it about once a day. He thinks it has made a difference ans I think his beard is so much more softer with him using this oil. I had read reviews of ladies using in on split ends. So I have been doing that. I honestly love how it makes my hair feel!!</li>
            <li> Moisturized beards and facial hair.</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely great product.  It really leaves your beard smooth and more managable.  Now it is not so prickly to kiss him.</li>
            <li> I like this item. When I got it I didn&#x27;t realize that it works for womens hair also. So I am deff. gonna love that and try it and give an update on that. please try it..UPDATE it works n my hair and mad it so soft.. have dry and damaged hair from hair dyeing to much and I love this product ..I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I happened to stumble upon Barberousse beard oil while on Facebook. I got a code so that I could get the beard oil for $2.00. With Amazon Prime, I was able to get free two day shipping, which was a very awesome deal. As for the product itself, this beard oil was exactly what I needed to help cure the very bothersome beard dandruff that I had been struggling to maintain for years. I had tried using the same dandruff shampoo that I used on my head, on my beard. But, it didn&#x27;t work as near as well as this beard oil! The beard oil has eliminated the vast majority of (if not all) of the beard dandruff I had. If you have dandruff in your beard, I highly recommend it. Thanks, Barberousse, for the opportunity to try out such an amazing product!</li>
            <li> My husband has been able to use this beard oil which has begun to help. He recently started using it but can already feel a difference. It does not leave your beard looking oily. Great product!</li>
            <li> This was ok as a conditioner, but felt kind of greasy afterwards. Was glad that it was unscented though, that was a big plus.</li>
            <li> This beard oil is wonderful, it is a great value. I&#x27;ve tried other oils and have had to use more to get the same results. This is less expensive. I get two ounces for the price I paid for one, and getting a better result!</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing! very moisturizing no fragrance, no build up. I would definitely recommend this for people with dry/itchy skin.</li>
