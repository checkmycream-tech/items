            <li>Just what I was looking for - nice product</li>
            <li>powder puffs are nice</li>
            <li>Nice item.</li>
            <li>they are really nice</li>
            <li>My mother bought a check glass container with lid (like a candy dish) from the dollar store, dumped powder in it, and used these puffs to make her own.</li>
            <li>Really​ nice.</li>
            <li>NICE PUFFS AND CAME</li>
            <li>I liked that there are three</li>
            <li>Not only was it a great price but the puffs are extremely soft, the size is perfect &amp; they feel wonderful when applying powder to my body.</li>
            <li>Soft, clean, perfect size, great price.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a good size and it was great getting three in a package at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>They are soft and plush and perfect for the Felce Azzurra powder that I purchased.</li>
            <li>It was nice to get more than one, so I have a back-up.  </li>
            <li>they are about the size of your palm, soft, and perfect for using with a dusting powder for your body.</li>
            <li>Great price and fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I find the size very comfortable to handle as a powder puff and having three of them means that I can have one washed and drying while another takes its place in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>The delivery was quick and the quality is good.</li>
            <li>so soft and pleasant!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love powder puffs.  </li>
            <li>I love the quality and softness.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>So glad they come 3 to a pack</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find them anywhere that is of this size and quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure... just don&#x27;t rub like you would with your tan powder.</li>
            <li>The are a thing of the past.&lt;br /&gt;However, my girls (3) and I love to put some baby powder in a little&lt;br /&gt;container and puff the powder on after</li>
            <li>Beautiful....Very pleased with the quality.  </li>
            <li>Better for body powder.</li>
            <li>Love them.  </li>
            <li>I like these puffs because they hold up better than the ones that come with the dusting powder.  </li>
            <li>They top layer is getting ripped off with usage.</li>
            <li>My wife love them, what more should I say?</li>
            <li>Im sure I can put it to usr</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I was glad I found them here.</li>
            <li>These are very nice quality and large size also.  </li>
            <li>They are perfect and super soft.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what I needed and I was delighted to find them.  </li>
            <li>the price was great also fits inside of a standard powder box nice.</li>
            <li>Pack of 3 makes it easy to have a replacement close at hand.</li>
            <li>Nice product and very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>However, the puffs are nice, and I do like them pretty well.</li>
            <li>The order was fine, no problems.</li>
            <li>quality is fine.</li>
            <li>Super soft, great coverage.</li>
            <li>Nice and large as described.  </li>
            <li>I love a good powder puff, and they are surprising hard to find.  </li>
            <li>Great to use with regular body powder</li>
            <li>And the three fit snugly in the bag</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t as fluffy as you might want, but for my purposes they are perfect in both size and ease of use.</li>
            <li>The puffs are really soft and pick up a good amount of powder without spilling.  </li>
            <li>Love them, just the right size.  </li>
            <li>So when I looked on Amazon and found them I was excited.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and nice size.</li>
            <li>LOVED&#x27;EM JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR AT A REASONABLE PRICE, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li>But good product all the same.</li>
            <li>My Friend that I ordered these for was estatic with them and guess what she wants more of them imagine that so it looks like I will be placing another order</li>
            <li>I have had some good body puffs, but none like these white ones.</li>
            <li>These were as expected; the shipment came pretty quickly -- good buy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather pay more money and purchase a container of talc that comes with a puff included and possibly get a better product.</li>
            <li>Not only do these have a good silk handle lace, they are just the right size.</li>
            <li>It is pretty huge and can be used as a body powder puff, too.</li>
            <li>There is a very old fashion feel to using powder puffs, and I enjoying using them.</li>
            <li>Definitely will reorder from Walter Drake when I need more!</li>
            <li>This was exactly what we wanted, we will buy again!</li>
            <li>Good quality powder puffs to apply loose powder to set your make up.</li>
            <li>Arrived in a very timely fashion and work just fine.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for powder puffs in stores for a while to replace my old one, but hadn&#x27;t been able to find them so Amazon to the rescue.</li>
            <li>So they are in South Carolina, North&lt;br /&gt;Carolina and Oregon making the ladies there smile and say Ahhhhh.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find them in the stores and my old one needed to be changed.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m satisfied with these puffs.</li>
            <li>Just the kind of big puffs  2 of my friends</li>
            <li>Especially like being able to clean them in the washer.</li>
            <li>They were just the right size,  I would recommend them.  </li>
            <li>They were better than expected, so soft, I use it with baby powder and the powder spreads to nice and even, would recomend to anyone,</li>
            <li>a shower.&lt;br /&gt;The powder keeps you dry and smelling nice all day.</li>
            <li>So far, they&#x27;ve worked very well and are of better quality than the ones that came with the containers.  </li>
            <li>they are a nice, big size and they really help to control powder from flying all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product shipped very fast, as well.</li>
            <li>Its nice and soft but the string on top of it is not good as it comes out so easy.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am still on my first powder puff.  </li>
            <li>I was able to sew it back</li>
            <li>I was very happy to find these Powder puffs online because I have been unable to find them in any stores.</li>
            <li>These are the exact powder puff I was seeking.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely purchase more of these.</li>
            <li>I was expecting some cheap fall apart puffs, but was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I should have looked on Amazon in the first place.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Needed some Large Body Powder Puffs to apply Baby Powder after showering and these were exactly the right size and what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>While puffs are getting harder to find these days, I&#x27;m happy to have these, but I wish they weren&#x27;t SOOOO tiny.</li>
            <li>a slight bit smaller than I thought, but are soft and work perfectly.</li>
            <li>Soft and are super for my after bath powder.</li>
            <li>You cannot easily find them locally.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without my powderpuff!!</li>
            <li>I really like the puffs.  </li>
            <li>These are very well made and work well.</li>
            <li>Thanks for getting this size.</li>
            <li>Price reasonable.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like these puffs.</li>
            <li>Very timely in receiving very soft and just the right size for an older powder holder.  </li>
            <li>They are very soft and the material holds the powder pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Been looking for decent powder puffs for ages.</li>
            <li>The powder puffs are nice and fluffy and soft.  </li>
            <li>This is super big</li>
            <li>Its more for body and such big areas.</li>
            <li>Very hard to find these, they are a good size.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend just getting this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these</li>
            <li>I liked these Powder Puffs as they are hard to find without having to buy powder.</li>
            <li>I am sure they will last a long time.</li>
            <li>I bought a vintage round powder box and emptied a container of powder into it and put a puff on top.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These powder puffs are so thick and luxurious, The handle is nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li>They are actually bigger than expected, but that is fine with me!</li>
            <li>Received the puffs a day before the &#x27;expected&#x27; date from our friendly UPS guy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been looking for new ones for awhile now</li>
            <li>These are very soft and keep the powder from going everywhere</li>
            <li>Arrived very early.  </li>
            <li>outside is soft and just the right size.</li>
            <li>Only quam was, the first one I used, the strap in back to hold it broke the first day.</li>
            <li>The ribbon seems to be sewn in pretty solid.</li>
            <li>I think they are plenty large enough to use with body powder.  </li>
            <li>The size is large enough I can squeeze the powder on and it holds, then I tap it on my body.</li>
            <li>However, I suppose I just couldn&#x27;t clearly see the picture of the item, as the texture of the puff wasn&#x27;t what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I like the soft ones but not &amp;#34;shaggy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>They are think and soft and a 3 pack means I won&#x27;t have to look for these again for a while.</li>
            <li>These are like the old-fashioned, soft body powder puffs that used to come in a box of powder.</li>
            <li>They are soft.</li>
            <li>They fit right into the standard round dusting powder containers and are absorbent enough to hold sufficient powder for placement on any part of the body.  </li>
            <li>Just the right size, not to fluffy taking on too much powder as some will.  </li>
            <li>Thick and plush enough, but the holding ribbon on two of the three broke free from the puff on the first use.</li>
            <li>One of the ribbon band came loose on one side the first time I used it</li>
            <li>The first &#x27;puffing&#x27; will loose some powder but after that, the powder seems to stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fluffy and super soft.</li>
            <li>Super fluffy.</li>
            <li>I have been having trouble finding big puffs for my body powder, these work fine but wish they were a bit bigger in diameter.</li>
            <li>I generally pour powder on them from the container and don&#x27;t use them in a dip box.  </li>
            <li>These are not much bigger than a facial puff and not very fluffy either.</li>
            <li>The little strap on the back of it help me while I put on the power.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much.</li>

            <li> Soft, clean, perfect size, great price.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a good size and it was great getting three in a package at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> They are soft and plush and perfect for the Felce Azzurra powder that I purchased.</li>
            <li> It was nice to get more than one, so I have a back-up.  </li>
            <li> they are about the size of your palm, soft, and perfect for using with a dusting powder for your body.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I find the size very comfortable to handle as a powder puff and having three of them means that I can have one washed and drying while another takes its place in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> The delivery was quick and the quality is good.</li>
            <li> so soft and pleasant!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love powder puffs.  </li>
            <li> I love the quality and softness.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> So glad they come 3 to a pack</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find them anywhere that is of this size and quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure... just don&#x27;t rub like you would with your tan powder.</li>
            <li> The are a thing of the past.&lt;br /&gt;However, my girls (3) and I love to put some baby powder in a little&lt;br /&gt;container and puff the powder on after</li>
            <li> Beautiful....Very pleased with the quality.  </li>
            <li> Better for body powder.</li>
            <li> Love them.  </li>
            <li> I like these puffs because they hold up better than the ones that come with the dusting powder.  </li>
            <li> They top layer is getting ripped off with usage.</li>
            <li> My wife love them, what more should I say?</li>
            <li> Im sure I can put it to usr</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> I was glad I found them here.</li>
            <li> These are very nice quality and large size also.  </li>
            <li> They are perfect and super soft.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what I needed and I was delighted to find them.  </li>
            <li> the price was great also fits inside of a standard powder box nice.</li>
            <li> Pack of 3 makes it easy to have a replacement close at hand.</li>
            <li> Nice product and very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> However, the puffs are nice, and I do like them pretty well.</li>
            <li> The order was fine, no problems.</li>
            <li> quality is fine.</li>
            <li> Super soft, great coverage.</li>
            <li> Nice and large as described.  </li>
            <li> I love a good powder puff, and they are surprising hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Great to use with regular body powder</li>
            <li> And the three fit snugly in the bag</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t as fluffy as you might want, but for my purposes they are perfect in both size and ease of use.</li>
            <li> The puffs are really soft and pick up a good amount of powder without spilling.  </li>
            <li> Love them, just the right size.  </li>
            <li> So when I looked on Amazon and found them I was excited.  </li>
            <li> Very soft and nice size.</li>
            <li> LOVED&#x27;EM JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR AT A REASONABLE PRICE, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> But good product all the same.</li>
            <li> My Friend that I ordered these for was estatic with them and guess what she wants more of them imagine that so it looks like I will be placing another order</li>
            <li> I have had some good body puffs, but none like these white ones.</li>
            <li> These were as expected; the shipment came pretty quickly -- good buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather pay more money and purchase a container of talc that comes with a puff included and possibly get a better product.</li>
            <li> Not only do these have a good silk handle lace, they are just the right size.</li>
            <li> It is pretty huge and can be used as a body powder puff, too.</li>
            <li> There is a very old fashion feel to using powder puffs, and I enjoying using them.</li>
            <li> Definitely will reorder from Walter Drake when I need more!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what we wanted, we will buy again!</li>
            <li> Good quality powder puffs to apply loose powder to set your make up.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a very timely fashion and work just fine.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for powder puffs in stores for a while to replace my old one, but hadn&#x27;t been able to find them so Amazon to the rescue.</li>
            <li> So they are in South Carolina, North&lt;br /&gt;Carolina and Oregon making the ladies there smile and say Ahhhhh.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find them in the stores and my old one needed to be changed.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m satisfied with these puffs.</li>
            <li> Just the kind of big puffs  2 of my friends</li>
            <li> Especially like being able to clean them in the washer.</li>
            <li> They were just the right size,  I would recommend them.  </li>
            <li> They were better than expected, so soft, I use it with baby powder and the powder spreads to nice and even, would recomend to anyone,</li>
            <li> a shower.&lt;br /&gt;The powder keeps you dry and smelling nice all day.</li>
            <li> So far, they&#x27;ve worked very well and are of better quality than the ones that came with the containers.  </li>
            <li> they are a nice, big size and they really help to control powder from flying all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product shipped very fast, as well.</li>
            <li> Its nice and soft but the string on top of it is not good as it comes out so easy.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am still on my first powder puff.  </li>
            <li> I was able to sew it back</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find these Powder puffs online because I have been unable to find them in any stores.</li>
            <li> These are the exact powder puff I was seeking.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase more of these.</li>
            <li> I was expecting some cheap fall apart puffs, but was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I should have looked on Amazon in the first place.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Needed some Large Body Powder Puffs to apply Baby Powder after showering and these were exactly the right size and what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> While puffs are getting harder to find these days, I&#x27;m happy to have these, but I wish they weren&#x27;t SOOOO tiny.</li>
            <li> a slight bit smaller than I thought, but are soft and work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Soft and are super for my after bath powder.</li>
            <li> You cannot easily find them locally.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without my powderpuff!!</li>
            <li> I really like the puffs.  </li>
            <li> These are very well made and work well.</li>
            <li> Thanks for getting this size.</li>
            <li> Price reasonable.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like these puffs.</li>
            <li> Very timely in receiving very soft and just the right size for an older powder holder.  </li>
            <li> They are very soft and the material holds the powder pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Been looking for decent powder puffs for ages.</li>
            <li> The powder puffs are nice and fluffy and soft.  </li>
            <li> This is super big</li>
            <li> Its more for body and such big areas.</li>
            <li> Very hard to find these, they are a good size.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend just getting this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these</li>
            <li> I liked these Powder Puffs as they are hard to find without having to buy powder.</li>
            <li> I am sure they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought a vintage round powder box and emptied a container of powder into it and put a puff on top.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These powder puffs are so thick and luxurious, The handle is nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li> They are actually bigger than expected, but that is fine with me!</li>
            <li> Received the puffs a day before the &#x27;expected&#x27; date from our friendly UPS guy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been looking for new ones for awhile now</li>
            <li> These are very soft and keep the powder from going everywhere</li>
            <li> Arrived very early.  </li>
            <li> outside is soft and just the right size.</li>
            <li> Only quam was, the first one I used, the strap in back to hold it broke the first day.</li>
            <li> The ribbon seems to be sewn in pretty solid.</li>
            <li> I think they are plenty large enough to use with body powder.  </li>
            <li> The size is large enough I can squeeze the powder on and it holds, then I tap it on my body.</li>
            <li> However, I suppose I just couldn&#x27;t clearly see the picture of the item, as the texture of the puff wasn&#x27;t what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I like the soft ones but not &amp;#34;shaggy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> They are think and soft and a 3 pack means I won&#x27;t have to look for these again for a while.</li>
            <li> These are like the old-fashioned, soft body powder puffs that used to come in a box of powder.</li>
            <li> They are soft.</li>
            <li> They fit right into the standard round dusting powder containers and are absorbent enough to hold sufficient powder for placement on any part of the body.  </li>
            <li> Just the right size, not to fluffy taking on too much powder as some will.  </li>
            <li> Thick and plush enough, but the holding ribbon on two of the three broke free from the puff on the first use.</li>
            <li> One of the ribbon band came loose on one side the first time I used it</li>
            <li> The first &#x27;puffing&#x27; will loose some powder but after that, the powder seems to stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fluffy and super soft.</li>
            <li> Super fluffy.</li>
            <li> I have been having trouble finding big puffs for my body powder, these work fine but wish they were a bit bigger in diameter.</li>
            <li> I generally pour powder on them from the container and don&#x27;t use them in a dip box.  </li>
            <li> These are not much bigger than a facial puff and not very fluffy either.</li>
            <li> The little strap on the back of it help me while I put on the power.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> These are really too small for applying body powder.</li>
            <li> Well put together should last a long while</li>
            <li> I was very surprised how fluffy they were.</li>
            <li> LARGE powder puffs for body talc are HARD to find.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to find these.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft, but are firm on the inside.  </li>
            <li> It was much bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected but a bit smaller.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use them, but will hunt down a larger size, next time.</li>
            <li> These are big enough for bath powder but small enough for face powder.  </li>
            <li> I finally broke down and bought these from Amazon, and I&#x27;m so</li>
            <li> Large powder puffs are very hard to find.</li>
            <li> I bought these hard-to-find body powder puffs because I was looking for something to apply powder that didn&#x27;t cause such a mess.  </li>
            <li> Paying $8 - 20 for powder just to get a new puff was getting old and expensive.</li>
            <li> wish they were a little bigger</li>
            <li> They were a little smaller than I had pictured, but I still kept them and will use them.</li>
            <li> Not as I expected.  </li>
            <li> Real fluffy and soft.</li>
            <li> these puffs are quite big if you are looking for something small..  </li>
            <li> I could not believe how hard these things are to find locally!</li>
            <li> Like the little ribbon across to use as a handle.</li>
            <li> My powder puffs remind me of being a little girl and being all powdered up by my grandma...</li>
            <li> It is neither too big to control or too thin to absorb any powder.  </li>
            <li> because finding a puff these days is not easy.</li>
            <li> Hard to write a review on powder puffs without sounding a bit odd.  </li>
            <li> The ribbon came off one side of the powder puff, and the puff itself is falling apart one little piece at a time!</li>
            <li> She said the puffs hold the powder and applies it so well that none is wasted!</li>
            <li> I was not really sure how I would feel about these, but I got them anyways.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find containers of dusting powder today, but if you do, they&#x27;re really small.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how hard it would be to find Bath Powder Puffs.  </li>
            <li> A hard to find item that my wife loves.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but the product is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> They were very hard to find.</li>
            <li> very difficult to use without&lt;br /&gt;the Powder Puff.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> These were all that I hoped they would be.  Soft, clean, perfect size, great price.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my Mother. She loves them! She said the puffs hold the powder and applies it so well that none is wasted!</li>
            <li> Not as I expected.  Too &amp;#34;hairy&amp;#34;.  I like the soft ones but not &amp;#34;shaggy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I liked these Powder Puffs as they are hard to find without having to buy powder.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love powder puffs.  These are very soft and keep the powder from going everywhere but where it belongs.  The larger size is a bonus!</li>
            <li> I was very surprised how fluffy they were. Their just great! The little strap on the back of it help me while I put on the power.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I am still on my first powder puff.  I love the quality and softness. It is neither too big to control or too thin to absorb any powder.  I felt the price was very appropriate.  There is a very old fashion feel to using powder puffs, and I enjoying using them.</li>
            <li> I really like the puffs.  They were just the right size,  I would recommend them.  Large powder puffs are very hard to find.</li>
            <li> Just the right size, not to fluffy taking on too much powder as some will.  Would buy again and definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I almost canceled this purchase because I thought they were not going to be very good quality considering they were so cheap, but I am so glad I didn&#x27;t. They are perfect and super soft. I will definitely purchase them again when I run out which will probably be a while!</li>
            <li> Love them. Soft and are super for my after bath powder. So glad they come 3 to a pack so I can wash 1 and use the next.</li>
            <li> These are nice puffs. While puffs are getting harder to find these days, I&#x27;m happy to have these, but I wish they weren&#x27;t SOOOO tiny. They are like child size.</li>
            <li> These puffs are a perfect size.  I have not been able to find them anywhere that is of this size and quality.</li>
            <li> Hard to write a review on powder puffs without sounding a bit odd.  They hold the powder well &amp; they put the powder where it&#x27;s suppose to go.</li>
            <li> I wanted this as a powder-foundation puff.. but these are body-sized. I decided to use these for my body-tan powder and the ribbon on the back broke after one use. I was able to sew it back but I&#x27;m not having a lot of luck with this item. Great to use with regular body powder I&#x27;m sure... just don&#x27;t rub like you would with your tan powder.</li>
            <li> These are really too small for applying body powder. I&#x27;ll use them, but will hunt down a larger size, next time.</li>
            <li> These puffs seem to be well made. They&#x27;re a good size and it was great getting three in a package at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Powder Puffs are a must instead of using your hand to apply what ever powder that you use use these. Hands are for applying lotion Powder Puffs are for applying powder.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find these Powder puffs online because I have been unable to find them in any stores. They are the perfect sizes and the quality of the workmanship  is perfect. I will definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li> These are the exact powder puff I was seeking.  They&#x27;re the size and softness described.  As for pricing, these puffs seem to me to be identical to those sold on Vermont Country Store priced at 3 for $10 (approx).  Definitely will reorder from Walter Drake when I need more!</li>
            <li> a slight bit smaller than I thought, but are soft and work perfectly. Well put together should last a long while</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with with the powder puffs I purchased. Not only was it a great price but the puffs are extremely soft, the size is perfect &amp; they feel wonderful when applying powder to my body. If anyone is looking for this type of product,  you can&#x27;t lose by making this purchase. A very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> So happy I found these.  Paying $8 - 20 for powder just to get a new puff was getting old and expensive.</li>
            <li> They are think and soft and a 3 pack means I won&#x27;t have to look for these again for a while. I have been looking for powder puffs in stores for a while to replace my old one, but hadn&#x27;t been able to find them so Amazon to the rescue.</li>
            <li> Been looking for decent powder puffs for ages. These are very well made and work well. They pick up the powder, retain it, and then deposit it nice and evenly. Highly recommend just getting this.</li>
            <li> I have been having trouble finding big puffs for my body powder, these work fine but wish they were a bit bigger in diameter. One of the ribbon band came loose on one side the first time I used it but I can still use it and it does the job.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find these Powder Puffs.  The are a thing of the past.&lt;br /&gt;However, my girls (3) and I love to put some baby powder in a little&lt;br /&gt;container and puff the powder on after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;The powder keeps you dry and smelling nice all day. very difficult to use without&lt;br /&gt;the Powder Puff.&lt;br /&gt;It was so nice to find them. So they are in South Carolina, North&lt;br /&gt;Carolina and Oregon making the ladies there smile and say Ahhhhh.&lt;br /&gt;There were three in the package, so I shared.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy and so are my girls.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks You!!!</li>
            <li> These powder puffs are just the right size and the material is perfect. I haven&#x27;t been able to find them in the stores and my old one needed to be changed. Great for  dusting body powder after showering.</li>
            <li> perfect for powder, etc</li>
            <li> Beautiful....Very pleased with the quality.  I would definitely purchase more of these.</li>
            <li> Just the size that I needed to use for my powder. Thanks for getting this size.</li>
            <li> My wife loves them, couldn&#x27;t find these in any store but Amazon had them</li>
            <li> These are big enough for bath powder but small enough for face powder.  Very nice quality, too.</li>
            <li> Nice product and very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Love these!! I have been looking for new ones for awhile now and they are perfect! Great price and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Great for your purse!</li>
            <li> But good product all the same. Just thought it was for face powder, but it&#x27;s too big for that. Better for body powder.</li>
            <li> I was not really sure how I would feel about these, but I got them anyways. I am very glad I did because finding a puff these days is not easy. I was expecting some cheap fall apart puffs, but was pleasantly surprised. They are not very big around, but they are thicker than I thought they would be. I have been using one of the puffs for about a month now and it is holding up well.</li>
            <li> Received these almost immediately and absolutely love them!</li>
            <li> These are very nice quality and large size also.  Price reasonable. I will buy these again.</li>
            <li> Love them.  And u can no longer find powder puffs anywhere.  So when I looked on Amazon and found them I was excited.  The are great.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as described.  There was a set of three powder puffs, and they are great quality.&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent addition to my antique powder jar!!!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for - nice product</li>
            <li> The ribbon came off one side of the powder puff, and the puff itself is falling apart one little piece at a time!</li>
            <li> does the trick, would recommend</li>
            <li> Took a long time to find these. They were just what I was looking for. Seem to be well made. I am sure they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a very timely fashion and work just fine. Haven&#x27;t washed them yet so I don&#x27;t know how successful that will be.</li>
            <li> These are very nice puffs.  They feel like a sponge is inside.&lt;br /&gt;The outside is soft and just the right size.</li>
            <li> powder puffs are nice</li>
            <li> Great price, great product. Especially like being able to clean them in the washer.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and feels good on skin the price was great also fits inside of a standard powder box nice.</li>
            <li> Nice item. Exactly as described. Like the little ribbon across to use as a handle.</li>
            <li> wish they were a little bigger</li>
            <li> these puffs are quite big if you are looking for something small..  they are really nice</li>
            <li> Just as advertised....large,soft and puffy! I will order again...</li>
            <li> I like these puffs because they hold up better than the ones that come with the dusting powder.  They&#x27;re soft, but are firm on the inside.  They can go through the washer and dryer, too. They really last.</li>
            <li> I really like these puffs. They are soft and plush and perfect for the Felce Azzurra powder that I purchased.</li>
            <li> They were better than expected, so soft, I use it with baby powder and the powder spreads to nice and even, would recomend to anyone,</li>
            <li> Good quality powder puffs to apply loose powder to set your make up. It is pretty huge and can be used as a body powder puff, too.</li>
            <li> The order was fine, no problems.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how hard it would be to find Bath Powder Puffs.  I should have looked on Amazon in the first place.  None of my local stores had them and I needed them for the medical body powder my doctor prescribed.  They are exactly what I needed and I was delighted to find them.  It was nice to get more than one, so I have a back-up.  I wanted something simple and functional.  I had no need for anything g fancy and frilly.</li>
            <li> They top layer is getting ripped off with usage.</li>
            <li> Arrived very early.  The powder puffs are nice and fluffy and soft.  And the three fit snugly in the bag, so just shake the individual puff you want and it is perfect.  They are actually bigger than expected, but that is fine with me!</li>
            <li> I have yet to use this product. It was much bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> My wife love them, what more should I say?</li>
            <li> Very Satisfied Customer!</li>
            <li> Very hard to find these, they are a good size. Haven&#x27;t tried to wash them yet but they seem well made.</li>
            <li> I bought a set of these for my mother - she loved them. It&#x27;s so hard to find containers of dusting powder today, but if you do, they&#x27;re really small. My mother bought a check glass container with lid (like a candy dish) from the dollar store, dumped powder in it, and used these puffs to make her own. I wish someone would bring back dusting powder.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for use with body powder.  Fluffy and super soft. Really​ nice.</li>
            <li> My Friend that I ordered these for was estatic with them and guess what she wants more of them imagine that so it looks like I will be placing another order Thank you</li>
            <li> Love my puffs, good size, good price very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love a good powder puff, and they are surprising hard to find.  These are perfect!  I feel like I should stock up to have enough for the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find these generous sized powder puffs. You cannot easily find them locally. The delivery was quick and the quality is good.</li>
            <li> Wonderful Puffs! Real fluffy and soft. I have had some good body puffs, but none like these white ones. good.</li>
            <li> Delivery was great. This is super big and I wanted it for the face.  Its more for body and such big areas. Super fluffy. Im sure I can put it to usr</li>
            <li> Great price on good quality powder puffs.  Love them, just the right size.  Pack of 3 makes it easy to have a replacement close at hand.</li>
            <li> NICE PUFFS AND CAME JUST AS STATED.</li>
            <li> looks great and my baby loves it</li>
            <li> You can consider these are over-sized cosmetic puffs or smallish bath powder puffs.  I find the size very comfortable to handle as a powder puff and having three of them means that I can have one washed and drying while another takes its place in the bathroom.  I generally pour powder on them from the container and don&#x27;t use them in a dip box.  So that should be taken into consideration when deciding to buy.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Fits in powder dish well. Good replacement. Would buy again. Only quam was, the first one I used, the strap in back to hold it broke the first day. Otherwise that, it is good.</li>
            <li> this is a great deal! they are about the size of your palm, soft, and perfect for using with a dusting powder for your body. you get three, which, from shopping around, is actually cheaper than buying one. i&#x27;ve been using one daily for about a month now, and it&#x27;s still holding up it&#x27;s shape and softness. i definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Needed some Large Body Powder Puffs to apply Baby Powder after showering and these were exactly the right size and what I wanted.  I liked that there are three so I can replace the one in use after months of use and not have to worry if they can be washed.  For this price, I can just replace them.</li>
            <li> I used these powder puffs immediately upon receiving them as replacements in my dusting powder containers.  So far, they&#x27;ve worked very well and are of better quality than the ones that came with the containers.  They fit right into the standard round dusting powder containers and are absorbent enough to hold sufficient powder for placement on any part of the body.  So far, I&#x27;m satisfied with these puffs.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected but a bit smaller.  These are like the old-fashioned, soft body powder puffs that used to come in a box of powder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking online for body powder puffs and couldn&#x27;t find any big enough.  Not only do these have a good silk handle lace, they are just the right size.</li>
            <li> LARGE powder puffs for body talc are HARD to find. These will work I just wish they were a bit larger .</li>
            <li> Very timely in receiving very soft and just the right size for an older powder holder.  Would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> Very good quality. These will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for.  Thick and plush enough, but the holding ribbon on two of the three broke free from the puff on the first use. I finally gave up trying to use them and went to Wal-Mart and replaced them.  Sorry, but the product is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> they arrived on time. I was hoping they would be bigger than the ones I have but they weren&#x27;t but I will use them.</li>
            <li> Just the kind of big puffs  2 of my friends and I  have been searching for. Not in any stores!! Love them.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Been on the look-out for it, now I have 3 and they work excellently. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Nice and large as described.  Held up well for the use we wanted it for.</li>
            <li> My powder puffs remind me of being a little girl and being all powdered up by my grandma...they do the job!</li>
            <li> LOVED&#x27;EM JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR AT A REASONABLE PRICE, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,WISH I WOULD HAVE FOUND THEM SOONER THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Received the puffs a day before the &#x27;expected&#x27; date from our friendly UPS guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered two sets...one for mom and one for myself.  Perfect size for my hand.  The ribbon seems to be sewn in pretty solid. They are very soft and the material holds the powder pretty well.  The first &#x27;puffing&#x27; will loose some powder but after that, the powder seems to stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mom hasn&#x27;t tried hers yet but she likes the fluffiness and size.</li>
            <li> Looked everywhere in stores for powder puffs for my grandmother. This was exactly what we wanted, we will buy again!</li>
            <li> I was looking for some replacement puffs and was so impressed with the quality, I ordered another set for my sister.</li>
            <li> Need to be larger. quality is fine.</li>
            <li> I used one powder puff maybe twice before the satin cross piece that you put your fingers through came apart.  I would not recommend this product.  I&#x27;d rather pay more money and purchase a container of talc that comes with a puff included and possibly get a better product.</li>
            <li> I bought these hard-to-find body powder puffs because I was looking for something to apply powder that didn&#x27;t cause such a mess.  They definitely work...they are a nice, big size and they really help to control powder from flying all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about these beside the price is that they are hand-washable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Amazon for carrying another product that I can&#x27;t find anywhere else!</li>
            <li> Tiny! These are not much bigger than a facial puff and not very fluffy either.</li>
            <li> Very soft and nice size.</li>
            <li> These were as expected; the shipment came pretty quickly -- good buy!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without my powderpuff!!</li>
            <li> The buying experience was very good. The product shipped very fast, as well. However, I suppose I just couldn&#x27;t clearly see the picture of the item, as the texture of the puff wasn&#x27;t what I wanted. However, the puffs are nice, and I do like them pretty well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these and they are so difficult to find. The puffs are really soft and pick up a good amount of powder without spilling.  I think they are plenty large enough to use with body powder.  They can also be flipped so you get twice the amount of use.  I bought a vintage round powder box and emptied a container of powder into it and put a puff on top.  The puff fits the container perfectly and it looks cute on my counter.</li>
            <li> Super soft, great coverage.</li>
            <li> These are slightly smaller than the one I tossed. I like I having extras in case one gets ruined. They are soft. I was glad I found them here. They were very hard to find.</li>
            <li> I had some gold bond body powder and wanted a powder puff because just poofing powder on my body was making it go everywhere except where I was aiming!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. I could not believe how hard these things are to find locally! Walmart, CVS, Walgreen, RiteAid, K-Mart, no one had a simple powder puff! I finally broke down and bought these from Amazon, and I&#x27;m so pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These powder puffs are so thick and luxurious, The handle is nice and sturdy. The size is large enough I can squeeze the powder on and it holds, then I tap it on my body. so soft and pleasant! there is no funky or off odor, just a really nice powder puff that is holding up great. Highly recommend these</li>
            <li> A hard to find item that my wife loves.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t as fluffy as you might want, but for my purposes they are perfect in both size and ease of use.</li>
            <li> Its nice and soft but the string on top of it is not good as it comes out so easy.</li>
            <li> They were a little smaller than I had pictured, but I still kept them and will use them.</li>
            <li> Great.  Have now ordered a second time.</li>
