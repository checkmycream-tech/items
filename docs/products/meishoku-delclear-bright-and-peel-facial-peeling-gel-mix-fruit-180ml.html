    <ol>

            <li>I use this in between PMD, and it does a great job.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice product!</li>
            <li>I got this based on the good reviews.</li>
            <li>I loved the product, but not the price.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Interesting!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>For me, it does work effectively as an exfoliator.</li>
            <li>Kind of like a pineapple mango fruit punch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting a good peel/exfoliator for a while, but haven&#x27;t been able to find one.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive so this fits me perfectly.</li>
            <li>This contains exfoliants used in most effective peels, AHA and BHA, so unlike the scammy things sold at mall kiosks, this does contain exfoliating products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not expensive and smell great.</li>
            <li>Too good to be true.</li>
            <li>First it smells amazing is very easy to use and gets the exfoliating/peel job done!</li>
            <li>The biggest way that I can tell though is that after I use it, the skin on my fingertips feels like they do after I use a magic eraser too</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed more breakouts after I started using it.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li>Japanese product seem to do the best job  for a lot of skin care needs!</li>
            <li>I noticed my skin was a lot softer and seemed more supple, will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Touching my face afterwards makes my face feels smoother, even on areas</li>
            <li>My girlfriend is really satisfied...</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>My skin feels amazing right now!</li>
            <li>I gently watch my face with my own cleanser, use a couple pumps of the peeling gel, rub my face in circular motions, and rinse!</li>
            <li>I also found that my moisturizer absorbs more easily after I use the peel.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, but you don&#x27;t get very much.</li>
            <li>Well that made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>But overall great product, great seller - I was supposed to receive this product MONTHS out but actually received it in a matter of a couple weeks from placing the order.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin smooth at all.</li>
            <li>And now I have the dewy, flake free skin that I want.</li>
            <li>After I use this peel my skin is really smooth and looks brighter and refreshed.</li>
            <li>So far so good with the product...</li>
            <li>This facial peeling gel is amazing!  </li>
            <li>and my skin doesn&#x27;t get irritated or burn and leave my skin looking fresh awake and glowing!</li>
            <li>After washing, some original skin peels were removed, but some of them were still there.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>Seems to making my skin feel squeaky clean .</li>
            <li>After I use it, my skin feels better, though it&#x27;s not dramatic.</li>
            <li>everywhere I want to have fresh, smooth glowing skin.  </li>
            <li>I took about 3-4 pumps and really focused on the areas that needed the most exfoliation and cleansing- around my nose and chin.</li>
            <li>I then rinse my face with luke warm water, pat dry, and applied my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This product was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>It goes quick.</li>
            <li>Maybe i am just too excited right now.</li>
            <li>Something that works AND is fun to use?</li>
            <li>For me, it works best when I have washed my face before and dried it off completely.</li>
            <li>Face feels smooth after (not dried out or flaky).</li>
            <li>After rinsing and moisturizing my skin felt REALLY soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>In short, I LOVE this peeling gel.</li>
            <li>And to top it all off, I wanted to return it, but this seller doesn&#x27;t accept returns on open beauty products...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel this one was working at first until I googled directions on how to use it.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;This product does exactly what it says it does.  </li>
            <li>I saw results after the first use.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li>my conclusion is that the product does work to a certain extent on removing dry, flaky skin, and it is a nice face wash, so I give it 4 stars.  </li>
            <li>It removes dead skin from you face and makes it feel clean and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>After washing, more of the dry skin was removed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Gently rub until it starts to feel more dry.  </li>
            <li>This product delivers gentle exfoliation.</li>
            <li>I needed a gentle exfoliator but have been unsuccessful in my search.</li>
            <li>then gentle applied it on my face.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li>ehhhh cant tell if it really is making a difference.</li>
            <li>Doesnt really get rid of blackheads for me.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle and does wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li>the whole</li>
            <li>I use it 2x a week on my whole face because like I said it may irritate areas that are not oily.</li>
            <li>Aside from the bubbles on the front of the labeling, there is no English text on the bottle; it is wrapped in plastic, however, and has directions of &amp;#34;apply to face&amp;#34;-- other reviewers have included more detailed instructions in their comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are 4 pointers in English on the original packaging which tells you all that this product does.</li>
            <li>This was basically an impulse buy because I had nothing better to do then to browse the make up aisle at a local Asian market while my mom was grocery shopping.</li>
            <li>It could do a little better removing nose-area/T-zone \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; which I&#x27;d imagine seeing improved results over the course of using it.</li>
            <li>Normally I avoid scented things like the plague, but this one doesn&#x27;t bug my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within</li>
            <li>Dead skins were rolling up into the jelly and the more skin that it took off the whiter the substance becomes.</li>
            <li>I live the feeling On my face â™¡</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really gentle, gentle enough</li>
            <li>I felt my face become brighter  &amp; clearer and very very soft skin.</li>
            <li>When I had a sunburn and was peeling, the number of little rubbery balls was incredible, and there was far less peeling skin left on my face.</li>
            <li>This stuff really peels away dead skin right before your eyes!</li>
            <li>I use this on freshly washed, dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I had to google the instructions since the whole package is in Japanese.</li>
            <li>I have actually been using this product for about 6 months as a gentle exfoliator.</li>
            <li>I use it almost daily on my T zone because I tend to have really oily skin.</li>
            <li>For me it is still too early to tell.</li>
            <li>I can now say that this stuff works just as good as the expensive product.  </li>
            <li>I first tried it on dry skin, but i noticed the product clumping together in medium sized balls on my face.</li>
            <li>Many people writing reviews on this are saying that once you rub the product in your face, the little beads that form are your dead skin cells - I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s actually the jelly drying up into these little beads, acting as exfoliating beads, which help in removing dead skin cells, that most likely appear in combination with the beads after rubbing it in your face.</li>
            <li>The dead skin cells come off with little effort and my face looks more radiant and feels much softer afterwards.</li>
            <li>Most other reviews say dry, so definitely see what see what works for you.</li>
            <li>I bought my product at a local Mitsuwa (Japanese grocery store) here in San Diego after seeing positive reviews on YouTube.</li>
            <li>since I&#x27;ve only had it for a short time I cannot discern if it is making a positive difference or not.</li>
            <li>If there is moisture on my face, the little jelly roll balls coagulate too quickly.</li>
            <li>I rubbed it until it became dryer, but it didn&#x27;t get totally dry (maybe about 2 minutes of gentle massaging).  </li>
            <li>I find it gentle enough for daily use.</li>
            <li>Luckily I have a local Mitsuwa market near my home which is where I purchased this peeling gel for a little cheaper than Amazon.</li>
            <li>Wearing a new sandwich gloves, I rubbed the product on my nose where I clearly had a bit of peeling already there from the dry winter.  </li>
            <li>I could probably use it every day or every other day without irritating my very sensitive skin, but also extremely effective.</li>
            <li>noticed that after using the product with my bare fingers, the fingers feel smoother, like when you accidentally get bleach on your hands.  </li>
            <li>I just received this product and have only used it a couple of times:  so far, I do like using it.  </li>
            <li>By the third rinse there were almost no little balls forming.</li>
            <li>While rinsing it off, I noticed these small white clumps, and so I massage more pumps (3) to my wet face.</li>
            <li>And after peeling, my skin did not dry.</li>
            <li>Using my bare fingers, I reapplied the product on the same area of my nose.  </li>
            <li>gel is cool and does not irritate my skin; to my touch, it leaves no residue (as far as I know the gel grabs the dead skin and rolls together into little balls).  </li>
            <li>Since I had used Cure before, I knew I was supposed to get little white balls that felt less smooth, so I rinsed it off.</li>
            <li>The dead skin comes off in little balls on your face, which you just wash off and finish with your beauty routine, and it is so smooth afterwards.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a nice product! Many people writing reviews on this are saying that once you rub the product in your face, the little beads that form are your dead skin cells - I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s actually the jelly drying up into these little beads, acting as exfoliating beads, which help in removing dead skin cells, that most likely appear in combination with the beads after rubbing it in your face. In using this product, I just wet my face, dry it, and rub the stuff in (after 3-4 pumps) and notice the exfoliation power of the dried jelly beads instantly. I wash it off, dry my face, and continue on with my skin care regimen. Face feels smooth after (not dried out or flaky). It could do a little better removing nose-area/T-zone \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; which I&#x27;d imagine seeing improved results over the course of using it. But overall great product, great seller - I was supposed to receive this product MONTHS out but actually received it in a matter of a couple weeks from placing the order. Great service fo&#x27; sho&#x27;! I&#x27;d definitely order from this seller again!</li>
            <li> This product delivers gentle exfoliation. I&#x27;ve read some debate online as to whether the clumps that form are truly dead skin or if the product clumps like that regardless. I find that when I&#x27;ve been using it, or other methods, regularly, fewer of the pills/balls form when massaging it in. When I had a sunburn and was peeling, the number of little rubbery balls was incredible, and there was far less peeling skin left on my face. For me, it does work effectively as an exfoliator. After I use it, my skin feels better, though it&#x27;s not dramatic. I find it gentle enough for daily use.</li>
            <li> I was really really skeptical about the whole balling up thing being skin. Something that works AND is fun to use? Too good to be true. So I put a small amount between saran wrap and rubbed it together for a long time, no little balls formed whatsoever. The biggest way that I can tell though is that after I use it, the skin on my fingertips feels like they do after I use a magic eraser too long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the review. I used this once and it balled up a lot. I rinsed, applied again and it balled up a lot less. By the third rinse there were almost no little balls forming. This contains exfoliants used in most effective peels, AHA and BHA, so unlike the scammy things sold at mall kiosks, this does contain exfoliating products. After rinsing and moisturizing my skin felt REALLY soft and smooth. Even nicer than it feels after I do my usual sugar scrub. In short, I LOVE this peeling gel. It&#x27;s really gentle, gentle enough I could probably use it every day or every other day without irritating my very sensitive skin, but also extremely effective. I also adore the scent. Kind of like a pineapple mango fruit punch. Yum! Normally I avoid scented things like the plague, but this one doesn&#x27;t bug my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within just hours of using this a lot of those stupid annoying forehead bumps that seem to exist on everyone no matter what you do to them came to a head and I could extract them. Yay!</li>
            <li> This was basically an impulse buy because I had nothing better to do then to browse the make up aisle at a local Asian market while my mom was grocery shopping. I had to google the instructions since the whole package is in Japanese. I needed a gentle exfoliator but have been unsuccessful in my search. I have tried department stores to drugstore brands and none have been that great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed my face and pat dried it throughly then put a few pump in my hand then gentle applied it on my face. Once applied I gentled rubbed the product in circular motions then the coolest thing started to happened. Dead skins were rolling up into the jelly and the more skin that it took off the whiter the substance becomes. I literally was seeing my dead skin sloughing off into these jelly balls. I then rinse my face with luke warm water, pat dry, and applied my favorite moisturizer. My skin feels amazing right now!</li>
            <li> I got this based on the good reviews. I&#x27;ve been wanting a good peel/exfoliator for a while, but haven&#x27;t been able to find one. I thought this might work, but I don&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s really hard to rinse all the little \\&quot;balls\\&quot; (that form when you rub it around)off. I&#x27;ve even had to wash my face again after using this to try to get the residue off. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin smooth at all. It makes it feel oily. I&#x27;ve also noticed more breakouts after I started using it. And to top it all off, I wanted to return it, but this seller doesn&#x27;t accept returns on open beauty products...Which I think is stupid because everyone&#x27;s skin is different and you don&#x27;t know how it will work until you use it, which requires you to open the product. $20 down the drain.</li>
            <li> I have actually been using this product for about 6 months as a gentle exfoliator. Luckily I have a local Mitsuwa market near my home which is where I purchased this peeling gel for a little cheaper than Amazon. It is absolutely fantastic! I gently watch my face with my own cleanser, use a couple pumps of the peeling gel, rub my face in circular motions, and rinse! The dead skin cells come off with little effort and my face looks more radiant and feels much softer afterwards. It might be a bit drying sometimes so definitely moisturize. I also found that my moisturizer absorbs more easily after I use the peel. Like the directions say, only use it a couple times a week! Otherwise your skin might get irritated and possibly rough. I highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I love this product! First it smells amazing is very easy to use and gets the exfoliating/peel job done! I use this product at least 4 times a week and my skin doesn&#x27;t get irritated or burn and leave my skin looking fresh awake and glowing! Japanese product seem to do the best job  for a lot of skin care needs! I will re purchase this product again and again!</li>
            <li> OMGGGGG! When I read all the reviews here I was very very skeptical! I even thought some of these reviews were fake! Boy was i wrong! This product was shipped quickly. No issues with packaging at all. All the Japanese text was a bit intimidating. There is pretty small cit in English that explains a bit about how to rub it on my face and stuff. There are 4 pointers in English on the original packaging which tells you all that this product does. I thought my face looked tired and bumpy prior to rubbing a few pumps of this product on my face. I felt my face become brighter  &amp; clearer and very very soft skin. Maybe i am just too excited right now. I will come back and review when I have settled down a bit!</li>
            <li> ehhhh cant tell if it really is making a difference.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, but you don&#x27;t get very much. It goes quick.</li>
            <li> I have acne and didn&#x27;t want to use a towel or brush on my delicate, sometimes scabby skin.  I was using an expensive gel exfoliator (from a vendor at the mall) and wanted to find a cheaper alternative (that didn&#x27;t involve being attacked by cosmetic salespeople).  I didn&#x27;t feel this one was working at first until I googled directions on how to use it.  The key for me was that it said to rub the product on the skin until it becomes dry.  I rubbed it until it became dryer, but it didn&#x27;t get totally dry (maybe about 2 minutes of gentle massaging).  Well that made a huge difference.  I can now say that this stuff works just as good as the expensive product.  I use this on freshly washed, dry skin.  Gently rub until it starts to feel more dry.  Rinse.  Moisturize.  And now I have the dewy, flake free skin that I want.</li>
            <li> Two months prior to buying this, I ordered Cure Aqua Gel samples off of Ebay. I loved the product, but not the price. While in H Mart the other day i stumbled upon this and decided to get it, it was $17.99. I first tried it on dry skin, but i noticed the product clumping together in medium sized balls on my face. Since I had used Cure before, I knew I was supposed to get little white balls that felt less smooth, so I rinsed it off. While rinsing it off, I noticed these small white clumps, and so I massage more pumps (3) to my wet face. Most other reviews say dry, so definitely see what see what works for you. I noticed my skin was a lot softer and seemed more supple, will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Peels all the dead skin away. Does the job! Doesnt really get rid of blackheads for me. After I use this peel my skin is really smooth and looks brighter and refreshed. I use it when I need to exfoliate. About 2 times a week.</li>
            <li> Interesting!  I live the feeling On my face â™¡</li>
            <li> I did not care for this at all.  Feels like jelly but when you take it off it feels like you are peeling but doesn&#x27;t work.  just feels like it.</li>
            <li> I saw a review on YouTube for the Meishoku Detclear Facial Peeling Gel and I wanted to try it so I ordered it on Amazon and I am SO ADDICTED!  This stuff really peels away dead skin right before your eyes! I use it all over.  I use it on my feet, my arms, my legs, everywhere I want to have fresh, smooth glowing skin.  I have issues with breakouts so I use a lot of blemish treatment products which have a tendency to dry out my skin and make it appear uneven under my makeup and Detclear just wipes the flakey skin away!&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff! Check it out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hearing about cure for a while but did not want to spend the amount that is asked for it in the states.  So I looked for an alternative and found this.  This facial peeling gel is amazing!  You us 3-5 pumps and gently rub it on your face in a circular motion to get rid of dead skin and black heads.  The dead skin comes off in little balls on your face, which you just wash off and finish with your beauty routine, and it is so smooth afterwards.  This is now my forever alternative to facial scrubs.</li>
            <li> This works just as described in all the comments. You have to really scrub it in before you start to see and feel the dead skin balls. I recomend using it once a week or every two weeks since you could end up with really dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a month now, and I&#x27;m only so-so about it.  After reading all the reviews about whether the grey balls were really skin or not, I decided to conduct some little tests of my own.&lt;br /&gt;1) Wearing the one time use sandwich plastic gloves, I rubbed a liberal amount of the product between my fingers.  No clumping what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;2) Wearing a new sandwich gloves, I rubbed the product on my nose where I clearly had a bit of peeling already there from the dry winter.  Saw some clumping.  After washing, some original skin peels were removed, but some of them were still there.&lt;br /&gt;3) Using my bare fingers, I reapplied the product on the same area of my nose.  Lots of clumping!  After washing, more of the dry skin was removed.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that after using the product with my bare fingers, the fingers feel smoother, like when you accidentally get bleach on your hands.  Touching my face afterwards makes my face feels smoother, even on areas I didn&#x27;t use the product.&lt;br /&gt;So my conclusion is that the product does work to a certain extent on removing dry, flaky skin, and it is a nice face wash, so I give it 4 stars.  However, you should be mindful that your fingers also contain easy-to-slough-off- skin, so the clumps may not be from the face afterall.</li>
            <li> So far so good with the product... My girlfriend is really satisfied...</li>
            <li> This is the peeling product I have used. It&#x27;s not expensive and smell great. And after peeling, my skin did not dry.</li>
            <li> I love this. It is so gentle and does wonders for my skin. I am very sensitive so this fits me perfectly.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;This product does exactly what it says it does.  I saw results after the first use. It removes dead skin from you face and makes it feel clean and refreshing.  I would definitely use this product again.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I bought my product at a local Mitsuwa (Japanese grocery store) here in San Diego after seeing positive reviews on YouTube. I&#x27;m a bit of a skeptic..the whole \\&quot;I see my dead skin cells roll off\\&quot; idea seemed like an overpromise for something that was just $15. BUT, after I figured out how to use it properly I am totally sold. For me, it works best when I have washed my face before and dried it off completely. If there is moisture on my face, the little jelly roll balls coagulate too quickly. I took about 3-4 pumps and really focused on the areas that needed the most exfoliation and cleansing- around my nose and chin. I let it sit for about 10-15 minutes and then rinsed it off and toweled it off with a damp cloth. I have super sensitive skin so my face was a little red with all the abrasion but the next morning my skin was a smoother brighter version of itself. I love it!</li>
            <li> I just received this product and have only used it a couple of times:  so far, I do like using it.  Aside from the bubbles on the front of the labeling, there is no English text on the bottle; it is wrapped in plastic, however, and has directions of &amp;#34;apply to face&amp;#34;-- other reviewers have included more detailed instructions in their comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel is cool and does not irritate my skin; to my touch, it leaves no residue (as far as I know the gel grabs the dead skin and rolls together into little balls).  I do wet my face afterward and pat dry, but since I&#x27;ve only had it for a short time I cannot discern if it is making a positive difference or not.</li>
            <li> Seems to making my skin feel squeaky clean .</li>
            <li> I use this in between PMD, and it does a great job.  My skin feels soft and smooth afterwards.  Besides, how the product works really makes me feel like it&#x27;s peeling off the dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for those with oily skin and clogged pores. Not for those with dry skin because it may cause your skin to get irritated. This product causes the oil on your skin to coagulate, therefore the clumping of the product on your face. It literally sucks up the oil on your skin. I use it almost daily on my T zone because I tend to have really oily skin. Use with Biore pore strips for best results. I use it 2x a week on my whole face because like I said it may irritate areas that are not oily. I think that with continuous use it may improve the texture and even out the skin tone. For me it is still too early to tell. I only have been using it for less than two months. However, I have notice some improvement. Overall, it keeps the oil under control and you do see the results almost immediately. Great product!</li>
