            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve kept using it, because sometimes products just take time for you to see a difference, but I haven&#x27;t seen any good changes in my skin.</li>

            <li>I think I&#x27;ve gotten amazing results.</li>
            <li>But the smell is nice.</li>

            <li>I love this scrub.  </li>
            <li>price is better than Costco.</li>
            <li>and I have tried many.</li>
            <li>I generally love all Aveeno products.</li>
            <li>I have already experience both skin irritation and dryness, mostly around my lips and nose.</li>
            <li>To top it off, it does not \\&quot;brighten\\&quot; or even out</li>
            <li>and so were most of my scars</li>
            <li>It is a good product, well worth the price.</li>

            <li>Its better than most scrubs I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out nor makes it more oily.</li>
            <li>I love this face scrub.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite face wash.</li>
            <li>Much as I love the feel of microbeads, I have given up cleansers which use them.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>My skin looks so much more healthier now.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>Most scrubs have granules or something you can notice.</li>
            <li>i love this product</li>
            <li>I personally feel like this is the all time BEST face wash.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still seeing the same, great results!</li>
            <li>I have used this for many years.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several brands and for the price this is the best.</li>

            <li>I figured it was because it is a \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; scrub, so I was okay with that...</li>
            <li>Thank you :)</li>
            <li>Also the price here on Amazon is better</li>

            <li>I absolutely love it</li>
            <li>Love this scrub</li>
            <li>Love it and would suggest anyone to try it.</li>
            <li>This is one of the better acne products out there.</li>
            <li>Because the beads are finer, it feels like it&#x27;s exfoliating more evenly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;really love it</li>
            <li>If you want to maintain a healthy glow</li>
            <li>This is a very nice, gentle scrub and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Works great and leaves skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Clean, fresh smell and this product works great on my complexion.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super pleased!</li>
            <li>It never dries it out and feel very clean after using</li>
            <li>I have found a happy medium for my normally combination skin.</li>
            <li>This product has been pretty good, it does what it says it does.  </li>
            <li>Just excellent product for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff, feels good and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Good product and works nice on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling so clean!</li>
            <li>I prefer the fine grit that is in the Oil of Olay, I feel like it&#x27;s cleaning better.  </li>
            <li>I gave this product a 5 because it is a very nice facial cleanser, very good consistency, and overall a nice product.</li>
            <li>As you get older it seems there are so many things you have to do to keep your skin looking good.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use any soap without irritation and this does a great job removing makeup and leaves my skin soft and feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>I love the smell- it light and yummy.  </li>
            <li>I like that the beads are kind of small, just the perfect scrub for me</li>
            <li>I have used other brands from drug stores/ grocery stores and this one is just the best.  </li>
            <li>It is good for the most sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Most of the bumps are gone and my face FEELS clean.</li>
            <li>fresh!&lt;br /&gt;I can easily remove my mascara and face powder with a dime size amount of this product.</li>
            <li>Aveeno, an Awesome Product &amp; a Wonder for my skin.my skin really feels soft n</li>
            <li>but the scent is WAY too strong.</li>
            <li>it is great to use before shaving, but I have sensitive  skin and it doesn&#x27;t cause me problems with breakouts as it is oil free and soap free.  </li>
            <li>(this C&amp;C scrub says it&#x27;s good for daily use just as Aveeno&#x27;s does), but I will write a separate review under that product after I&#x27;ve used it more and can report more reliably.</li>
            <li>a good product that is not irritating, even with rosacea and has a clean non-offensive scent.</li>
            <li>Aveeno Positively Radiant scrub is easy on my skin yet also effective at brightening my skin tone.</li>
            <li>This is fine.</li>
            <li>It almost feels like you are rubbing fine grit sand on your face.  </li>
            <li>Works fine</li>
            <li>and my skin has reacted just fine.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never used an exfoliant before or if you have very sensitive skin, this is probably a really good product for you.  </li>
            <li>it is good for people with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product, I love this product so much because one, I have very sensitive skin and even though it&#x27;s a scrub it doesn&#x27;t cause any kind of damage.</li>
            <li>you need a little but still dont think its handy great smell, gave it tree stars because i can do without it</li>
            <li>The best part is I only need the tiniest little bit and it lathers up and works great.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a huge fan.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge Aveeno fan and will continue to use their lotions</li>
            <li>I never had a huge acne problem where my face would be covered with acne</li>
            <li>Description is relatively accurate.  </li>
            <li>Liked it so much.</li>
            <li>&quot; feeling on my face and my skin felt smooth to the touch after using it.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It feels like it has sand in it that works on your face to smooth out any roughness or dryness.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s been clearing up my light break outs.</li>
            <li>There are light scrubbing pieces like pieces of sugar that dissolve while in use</li>
            <li>It has a light scent, nothing perfume-y.</li>
            <li>That wasn&#x27;t available on Amazon Prime, so I figured I&#x27;d give this a try.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like the gritty feeling, this might be great for you.</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and radiant.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>Removes age spots and gives skin a fabulous glow.  </li>
            <li>I love Aveeno and I heard so many good things about this cleanser, but I have to say it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li>There are many Aveeno products I love and work very well.</li>
            <li>really loved using it .. it will make your face soft and day after day glowing ..</li>
            <li>It has a fine sandy texture which makes your face feel refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li>Great daily scrub for your face, help to exfoliate the skin and clean your pores, I will buy this again</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years, as it keeps my face looking smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling smooth and clean but not stripped of all moisture.</li>
            <li>product does not have very much scent, which is very nice if you are sensitive to smells like I am.</li>
            <li>The smell was very much like chemicals instead of something refreshing.</li>
            <li>This is a great product though, the small beads are nice and definitely clean well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great mild exfoliant and doesn&#x27;t damage my fragile aging skin.</li>
            <li>With this routine, I have noticed a significant difference in the feel of my skin after I wash it.</li>
            <li>but and very pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this at Costco in a 3 pack.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling cool and smooth,</li>
            <li>Better than the popular St Ives scrub, this stuff tears off a layer of your skin while the aveeno actually \\&quot;exfoliates&#x27;.</li>
            <li>but it dont clean for s^&amp;t</li>
            <li>I sat there for a good 5 minutes, and it really didn&#x27;t do much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>By far my favorite face wash!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nothing special</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice any brightening of my face nor does my skin feel like anything special after using it.  </li>
            <li>Love this and gentle on my skin</li>
            <li>It is gentle to you skin and not a wasteful product as so many are.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, It hasnt really helped with the acne</li>
            <li>Good basic face wash.</li>
            <li>Good facial scrub.</li>
            <li>leaves face feeling fresh and light.</li>
            <li>It DOES make my skin seem clearer, fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face super clean.</li>
            <li>and my skin was much softer and just looked better.</li>
            <li>My skin feels nice and soft after using it.</li>
            <li>Also a good price for a big bottle!</li>
            <li>It has been the most gentle scrub I have found.</li>
            <li>i think it is a cheap, but it is useful and helpful.</li>
            <li>Good product, my second purchase</li>
            <li>It exfoliates gently and makes makeup application smooth and easy.</li>
            <li>What i was looking for: something to wash my face clean with a days worth of makeup while simultaneously evening out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Two it keeps my skin fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It is great for taking off daily accumulated dirt, but it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate the skin as much as I want to.  </li>
            <li>I used hers at her house a few times and liked the way it made my skin feel, so I decided to buy one of my own.</li>
            <li>Just washing in the shower and rinsing did not seem adequate.</li>
            <li>i initially used cetaphil, but with time i realised it left my skin greasy, thats the reason i had to look for Aveeno which is perfect on all skin types n for all seasons too..</li>
            <li>had the option of giving only a 5 star, otherwise i would have given more :-)</li>
            <li>I purchased this scrub because I love most of the aveeno proucts, was in need of a facial scrub, and thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great product, will purchase again in the future!</li>
            <li>notice any brightening.&lt;br /&gt;A mild scrub for allergic skin.</li>
            <li>Imhave since bought the st. Ives citrus mild scrub</li>
            <li>I think it would be too gentle to use, and the scrub is too fine to clean out everything.</li>
            <li>I like it very much!</li>
            <li>It has cleared it up a good deal, but not completely, yet.</li>
            <li>Good basic cleanser, I think it&#x27;s very gentle</li>
            <li>I think this cleanser is probably best for someone who has relatively few skin issues and mostly normal skin.</li>
            <li>I would recommend trying it out; It&#x27;s effective, cheap, and the tube lasts for a really long time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a noticeable &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; in my skin tone, but my skin definitely feels better - feels clean and smooth after using the scrub.</li>
            <li>&quot; That was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>I give the product two stars because I did like how it made my skin feel in general, especially right after using it.</li>
            <li>(definitely feels amazing</li>
            <li>it cleans in depth and helps to look fresh n</li>
            <li>I think this Clean &amp; Clear scrub is going to be what I was looking for and might recommend this to people who need a stronger scrub than Aveeno&#x27;s but a scrub that&#x27;s not TOO strong</li>
            <li>I love using this as it leaves my skin feeling really soft.</li>
            <li>Once I scrub it, feels fresh and this scrub did help me reduce and control acne.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t Aveeno pride themselves on being a more natural brand?</li>
            <li>This face wash leaves my face feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>Works great on preventing acne for my sensitive combination skin (not as well as Proactiv&#x27;s daily cleanser though).</li>
            <li>Makes skin feel and look more visibly soft.</li>
            <li>and so far I love it.</li>
            <li>I had the Oil of Olay daily face scrub and liked it.  </li>
            <li>I have tried multiple kind of face scrubs, soaps, cleansers but after running into this product never used anything else.</li>
            <li>but I had enough acne to get some kind of a face wash or scrub.</li>
            <li>so why would i go back to any other product once ive found a PERFECT one,</li>
            <li>only problem is that it&#x27;s not sulfate and paraben free, so for those very healthy conscious you might want to take a pass on this one.</li>
            <li>The pros about this product is that it is a great daily scrub, it doesn&#x27;t really have a strong odor, and 5 ounces actually last you a while if you use the correct amount.  </li>
            <li>i really feel that my face is really really clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and am very happy with it along with other Aveeno products!</li>
            <li>I love this face scrub - my skin is sensitive, so I can only use it every couple of days, but I do love the feeling after I have.</li>
            <li>Love Aveeno products in general.  </li>
            <li>The product also doesn&#x27;t really lather that well (unless maybe your face is soaked?), so I, personally, have to keep squeezing more out and wetting my face to get enough on as you need to rub this scrub in pretty good and for a while.     </li>
            <li>Then I go back over gently with a warm wash cloth, then rinse.</li>
            <li>Its super gentle on the skin and not overly exfoliating.</li>
            <li>It costs around $7-$8 a bottle, pretty much worth the higher price tag.    </li>
            <li>The actual cleansing portion is fairly gentle and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice, gentle daily scrub.</li>
            <li>Does kind of dry my face out, so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not all that easy to find products as compatible as this with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>combined with the Aveeno pads, a daily moisturizer with SPF 15 UV protector in the morning, followed by this at night, seems to be doing the trick for keeping acne at bay and keeping her young face bright and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>face wash its all natural and good for all age types leaves your skin smooth and fades the dark spots.</li>
            <li>Even when i had no acne, I did like this scrub - good to use a scrub every once in a while to get those dead skin cells out of ur skin, right?</li>
            <li>Even though it contains micro beads, it is very gentle on skin.</li>
            <li>and it still works - very gentle and non-abrasive but yet exfoliates you will like this product.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle, but also you can feel it working.</li>
            <li>I have hyper-sensitive skin and often find myself allergic to products that others with sensitive skin find fine</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling soft, clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Keep it in the shower, use just a pinch and it quickly removes dirt and oils leaving skin ready for Aveeno Positively Radiant Moisturizer with SPF 15.  </li>
            <li>I rarely go for a facial kind of thing, I only put on facepacks at home once in a while, so this helps keeping my pores clean.</li>
            <li>This item works very well !</li>
            <li>The only thing I love about this product is the smell.  </li>
            <li>I love the Aveeno product but only buy it when it&#x27;s on sale.</li>
            <li>I saw a difference the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>The reviews on this product are somewhat funny.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping as well!</li>
            <li>- I noticed a difference after about a week of consistent use.</li>
            <li>In fact, the reason I bought this product in the first place is that my mother has it and suggested it for my skin.</li>
            <li>but surely --&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely add this to my subscribe list&lt;br /&gt;yay&lt;br /&gt;Reena</li>
            <li>Since I started ordering this from Amazon, I found that the prices are much better on Amazon then in stores back home.</li>
            <li>; that is part of why I&#x27;ve been able to use the same bottle for so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It not too rough, not too greasy and rinse off nicely.</li>
            <li>I love this daily face wash!  </li>
            <li>I love this daily scrub.</li>
            <li>Thanks Aveeno!</li>
            <li>and this is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>and it has not failed me since.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t get better after using for 2 weeks just to give it a proper chance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Simply put the words microbeads and pollution in your favorite search engine.</li>
            <li>My skin looks fresher and truly more radiant when I use it daily.</li>
            <li>Aveeno products are usually affordable and effective so I have a tendency to purchase products from a brand name that I am familiar with and have used before.</li>
            <li>I tried to find something that I liked after a particular soap was discontinued and it took me a long time to find this.</li>
            <li>I recently switched to the Aveeno Smart Essentials Detoxifying Scrub which in my opinion works better, but this may just be for my skin type.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s great (but when switching to a new face wash, they usually are all great for the first few weeks).</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve already moved on to another product to try and treat my acne and help with skin tone/texture, Clean &amp; Clear Oxygenating Scrub.</li>
            <li>I used this to take all of my make up off (not eye make up) and my skin felt clean and soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>It leaves my sensitive skin clean with no stinging feeling.  </li>
            <li>What really got my attention, was that right on front, it says \\&quot;gentle scrub to even skin tone and</li>
            <li>I used it twice a day along with the Aveeno Positively Radiant Moisturizer with SPF15</li>
            <li>I just wanted a gentle scrub that cleans my face, and this Aveeno scrub is exactly it.  </li>
            <li>I am willing to spend too much money on Bobbi Brown makeup, but this gem is all i need for washing it off at night.</li>
            <li>I just wish that this product helped more with minor breakouts.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The exfoliation is more gentle than most \\&quot;scrubs\\&quot; due to the very tiny beads.  </li>
            <li>Maybe you have to have a certain skin type to see results.</li>
            <li>This is my new daily face wash; I love it.</li>
            <li>I love aveeno products because it feels very natural and leaves me feeling the same way.  </li>
            <li>I tried the Aveeno Facial Cleanser, and it is smooth and comfortable, and I have been searching for a daily facial scrub for a long time, and it is good.</li>
            <li>Back to my Go 360 Clean Deep Exfoliating Scrub dependable product for the time being, until I feel safe trying a new product...</li>
            <li>Compare to most exfoliator, this wasn&#x27;t as rough on my face.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works for me</li>
            <li>I started using this product and finished the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care too much for face washes and stuff, and my acne was gone</li>
            <li>but my face looks and feels so much brighter after use.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t even notice it that much.</li>
            <li>But I really like this Aveeno scrub</li>
            <li>I like the citrusy smell and the way it cleans gently.</li>
            <li>This worked very well for me.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t even use it that much (once a night)</li>
            <li>(wait, doesn&#x27;t that cover the whole year??)</li>
            <li>No matter how much lotion I use on my skin, I still have it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very mild face wash, so if you&#x27;re looking for a really deep deep clean, this might not be your wash.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t breaking out nearly as much as I was before</li>
            <li>need to use much of this product during&lt;br /&gt;the Winter ...</li>
            <li>My sis likes that it is so gentle.</li>
            <li>but it did work very well.</li>
            <li>Really improves skin.</li>
            <li>I think because it is so gentle.</li>
            <li>and I needed to find a gentle scrub</li>
            <li>I feel it really helps my moisturizer absorb.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t ready</li>
            <li>Our whole family uses this and loves it.</li>
            <li>- you can really feel the product cleaning your face.</li>
            <li>and I started breaking out and had so much redness I had to use lots of concealer.</li>
            <li>A gentle face cleanser that works well to remove make up.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>when it gets close to empty there is a good amount left in the tube that won&#x27;t squeeze out.</li>
            <li>The best part of it all is that I can use it daily without it irritating my skin.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that for people that wash their faces two times a day, this stuff goes pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>For example, I have not seen my skin \\&quot;brighten\\&quot; so much as look shiny/oily in certain spots, particularly my forehead.</li>
            <li>i neednt use a scrub again to either remove dead tissue or black heads or even tan.. for those with sensitive skin like mine, it is very mild n works great too.</li>
            <li>st.ives way better it would be really good if you don&#x27;t like a harsh scrub this is very little beads</li>
            <li>Sodium Hydroxide is, among many other industrial purposes, used to turn animal carcasses into pulp.</li>
            <li>They simply make my face feel clean and</li>
            <li>and I think it would be suitable for regular if not daily use.</li>
            <li>Only purchase this daily scrub if you can handle the assault of beautiful young twenty-something women that a young adonis must bare on an hourly basis.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed anything special, it&#x27;s only been about a week</li>
            <li>, i.e. itching/stinging sensation that just would not go away (this would go on for hours) and a raised spot, kind of like a small swelling.</li>
            <li>Good product though, not good if you don&#x27;t have acne though</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m dark skinned (love it) and have been washing my face with this cleanser since 2009.  </li>
            <li>Nice mild scent, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I even feel safe letting my toddler daughter use a little dab when she wants to be just like mommy.</li>
            <li>Leaves you feeling brand new!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the new formula as much.</li>
            <li>But this product has done more good than bad for me.</li>
            <li>I love the beads because they really help with exfoliating the dead skin/dirt.</li>
            <li>If more people are buying the product, it should be CHEAPER than more expensive.</li>
            <li>The main reason I got</li>
            <li>Seems to do a decent job.</li>
            <li>Washing my face with this feels fresh and not dry.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream, it makes my face very soft.</li>
            <li>While some face washes have rough exfoliants, the Skin Brightening Daily Scrub has the perfect combination of cleanser and small beads.</li>
            <li>more a few drop is enough for full face..</li>
            <li>I am having a little more acne, but since I have been using a whole lot of new products, it might be because of something else.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and I recommend highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Since high school I used Clean &amp; Clear Daily Pore Cleanser which worked well, but the store did not have any in stock the day I went to buy some.</li>
            <li>But when I tried this product for the first time, I gently buffed away the dry spots on my face, leaving it extremely smooth even the next morning.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin though and it did not continually keep it smooth.</li>
            <li>I wish it were a little more scrubby</li>
            <li>Not exactly what I was looking for, but it is a great scrub for gentle skin because the beads are so small.</li>
            <li>B004D247SC Aveeno Smart Essentials Scrub]], since the latter is a little more gentle on the skin for when you don&#x27;t need much exfoliation.</li>
            <li>, skin feels INCREDIBLY soft (even my hands), don&#x27;t have to use much to rub it on your face and feel it working, etc.</li>
            <li>But that is what makes this a gentle cleanser for those who have sensitive skin or don&#x27;t like the feel of grit when they are washing their face.  </li>
            <li>Really brightens the face, but is not harsh.  </li>
            <li>It has these tiny tiny beads that gently scrub your skin and just make your face feel so smooth after washing.</li>
            <li>Though I really do love aveeno products, there are a few cons.  </li>
            <li>I can see how big/harsh beads can irritate some people&#x27;s skin, and I&#x27;ve seen reviews of this product where many people have mentioned a scrub by St. Ives as an example of a harsh scrub.</li>
            <li>Its really worth paying the extra couple of dollars.  </li>
            <li>More harsh and drying than I thought it&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li>I normally use this product during the Summer,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>Few scrubs are better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>However, it did make my face feel a little dry and not as bright</li>
            <li>It is a bit drying you should moisturizer right after using it if possible.</li>
            <li>But without some kind of a facial lotion product it does have a chance of drying your skin, especially if you have sensitive skin such as myself.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I use this product and all the other aveeno products and they are fantastic.</li>
            <li>so I never got around to buying a new one.</li>
            <li>I want to try out a new product.</li>
            <li>I now live in Costa Rica and this is the one item I HAVE to have from the States.</li>
            <li>Light weight cleanser, scent is neither good nor bad.</li>
            <li>--I believe that this product is mainly for those with sensitive skin, and that&#x27;s what they should advertise so the rest of us can save our money.</li>
            <li>For my skin which tends to be oily and gets rough patches if I use the wrong soap, this is excellent.</li>
            <li>As far as brightening goes, it didn&#x27;t really help with that either, but I have had freckles since I was 5 years old</li>
            <li>I really like it because it is a gentle exfoliant; it doesn&#x27;t screw up my skin with daily use.</li>
            <li>I will say though, I have very sensitive redness prone skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>so I am very sensitive to all these kinds of products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and truly is a scrub that can be used daily.</li>
            <li>I really hate when companies find a lovely product and then just price it higher because they know people love the product so much</li>
            <li>First of all, some others here mention the smaller beads.</li>
            <li>Pain and irritation are evident within 3 minutes, but contact with dilute solutions may not cause symptoms for several hours.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with it!</li>
            <li>I also love the small microbeads in it to exfoliate my skin.</li>
            <li>I use it almost everyday to gently exfoliate and clean my skin.</li>
            <li>Smells great, leaves skin feeling fresh, however pretty expensive for a small amount.  </li>
            <li>We have tried all different types of face cleansers like clean and clear, st Ives, Neutrogena, cetaphil, Nivea, Olay, Biore,  Loreal....but finally stopped at this one.</li>
            <li>It may have wiped the makeup off, but i think my face looks less smooth than it did before i started this product.  </li>
            <li>This product does dry my skin a little after a wash, but the body uses its own oils to counteract that dryness and makes that dryness feel fade after 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Seldom used, Aveeno positively radiant skin brightening daily scrub.  </li>
            <li>It cleans the same and pretty much IS the same product.    </li>
            <li>, well I never labeled my skin as sensitive, but after using this product I do not know how people with sensitive skin can use this product!</li>
            <li>I got some hydrocortisone cream &amp; only used a mild soap to cleanse area &amp; a week later my face is healed....</li>
            <li>the tube appears half full when new.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this product half the price as it was in the stores, so I bought 2!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t super smelly like other face washes.  </li>
            <li>Other studies acknowledge Sodium Hydroxide as a strong irritant that is corrosive to the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract, but that the severity of the effects are related directly to concentration and pH levels, as well as the length of exposure and skin type.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I didnt really think at that time that this product was actually improving my skin and got rid of my acne, instead i just chalked it up to my hormone problems being fixed and the scars fading by themselves.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough for my sensitive skin to use every day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product and Aveeno clear complexion moisturizer for about two weeks.</li>
            <li>Ive used this product before but couldnt find it in the stores near me since ive moved.</li>
            <li>Supposedly this is for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This film is a shattering powerhouse of emotion but crafted in such a way as to gently pull the rug from under your feet and place a cushion under your bott as you come to rest.</li>
            <li>This film is a shattering powerhouse of emotion but crafted in such a way as to gently pull the rug from under your feet and place a cushion under your bott as you come to rest.</li>
            <li>Frankly, I am surprised to see Aveeno still offers this product.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft and it evens out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Maybe its the fact that I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>it could be that maybe I didn&#x27;t wash it off completely.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think any old drugstore cleanser is going to help with them.</li>
            <li>My esthetician recommended that I use a exfoliant on my face, and after using this product regularly, she really noticed an improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>This product has such tiny exfoliating beads that it really doesn&#x27;t seem to have much of an exfoliating effect when used.</li>
            <li>for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 30 yr old male with sensitive skin and it has been serving its purpose very well.</li>
            <li>It leaves a soft glow to her skin and her face never feels oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After exfoliating with it, my face feels baby soft.</li>
            <li>No complaints so far</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive, combination skin and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for months now, and I still can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s actually working or not.</li>
            <li>daughter doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Gentle enough to use every day</li>
            <li>early 20s</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d have brighter skin, but so far I have not seen a difference</li>
            <li>Delivery of this item was professional.</li>
            <li>I really like this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>It works well and my skin feels soft &amp; refreshed.</li>
            <li>Thanks Aveeno, you are the only company I have</li>
            <li>We need to regularly exfoliate our faces, to remove the dead cells, and make our skin able to absorb the skin care products we apply.  </li>
            <li>Goes soft &amp; smooth on your face and within a few weeks you will see the difference.</li>
            <li>I have been using this daily scrub for a few months now and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>This does the exact opposite, my face doesn&#x27;t feel dry after using it and it has a certain glow to my skin after using it.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I was surprised it had tiny tiny beads.</li>
            <li>Positively works well as daily facial scrub to gently remove daily sunscreen applications.</li>
            <li>Only one earth on which to live!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had acne and had mild to moderate amount of acne scars on my face as well, with daily use for several months</li>
            <li>Just a little dab of this will easily cover your face and I find one bottle lasting me over a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am currently 39 weeks pregnant and have not really had any issues with acne/pimples...until now.</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t that strong or harsh yet has enough granules to feel like its working.</li>
            <li>Some people, like my brother, prefer the large beads in a facial scrub, but I like the smaller beads in this one.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a light daily cleaner that gave me a little bit of exfoliation and wasn&#x27;t overly fragrant.</li>
            <li>i suddenly started to get acne in the humid weather where i live.</li>
            <li>Even dry skin responds to this gentle &#x27;body scrub.&#x27;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a very short amount of time, but I can already note some key differences--bigger beads, a much nicer feel after using it</li>
            <li>Does leave my skin soft and this time of year, my natural oils lubricate my skin enough</li>
            <li>you only need just a little bit, and my face feels much cleaner than with higher end products.</li>
            <li>, I just wish it were in a larger oz bottle rather than having to order a bunch of small ones, but it does last quite a while if you don&#x27;t use more than you need (like i tend to do)</li>
            <li>Contact with the eye may produce pain and irritation, and in severe cases, clouding of the eye and blindness.\\&quot; Solutions as weak as .12% have shown to destruct healthy skin cells within one hour.</li>
            <li>and I notice a major improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>It did not exfoliate as well as I hoped, but it worked well with my skin and did not cause any major breakouts.</li>
            <li>Recommended for normal, dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This face wash is great, but microbeads have been shown to be bad for the ecosystem, so I really feel bad giving it a good review.</li>
            <li>Does not make my face feel clean one bit, actually feels a little slippery/greasy&lt;</li>
            <li>and I used it for a month and a half and used more than half the bottle.</li>
            <li>My previous face wash was clinique, spent around $50 for the whole set, and my skin never felt right.</li>
            <li>But again, it makes it a little dry, but if you use it once a week, you should be fine.</li>
            <li>I use this every morning in the shower, along with the other Positively Radiant items.</li>
            <li>and I generally like this product.  </li>
            <li>I used my regular body wash to clean off the tape residue, still left black marks.  </li>
            <li>- you can barely tell they&#x27;re there</li>
            <li>Had no trouble with any others from different brands.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin, so this prouct seemed like the obvious</li>
            <li>and now I am in physical therapy from having to bed 30-40 young phillies nightly.</li>
            <li>I am almost 30, and my skin is definitely transitioning from the youthful, bounces-back-easily skin of my early 20&#x27;s to something....not so easily-bouncing-back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how well it will work on customers that have a severe acne (may need something stronger) but those who have sensitive skin, this product is definitely  worth trying.</li>
            <li>However, unless you have that problem of most scrubs irritating your skin, the seemingly non-existent beads in this product are just not going to get the job done on your skin...</li>
            <li>At its price, now I&#x27;m kind of sorry I did.</li>
            <li>The tiny little beads are very soothing and not annoying like a lot of other daily scrubs.  </li>
            <li>I need to buy a deep moisturizing creme and a new daily scrub.</li>
            <li>and with that a whole new round of scars.</li>
            <li>It can be used daily while taking shower and doesn&#x27;t dry the skin that much.</li>
            <li>I am constantly aware of skin&#x27;s condition and there is a slight burning sensation.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say anything scientific about the two (I haven&#x27;t exactly done any controlled studies comparing the actual outcomes of the two...), but I just prefer the feel of the other.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really help with acne, but then again it&#x27;s not really supposed to!</li>
            <li>The small beads are not too rough on the skin and the smell makes it that much more pleasurable to use, but I&#x27;m still uncertain if it actually does what it insists.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product, especially if you have sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li>Second, this product claims to do some things I don&#x27;t think it does, or maybe--again--it only does it for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this facewash for about a week, so I am not sure of the true properties of it.</li>
            <li>I do not need lotion as this product does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>This is a decent scrub minus the brightening.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out my skin at all</li>
            <li>It was a little bit drying at first, but I don&#x27;t have any issues with it now.</li>
            <li>Even if the face wash is causing the acne, only a little bit has showed and so worth it, and it may be different with you anyways.</li>
            <li>and I like the super tiny beads; they don&#x27;t hurt your face and they aren&#x27;t rough like some other scrubs.</li>
            <li>Others around the same price i had to use a ton to get my face clean because it was so thick.</li>
            <li>this doesn&#x27;t help my dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It does make my skin dry, which is easily fixed by some lotion afterwards.</li>
            <li>my deep dark very noticeable acne marks are almost invisible.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that is also very dry, this product caused my face to get red</li>
            <li>The product occasionally would come out in large clumps, which would make a mess on the sink or in the shower.</li>
            <li>It does help to get rid of any blemishes on the skin, I had few, but the few I have (had) are pretty much gone now.  </li>
            <li>However, I have to echo the sentiments of other reviewers and say that the beads are just a skosh too small to really fit my requirements in a scrub.</li>
            <li>I also have very dry, sensitive</li>
            <li>My complexion has already improved (got a little too much sun this year).</li>
            <li>I stopped using this product immediately due to this was the only thing new I put on my skin....</li>
            <li>I walked away from it to use other scrubs because I wanted something new, but I always came back to it.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and tend to get red and blotchy with other face washes.</li>

            <li> I think I&#x27;ve gotten amazing results.</li>
            <li> But the smell is nice.</li>
            <li> However, Target (a Midwestern Store) carries their own brand that remakes the product for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> I have liked it.</li>
            <li> Nice scent and consistency.</li>
            <li> Great price and love being able to shop online and have it delivered to my house.</li>
            <li> Nice scrub without being too abrasive.</li>
            <li> It gets my face shiny and helps reduce the breakout of pimples or acne effectively.</li>
            <li> Is what just wanted, perfect, gentle...</li>
            <li> I kind of feel like it doesn&#x27;t</li>

            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> the face will become very smooth after using it.</li>

            <li> and I have tried many.</li>
            <li> I generally love all Aveeno products.</li>
            <li> I have already experience both skin irritation and dryness, mostly around my lips and nose.</li>
            <li> To top it off, it does not \\&quot;brighten\\&quot; or even out</li>
            <li> and so were most of my scars</li>
            <li> It is a good product, well worth the price.</li>

            <li> Love it and would suggest anyone to try it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better acne products out there.</li>
            <li> Because the beads are finer, it feels like it&#x27;s exfoliating more evenly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;really love it</li>
            <li> If you want to maintain a healthy glow</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, gentle scrub and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Works great and leaves skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Clean, fresh smell and this product works great on my complexion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super pleased!</li>
            <li> It never dries it out and feel very clean after using</li>
            <li> I have found a happy medium for my normally combination skin.</li>
            <li> This product has been pretty good, it does what it says it does.  </li>
            <li> Just excellent product for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff, feels good and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Good product and works nice on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling so clean!</li>
            <li> I prefer the fine grit that is in the Oil of Olay, I feel like it&#x27;s cleaning better.  </li>
            <li> I gave this product a 5 because it is a very nice facial cleanser, very good consistency, and overall a nice product.</li>
            <li> As you get older it seems there are so many things you have to do to keep your skin looking good.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use any soap without irritation and this does a great job removing makeup and leaves my skin soft and feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> I love the smell- it light and yummy.  </li>
            <li> I like that the beads are kind of small, just the perfect scrub for me</li>
            <li> I have used other brands from drug stores/ grocery stores and this one is just the best.  </li>
            <li> It is good for the most sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Most of the bumps are gone and my face FEELS clean.</li>
            <li> fresh!&lt;br /&gt;I can easily remove my mascara and face powder with a dime size amount of this product.</li>
            <li> Aveeno, an Awesome Product &amp; a Wonder for my skin.my skin really feels soft n</li>
            <li> but the scent is WAY too strong.</li>
            <li> it is great to use before shaving, but I have sensitive  skin and it doesn&#x27;t cause me problems with breakouts as it is oil free and soap free.  </li>
            <li> (this C&amp;C scrub says it&#x27;s good for daily use just as Aveeno&#x27;s does), but I will write a separate review under that product after I&#x27;ve used it more and can report more reliably.</li>
            <li> a good product that is not irritating, even with rosacea and has a clean non-offensive scent.</li>
            <li> Aveeno Positively Radiant scrub is easy on my skin yet also effective at brightening my skin tone.</li>
            <li> This is fine.</li>
            <li> It almost feels like you are rubbing fine grit sand on your face.  </li>
            <li> Works fine</li>
            <li> and my skin has reacted just fine.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used an exfoliant before or if you have very sensitive skin, this is probably a really good product for you.  </li>
            <li> it is good for people with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product, I love this product so much because one, I have very sensitive skin and even though it&#x27;s a scrub it doesn&#x27;t cause any kind of damage.</li>
            <li> you need a little but still dont think its handy great smell, gave it tree stars because i can do without it</li>
            <li> The best part is I only need the tiniest little bit and it lathers up and works great.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a huge fan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge Aveeno fan and will continue to use their lotions</li>
            <li> I never had a huge acne problem where my face would be covered with acne</li>
            <li> Description is relatively accurate.  </li>
            <li> Liked it so much.</li>
            <li> &quot; feeling on my face and my skin felt smooth to the touch after using it.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smoothly.  </li>
            <li> It feels like it has sand in it that works on your face to smooth out any roughness or dryness.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s been clearing up my light break outs.</li>
            <li> There are light scrubbing pieces like pieces of sugar that dissolve while in use</li>
            <li> It has a light scent, nothing perfume-y.</li>
            <li> That wasn&#x27;t available on Amazon Prime, so I figured I&#x27;d give this a try.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like the gritty feeling, this might be great for you.</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth and radiant.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> Removes age spots and gives skin a fabulous glow.  </li>
            <li> I love Aveeno and I heard so many good things about this cleanser, but I have to say it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> There are many Aveeno products I love and work very well.</li>
            <li> really loved using it .. it will make your face soft and day after day glowing ..</li>
            <li> It has a fine sandy texture which makes your face feel refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> Great daily scrub for your face, help to exfoliate the skin and clean your pores, I will buy this again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, as it keeps my face looking smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling smooth and clean but not stripped of all moisture.</li>
            <li> product does not have very much scent, which is very nice if you are sensitive to smells like I am.</li>
            <li> The smell was very much like chemicals instead of something refreshing.</li>
            <li> This is a great product though, the small beads are nice and definitely clean well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great mild exfoliant and doesn&#x27;t damage my fragile aging skin.</li>
            <li> With this routine, I have noticed a significant difference in the feel of my skin after I wash it.</li>
            <li> but and very pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this at Costco in a 3 pack.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling cool and smooth,</li>
            <li> Better than the popular St Ives scrub, this stuff tears off a layer of your skin while the aveeno actually \\&quot;exfoliates&#x27;.</li>
            <li> but it dont clean for s^&amp;t</li>
            <li> I sat there for a good 5 minutes, and it really didn&#x27;t do much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> By far my favorite face wash!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nothing special</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any brightening of my face nor does my skin feel like anything special after using it.  </li>
            <li> Love this and gentle on my skin</li>
            <li> It is gentle to you skin and not a wasteful product as so many are.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff, It hasnt really helped with the acne</li>
            <li> Good basic face wash.</li>
            <li> Good facial scrub.</li>
            <li> leaves face feeling fresh and light.</li>
            <li> It DOES make my skin seem clearer, fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face super clean.</li>
            <li> and my skin was much softer and just looked better.</li>
            <li> My skin feels nice and soft after using it.</li>
            <li> Also a good price for a big bottle!</li>
            <li> It has been the most gentle scrub I have found.</li>
            <li> i think it is a cheap, but it is useful and helpful.</li>
            <li> Good product, my second purchase</li>
            <li> It exfoliates gently and makes makeup application smooth and easy.</li>
            <li> What i was looking for: something to wash my face clean with a days worth of makeup while simultaneously evening out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Two it keeps my skin fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> It is great for taking off daily accumulated dirt, but it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate the skin as much as I want to.  </li>
            <li> I used hers at her house a few times and liked the way it made my skin feel, so I decided to buy one of my own.</li>
            <li> Just washing in the shower and rinsing did not seem adequate.</li>
            <li> i initially used cetaphil, but with time i realised it left my skin greasy, thats the reason i had to look for Aveeno which is perfect on all skin types n for all seasons too..</li>
            <li> had the option of giving only a 5 star, otherwise i would have given more :-)</li>
            <li> I purchased this scrub because I love most of the aveeno proucts, was in need of a facial scrub, and thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product, will purchase again in the future!</li>
            <li> notice any brightening.&lt;br /&gt;A mild scrub for allergic skin.</li>
            <li> Imhave since bought the st. Ives citrus mild scrub</li>
            <li> I think it would be too gentle to use, and the scrub is too fine to clean out everything.</li>
            <li> I like it very much!</li>
            <li> It has cleared it up a good deal, but not completely, yet.</li>
            <li> Good basic cleanser, I think it&#x27;s very gentle</li>
            <li> I think this cleanser is probably best for someone who has relatively few skin issues and mostly normal skin.</li>
            <li> I would recommend trying it out; It&#x27;s effective, cheap, and the tube lasts for a really long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a noticeable &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; in my skin tone, but my skin definitely feels better - feels clean and smooth after using the scrub.</li>
            <li> &quot; That was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I give the product two stars because I did like how it made my skin feel in general, especially right after using it.</li>
            <li> (definitely feels amazing</li>
            <li> it cleans in depth and helps to look fresh n</li>
            <li> I think this Clean &amp; Clear scrub is going to be what I was looking for and might recommend this to people who need a stronger scrub than Aveeno&#x27;s but a scrub that&#x27;s not TOO strong</li>
            <li> I love using this as it leaves my skin feeling really soft.</li>
            <li> Once I scrub it, feels fresh and this scrub did help me reduce and control acne.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t Aveeno pride themselves on being a more natural brand?</li>
            <li> This face wash leaves my face feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> Works great on preventing acne for my sensitive combination skin (not as well as Proactiv&#x27;s daily cleanser though).</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel and look more visibly soft.</li>
            <li> and so far I love it.</li>
            <li> I had the Oil of Olay daily face scrub and liked it.  </li>
            <li> I have tried multiple kind of face scrubs, soaps, cleansers but after running into this product never used anything else.</li>
            <li> but I had enough acne to get some kind of a face wash or scrub.</li>
            <li> so why would i go back to any other product once ive found a PERFECT one,</li>
            <li> only problem is that it&#x27;s not sulfate and paraben free, so for those very healthy conscious you might want to take a pass on this one.</li>
            <li> The pros about this product is that it is a great daily scrub, it doesn&#x27;t really have a strong odor, and 5 ounces actually last you a while if you use the correct amount.  </li>
            <li> i really feel that my face is really really clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and am very happy with it along with other Aveeno products!</li>
            <li> I love this face scrub - my skin is sensitive, so I can only use it every couple of days, but I do love the feeling after I have.</li>
            <li> Love Aveeno products in general.  </li>
            <li> The product also doesn&#x27;t really lather that well (unless maybe your face is soaked?), so I, personally, have to keep squeezing more out and wetting my face to get enough on as you need to rub this scrub in pretty good and for a while.     </li>
            <li> Then I go back over gently with a warm wash cloth, then rinse.</li>
            <li> Its super gentle on the skin and not overly exfoliating.</li>
            <li> It costs around $7-$8 a bottle, pretty much worth the higher price tag.    </li>
            <li> The actual cleansing portion is fairly gentle and smells nice.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice, gentle daily scrub.</li>
            <li> Does kind of dry my face out, so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not all that easy to find products as compatible as this with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> combined with the Aveeno pads, a daily moisturizer with SPF 15 UV protector in the morning, followed by this at night, seems to be doing the trick for keeping acne at bay and keeping her young face bright and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> face wash its all natural and good for all age types leaves your skin smooth and fades the dark spots.</li>
            <li> Even when i had no acne, I did like this scrub - good to use a scrub every once in a while to get those dead skin cells out of ur skin, right?</li>
            <li> Even though it contains micro beads, it is very gentle on skin.</li>
            <li> and it still works - very gentle and non-abrasive but yet exfoliates you will like this product.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle, but also you can feel it working.</li>
            <li> I have hyper-sensitive skin and often find myself allergic to products that others with sensitive skin find fine</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling soft, clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Keep it in the shower, use just a pinch and it quickly removes dirt and oils leaving skin ready for Aveeno Positively Radiant Moisturizer with SPF 15.  </li>
            <li> I rarely go for a facial kind of thing, I only put on facepacks at home once in a while, so this helps keeping my pores clean.</li>
            <li> This item works very well !</li>
            <li> The only thing I love about this product is the smell.  </li>
            <li> I love the Aveeno product but only buy it when it&#x27;s on sale.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> The reviews on this product are somewhat funny.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping as well!</li>
            <li> - I noticed a difference after about a week of consistent use.</li>
            <li> In fact, the reason I bought this product in the first place is that my mother has it and suggested it for my skin.</li>
            <li> but surely --&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely add this to my subscribe list&lt;br /&gt;yay&lt;br /&gt;Reena</li>
            <li> Since I started ordering this from Amazon, I found that the prices are much better on Amazon then in stores back home.</li>
            <li> ; that is part of why I&#x27;ve been able to use the same bottle for so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It not too rough, not too greasy and rinse off nicely.</li>
            <li> I love this daily face wash!  </li>
            <li> I love this daily scrub.</li>
            <li> Thanks Aveeno!</li>
            <li> and this is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> and it has not failed me since.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t get better after using for 2 weeks just to give it a proper chance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Simply put the words microbeads and pollution in your favorite search engine.</li>
            <li> My skin looks fresher and truly more radiant when I use it daily.</li>
            <li> Aveeno products are usually affordable and effective so I have a tendency to purchase products from a brand name that I am familiar with and have used before.</li>
            <li> I tried to find something that I liked after a particular soap was discontinued and it took me a long time to find this.</li>
            <li> I recently switched to the Aveeno Smart Essentials Detoxifying Scrub which in my opinion works better, but this may just be for my skin type.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s great (but when switching to a new face wash, they usually are all great for the first few weeks).</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve already moved on to another product to try and treat my acne and help with skin tone/texture, Clean &amp; Clear Oxygenating Scrub.</li>
            <li> I used this to take all of my make up off (not eye make up) and my skin felt clean and soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> It leaves my sensitive skin clean with no stinging feeling.  </li>
            <li> What really got my attention, was that right on front, it says \\&quot;gentle scrub to even skin tone and</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day along with the Aveeno Positively Radiant Moisturizer with SPF15</li>
            <li> I just wanted a gentle scrub that cleans my face, and this Aveeno scrub is exactly it.  </li>
            <li> I am willing to spend too much money on Bobbi Brown makeup, but this gem is all i need for washing it off at night.</li>
            <li> I just wish that this product helped more with minor breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The exfoliation is more gentle than most \\&quot;scrubs\\&quot; due to the very tiny beads.  </li>
            <li> Maybe you have to have a certain skin type to see results.</li>
            <li> This is my new daily face wash; I love it.</li>
            <li> I love aveeno products because it feels very natural and leaves me feeling the same way.  </li>
            <li> I tried the Aveeno Facial Cleanser, and it is smooth and comfortable, and I have been searching for a daily facial scrub for a long time, and it is good.</li>
            <li> Back to my Go 360 Clean Deep Exfoliating Scrub dependable product for the time being, until I feel safe trying a new product...</li>
            <li> Compare to most exfoliator, this wasn&#x27;t as rough on my face.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works for me</li>
            <li> I started using this product and finished the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care too much for face washes and stuff, and my acne was gone</li>
            <li> but my face looks and feels so much brighter after use.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even notice it that much.</li>
            <li> But I really like this Aveeno scrub</li>
            <li> I like the citrusy smell and the way it cleans gently.</li>
            <li> This worked very well for me.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t even use it that much (once a night)</li>
            <li> (wait, doesn&#x27;t that cover the whole year??)</li>
            <li> No matter how much lotion I use on my skin, I still have it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very mild face wash, so if you&#x27;re looking for a really deep deep clean, this might not be your wash.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t breaking out nearly as much as I was before</li>
            <li> need to use much of this product during&lt;br /&gt;the Winter ...</li>
            <li> My sis likes that it is so gentle.</li>
            <li> but it did work very well.</li>
            <li> Really improves skin.</li>
            <li> I think because it is so gentle.</li>
            <li> and I needed to find a gentle scrub</li>
            <li> I feel it really helps my moisturizer absorb.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t ready</li>
            <li> Our whole family uses this and loves it.</li>
            <li> - you can really feel the product cleaning your face.</li>
            <li> and I started breaking out and had so much redness I had to use lots of concealer.</li>
            <li> A gentle face cleanser that works well to remove make up.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> when it gets close to empty there is a good amount left in the tube that won&#x27;t squeeze out.</li>
            <li> The best part of it all is that I can use it daily without it irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that for people that wash their faces two times a day, this stuff goes pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> For example, I have not seen my skin \\&quot;brighten\\&quot; so much as look shiny/oily in certain spots, particularly my forehead.</li>
            <li> i neednt use a scrub again to either remove dead tissue or black heads or even tan.. for those with sensitive skin like mine, it is very mild n works great too.</li>
            <li> st.ives way better it would be really good if you don&#x27;t like a harsh scrub this is very little beads</li>
            <li> Sodium Hydroxide is, among many other industrial purposes, used to turn animal carcasses into pulp.</li>
            <li> They simply make my face feel clean and</li>
            <li> and I think it would be suitable for regular if not daily use.</li>
            <li> Only purchase this daily scrub if you can handle the assault of beautiful young twenty-something women that a young adonis must bare on an hourly basis.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed anything special, it&#x27;s only been about a week</li>
            <li> , i.e. itching/stinging sensation that just would not go away (this would go on for hours) and a raised spot, kind of like a small swelling.</li>
            <li> Good product though, not good if you don&#x27;t have acne though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dark skinned (love it) and have been washing my face with this cleanser since 2009.  </li>
            <li> Nice mild scent, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I even feel safe letting my toddler daughter use a little dab when she wants to be just like mommy.</li>
            <li> Leaves you feeling brand new!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the new formula as much.</li>
            <li> But this product has done more good than bad for me.</li>
            <li> I love the beads because they really help with exfoliating the dead skin/dirt.</li>
            <li> If more people are buying the product, it should be CHEAPER than more expensive.</li>
            <li> The main reason I got</li>
            <li> Seems to do a decent job.</li>
            <li> Washing my face with this feels fresh and not dry.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream, it makes my face very soft.</li>
            <li> While some face washes have rough exfoliants, the Skin Brightening Daily Scrub has the perfect combination of cleanser and small beads.</li>
            <li> more a few drop is enough for full face..</li>
            <li> I am having a little more acne, but since I have been using a whole lot of new products, it might be because of something else.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> and I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Since high school I used Clean &amp; Clear Daily Pore Cleanser which worked well, but the store did not have any in stock the day I went to buy some.</li>
            <li> But when I tried this product for the first time, I gently buffed away the dry spots on my face, leaving it extremely smooth even the next morning.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin though and it did not continually keep it smooth.</li>
            <li> I wish it were a little more scrubby</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I was looking for, but it is a great scrub for gentle skin because the beads are so small.</li>
            <li> B004D247SC Aveeno Smart Essentials Scrub]], since the latter is a little more gentle on the skin for when you don&#x27;t need much exfoliation.</li>
            <li> , skin feels INCREDIBLY soft (even my hands), don&#x27;t have to use much to rub it on your face and feel it working, etc.</li>
            <li> But that is what makes this a gentle cleanser for those who have sensitive skin or don&#x27;t like the feel of grit when they are washing their face.  </li>
            <li> Really brightens the face, but is not harsh.  </li>
            <li> It has these tiny tiny beads that gently scrub your skin and just make your face feel so smooth after washing.</li>
            <li> Though I really do love aveeno products, there are a few cons.  </li>
            <li> I can see how big/harsh beads can irritate some people&#x27;s skin, and I&#x27;ve seen reviews of this product where many people have mentioned a scrub by St. Ives as an example of a harsh scrub.</li>
            <li> Its really worth paying the extra couple of dollars.  </li>
            <li> More harsh and drying than I thought it&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li> I normally use this product during the Summer,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> Few scrubs are better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> However, it did make my face feel a little dry and not as bright</li>
            <li> It is a bit drying you should moisturizer right after using it if possible.</li>
            <li> But without some kind of a facial lotion product it does have a chance of drying your skin, especially if you have sensitive skin such as myself.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I use this product and all the other aveeno products and they are fantastic.</li>
            <li> so I never got around to buying a new one.</li>
            <li> I want to try out a new product.</li>
            <li> I now live in Costa Rica and this is the one item I HAVE to have from the States.</li>
            <li> Light weight cleanser, scent is neither good nor bad.</li>
            <li> --I believe that this product is mainly for those with sensitive skin, and that&#x27;s what they should advertise so the rest of us can save our money.</li>
            <li> For my skin which tends to be oily and gets rough patches if I use the wrong soap, this is excellent.</li>
            <li> As far as brightening goes, it didn&#x27;t really help with that either, but I have had freckles since I was 5 years old</li>
            <li> I really like it because it is a gentle exfoliant; it doesn&#x27;t screw up my skin with daily use.</li>
            <li> I will say though, I have very sensitive redness prone skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> so I am very sensitive to all these kinds of products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very gentle and truly is a scrub that can be used daily.</li>
            <li> I really hate when companies find a lovely product and then just price it higher because they know people love the product so much</li>
            <li> First of all, some others here mention the smaller beads.</li>
            <li> Pain and irritation are evident within 3 minutes, but contact with dilute solutions may not cause symptoms for several hours.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with it!</li>
            <li> I also love the small microbeads in it to exfoliate my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday to gently exfoliate and clean my skin.</li>
            <li> Smells great, leaves skin feeling fresh, however pretty expensive for a small amount.  </li>
            <li> We have tried all different types of face cleansers like clean and clear, st Ives, Neutrogena, cetaphil, Nivea, Olay, Biore,  Loreal....but finally stopped at this one.</li>
            <li> It may have wiped the makeup off, but i think my face looks less smooth than it did before i started this product.  </li>
            <li> This product does dry my skin a little after a wash, but the body uses its own oils to counteract that dryness and makes that dryness feel fade after 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Seldom used, Aveeno positively radiant skin brightening daily scrub.  </li>
            <li> It cleans the same and pretty much IS the same product.    </li>
            <li> , well I never labeled my skin as sensitive, but after using this product I do not know how people with sensitive skin can use this product!</li>
            <li> I got some hydrocortisone cream &amp; only used a mild soap to cleanse area &amp; a week later my face is healed....</li>
            <li> the tube appears half full when new.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this product half the price as it was in the stores, so I bought 2!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t super smelly like other face washes.  </li>
            <li> Other studies acknowledge Sodium Hydroxide as a strong irritant that is corrosive to the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract, but that the severity of the effects are related directly to concentration and pH levels, as well as the length of exposure and skin type.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I didnt really think at that time that this product was actually improving my skin and got rid of my acne, instead i just chalked it up to my hormone problems being fixed and the scars fading by themselves.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough for my sensitive skin to use every day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product and Aveeno clear complexion moisturizer for about two weeks.</li>
            <li> Ive used this product before but couldnt find it in the stores near me since ive moved.</li>
            <li> Supposedly this is for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This film is a shattering powerhouse of emotion but crafted in such a way as to gently pull the rug from under your feet and place a cushion under your bott as you come to rest.</li>
            <li> This film is a shattering powerhouse of emotion but crafted in such a way as to gently pull the rug from under your feet and place a cushion under your bott as you come to rest.</li>
            <li> Frankly, I am surprised to see Aveeno still offers this product.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so soft and it evens out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Maybe its the fact that I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> it could be that maybe I didn&#x27;t wash it off completely.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think any old drugstore cleanser is going to help with them.</li>
            <li> My esthetician recommended that I use a exfoliant on my face, and after using this product regularly, she really noticed an improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> This product has such tiny exfoliating beads that it really doesn&#x27;t seem to have much of an exfoliating effect when used.</li>
            <li> for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 30 yr old male with sensitive skin and it has been serving its purpose very well.</li>
            <li> It leaves a soft glow to her skin and her face never feels oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After exfoliating with it, my face feels baby soft.</li>
            <li> No complaints so far</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive, combination skin and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for months now, and I still can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s actually working or not.</li>
            <li> daughter doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Gentle enough to use every day</li>
            <li> early 20s</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d have brighter skin, but so far I have not seen a difference</li>
            <li> Delivery of this item was professional.</li>
            <li> I really like this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> It works well and my skin feels soft &amp; refreshed.</li>
            <li> Thanks Aveeno, you are the only company I have</li>
            <li> We need to regularly exfoliate our faces, to remove the dead cells, and make our skin able to absorb the skin care products we apply.  </li>
            <li> Goes soft &amp; smooth on your face and within a few weeks you will see the difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using this daily scrub for a few months now and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> This does the exact opposite, my face doesn&#x27;t feel dry after using it and it has a certain glow to my skin after using it.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I was surprised it had tiny tiny beads.</li>
            <li> Positively works well as daily facial scrub to gently remove daily sunscreen applications.</li>
            <li> Only one earth on which to live!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had acne and had mild to moderate amount of acne scars on my face as well, with daily use for several months</li>
            <li> Just a little dab of this will easily cover your face and I find one bottle lasting me over a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am currently 39 weeks pregnant and have not really had any issues with acne/pimples...until now.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t that strong or harsh yet has enough granules to feel like its working.</li>
            <li> Some people, like my brother, prefer the large beads in a facial scrub, but I like the smaller beads in this one.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a light daily cleaner that gave me a little bit of exfoliation and wasn&#x27;t overly fragrant.</li>
            <li> i suddenly started to get acne in the humid weather where i live.</li>
            <li> Even dry skin responds to this gentle &#x27;body scrub.&#x27;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a very short amount of time, but I can already note some key differences--bigger beads, a much nicer feel after using it</li>
            <li> Does leave my skin soft and this time of year, my natural oils lubricate my skin enough</li>
            <li> you only need just a little bit, and my face feels much cleaner than with higher end products.</li>
            <li> , I just wish it were in a larger oz bottle rather than having to order a bunch of small ones, but it does last quite a while if you don&#x27;t use more than you need (like i tend to do)</li>
            <li> Contact with the eye may produce pain and irritation, and in severe cases, clouding of the eye and blindness.\\&quot; Solutions as weak as .12% have shown to destruct healthy skin cells within one hour.</li>
            <li> and I notice a major improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> It did not exfoliate as well as I hoped, but it worked well with my skin and did not cause any major breakouts.</li>
            <li> Recommended for normal, dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This face wash is great, but microbeads have been shown to be bad for the ecosystem, so I really feel bad giving it a good review.</li>
            <li> Does not make my face feel clean one bit, actually feels a little slippery/greasy&lt;</li>
            <li> and I used it for a month and a half and used more than half the bottle.</li>
            <li> My previous face wash was clinique, spent around $50 for the whole set, and my skin never felt right.</li>
            <li> But again, it makes it a little dry, but if you use it once a week, you should be fine.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning in the shower, along with the other Positively Radiant items.</li>
            <li> and I generally like this product.  </li>
            <li> I used my regular body wash to clean off the tape residue, still left black marks.  </li>
            <li> - you can barely tell they&#x27;re there</li>
            <li> Had no trouble with any others from different brands.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin, so this prouct seemed like the obvious</li>
            <li> and now I am in physical therapy from having to bed 30-40 young phillies nightly.</li>
            <li> I am almost 30, and my skin is definitely transitioning from the youthful, bounces-back-easily skin of my early 20&#x27;s to something....not so easily-bouncing-back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well it will work on customers that have a severe acne (may need something stronger) but those who have sensitive skin, this product is definitely  worth trying.</li>
            <li> However, unless you have that problem of most scrubs irritating your skin, the seemingly non-existent beads in this product are just not going to get the job done on your skin...</li>
            <li> At its price, now I&#x27;m kind of sorry I did.</li>
            <li> The tiny little beads are very soothing and not annoying like a lot of other daily scrubs.  </li>
            <li> I need to buy a deep moisturizing creme and a new daily scrub.</li>
            <li> and with that a whole new round of scars.</li>
            <li> It can be used daily while taking shower and doesn&#x27;t dry the skin that much.</li>
            <li> I am constantly aware of skin&#x27;s condition and there is a slight burning sensation.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything scientific about the two (I haven&#x27;t exactly done any controlled studies comparing the actual outcomes of the two...), but I just prefer the feel of the other.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really help with acne, but then again it&#x27;s not really supposed to!</li>
            <li> The small beads are not too rough on the skin and the smell makes it that much more pleasurable to use, but I&#x27;m still uncertain if it actually does what it insists.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product, especially if you have sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li> Second, this product claims to do some things I don&#x27;t think it does, or maybe--again--it only does it for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this facewash for about a week, so I am not sure of the true properties of it.</li>
            <li> I do not need lotion as this product does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a decent scrub minus the brightening.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin at all</li>
            <li> It was a little bit drying at first, but I don&#x27;t have any issues with it now.</li>
            <li> Even if the face wash is causing the acne, only a little bit has showed and so worth it, and it may be different with you anyways.</li>
            <li> and I like the super tiny beads; they don&#x27;t hurt your face and they aren&#x27;t rough like some other scrubs.</li>
            <li> Others around the same price i had to use a ton to get my face clean because it was so thick.</li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t help my dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It does make my skin dry, which is easily fixed by some lotion afterwards.</li>
            <li> my deep dark very noticeable acne marks are almost invisible.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that is also very dry, this product caused my face to get red</li>
            <li> The product occasionally would come out in large clumps, which would make a mess on the sink or in the shower.</li>
            <li> It does help to get rid of any blemishes on the skin, I had few, but the few I have (had) are pretty much gone now.  </li>
            <li> However, I have to echo the sentiments of other reviewers and say that the beads are just a skosh too small to really fit my requirements in a scrub.</li>
            <li> I also have very dry, sensitive</li>
            <li> My complexion has already improved (got a little too much sun this year).</li>
            <li> I stopped using this product immediately due to this was the only thing new I put on my skin....</li>
            <li> I walked away from it to use other scrubs because I wanted something new, but I always came back to it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and tend to get red and blotchy with other face washes.</li>
            <li> Small but persistent dry patches on my face are magically disappearing in only a few weeks of daily morning washes!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 29 year old active male with moderately oily skin</li>
            <li> thing I will note is that this tends to be a tad harsh for normal skin - especially during the winter months.  </li>
            <li> My skin: No serious acne problems, just uneven skin tone    </li>
            <li> Left skin soft initially, but after a few days left skin feeling too moist/oily</li>
            <li> For some reason, if you have a pimple and use this scrub, it might go away for a few days, but then it comes back, and will feel like a brand new pimple.</li>
            <li> and this seems to be the only product that doesn&#x27;t turn my face red, leave a film, or over dry it.  </li>
            <li> It also helped my acne although I&#x27;m not sure if it is really meant for that.</li>
            <li> I really like the small microbeads</li>
            <li> This product is generally not working for me.    </li>
            <li> Personally, I like the scrubbing grains to be a little tiny bit bigger, these are REALLY tiny and almost not noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle, the beads are small and granular compared to other scrubs.</li>
            <li> I have to scrub a bit harder in problematic areas to feel like i cleaned the area well enough.  </li>
            <li> Everything in moderation goes a long way with the body in helping remain chemically balanced.  </li>
            <li> or maybe it will, but it will take a long time.    </li>
            <li> Buf-Pufs are designed to completely remove dead skin cells, dirt and oil by pulling them away from the skin (I bought mine on Amazon for around $3).</li>
            <li> The regular is way too rough.</li>
            <li> This has been the only facial scrub that has just the right amount of grit without hurting or feeling useless but also improves the redness on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I usually try new face cleaning products.</li>
            <li> After using this we never went back to any other face cleanser.</li>
            <li> Will probably go back to my other cleanser.</li>
            <li> Aveeno has other facial products for cleansing but this is the one that causes no issues.</li>
            <li> I have gone through periods of time where I stop using it and use some other product, but I always come back to this.</li>
            <li> I have combination/sensitive skin (oily in t-zone then dry).</li>
            <li> My skin is sometimes dry sometimes oily ...</li>
            <li> This face wash doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin dry and didn&#x27;t brighten it at all.</li>
            <li> allergy season and the dry months</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your face overly dry.</li>
            <li> or if you have dry skin like me.</li>
            <li> and it would feel dry and stingy afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling too dry either.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 2 days and so far, my acne has worsen and my skin has been feeling itchy.</li>
            <li> Surprised me because usually I prefer Aveeno.</li>
            <li> I have dry patches on my face!  </li>
            <li> However, now I&#x27;m 27 and twice a month I seem to break out for a few days and some products I&#x27;ve used in the past really dries out my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my face very dry, but dry enough to want to put on a little moisturizer on my face.  </li>
            <li> I wish the beads were a little bigger.</li>
            <li> I started to use this scrub daily evening after i go home form work - by this time my face becomes oily, shiny and a little itchy with my acne.</li>
            <li> I like it because it only squirts out a little bit of product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to feel like I&#x27;m really getting exfoliated.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because when I was younger I use to use other face washes that were too rough.  </li>
            <li> Before this I wasn&#x27;t using any soap on my face, I just never really had any problems with acne.  </li>
            <li> Definitely making a difference lightening marks and uneven tone.</li>
            <li> I am only using it now a few time a week rather than twice a day.</li>
            <li> Its rare that you feel it, but when you do it feels wrong because its not throughout the product.</li>
            <li> I expected wonders from peoples reviews.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with my skin and getting age spots (I am only 28...</li>
            <li> I have pale, sensitive, combination skin, and I found that this face scrub is not too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve started to notice that the scars are fading away, not completely gone but much less visible than before.</li>
            <li> I bought this at the same time as a few other cleansers to test them all out.</li>
            <li> It can also be used in combination with other products, where as other facial scrubs might be too harsh for combination with anything else in the day.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I also like that a little dab of this product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The little granules are gentle enough that it does not tear up your skin, and it does exfoliate well and moisturize so that your skin does not get angry at you.  </li>
            <li> I have been using practiv for years and have tried several times to switch to something less harsh.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it and their other lotions and cleansers.</li>
            <li> and my face would be extremely oily.  </li>
            <li> For the past two months, I have had various break outs on my face.</li>
            <li> The other day I was thinking why i started getting acne again, and then came to the conclusion that i stopped using this product</li>
            <li> I have used this scrub for the last five days, and I use it once every time I shower, which is usually 2 times a day (morning and night-after workouts).  </li>
            <li> Other than the fact that it was supposed to lighten my skin, there are no cons to using this product.</li>
            <li> And you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> Cannot vouch about the radiant skin or any other skin benefits other than this product cleans your face.</li>
            <li> If you have one, don&#x27;t buy the other...</li>
            <li> The beads are non-irritating, and do not scratch my face like other exfoliants.</li>
            <li> small opening for a big package</li>
            <li> I use this and other aveeno products a lot.  </li>
            <li> during the Summer, every other day.</li>
            <li> Each time it lasts me about 6 months, b/c it takes such a small amount to do the job.</li>
            <li> I have used Aveeno products for many years and have never been disappointed with them.</li>
            <li> Also leaves no residue/filmy feeling, which is something I couldn&#x27;t stand with other face washes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used any other Aveeno products before and no one I know uses the products.</li>
            <li> This works well, but it&#x27;s really thin, similar to standard body wash.  </li>
            <li> tried about ten other brands before aveeno and they left my skin extremely dry and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> * Wet face, and you just need a LITTLE BIT.  </li>
            <li> noticed brighter skin and fading of dark spots as result of pimples...</li>
            <li> I have noticed my skin has gotten somewhat flakey lately, and the texture needed a boost, and i also have a sort of red t-zone.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product when I came across it to see how well it works since everything else that I have tried tend to dry my face out and make it feel tight and stiff.</li>
            <li> The sand is very small that I can sue it daily as it says.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I tried Aveeno and it has disappointed me immensely and harmed my face.</li>
            <li> Aside from that slight inflammation, it&#x27;s as if the product does nothing but moisturizes my face, not exfoliate it.    </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t seem to find something that&#x27;s about half way between this and the super-rough St. Ives</li>
            <li> came opened and half used...</li>
            <li> and this made my skin feel less oily.</li>
            <li> my&lt;br /&gt;skin has less oil on the surface, but I&#x27;m finding</li>
            <li> It does seem to even your skin tone if you have slight</li>
            <li> Since using this product, I&#x27;ve noticed less breakouts and less red/patchy spots.</li>
            <li> I have dark skin and tons of acne marks-mostly hyperpigmentation, and a little bit of acne that was on its way out of my life but kept holding on.</li>
            <li> I have dry and dull skin</li>
            <li> If I could correctly spell exfoliant so the little spellcheck would not underline it, I would say &amp;#34;good exfolient.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I seen a little results in two nights of using it</li>
            <li> I like that it has a little texture to it for exfoliation, but isn&#x27;t like sandpaper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little while</li>
            <li> but you get a little bit of a scrub.</li>
            <li> Another thing is I do have uneven skin tone and texture, and it is not doing a thing for that.</li>
            <li> I used this every day and with in a few weeks could see the difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday sometimes a twice a day.</li>
            <li> so it does not feel harsh</li>
            <li> I have used it weekly and have even used it a few days in a row</li>
            <li> I have uneven skin tone around the mouth area and its gotten a lot lighter.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using it for a few months now, I don&#x27;t think any issues will come of it.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and do not need lotion or anything else when using this product.</li>
            <li> My skin actually gets worse from using this.</li>
            <li> I decided to take a break from my usual face wash, Cerave, because I had been using it for a few years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smoother and looks less dull.</li>
            <li> I used on lower part of my face &amp; neck and a week later got a painful red rash on chin &amp; around my mouth.</li>
            <li> A small dab  and water will do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to see a small change</li>
            <li> Not sure about its exfoliating power however.</li>
            <li> That might seem like a small concern.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure I can tell the difference between the foam cleanser and this scrub.</li>
            <li> Because they are so small (micro) sewage systems cannot filter them out.</li>
            <li> (though \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; is a bit of an overstatement considering how small the beads are).</li>
            <li> bit of an odd smell- not strong, just not particularly pleasant.</li>
            <li> Aveeno needs to toss this one because the results (zero) make you feel like you are either not sure</li>
            <li> I have dry/average skin that breaks out in small spots 1-2 times a month.</li>
            <li> The scrub did not live up to my expectations, no brightening of skin, didnt feel it cleansed well enough :(</li>
            <li> I want to find the ONE that makes my face radiant or at least I see result &#x3D;-)</li>
            <li> The negative reviews say that it doesn&#x27;t help their acne.  </li>
            <li> Boring I went back to my old face wash and gave this to my niece.</li>
            <li> I  have discoloration on my cheek and it disappear slowly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, and I&#x27;m just not happy.</li>
            <li> When I mean</li>
            <li> and I felt that it did give my skin an overall &#x27;dewy&#x27; effect (not to be confused with oily!!).</li>
            <li> The beads in the scrub are also very small.  </li>
            <li> The beads are very small which I prefer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay the ridiculous prices at the drug stores.  </li>
            <li> This merely felt dirty, like someone accidentally mixed a small amount of beach sand in it.</li>
            <li> It is just frustrating because sometimes they can be so expensive in comparing to other products.  </li>
            <li> I used to have a bad problem with acne when I was a teen, but after puberty ended, my acne problem went away.  </li>
            <li> BUT, overall, I&#x27;m just disappointed.</li>
            <li> Usually a pimple will come, be ugly for a few days, then go away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely confused as to whats going on with that.</li>
            <li> I just recently moved away to college and my skin got soooo bad from all the bad unhealthy food!</li>
            <li> What it did: i&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks now, and i&#x27;m not impressed at all.  </li>
            <li> I would not have mind if I did not see results, rather than feeling like I am had a chemical peel gone horribly wrong.     </li>
            <li> It has a weird consistency but it does work</li>
            <li> but unfortunately, this is not for me.</li>
            <li> Being someone who has had horrible skin for the last 18 years aveeno products have always been a life saver</li>
            <li> Cannot even explain what was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Wife wanted to try this, and she is not impressed.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m really not impressed with the scrub.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Aveeno.</li>
            <li> The skin looks like the stale layer of skin has been removed.</li>
            <li> They are terribly destructive to our waters and fisheries.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t get mad if it doesn&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> I have never used a bad Aveeno product.  </li>
            <li> I was sadly disappointed.</li>
            <li> However, considering the reasons I purchased this product, I would have to say I&#x27;m disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> So disappointed to find out this product has plastic microbeads.</li>
            <li> fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible.  </li>
            <li> Worst of all is that this scrub is like a gel, and I prefer scrubs that are like a cream.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Compare to most exfoliator, this wasn&#x27;t as rough on my face. I didn&#x27;t notice any brightening effects after using up the entire bottle. It did leave my skin softer and feeling cleaner after.</li>
            <li> If I could correctly spell exfoliant so the little spellcheck would not underline it, I would say &amp;#34;good exfolient.&amp;#34;  Nope. Not the e. Anyway, I digress. The little granules are gentle enough that it does not tear up your skin, and it does exfoliate well and moisturize so that your skin does not get angry at you.  You can use it daily.  Aveeno is so good with all of their products and this is one of their best, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Great daily scrub for your face, help to exfoliate the skin and clean your pores, I will buy this again</li>
            <li> I like it I seen a little results in two nights of using it</li>
            <li> Ive used this product before but couldnt find it in the stores near me since ive moved. I love it* I have scars from acne and it has always done the job to lighten it up. It takes awhile but keep with it, youll definitely see a difference. Also pair it with Ambi Fade cream as a moisturizer</li>
            <li> Better than the popular St Ives scrub, this stuff tears off a layer of your skin while the aveeno actually \\&quot;exfoliates&#x27;. I recommend it and their other lotions and cleansers.</li>
            <li> This facewash makes my face so incredible smooth. I use this every time I shower and putting on my makeup afterwards feels wonderful because my face feels so refreshed and soft!</li>
            <li> Made my skin look smoother and younger.</li>
            <li> everytime i use this product i really feel that my face is really really clean.</li>
            <li> This item works very well !</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for last 3 years. This is one of the best face cleanser you can buy in this class and price range. Even though it contains micro beads, it is very gentle on skin. It is good for the most sensitive skin. We have tried all different types of face cleansers like clean and clear, st Ives, Neutrogena, cetaphil, Nivea, Olay, Biore,  Loreal....but finally stopped at this one. After using this we never went back to any other face cleanser. It can be used daily while taking shower and doesn&#x27;t dry the skin that much. We love this product and use it every day.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t super smelly like other face washes.  It cleans my face without drying my skin out too.  I have been using practiv for years and have tried several times to switch to something less harsh.  Everything seems to make my face break out again, but this seems to be doing the trick.  Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have oily, oily, oily skin.  I would wash my face with this scrub, go to bed and then wake-up and my face would be extremely oily.  It&#x27;s like my oily glands went into overdrive.  I didn&#x27;t notice any of the skin brightening claims.  The only thing I love about this product is the smell.  I love the smell and that&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li> Love this and gentle on my skin</li>
            <li> I am currently 39 weeks pregnant and have not really had any issues with acne/pimples...until now. For the past two months, I have had various break outs on my face. Since high school I used Clean &amp; Clear Daily Pore Cleanser which worked well, but the store did not have any in stock the day I went to buy some. So I decided to try Aveeno Skin Brightening Daily Scrub. It&#x27;s a bit more expensive, but it was all there was.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for two weeks now daily and several nights a week before bed. I first rub it in using small circular motions with the pads of my fingers, all around my face. Then I go back over gently with a warm wash cloth, then rinse. I love the beads because they really help with exfoliating the dead skin/dirt. With this routine, I have noticed a significant difference in the feel of my skin after I wash it. I have combination/sensitive skin (oily in t-zone then dry). Most of the bumps are gone and my face FEELS clean. Not oily or with residue like with some soaps. Hopefully in a months time, my skin will be back to \\&quot;normal\\&quot;. Hope this review helps someone!</li>
            <li> This face wash is great, but microbeads have been shown to be bad for the ecosystem, so I really feel bad giving it a good review. Purchased a three pack at Costco and am just starting the third face wash. Its super gentle on the skin and not overly exfoliating. The scent is quite neutral and doesn&#x27;t overdry my skin. That all being said, I personally won&#x27;t be purchasing this item again. Only one earth on which to live!</li>
            <li> I love this scrub.  I think it is some of the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It is gentle to you skin and not a wasteful product as so many are.  A small dab  and water will do.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. This stuff really works for me</li>
            <li> price is better than Costco.</li>
            <li> My skin: No serious acne problems, just uneven skin tone    What i was looking for: something to wash my face clean with a days worth of makeup while simultaneously evening out my skin tone.  Also, minimize any marks i had on my face.    What it did: i&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks now, and i&#x27;m not impressed at all.  It may have wiped the makeup off, but i think my face looks less smooth than it did before i started this product.  It has not evened out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> noticed brighter skin and fading of dark spots as result of pimples... good product</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use any soap without irritation and this does a great job removing makeup and leaves my skin soft and feeling refreshed. Best one and I have tried many.</li>
            <li> I used to have a bad problem with acne when I was a teen, but after puberty ended, my acne problem went away.  I just wanted a gentle scrub that cleans my face, and this Aveeno scrub is exactly it.  I love aveeno products because it feels very natural and leaves me feeling the same way.  The pros about this product is that it is a great daily scrub, it doesn&#x27;t really have a strong odor, and 5 ounces actually last you a while if you use the correct amount.  Though I really do love aveeno products, there are a few cons.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my face very dry, but dry enough to want to put on a little moisturizer on my face.  The beads in the scrub are also very small.  It is great for taking off daily accumulated dirt, but it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate the skin as much as I want to.  I have to scrub a bit harder in problematic areas to feel like i cleaned the area well enough.  Another warning, like some reviewers already mentioned.. DO NOT GET THE BEADS IN YOUR EYE.  It actually tore my contacts once because I was trying to rub the bead out.  I would recommend this product for every day use, and use something stronger or a mud mask once a week to get the more difficult things off.  If you have a bigger issue with acne, I would not recommend this. I think it would be too gentle to use, and the scrub is too fine to clean out everything.</li>
            <li> This is fine. I wish the beads were a little bigger. It&#x27;s tough to feel like I&#x27;m really getting exfoliated. But the smell is nice.</li>
            <li> I generally love all Aveeno products. This product is wonderful. It smells great, the texture is wonderful and it cleans pretty well. The only problem is that for people that wash their faces two times a day, this stuff goes pretty quickly. It costs around $7-$8 a bottle, pretty much worth the higher price tag.    However, Target (a Midwestern Store) carries their own brand that remakes the product for a cheaper price. Their version is $2-$3 cheaper, smells THE SAME, and almost the same texture (the scrub is slightly bigger). It cleans the same and pretty much IS the same product.    I love the Aveeno product but only buy it when it&#x27;s on sale. Otherwise it&#x27;s the Target Brand. I really hate when companies find a lovely product and then just price it higher because they know people love the product so much, they&#x27;ll spend the money. Why should consumers have to pay for that? It makes no sense! If more people are buying the product, it should be CHEAPER than more expensive.</li>
            <li> I usually try new face cleaning products. I want to find the ONE that makes my face radiant or at least I see result &#x3D;-) This is the first time I tried Aveeno and it has disappointed me immensely and harmed my face. I would not have mind if I did not see results, rather than feeling like I am had a chemical peel gone horribly wrong.     Supposedly this is for sensitive skin, well I never labeled my skin as sensitive, but after using this product I do not know how people with sensitive skin can use this product! I only use the product twice. I have already experience both skin irritation and dryness, mostly around my lips and nose. I am constantly aware of skin&#x27;s condition and there is a slight burning sensation. I stopped using it and I am now trying to put face creme but it only makes the burning sensation feel stronger. I need to buy a deep moisturizing creme and a new daily scrub. Back to my Go 360 Clean Deep Exfoliating Scrub dependable product for the time being, until I feel safe trying a new product...</li>
            <li> Not for me. It broke me out.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference the first time I used it.  My skin would glow after each use.</li>
            <li> I jst loved it! My skin is sometimes dry sometimes oily ... it cleans in depth and helps to look fresh n brightens da skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not pleased with this product. I used on lower part of my face &amp; neck and a week later got a painful red rash on chin &amp; around my mouth. I stopped using this product immediately due to this was the only thing new I put on my skin....I got some hydrocortisone cream &amp; only used a mild soap to cleanse area &amp; a week later my face is healed....Don&#x27;t use on face....never will I buy again</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible.  It makes my skin break out because it leaves a waxy residue on your face after you wash it off that clogs my pores.  Also, the \\&quot;microbeads\\&quot; are a joke - you can barely tell they&#x27;re there and they don&#x27;t help exfoliate at all.  Worst of all is that this scrub is like a gel, and I prefer scrubs that are like a cream.  To top it off, it does not \\&quot;brighten\\&quot; or even out my skin tone at all.  I would not buy this garbage again.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! As you get older it seems there are so many things you have to do to keep your skin looking good. This product is one of my tools.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this facewash for about a week, so I am not sure of the true properties of it. So far it&#x27;s great (but when switching to a new face wash, they usually are all great for the first few weeks). I love the smell- it light and yummy.  I like that it has a little texture to it for exfoliation, but isn&#x27;t like sandpaper.</li>
            <li> I have dark skin and tons of acne marks-mostly hyperpigmentation, and a little bit of acne that was on its way out of my life but kept holding on. I started using this product and finished the whole bottle. I don&#x27;t really care too much for face washes and stuff, and my acne was gone and so were most of my scars so I never got around to buying a new one. My acne is BACK! and with that a whole new round of scars. I didnt really think at that time that this product was actually improving my skin and got rid of my acne, instead i just chalked it up to my hormone problems being fixed and the scars fading by themselves. The other day I was thinking why i started getting acne again, and then came to the conclusion that i stopped using this product so I am definitely adding this product to my daily regimen.   So, I can say that it did actually fade my scars overtime. It also helped my acne although I&#x27;m not sure if it is really meant for that. It was just a bonus for me. I would definitely recommend this product, especially if you have sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I&#x27;ve used it for years and I&#x27;m a huge fan.</li>
            <li> I have used this scrub for the last five days, and I use it once every time I shower, which is usually 2 times a day (morning and night-after workouts).  Before this I wasn&#x27;t using any soap on my face, I just never really had any problems with acne.  This product has been pretty good, it does what it says it does.  It has made my skin shiny in a good way.  The main reason I got it was to exfoliate my skin and as a simple wash for sweat and dirt.  I was skeptical at first because when I was younger I use to use other face washes that were too rough.  This product does dry my skin a little after a wash, but the body uses its own oils to counteract that dryness and makes that dryness feel fade after 20 minutes.  It does help to get rid of any blemishes on the skin, I had few, but the few I have (had) are pretty much gone now.  The reviews on this product are somewhat funny.  The negative reviews say that it doesn&#x27;t help their acne.  I can&#x27;t say if it does or doesn&#x27;t but one must remember it isn&#x27;t all about the soap, it&#x27;s the body also being in chemical balance.  Everything in moderation goes a long way with the body in helping remain chemically balanced.  This is a great product though, the small beads are nice and definitely clean well.  For example, I work outside during the day and after a 9 hour shift outside I had dirt and electrical tape residue on my fingers.  I used my regular body wash to clean off the tape residue, still left black marks.  When I applied the scrub to my hands and fingers, off went the residue.  It is a good product, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I want to try out a new product. I have used olay. It was the best one. I wanted to  try something different. So I gave this one a try. I have liked it. I would use this for now. It is cheaper at amazon. Liked it so much. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This film is a shattering powerhouse of emotion but crafted in such a way as to gently pull the rug from under your feet and place a cushion under your bott as you come to rest. Box of tissues essential. A gem</li>

            <li> Love Aveeno products! Fast shipping as well!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, It hasnt really helped with the acne but my face looks and feels so much brighter after use.</li>
            <li> stop using this product - it contains microbeads.  Please go to beatthemicrobeaddotorg</li>
            <li> my favorite face wash ever. tried about ten other brands before aveeno and they left my skin extremely dry and uncomfortable. aveeno has improved my skin condition and i&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years now</li>
            <li> I love this face scrub - my skin is sensitive, so I can only use it every couple of days, but I do love the feeling after I have.</li>
            <li> This face wash doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. It has cleared it up a good deal, but not completely, yet. I&#x27;ve only used it a week but and very pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li> this is the best scrub i have ecer used perfect fargrance and it works as it says. your skin feels great the granules in scrub are really cool</li>
            <li> I started using this product about 4-5 months ago and I must say, I love this scrub! Its better than most scrubs I&#x27;ve used. Its gentle on skin, beads are very fine and it doesnt irritate my skin, smells heavenly and best of all, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out nor makes it more oily. I&#x27;ve always had acne and had mild to moderate amount of acne scars on my face as well, with daily use for several months, I&#x27;ve started to notice that the scars are fading away, not completely gone but much less visible than before. Will definitely repurchase this! Also, price is great and a lasts a good while.</li>
            <li> Definitely making a difference lightening marks and uneven tone. It has a weird consistency but it does work - I noticed a difference after about a week of consistent use. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> a good product that is not irritating, even with rosacea and has a clean non-offensive scent. the tube appears half full when new. when it gets close to empty there is a good amount left in the tube that won&#x27;t squeeze out.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  As described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 29 year old active male with moderately oily skin and I generally like this product.  The exfoliation is more gentle than most \\&quot;scrubs\\&quot; due to the very tiny beads.  It almost feels like you are rubbing fine grit sand on your face.  The actual cleansing portion is fairly gentle and smells nice.  Just a little dab of this will easily cover your face and I find one bottle lasting me over a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I will note is that this tends to be a tad harsh for normal skin - especially during the winter months.  I like to mix usage of this with [[ASIN:B004D247SC Aveeno Smart Essentials Scrub]], since the latter is a little more gentle on the skin for when you don&#x27;t need much exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Delivery and packaging time was excellent.  This Aveeno product has given wonderful facials without causing any redness or irritation.  I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I used to use this product a couple of years ago but stopped after concerns about plastic beads hurting our water system. Since the product was reformulated I tried it again. Works fine but the scent is WAY too strong. Not what I remember. Will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> This makes your skin feel great</li>
            <li> It is alright, but, it dries my skin out. I am only using it now a few time a week rather than twice a day.</li>
            <li> Aveeno is all I use anymore. Great products. This is a nice, gentle daily scrub. I recommend all Aveeno skin products, the best!</li>
            <li> Aveeno has always done wonders for my skin so I decided that I would try this and see what happens. I was sadly disappointed. This product didnt lighten my skin at all and I used it for a month and a half and used more than half the bottle. Even after that I saw no evidence of skin lightening. I have severe acne and I know that it wasnt going to work miracles. When I used this product I paired it with the Aveeno Oatmeal bath bar. I just wanted to see a small change and I didnt even get that. I did give me this \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling on my face and my skin felt smooth to the touch after using it. But thats not what I bought it for. Other than the fact that it was supposed to lighten my skin, there are no cons to using this product. Maybe you have to have a certain skin type to see results.</li>
            <li> I love this face scrub. It has a fine sandy texture which makes your face feel refreshed and clean. And you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower to wash my face. Seems to do a decent job. Nice scent and consistency. Not stripping of face moisture. The beads are microfine... You don&#x27;t even notice it that much. Not sure about its exfoliating power however. Good basic face wash. Cannot vouch about the radiant skin or any other skin benefits other than this product cleans your face.</li>
            <li> I like the Aveeno products I&#x27;ve tried, including this one. However, considering the reasons I purchased this product, I would have to say I&#x27;m disappointed with it. This product is generally not working for me.    First of all, some others here mention the smaller beads. That might seem like a small concern. However, I think the beads are the reason this product won&#x27;t work for everyone--I believe that this product is mainly for those with sensitive skin, and that&#x27;s what they should advertise so the rest of us can save our money. I can see how big/harsh beads can irritate some people&#x27;s skin, and I&#x27;ve seen reviews of this product where many people have mentioned a scrub by St. Ives as an example of a harsh scrub. However, unless you have that problem of most scrubs irritating your skin, the seemingly non-existent beads in this product are just not going to get the job done on your skin...or maybe it will, but it will take a long time.    Second, this product claims to do some things I don&#x27;t think it does, or maybe--again--it only does it for those with sensitive skin. For example, I have not seen my skin \\&quot;brighten\\&quot; so much as look shiny/oily in certain spots, particularly my forehead. Another thing is I do have uneven skin tone and texture, and it is not doing a thing for that. The product also doesn&#x27;t really lather that well (unless maybe your face is soaked?), so I, personally, have to keep squeezing more out and wetting my face to get enough on as you need to rub this scrub in pretty good and for a while.     Third, I assumed that a product that would exfoliate the skin would also help with acne and have been led to believe by some reviews I&#x27;ve seen that it HAS helped some people with acne. In fact, the reason I bought this product in the first place is that my mother has it and suggested it for my skin. I used hers at her house a few times and liked the way it made my skin feel, so I decided to buy one of my own. At its price, now I&#x27;m kind of sorry I did. My acne is just the same as ever--pimples/scars did not fade one bit with this product--and, in fact, every time after using this product the same spot on my chin has become inflamed, i.e. itching/stinging sensation that just would not go away (this would go on for hours) and a raised spot, kind of like a small swelling. The last time I used this product, I applied it to my forehead and cheeks only and my chin did not become inflamed. Aside from that slight inflammation, it&#x27;s as if the product does nothing but moisturizes my face, not exfoliate it.    I give the product two stars because I did like how it made my skin feel in general, especially right after using it. If I want to moisturize my skin, I will definitely use it. But I&#x27;ve already moved on to another product to try and treat my acne and help with skin tone/texture, Clean &amp; Clear Oxygenating Scrub. I&#x27;ve been using this for a very short amount of time, but I can already note some key differences--bigger beads, a much nicer feel after using it (definitely feels amazing and like it&#x27;s working), some of my pimples feel like they are shrinking within an hour of usage, skin feels INCREDIBLY soft (even my hands), don&#x27;t have to use much to rub it on your face and feel it working, etc. I think this Clean &amp; Clear scrub is going to be what I was looking for and might recommend this to people who need a stronger scrub than Aveeno&#x27;s but a scrub that&#x27;s not TOO strong (this C&amp;C scrub says it&#x27;s good for daily use just as Aveeno&#x27;s does), but I will write a separate review under that product after I&#x27;ve used it more and can report more reliably. As for this Aveeno scrub, I have the foam cleanser and I&#x27;m not sure I can tell the difference between the foam cleanser and this scrub. If you have one, don&#x27;t buy the other...</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look radiant. I use it with a facial brush weekly.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face wash.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash! While some face washes have rough exfoliants, the Skin Brightening Daily Scrub has the perfect combination of cleanser and small beads. The beads are non-irritating, and do not scratch my face like other exfoliants. They simply make my face feel clean and fresh!&lt;br /&gt;I can easily remove my mascara and face powder with a dime size amount of this product.</li>
            <li> Smells great, leaves skin feeling fresh, however pretty expensive for a small amount.  Will probably go back to my other cleanser.</li>
            <li> Much as I love the feel of microbeads, I have given up cleansers which use them. They are terribly destructive to our waters and fisheries. Because they are so small (micro) sewage systems cannot filter them out. Therefore, they get into our streams, rivers, ponds, and so forth. The fish inhale them into their gills where they lodge and gradually suffocate the fish. Frankly, I am surprised to see Aveeno still offers this product.</li>
            <li> Good facial scrub. I love using this as it leaves my skin feeling really soft.</li>
            <li> Smells great and feels great.</li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t help my dry sensitive skin.  i was using it often and whenever i go for a facial or to a makeup counter they tell me i need to exfoliate so I know it&#x27;s not working for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month and I love it! It makes my skin feel so soft and it evens out my skin tone.  A great product with an outstanding price!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Olay Regenerist cleanser, St. Ives scrub, Neutrogena, Estee Lauder, Ahava - need I go on? But I really like this Aveeno scrub (though \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; is a bit of an overstatement considering how small the beads are). I like the citrusy smell and the way it cleans gently. I wish it were a little more scrubby but I can&#x27;t seem to find something that&#x27;s about half way between this and the super-rough St. Ives so I&#x27;ll stick with this until I do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good face scrub but it cause me to break out. Maybe its the fact that I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I  have discoloration on my cheek and it disappear slowly but surely --&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely add this to my subscribe list&lt;br /&gt;yay&lt;br /&gt;Reena</li>
            <li> I have been using this scrub for years now, but only occasionally untill i suddenly started to get acne in the humid weather where i live. I started to use this scrub daily evening after i go home form work - by this time my face becomes oily, shiny and a little itchy with my acne. Once I scrub it, feels fresh and this scrub did help me reduce and control acne. Even when i had no acne, I did like this scrub - good to use a scrub every once in a while to get those dead skin cells out of ur skin, right? The microbeads in it are not too big or too scrubby, i guess that is the reason it is a daily scrub. I use soap in the morning, this scrub in the evening and I am done. I rarely go for a facial kind of thing, I only put on facepacks at home once in a while, so this helps keeping my pores clean.</li>
            <li> Personally, I like the scrubbing grains to be a little tiny bit bigger, these are REALLY tiny and almost not noticeable.  But that is what makes this a gentle cleanser for those who have sensitive skin or don&#x27;t like the feel of grit when they are washing their face.  I gave this product a 5 because it is a very nice facial cleanser, very good consistency, and overall a nice product.</li>
            <li> small opening for a big package you need a little but still dont think its handy great smell, gave it tree stars because i can do without it</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 2 days and so far, my acne has worsen and my skin has been feeling itchy.</li>
            <li> I love this. I tried to find something that I liked after a particular soap was discontinued and it took me a long time to find this. I now live in Costa Rica and this is the one item I HAVE to have from the States. For my skin which tends to be oily and gets rough patches if I use the wrong soap, this is excellent. I&#x27;ve probably been using it for 8 years or so. Since I started ordering this from Amazon, I found that the prices are much better on Amazon then in stores back home.</li>
            <li> Saw that the came out with anew face wash and though i&#x27;ll try it. After a mouth of use I saw no brightening..... Boring I went back to my old face wash and gave this to my niece.</li>
            <li> love this product its really great. I saw the add on TV and I decided to try it. Love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this for awhile now. This product makes my skin dry and didn&#x27;t brighten it at all. I&#x27;m a huge Aveeno fan and will continue to use their lotions but unfortunately, this is not for me.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so much more healthier now.</li>
            <li> Was not brandnew. came opened and half used...</li>
            <li> I love Aveeno and I heard so many good things about this cleanser, but I have to say it wasn&#x27;t what I expected. It dries my face out and I only use it like twice a week.  It did brighten my skin tone done but not like I was expecting. It removes makeup well.</li>
            <li> it sometimes makes my face look shiny...not bright. it could be that maybe I didn&#x27;t wash it off completely. otherwise I like this as a daily exfoliatiant</li>
            <li> smells great; makes my face feel clean</li>
            <li> When I mean okay it&#x27;s okay it&#x27;s nothing special I love st.ives way better it would be really good if you don&#x27;t like a harsh scrub this is very little beads</li>
            <li> works so well.. i will definitely buy again. if you are looking for flawless, radiant, bright skin, this is for you. leaves face feeling fresh and light. smells great too.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream, it makes my face very soft.</li>
            <li> I use this every day.  It exfoliates gently and makes makeup application smooth and easy.</li>
            <li> This worked very well for me.  I am so bummed that they stopped offering it.  I don&#x27;t like the new formula as much.</li>
            <li> I like it because it feels like its actually cleaning my face by scrubbing it. However, it did make my face feel a little dry and not as bright and I don&#x27;t even use it that much (once a night) and I don&#x27;t have any skin allergies.</li>
            <li> Good basic cleanser, I think it&#x27;s very gentle and it won&#x27;t irritate your skin. I have acne-prone oily skin and this made my skin feel less oily. It doesn&#x27;t really help with acne, but then again it&#x27;s not really supposed to! As far as brightening goes, it didn&#x27;t really help with that either, but I have had freckles since I was 5 years old and I don&#x27;t think any old drugstore cleanser is going to help with them. I used it twice a day along with the Aveeno Positively Radiant Moisturizer with SPF15 and I felt that it did give my skin an overall &#x27;dewy&#x27; effect (not to be confused with oily!!). I used this to take all of my make up off (not eye make up) and my skin felt clean and soft afterwards. I think this cleanser is probably best for someone who has relatively few skin issues and mostly normal skin.</li>
            <li> So disappointed to find out this product has plastic microbeads. Doesn&#x27;t Aveeno pride themselves on being a more natural brand? For those that do not know, plastic microbeads wreak havoc on the environment. Stay away!</li>
            <li> I have skin that scars very easily, and after using this all my scars have faded. It does make my skin dry, which is easily fixed by some lotion afterwards.</li>
            <li> I use this and other aveeno products a lot.  I like the feel it leaves on my face after I am done.  Does kind of dry my face out, so I have to put lotion on afterwards.</li>
            <li> Great price and love being able to shop online and have it delivered to my house.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed anything special, it&#x27;s only been about a week and I&#x27;ve found that using a rotating scrubber leaves a cleaner and softer feel. Just washing in the shower and rinsing did not seem adequate. It doesn&#x27;t lather so I dab some on four areas of my face after wetting it and then doing the scrubby thing. Does leave my skin soft and this time of year, my natural oils lubricate my skin enough I do not need lotion as this product does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I tried the Aveeno Facial Cleanser, and it is smooth and comfortable, and I have been searching for a daily facial scrub for a long time, and it is good.</li>
            <li> face wash its all natural and good for all age types leaves your skin smooth and fades the dark spots.</li>
            <li> This burns my face. When I use it my skin turns red. I bought this at the same time as a few other cleansers to test them all out. Had no trouble with any others from different brands. Surprised me because usually I prefer Aveeno. That was not the case with this product. You can&#x27;t even feel any scrubbies in it. Most scrubs have granules or something you can notice. This merely felt dirty, like someone accidentally mixed a small amount of beach sand in it. Its rare that you feel it, but when you do it feels wrong because its not throughout the product. The smell was very much like chemicals instead of something refreshing. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning in the shower, along with the other Positively Radiant items. I would recommend this as a morning scrub, prior to using the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> IT WORK GOOD WITH ME , IT IS TITLE OF BRIGHTENING</li>
            <li> it makes my skin so bright and smooth!! i love this product, I just wish it were in a larger oz bottle rather than having to order a bunch of small ones, but it does last quite a while if you don&#x27;t use more than you need (like i tend to do)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used an exfoliant before or if you have very sensitive skin, this is probably a really good product for you.  However, I have to echo the sentiments of other reviewers and say that the beads are just a skosh too small to really fit my requirements in a scrub.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, as it keeps my face looking smooth and clean. This was one of my subscribe-and-save items until it was discontinued. I am willing to spend too much money on Bobbi Brown makeup, but this gem is all i need for washing it off at night.</li>
            <li> Another quality Aveeno product! Nice scrub without being too abrasive. Nice mild scent, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have used the same bottle of this, every day for 1.5 years. I really like it because it is a gentle exfoliant; it doesn&#x27;t screw up my skin with daily use. It DOES make my skin seem clearer, fresh and smooth. I think it is really good value for the money. I like it because it only squirts out a little bit of product; that is part of why I&#x27;ve been able to use the same bottle for so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not have very much scent, which is very nice if you are sensitive to smells like I am.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite face wash!</li>
            <li> I personally feel like this is the all time BEST face wash.  I have used other brands from drug stores/ grocery stores and this one is just the best.  I have never used a bad Aveeno product.  It is just frustrating because sometimes they can be so expensive in comparing to other products.  Its really worth paying the extra couple of dollars.  And besides I feel like this bottle will last you at couple months with using this product a couple times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During allergy season and the dry months (wait, doesn&#x27;t that cover the whole year??) I have dry patches on my face!  No matter how much lotion I use on my skin, I still have it.  Since I have been using this product it has gone away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:&lt;br /&gt;* Wet face, and you just need a LITTLE BIT.  A little goes a long way.  It goes on so smoothly.  It feels like it has sand in it that works on your face to smooth out any roughness or dryness.</li>
            <li> Light weight cleanser, scent is neither good nor bad.</li>
            <li> This face wash leaves my face feeling fresh. It&#x27;s a very mild face wash, so if you&#x27;re looking for a really deep deep clean, this might not be your wash. I don&#x27;t have an acne issue, I just needed something to wipe away the day off of my face. It works well for me!</li>
            <li> Best face wash out there! Doesn&#x27;t leave your face overly dry. Perfect amount of moisture.</li>
            <li> More harsh and drying than I thought it&#x27;d be. Also has salicylic acid for acne so increases sun sensitivity. Good product though, not good if you don&#x27;t have acne though or if you have dry skin like me.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, gentle scrub and I love it.  My esthetician recommended that I use a exfoliant on my face, and after using this product regularly, she really noticed an improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> This product has such tiny exfoliating beads that it really doesn&#x27;t seem to have much of an exfoliating effect when used. I never notice any benefits from using this regularly for a month- after running out I didn&#x27;t purchase anymore. I will say though, I have very sensitive redness prone skin and this product did not irritate my skin in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Affordable&lt;br /&gt;Good for sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Does not exfoliate well.&lt;br /&gt;Has bit of an odd smell- not strong, just not particularly pleasant.</li>
            <li> Left skin soft initially, but after a few days left skin feeling too moist/oily</li>
            <li> Small but persistent dry patches on my face are magically disappearing in only a few weeks of daily morning washes!  I am amazed....... and brightened!</li>
            <li> Aveeno Positively Radiant scrub is easy on my skin yet also effective at brightening my skin tone. It&#x27;s not all that easy to find products as compatible as this with sensitive skin. Recommended.</li>
            <li> This is the best face cleansing product for those of us who cannot tolerate oils or abrasive chemicals and I have been using this as a facial cleanser for years and it still works - very gentle and non-abrasive but yet exfoliates you will like this product.  Aveeno has other facial products for cleansing but this is the one that causes no issues.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face super clean.</li>
            <li> Even dry skin responds to this gentle &#x27;body scrub.&#x27; Aveeno products are usually affordable and effective so I have a tendency to purchase products from a brand name that I am familiar with and have used before. This will be another addition to &#x27;my favorites list.&#x27; Recommended for normal, dry and sensitive skin. If you have skin allergies, be sure to read the ingredient list!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this at Costco in a 3 pack. I used this every day and with in a few weeks could see the difference in my skin.  I wasn&#x27;t breaking out nearly as much as I was before and my skin was much softer and just looked better. When I ran out, I was horrified to see Costco didn&#x27;t sell it anymore. I didn&#x27;t want to pay the ridiculous prices at the drug stores.  I ended up buying 5 bottles from Amazon since the price was so good. It&#x27;s still part of my daily skin care routine and I&#x27;m still seeing the same, great results!</li>
            <li> Love love love! Amazing product. Being someone who has had horrible skin for the last 18 years aveeno products have always been a life saver</li>
            <li> I have used this for many years.  We need to regularly exfoliate our faces, to remove the dead cells, and make our skin able to absorb the skin care products we apply.  Really brightens the face, but is not harsh.  Good for men too!</li>
            <li> I use this every morning and night faithfully and it keeps my skin smooth and refreshed, it smells wonderful too!</li>
            <li> I love love love this scrub. The sand is very small that I can sue it daily as it says. I walked away from it to use other scrubs because I wanted something new, but I always came back to it.</li>
            <li> I needed a face wash for the morning and night. I didn&#x27;t have anything to wipe my makeup off at the end of the day so I just grapped the cheapest face wash on Amazon. I am having a little more acne, but since I have been using a whole lot of new products, it might be because of something else. Even if the face wash is causing the acne, only a little bit has showed and so worth it, and it may be different with you anyways.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash. I have been using it for years and it is non-drying and exfoliates my skin.</li>
            <li> I expected wonders from peoples reviews. But works just like any regular face wash. I prefer st ives face scrub.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for 6+ years and i love the way my skin looks and feels after. I only use it 2-3 times a week to avoid over exfoliating. I have combination skin and Ive never had any problems!</li>
            <li> I like that the beads are kind of small, just the perfect scrub for me</li>
            <li> Great price and very quick delivery!</li>
            <li> Just excellent product for dry skin.  Goes soft &amp; smooth on your face and within a few weeks you will see the difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 30 yr old male with sensitive skin and it has been serving its purpose very well. I use it everyday sometimes a twice a day. It gets my face shiny and helps reduce the breakout of pimples or acne effectively. My only suggestion is to use it with regular facial soap alternatively with this because still the scrub can damage your skin. I use them in 2:1 ratio: 2 scrub and 1 soap.</li>
            <li> it is just as described on the website. the face will become very smooth after using it. I like it very much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little while and I noticed my face broke out more often when I was using it. Then I bothered to read the ingredients and noticed it contains Sodium Hydroxide. Sodium Hydroxide is, among many other industrial purposes, used to turn animal carcasses into pulp. Granted, SH is the last ingredient but I can&#x27;t help but think that using this product over time could be a cancer or skin damage risk. I&#x27;ll just copy and paste what I found on a website called truthinaging...&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Sodium Hydroxide is, however, a known irritant. Studies by the National Institute for Occupation Safety and Health found that this ingredient causes \\&quot;Irritation eyes, skin, mucous membrane; pneumonitis; eye, skin burns; temporary loss of hair\\&quot; and recommends that consumers prevent skin and eye contact. The CDC reports that \\&quot;Skin contact with sodium hydroxide can cause severe burns with deep ulcerations. Pain and irritation are evident within 3 minutes, but contact with dilute solutions may not cause symptoms for several hours. Contact with the eye may produce pain and irritation, and in severe cases, clouding of the eye and blindness.\\&quot; Solutions as weak as .12% have shown to destruct healthy skin cells within one hour. Other studies acknowledge Sodium Hydroxide as a strong irritant that is corrosive to the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract, but that the severity of the effects are related directly to concentration and pH levels, as well as the length of exposure and skin type.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;m going to be switching back to Queen Helene facial scrub.</li>
            <li> made my skin break out.......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and am very happy with it along with other Aveeno products!</li>
            <li> I love this face scrub! I have pale, sensitive, combination skin, and I found that this face scrub is not too harsh on my skin. I used to use St. Ives and I felt like I was rubbing sandpaper on my face and it would feel dry and stingy afterwards. But when I tried this product for the first time, I gently buffed away the dry spots on my face, leaving it extremely smooth even the next morning.</li>
            <li> I love aveeno products, it does the job for me,I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> good price and great product</li>
            <li> I have aging skin and always use a scrub. I&#x27;ve tried several brands and for the price this is the best. I think I&#x27;ve gotten amazing results. It does what it says. Aveeno does more than many pricer brands, I also use their firming cream and love it.</li>
            <li> Works great on preventing acne for my sensitive combination skin (not as well as Proactiv&#x27;s daily cleanser though). I do wish there was no fragrance and sodium hydroxide.</li>
            <li> My skin feels nice and soft after using it. And I don&#x27;t get all red and bumpy like with lots of face washes.&lt;br /&gt;So it is good for people with sensitive skin! Also a good price for a big bottle!</li>
            <li> I normally use this product during the Summer,&lt;br /&gt;but was running low and needed to stock up ...&lt;br /&gt;Either Aveeno has changed their formula or&lt;br /&gt;maybe because I&#x27;ve reached the age of 50, my&lt;br /&gt;skin has less oil on the surface, but I&#x27;m finding I&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t need to use much of this product during&lt;br /&gt;the Winter ...Twice a week is about all it takes,&lt;br /&gt;whereas during the Summer, every other day.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I was looking for, but it is a great scrub for gentle skin because the beads are so small. My sis likes that it is so gentle. I didn&#x27;t realize that it didn&#x27;t have any salicylic acid, though, until I arrived. If I weren&#x27;t looking for a product with salicylic acid, this would have been perfect.</li>
            <li> I use this as it cleans and makes my face feel great.  It never dries it out and feel very clean after using</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with my skin and getting age spots (I am only 28...smh). I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 3-weeks and I notice a major improvement in my skin. The micro beads are not abrasive at all unless you press into your skin and keep rubbing for several minutes (which wouldn&#x27;t make sense). Otherwise I use this product and all the other aveeno products and they are fantastic.</li>
            <li> There are many Aveeno products I love and work very well. This is a decent scrub minus the brightening. Aveeno needs to toss this one because the results (zero) make you feel like you are either not sure what brighter skin means or lied to.</li>
            <li> Out of the scrub I have used (~7 different ones) I like this one the most. It not too rough, not too greasy and rinse off nicely.</li>
            <li> Their products are very good and your price are better than the store</li>
            <li> Aveeno, an Awesome Product &amp; a Wonder for my skin.my skin really feels soft n it actually breaths. this is the only thing i use it for my face, which works excellent for cleansing n scrubbing too... i neednt use a scrub again to either remove dead tissue or black heads or even tan.. for those with sensitive skin like mine, it is very mild n works great too. i initially used cetaphil, but with time i realised it left my skin greasy, thats the reason i had to look for Aveeno which is perfect on all skin types n for all seasons too.. so why would i go back to any other product once ive found a PERFECT one, AM LOVING IT!! I would definatly recommend it to every one.. had the option of giving only a 5 star, otherwise i would have given more :-)</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel and look more visibly soft. Noticed after 2nd use. I&#x27;ve been using this and clinique face wash for almost 2 weeks now and my deep dark very noticeable acne marks are almost invisible. One of my favs!!!</li>
            <li> This scrub replaces the Neutrogena scrub that my daughter and I used. I bought the Neutrogena for myself and as she progressed into a tween she needed a scrub too. She didn&#x27;t care for the smell of the Neutrogena but it did work very well. I had been buying the Aveeno acne pads for her and decided to get this for the night time routine. She loves the smell and the texture and I love the great price. It leaves a soft glow to her skin and her face never feels oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This combined with the Aveeno pads, a daily moisturizer with SPF 15 UV protector in the morning, followed by this at night, seems to be doing the trick for keeping acne at bay and keeping her young face bright and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t tell her but, dad is using it too now.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product exfoliate the skin, smooth and works great for my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Really improves skin.</li>
            <li> After exfoliating with it, my face feels baby soft. But again, it makes it a little dry, but if you use it once a week, you should be fine.</li>
            <li> I decided to take a break from my usual face wash, Cerave, because I had been using it for a few years. And I know it&#x27;s good for your skin to switch it up every once in a while. I purchased this and I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with it! It&#x27;s gentle enough for my sensitive skin to use every day. The smell isn&#x27;t too overwhelming, it has a nice scent. I can wash my face once and it takes off all my make up. And I have def noticed an improvement in my skin texture. It&#x27;s smoother and looks less dull. Also, it&#x27;s been clearing up my light break outs. I&#x27;m super pleased! Will buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Is what just wanted, perfect, gentle... enough to used daily</li>
            <li> I love this daily face wash!  The tiny little beads are very soothing and not annoying like a lot of other daily scrubs.  I would definitely use this again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Washing my face with this feels fresh and not dry. Will use nothing else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product going on 3 weeks and so far I love it. No complaints so far</li>
            <li> I just love this face wash.  It&#x27;s refreshing.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> The scrub did not live up to my expectations, no brightening of skin, didnt feel it cleansed well enough :(</li>
            <li> My previous face wash was clinique, spent around $50 for the whole set, and my skin never felt right. Others around the same price i had to use a ton to get my face clean because it was so thick. This is perfect. you only need just a little bit, and my face feels much cleaner than with higher end products. I will never buy anything else.</li>
            <li> It is okay and does what it claims so I may buy again.</li>
            <li> Did not work for my skin. Cannot even explain what was wrong.  I gave it away.</li>
            <li> Wife wanted to try this, and she is not impressed.  Nothing special.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, feels good and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Leaves you feeling brand new!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It has been the most gentle scrub I have found. I have sensitive skin and it is has never irritated it. Pleasant light fragrance also. I recommend it to alll my friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this scrub for about 2 years. Each time it lasts me about 6 months, b/c it takes such a small amount to do the job. My skin feels smoother and does in fact look brighter after use. The beads are very small which I prefer. I have somewhat sensitive, combination skin and this is one of few products I&#x27;ve tried that really works with that. I even feel safe letting my toddler daughter use a little dab when she wants to be just like mommy.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a light daily cleaner that gave me a little bit of exfoliation and wasn&#x27;t overly fragrant. If you are looking for the same, give this a try. There are light scrubbing pieces like pieces of sugar that dissolve while in use so it does not feel harsh but you get a little bit of a scrub.</li>
            <li> My favorite! Leaves my skin feeling so clean!</li>
            <li> I keep coming back to this exfoliator- I think because it is so gentle. It&#x27;s one of my favorite face care products.</li>
            <li> I just recently moved away to college and my skin got soooo bad from all the bad unhealthy food! This saved my life, I swear!</li>
            <li> I purchased this scrub because I love most of the aveeno proucts, was in need of a facial scrub, and thought I would give it a try. What really got my attention, was that right on front, it says \\&quot;gentle scrub to even skin tone and texture.\\&quot; That was exactly what I was looking for! I have noticed my skin has gotten somewhat flakey lately, and the texture needed a boost, and i also have a sort of red t-zone. I DO moisturize. I have found a happy medium for my normally combination skin. ANYWAY. I also have sensitive skin, so this prouct seemed like the obvious fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really disappointed. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, and I&#x27;m just not happy. The first time I used it, I was surprised it had tiny tiny beads. I figured it was because it is a \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; scrub, so I was okay with that...except it didn&#x27;t expholiate my skin at all. I sat there for a good 5 minutes, and it really didn&#x27;t do much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve kept using it, because sometimes products just take time for you to see a difference, but I haven&#x27;t seen any good changes in my skin. The opposite actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely needs to be paired with a facial cleanser. But I have noticed that I have had 2 pimples, that keep flairing up, while using this product. Usually a pimple will come, be ugly for a few days, then go away. For some reason, if you have a pimple and use this scrub, it might go away for a few days, but then it comes back, and will feel like a brand new pimple. I&#x27;m completely confused as to whats going on with that. BUT, overall, I&#x27;m just disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have hyper-sensitive skin and often find myself allergic to products that others with sensitive skin find fine so this scrub is brilliant for me. Very gentle, the beads are small and granular compared to other scrubs. I use it in the shower and I think it would be suitable for regular if not daily use. Great product, will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product, will purchase again in the future! Thank you :)</li>
            <li> A Good Scrub,But not doesn&#x27;t do the job as marketed.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t notice any brightening.&lt;br /&gt;A mild scrub for allergic skin.</li>
            <li> I always keep coming back to this Aveeno scrub.  Obviously it exfoliates so as a &#x27;dude&#x27; it is great to use before shaving, but I have sensitive  skin and it doesn&#x27;t cause me problems with breakouts as it is oil free and soap free.  It does seem to even your skin tone if you have slight discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that it&#x27;s not sulfate and paraben free, so for those very healthy conscious you might want to take a pass on this one.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rave enough about this product! It has these tiny tiny beads that gently scrub your skin and just make your face feel so smooth after washing. It has a light scent, nothing perfume-y. I have used Aveeno products for many years and have never been disappointed with them. I was so excited to find this product half the price as it was in the stores, so I bought 2!&lt;br /&gt; I love Amazon shopping!!!</li>
            <li> I love this daily scrub. It&#x27;s gentle enough to use everyday. The first time I used it I couldn&#x27;t believe how bright my skin was! Some washes cause me to break out. Not this one! Thanks Aveeno! I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and I needed to find a gentle scrub and this is exactly what I needed. Very gentle, but also you can feel it working. I have used it weekly and have even used it a few days in a row and my skin has reacted just fine. I feel it really helps my moisturizer absorb. Also the price here on Amazon is better then it is in the stores, will be ordering again when needed.</li>
            <li> I had the Oil of Olay daily face scrub and liked it.  That wasn&#x27;t available on Amazon Prime, so I figured I&#x27;d give this a try.  This works well, but it&#x27;s really thin, similar to standard body wash.  I prefer the fine grit that is in the Oil of Olay, I feel like it&#x27;s cleaning better.  I can&#x27;t say anything scientific about the two (I haven&#x27;t exactly done any controlled studies comparing the actual outcomes of the two...), but I just prefer the feel of the other.  If you don&#x27;t like the gritty feeling, this might be great for you.</li>
            <li> Aveeno is my favorite brand for everything including this face wash</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for months now, and I still can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s actually working or not. I kind of feel like it doesn&#x27;t but I still use it. The small beads are not too rough on the skin and the smell makes it that much more pleasurable to use, but I&#x27;m still uncertain if it actually does what it insists. I understand products work differently among the person that is using it but I&#x27;m really not impressed with the scrub.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple kind of face scrubs, soaps, cleansers but after running into this product never used anything else. I&#x27;ve been using this product since middle school so for about 9 years and it has not failed me since. I never had a huge acne problem where my face would be covered with acne but I had enough acne to get some kind of a face wash or scrub. This is an amazing product, I love this product so much because one, I have very sensitive skin and even though it&#x27;s a scrub it doesn&#x27;t cause any kind of damage. Two it keeps my skin fresh and clean. But without some kind of a facial lotion product it does have a chance of drying your skin, especially if you have sensitive skin such as myself. But this product has done more good than bad for me. I&#x27;m not sure how well it will work on customers that have a severe acne (may need something stronger) but those who have sensitive skin, this product is definitely  worth trying.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 4 years and I love it. I have uneven skin tone around the mouth area and its gotten a lot lighter. My face feels smooth and radiant. I also love the small microbeads in it to exfoliate my skin. I read some reviews about it helping acne. It&#x27;s not an acne treatment so don&#x27;t get mad if it doesn&#x27;t work for you. It&#x27;s not for all skin type. So try it out if u like it and it works for u great. If not try something else.</li>
            <li> Face wash works great for oily skin. I have very sensitive skin and tend to get red and blotchy with other face washes. Works great and leaves skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Good product and works nice on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Only purchase this daily scrub if you can handle the assault of beautiful young twenty-something women that a young adonis must bare on an hourly basis.  I wasn&#x27;t ready and now I am in physical therapy from having to bed 30-40 young phillies nightly.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that is also very dry, this product caused my face to get red and it didn&#x27;t get better after using for 2 weeks just to give it a proper chance.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin and she seems ok with it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this daily scrub for a few months now and absolutely love it.  I have super sensitive skin and this seems to be the only product that doesn&#x27;t turn my face red, leave a film, or over dry it.  I use it with the Oil of Olay spin brush thingy every day and haven&#x27;t had any issues.  Since I have been using it for a few months now, I don&#x27;t think any issues will come of it.  Get some now!</li>
            <li> This is the best facial wash for me. I have dry and dull skin and this helps with my condition. I love its scent too.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  Gentle enough to use every day (even 2x a day). Leaves your face feeling smooth and clean but not stripped of all moisture. Does not make your face red or irritated.  FYI:  Although the name of the product implies that your face with be brightened - that will not happen.  Do not purchase this product if you&#x27;re expecting a brightner.</li>
            <li> This scrub literally gives you a facial every day. Removes age spots and gives skin a fabulous glow.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product as part of my weekly skin care. It&#x27;s a great mild exfoliant and doesn&#x27;t damage my fragile aging skin.</li>
            <li> it is good. i think it is a cheap, but it is useful and helpful. No any stimulation for skin.</li>
            <li> Good product, my second purchase</li>
            <li> Simply put the words microbeads and pollution in your favorite search engine.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and this cleanser works miracles! Use a Buf-Puf Facial Sponge with this cleanser. Buf-Pufs are designed to completely remove dead skin cells, dirt and oil by pulling them away from the skin (I bought mine on Amazon for around $3). Definitely get the \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; Buf-Puf. The regular is way too rough.</li>
            <li> This product feels like silk on my face and leaves me looking radiant and glowy. I absolutely love it</li>
            <li> Positively works well as daily facial scrub to gently remove daily sunscreen applications. Keep it in the shower, use just a pinch and it quickly removes dirt and oils leaving skin ready for Aveeno Positively Radiant Moisturizer with SPF 15.  Found out about this from my dermatologist, he uses it too.</li>
            <li> Love this scrub it is the perfect blend of exfoliating and moisture. I use it everyday and do not need lotion or anything else when using this product.</li>
            <li> Our whole family uses this and loves it.</li>
            <li> I had been using acne fighting face washes until a friend suggested I try this product. I love it! I have dry/average skin that breaks out in small spots 1-2 times a month. Since using this product, I&#x27;ve noticed less breakouts and less red/patchy spots. It was a little bit drying at first, but I don&#x27;t have any issues with it now. I really like the small microbeads - you can really feel the product cleaning your face. Also leaves no residue/filmy feeling, which is something I couldn&#x27;t stand with other face washes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product and Aveeno clear complexion moisturizer for about two weeks. I&#x27;ve never used any other Aveeno products before and no one I know uses the products. However, I decided to give it a try any way because I have tried everything else it seems and nothing is doing what I want it to. During my teens/early 20s I never had a problem with pimples or breakouts at all. However, now I&#x27;m 27 and twice a month I seem to break out for a few days and some products I&#x27;ve used in the past really dries out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product so my complexion would be clearer and I&#x27;d have brighter skin, but so far I have not seen a difference, the only difference is how it makes my face feel. I use it once in the morning when I take my shower, then I use it again when I get home from work. It does not dry out my skin at all and I like the super tiny beads; they don&#x27;t hurt your face and they aren&#x27;t rough like some other scrubs. I also like that a little dab of this product goes a long way. I just wish that this product helped more with minor breakouts. Like I said, I have not seen a difference in my face, I still have blotches and my skin tone isn&#x27;t even, but I&#x27;m going to keep giving this product a try. I have only been using it two weeks, so hopefully it will work eventually.</li>
            <li> dont work for my skin. but hey you never know it might work for you. but it dont clean for s^&amp;t</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face wash of all time!  It leaves my sensitive skin clean with no stinging feeling.  I would reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  The best part is I only need the tiniest little bit and it lathers up and works great.  I bet this bottle will last me 6 months.</li>
            <li> Seldom used, Aveeno positively radiant skin brightening daily scrub.  This item was a gift.  Description is relatively accurate.  Delivery of this item was professional.</li>
            <li> Works well very fine granular texture.  It is a bit drying you should moisturizer right after using it if possible.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product when I came across it to see how well it works since everything else that I have tried tend to dry my face out and make it feel tight and stiff. This does the exact opposite, my face doesn&#x27;t feel dry after using it and it has a certain glow to my skin after using it. The best part of it all is that I can use it daily without it irritating my skin. Love it and would suggest anyone to try it.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for years, and it works great! Can&#x27;t go wrong with Aveeno. Just wish it didn&#x27;t have to be an add-on buy to an order.</li>
            <li> This is the facial cleanser that I use on a daily basis.  It leaves my face feeling soft, clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple months now on and off.&lt;br /&gt;My conclusions:&lt;br /&gt;1. This product doesn&#x27;t exfoliate my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;2. Does not make my face feel clean one bit, actually feels a little slippery/greasy&lt;br /&gt;3. My skin actually gets worse from using this. I&#x27;ve experienced acne everytime I use this product.&lt;br /&gt;4. Great smelling product from aveeno&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recomendation: I would skip this and get something else</li>
            <li> It works great! My face looks fresher after I use it. The skin looks like the stale layer of skin has been removed.</li>
            <li> I really like this facial cleanser. It leaves your skin feeling cool and smooth, no greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase this again and I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> This has been the only facial scrub that has just the right amount of grit without hurting or feeling useless but also improves the redness on my cheeks. My complexion evens out and is clearer than ever. I ran out for about a week and I started breaking out and had so much redness I had to use lots of concealer. I won&#x27;t be making that mistake again!</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a facial scrub.  It works well and my skin feels soft &amp; refreshed.</li>
            <li> A gentle face cleanser that works well to remove make up. It did not exfoliate as well as I hoped, but it worked well with my skin and did not cause any major breakouts. I have very dry skin though and it did not continually keep it smooth. The product occasionally would come out in large clumps, which would make a mess on the sink or in the shower. The scent was pleasant and I have no complaints. I recently switched to the Aveeno Smart Essentials Detoxifying Scrub which in my opinion works better, but this may just be for my skin type.</li>
            <li> Love Aveeno products in general.  I use it with an electronic face brush.  smells good.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better acne products out there. I use it almost everyday to gently exfoliate and clean my skin. Some people, like my brother, prefer the large beads in a facial scrub, but I like the smaller beads in this one. Because the beads are finer, it feels like it&#x27;s exfoliating more evenly. It can also be used in combination with other products, where as other facial scrubs might be too harsh for combination with anything else in the day. I would recommend trying it out; It&#x27;s effective, cheap, and the tube lasts for a really long time.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t get it in your eye.  Clean, fresh smell and this product works great on my complexion.  Few scrubs are better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is my new daily face wash; I love it. My complexion has already improved (got a little too much sun this year). Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> really loved using it .. it will make your face soft and day after day glowing .. I use it day and nights and best thing is you dont need to pour more a few drop is enough for full face..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;really love it</li>
            <li> I have fibromyalgia so I am very sensitive to all these kinds of products.&lt;br /&gt;My mother recommended this to me and I have been using it for over a year.&lt;br /&gt;It is very lightly scented and has micro beads to exfoliate. I use it&lt;br /&gt;with my Clarisonic and LOVE it!! Thanks Aveeno, you are the only company I have&lt;br /&gt;never had problems with! Yay!!</li>
            <li> Works well to scrub your face and leave it feeling refreshed. Doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling too dry either. Nice product</li>
            <li> As the product states, you can use this every day. I don&#x27;t see a noticeable &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; in my skin tone, but my skin definitely feels better - feels clean and smooth after using the scrub.</li>
            <li> I am almost 30, and my skin is definitely transitioning from the youthful, bounces-back-easily skin of my early 20&#x27;s to something....not so easily-bouncing-back. I also have very dry, sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great for skin like mine. It is very gentle and truly is a scrub that can be used daily. I have gone through periods of time where I stop using it and use some other product, but I always come back to this. My skin looks fresher and truly more radiant when I use it daily. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Loved using Aveeno and their products! They have a reputation for making good products :)</li>
            <li> Good product now my kids are using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dark skinned (love it) and have been washing my face with this cleanser since 2009.  It does not literally &#x27;brightens&#x27; the skins, it cleanses out your pores so that your skin will have an even tone. You only need a quarter-size amount to get the job done. Although one tube lasts for me about two months, I wish it would come in a larger bottle; maybe even a pump bottle.  Oh, I do not wear makeup.</li>
            <li> Great product for exfoliation and skin brightening. If you want to maintain a healthy glow it is a must for you to exfoliate. This product isn&#x27;t that strong or harsh yet has enough granules to feel like its working.</li>
            <li> O.k. Nothing great. I don&#x27;t notice any brightening of my face nor does my skin feel like anything special after using it.  Won&#x27;t buy again. Imhave since bought the st. Ives citrus mild scrub and it&#x27;s AWESOME!</li>
