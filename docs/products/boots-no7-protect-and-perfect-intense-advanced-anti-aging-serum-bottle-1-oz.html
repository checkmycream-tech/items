            <li>I come to find out that the Protect &amp; Perfect Intense Advanced Serum is their newest product.</li>
            <li>I originally bought the Protect &amp; Perfect Intense Serum.</li>
            <li>Now that I live in Florida, and have very FAIR SKIN.</li>

            <li>I feel my face is firmer and all together better.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of it</li>
            <li>Oh, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but I am now sold on Boots products, and will try the day and night cremes too:)</li>

            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and effective.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this product... have ordered 3x already</li>
            <li>Need some more.</li>
            <li>Now it looks and feels so much better</li>
            <li>This is supposed to be so good, guess I just don&#x27;t have the right type of skin.</li>
            <li>When I first put some product onto my hands, you can smell the product which isn&#x27;t a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other products and this works the best.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the serum and will be trying their other products soon.</li>
            <li>Application is easy.</li>
            <li>Over the course of a month I was a reduction in all the fine lines on my face.  </li>
            <li>I was targeting a line between my eyebrows, fine crows feet and lines around my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Nothing works miracles, but I do see some lessening of fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Smooth.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth after application.  </li>
            <li>Good feel not heavy.</li>
            <li>Slight very pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Best cream hands down!!</li>
            <li>Also, their exfoliant and peeling masque products are fabulous, fun and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this during the day (haven&#x27;t tried their eye cream yet) and RoC Retinol Correxion Sensitive Night Cream, and my skin is looking really nice.  </li>
            <li>My skin is silky smooth right after using.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t smell it at all without putting my nose super close to it.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!!!</li>
            <li>I believe I heard about this on TV - not a commercial - and thought I&#x27;d give it a try and am glad I did!  </li>
            <li>(2) the smell isn&#x27;t so great, it made me a little nauseous.</li>
            <li>Quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li>But, I do really like the produce better than any I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>I hope these are strong enough words to let you know my true feelings....</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!  </li>
            <li>This was my first try with the &amp;#34;intense&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li>This is my first week using it</li>
            <li>This is my third or more order.</li>
            <li>I can see a difference super silky &amp; less visible fine lines !</li>
            <li>The serum is light and silky.&lt;br /&gt;Con: can&#x27;t tell how much of the product is left.</li>
            <li>It feels good, smooth without being greasy, and it helps my sensitive skin look hydrated and silky without being at all irritating.  </li>
            <li>It really works</li>
            <li>Really like rhis product</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t really notice pores that use to look like craters.</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle and so far I feel it is really making my skin softer and more hydrated.</li>
            <li>Came fast and at a reasonable price</li>
            <li>I really like the feel of it on my skin.</li>
            <li>It did have a very chemically smell</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem very moisturizing though</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another thing I didn&#x27;t care too much for was, without thinking, I stuck my hand under the faucet.  </li>
            <li>all, I didn&#x27;t care too much for this product.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than target even with the cost  of shipping.</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel very silky.</li>
            <li>It really prepared my skin for the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>too soon to tell  much, but I like the way it feels on my face</li>
            <li>I coulda saved so much money...</li>
            <li>Might work on other people, but surely did not work for me.</li>
            <li>I have used any number of quality creams, etc., over the years and am pretty critical of them - wouldn&#x27;t repurchase most of them, but this is definitely going on my list of &amp;#34;must haves&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Love the results which were apparent after only one week.  </li>
            <li>apparently the &amp;#34;Intense Advanced&amp;#34; is the more recent innovation, designed for aging skin.  </li>
            <li>Plan to stay on it as long as it is available</li>
            <li>The moisturizer is ok but slightly drying to the skin.</li>
            <li>It had the same effect as an oil, most similar to coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>As someone in my late 40s, I have a number of fine wrinkles, and I&#x27;ve only recently realized that I have to start doing a bit more than slapping on moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and spots appear to be less noticeable.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife following all of the positive reports on TV.  </li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s hard for me to say I love any anti-wrinkle serum, (lots of wrinkles over my 63 years)</li>
            <li>I also use it with Mary Kay&#x27;s oil free hydrating gel in the morning and Avon Lift &amp; Firm serum at night.</li>
            <li>I have only used it for a few days, but it really has helped smooth my skin.</li>
            <li>Just made skin soft..</li>
            <li>Still to early to see if it helps with wrinkles.</li>
            <li>No 7 product is great,I did not try this as yet,still finishing upan old product.</li>
            <li>rosacea-prone, sun-damaged, you name it (62 years old).  </li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m sure it will last me quite a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just finished my first bottle and am starting on the second.  </li>
            <li>Originally bought this product to target very noticeable forehead lines that seemed to be getting worse.</li>
            <li>The very next day, I woke up with several tiny bumps on both my left and right temples.</li>
            <li>So far nothing but its only been a month.</li>
            <li>Only used it  three times so far but can see a different in my skin.</li>
            <li>The only other solution before boots #7 would be to discontinue having a drink, but who wants to do that.</li>
            <li>The product that was still on my hand was super hard to get off with just water.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s impossible to say which of the creams is most helping, or if both are, but I&#x27;m still very pleased.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Love the results which were apparent after only one week.  </li>
            <li> apparently the &amp;#34;Intense Advanced&amp;#34; is the more recent innovation, designed for aging skin.  </li>
            <li> Plan to stay on it as long as it is available</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is ok but slightly drying to the skin.</li>
            <li> It had the same effect as an oil, most similar to coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> As someone in my late 40s, I have a number of fine wrinkles, and I&#x27;ve only recently realized that I have to start doing a bit more than slapping on moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and spots appear to be less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife following all of the positive reports on TV.  </li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s hard for me to say I love any anti-wrinkle serum, (lots of wrinkles over my 63 years)</li>
            <li> I also use it with Mary Kay&#x27;s oil free hydrating gel in the morning and Avon Lift &amp; Firm serum at night.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a few days, but it really has helped smooth my skin.</li>
            <li> Just made skin soft..</li>
            <li> Still to early to see if it helps with wrinkles.</li>
            <li> No 7 product is great,I did not try this as yet,still finishing upan old product.</li>
            <li> rosacea-prone, sun-damaged, you name it (62 years old).  </li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m sure it will last me quite a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just finished my first bottle and am starting on the second.  </li>
            <li> Originally bought this product to target very noticeable forehead lines that seemed to be getting worse.</li>
            <li> The very next day, I woke up with several tiny bumps on both my left and right temples.</li>
            <li> So far nothing but its only been a month.</li>
            <li> Only used it  three times so far but can see a different in my skin.</li>
            <li> The only other solution before boots #7 would be to discontinue having a drink, but who wants to do that.</li>
            <li> The product that was still on my hand was super hard to get off with just water.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to say which of the creams is most helping, or if both are, but I&#x27;m still very pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li> To my delight the Intense Advanced formula did not have an unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it really works yet.</li>
            <li> No improvement after one bottle, which lasted only a month if that long.</li>
            <li> and I know longer have dry flaky red skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very old and don&#x27;t have wrinkles</li>
            <li> It took about a month to see any improvement but now I really have to look hard to see those lines.  </li>
            <li> I am also a life long sun baby who can&#x27;t use sun screens (I sweat them off immediately and it runs in to my eyes)</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t used it long eniough.</li>
            <li> I am on my 6th bottle of this serum---and it lasts a long time!  </li>
            <li> I feel I have used this product long enough that I should see a little improvement.</li>
            <li> No 7 really delivers.</li>
            <li> Not really seeing any improvements to my face.</li>
            <li> Keeps me nice and moisturized when used with a heavier base.</li>
            <li> Not seeing the results that I anticipated based on the reviews and other blogs written about this product.</li>
            <li> I need to be very careful.</li>
            <li> I figured since it was such a new product, it shouldn&#x27;t smell bad &amp; if the scent was the same as the previous one...</li>
            <li> Used very little so it lasted me a long time</li>
            <li> Down side is that I tend to sneeze a lot after applying.</li>
            <li> Irritating the face and left a pink patch on my face, flaking and irritated.  </li>
            <li> I stopped a few days each time and gave it a few tries.  </li>
            <li> Every time i used the product i got serious breakouts..wish i could get my money back!</li>
            <li> you were having trouble figuring out the difference between the P&amp;P &amp;#34;Intense Advanced&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Intense,&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now, I do see and feel the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times.</li>
            <li> For the past week I have worn no foundation.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what all the fuss is about.  </li>
            <li> The product had a subtle scent to it.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin, and this seemed to make that worse, so</li>
            <li> I use &amp;#34;No. 7&amp;#34; everything and have not been one bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in Missouri.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, with this product, I see no difference in my skin,I would never buy this again</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Over the course of a month I was a reduction in all the fine lines on my face.  It also lessened the deep lines around my mouth.  I plan on continuing to use it every day.</li>

            <li> Originally bought this product to target very noticeable forehead lines that seemed to be getting worse. It took about a month to see any improvement but now I really have to look hard to see those lines.

            <li> Really like rhis product</li>
            <li> Application is easy. Not sticky. Feels like a primer on the skin. Slight very pleasant scent. Very pleased with the purchase. Glad I can get it thru you now!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say I see any improvement on my skin. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> As she wanted........she got!</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> Love the results which were apparent after only one week.  I&#x27;ll continue to use.</li>
            <li> I hope these are strong enough words to let you know my true feelings....LOVE LOVE LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Feels great on my face. Not sure if it really works yet.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff been using it for about 4 mths now &amp; I can see a difference super silky &amp; less visible fine lines !</li>
            <li> This serum has helped my rosacia. I&#x27;ve tried many other products and this works the best. The only other solution before boots #7 would be to discontinue having a drink, but who wants to do that. I am very happy with the serum and will be trying their other products soon.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Not greasy, so doesn&#x27;t give me blemishes.  Keeps me nice and moisturized when used with a heavier base.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!  Love this product!</li>
            <li> No change noticed yet</li>
            <li> Smooth. Feels great. Will use this forever.</li>
            <li> Quickly absorbed. Nonsticky. Smoothes out fines lines and softening wrinkles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks and already see results. For the past week I have worn no foundation. My skin is smooth and spots appear to be less noticeable. The serum is light and silky.&lt;br /&gt;Con: can&#x27;t tell how much of the product is left. Plus I feel it should come in much larger sizes.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a few days, but it really has helped smooth my skin.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and it keeps my 70 year old skin beautiful!</li>
            <li> I have used Boots No7 Protect &amp; Perfect Serum for years. This was my first try with the &amp;#34;intense&amp;#34; product. I have oily skin, and this seemed to make that worse, so I am going to revert to the regular serum. Still love the product, as it has served me well for 3 years now!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> makes skin glow and firms skin also hides pores love will buy more</li>
            <li> Irritating the face and left a pink patch on my face, flaking and irritated.  I stopped a few days each time and gave it a few tries.  Didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very old and don&#x27;t have wrinkles but I have moderate acne. This serum has helped my skin heal and become softer and even out my skin tone. The red marks that having acne gives me is healed way faster when using this product. I feel my face is firmer and all together better. I use this along with nuetrogenas water gel moisturizer and I know longer have dry flaky red skin.</li>
            <li> Have just started using so no results yet.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what all the fuss is about.  The moisturizer is ok but slightly drying to the skin.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of it but I will wait and see if it actually works. So far nothing but its only been a month.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me at all.  I was targeting a line between my eyebrows, fine crows feet and lines around my mouth.  I used it for over a month and did not see any results whatsoever.  Might work on other people, but surely did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Works nicely. My skin is silky smooth right after using. Weeks later I noticed my skin is clearer and I can&#x27;t really notice pores that use to look like craters. Down side is that I tend to sneeze a lot after applying. I guess I must be allergic to an ingredientin it. But this product works beautifully.</li>
            <li> Just made skin soft..no improvement on wrinkles..</li>
            <li> A very effective serum.  No 7 really delivers. I will continue to use this and all the No 7 products.</li>
            <li> excellent product love it...</li>
            <li> Saw this product in a Dr. Phil&#x27;s Show and I decided to give it a try.. I like it, the price is great. This is my first week using it so I don&#x27;t know if I will be seeing a change soon as they described it, but I am happy with it..</li>
            <li> Good feel not heavy. Nice scent.</li>
            <li> Wonderful skincare product!!! Highly Recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Oh, I love this stuff. From the first time I used this I was so impressed. My skin feels like velvet! Wrinkles are going after only 1 week! I am using the glycol peel also. I sent for the day crème, night crème and eye serum. I will be 63 next month so if it&#x27;s working for me, imagine what it will do for you! I am also a life long sun baby who can&#x27;t use sun screens (I sweat them off immediately and it runs in to my eyes)</li>
            <li> Much smaller than anticipated</li>
            <li> Finally found something that works</li>
            <li> This product seems really good.Only used it  three times so far but can see a different in my skin.I now have a healthy glow,and for an older person this is awesome! If it softens the wrinkles in a couple of weeks thats a plus but I am now sold on Boots products, and will try the day and night cremes too:)</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and so far I feel it is really making my skin softer and more hydrated. I plan to continue using it?</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work &amp; was leaking when I received it!!! SMH</li>
            <li> Love! Leaves your skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Came fast and at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> Makes my skin softer.  Still to early to see if it helps with wrinkles. But will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This is my third or more order. I really like the feel of it on my skin. It will not erase or reduce wrinkles as promised, but it is a good product. Maybe if I faithfully used it morning and evening it would reduce wrinkles...just don&#x27;t know. But, I do really like the produce better than any I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be so good, guess I just don&#x27;t have the right type of skin.</li>
            <li> Love the product. My skin feels smooth after application.  However I can not comment on the effect on my wrinkles yet.</li>
            <li> No 7 was recommended by adermatologist.  It is smooth and effective.  Nothing works miracles, but I do see some lessening of fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> They saI&#x27;d you would see results in 2 weeks. I saw results in two days.</li>
            <li> Seems to help but I haven&#x27;t used it long eniough.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, with this product, I see no difference in my skin,I would never buy this again</li>
            <li> The product had a subtle scent to it.  I couldn&#x27;t smell it at all without putting my nose super close to it. It did have a very chemically smell though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum felt very nice and creamy.  I smoothed into my face nicely.  It didn&#x27;t seem very moisturizing though which is my number one thing to look for in facial products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I didn&#x27;t care too much for was, without thinking, I stuck my hand under the faucet.  The product that was still on my hand was super hard to get off with just water.  It had the same effect as an oil, most similar to coconut oil.  I totally did not expect that and it kind of turned me off of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I didn&#x27;t care too much for this product.  But, in it&#x27;s defense, I have no use for a product of this nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this product in the future.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper at Target.  Not the greatest, but not the worst.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve just finished my first bottle and am starting on the second.  It feels good, smooth without being greasy, and it helps my sensitive skin look hydrated and silky without being at all irritating.  As someone in my late 40s, I have a number of fine wrinkles, and I&#x27;ve only recently realized that I have to start doing a bit more than slapping on moisturizer.  I&#x27;m using this during the day (haven&#x27;t tried their eye cream yet) and RoC Retinol Correxion Sensitive Night Cream, and my skin is looking really nice.  It&#x27;s impossible to say which of the creams is most helping, or if both are, but I&#x27;m still very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;If you were having trouble figuring out the difference between the P&amp;P &amp;#34;Intense Advanced&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Intense,&amp;#34; apparently the &amp;#34;Intense Advanced&amp;#34; is the more recent innovation, designed for aging skin.

            <li> Love this product... have ordered 3x already</li>
            <li> Not seeing the results that I anticipated based on the reviews and other blogs written about this product. My guess is they paid a bunch of people to say good things and promote this product.</li>
            <li> My sister started using this &amp; we all noticed a difference in her complexion....So I waned to try it.  I have seen a good improvement in my skin texture. Seems smoother &amp; lines not as pronounced. I have to say that I have also been using the day &amp; night creams. All good products.</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizer.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> Used very little so it lasted me a long time and I felt like my skin looked better, more moist!</li>
            <li> Great Stuff!!!!!  Need some more.</li>
            <li> Best cream hands down!!</li>
            <li> Good product &amp; service</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now, I do see and feel the difference in my skin. Now that I live in Florida, and have very FAIR SKIN. I need to be very careful.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than target even with the cost  of shipping. Same product and it seems to work. Have seen some improvements. To soon to tell.</li>
            <li> I originally bought the Protect &amp; Perfect Intense Serum. As another reviewer stated there was a not too pleasant smell. I used it a few times. It made my skin feel very silky. However, the smell bothered me a lot. I come to find out that the Protect &amp; Perfect Intense Advanced Serum is their newest product. I figured since it was such a new product, it shouldn&#x27;t smell bad &amp; if the scent was the same as the previous one...then it was suppose to smell like that. To my delight the Intense Advanced formula did not have an unpleasant smell. Again, it made my skin feel nice &amp; silky. It really prepared my skin for the moisturizer. I use the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream. I only use the serum in the evening. So, I&#x27;m sure it will last me quite a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Review by Tom Chu&#x27;s wife.</li>
            <li> No 7 product is great,I did not try this as yet,still finishing upan old product.</li>
            <li> Great product. It truly does make a difference with my skin.</li>
            <li> Does not work wonders!</li>
            <li> Not really seeing any improvements to my face. I feel I have used this product long enough that I should see a little improvement. Disappointed in Missouri.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell.....It&#x27;s not a miracle..I like it.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable results, but it feels amazing!</li>
            <li> Love Boots No7 works great</li>
            <li> Very nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li> too soon to tell  much, but I like the way it feels on my face</li>
            <li> Boots No7 the best wrinkle cream EVER!</li>
            <li> This works great, I see a difference when used with the wrinkle filler...makeup goes on perfect and I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I was buying serums at the salon for $100 and moisturizers at $40 and nothing came close to these Boots products.  I am on my 6th bottle of this serum---and it lasts a long time!  Two pumps and you&#x27;re good for the day.  Complement it with the Day Cream and you&#x27;ll have a carefree, good skin day.  I had flaky dry/oily skin---rosacea-prone, sun-damaged, you name it (62 years old).  Now it looks and feels so much better and I don&#x27;t fuss about it any more!  The gal at the drug store was very sincere when telling me about it, and Thank Goodness I took the leap and purchased it. I coulda saved so much money... Also, their exfoliant and peeling masque products are fabulous, fun and easy to use. .Go for it!</li>
            <li> Every time i used the product i got serious breakouts..wish i could get my money back!</li>
            <li> When I first put some product onto my hands, you can smell the product which isn&#x27;t a pleasant smell. It smells like a chemical or something. It feels almost like a silicone feeling when applied to the skin. It applies well on the skin. This product did make me break out. The very next day, I woke up with several tiny bumps on both my left and right temples. I have oily skin and this did not make my face feel oily the next day which is a plus. However I won&#x27;t be using this or buying it because (1) it broke me out and I am not risking to try the product out again (2) the smell isn&#x27;t so great, it made me a little nauseous.</li>
            <li> I believe I heard about this on TV - not a commercial - and thought I&#x27;d give it a try and am glad I did!  While it&#x27;s hard for me to say I love any anti-wrinkle serum, (lots of wrinkles over my 63 years) but this one comes close.  It feels good and absorbs well.  I believe it is working.  I have used any number of quality creams, etc., over the years and am pretty critical of them - wouldn&#x27;t repurchase most of them, but this is definitely going on my list of &amp;#34;must haves&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> No improvement after one bottle, which lasted only a month if that long.</li>
    </ol>
