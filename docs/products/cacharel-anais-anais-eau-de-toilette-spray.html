            <li>Fresh and sweet without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume because it is the first my mother ever bought for me when I was little, so it has a special place in my heart, but still even if that were not the case, the scent is very appealing to me on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It</li>

            <li>For those who are looking for a light, pretty flowery subtle scent without giving yourself and everyone around you a chemical headache....</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s an old standby and keeping a bottle on hand is a must.</li>
            <li>Yes, she knows that she will always be getting it, but she still acts pleasantly surprised.</li>

            <li> Love it!  My favorite sent ever!!!</li>
            <li> I used this many years ago, so i ordered it since i seen it available on this sellers site for a resonable price. When i got the perfume it does not smell like i remember it on my. But they say perfumes can smell good in the bottle but not with your body chemistry. I asked the seller if i could exchange the item for equal price or i would even pay more for something i know i need. but the seller refused to take a back. I did tell her she needed to note on her web site all sales are final... so for the perfume it self great if your body chemistry matches but the seller was not that great not even trying to make her customers happy...anyway i will find someone who likes it and give it to them as a gift.</li>
            <li> still on the market after 30 years is one of the best</li>
            <li> I love this perfume because it is the first my mother ever bought for me when I was little, so it has a special place in my heart, but still even if that were not the case, the scent is very appealing to me on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does go on a little powdery at first but as it settles, it becomes more flowery, but not a bitter or \\&quot;bubble gummy\\&quot; flowery, if that makes sense. It&#x27;s a good, solid, well-balanced, musky lily and jasmine scent that says \\&quot;girly\\&quot; but not \\&quot;immature\\&quot;. It has a range that goes from \\&quot;innocent\\&quot; to \\&quot;graceful\\&quot;, it&#x27;s a perfume that you can grow up and grow old with, something that is timeless and feminine... Like Audrey Hepburn, like a classic Channel handbag, like a vintage pair of stilettos.</li>
            <li> For the price, the nicest sweetest scent on the market. It&#x27;s an old standby and keeping a bottle on hand is a must.</li>
            <li> A very rich, pretty scent!  I wore this in high school and still love it twenty years later.  It has a sort of &amp;#34;white,&amp;#34; creamy scent of gardenias mixed with another flower.  I only put on a small amount, because a little goes a long way with this particular fragrance (at least on my body), but it lasts all day.  I am so glad they are still making this perfume!</li>
            <li> If you like a different smell you might like this. Have used this perfume for 20 years. A friend gave me this for a birthday gift. I keep it among my favorites. Thanks to Amazon for having it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy anais anais. I started using it many years ago. It is fresh and very pleasant and not strong.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume since I was 15 still the same fresh makes you feel unique and fresh the whole day.</li>
            <li> Dose not stay with you fades fast</li>
            <li> Packaging is the same as the last bottle I purchased, but the fragrance is different. More pungent, doesn&#x27;t last as long. Will not purchase this item online again.</li>
            <li> I bought this spray for a family member. She&#x27;s been using it for years and enjoys it very much. The price was much better than in the department stores.</li>
            <li> every this is ok nice,only beacre full in send beacuse first time is lost becare full whit its ok nice thank you</li>
            <li> Loved it! Will be using this product again.</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne for many,many years at a fraction of regular store cost.</li>
            <li> Great product and quick delivery</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my Mom. It&#x27;s her favorite and one of my go-to scents too. Fresh and sweet without being overpowering. It&#x27;s a classic!</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my wife and she loves it!! :)</li>
            <li> I DIDN&#x27;T READ THE SIZE BEFORE ORDERING. I BOUGHT DOUBLE THE SIZE ON LINE FOR THE SAME MONEY.  I WILL NEED TO GO BACK TO MY FILES AND SEE WHERE I ORDERED IT.  SMELL IS GOOD THOUGH</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law insists on Anais Anais and she still gets it every year at Christmas time.  Yes, she knows that she will always be getting it, but she still acts pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has EVER smelled this perfume has fallen in love with it. It is beyond description. I could bathe in it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 9-year old daughter.  I loved this perfume as an teenager and wanted her to like it, too.  It has such a timeless lovely sent and she loves it, too.  It was delivered on time and I enjoyed the shopping experience with Amazon.  Way to go for Christmas shopping!</li>
            <li> Just love the aroma and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> My old favorite has returned! It has been over 20 years since I wore this perfume. For reasons not remembered, I switched to Eternity. Now my old love has returned. Great price &amp; great product. Was happy to see it return in front of my eyes! Thank you Amazon again!</li>
            <li> Wonderful old scent! Great price!</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume. What else is there to say?&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for her, and I she still loves it after using it for many years.</li>
            <li> All I wanted was a soft scent that was not overpowering.  I have used Anais Anais for years.  This order was the llabeled &amp;#34;original,&amp;#34; which is totally different.  A prettier bottle, but I don&#x27;t think a scent at all.</li>
            <li> Received very quickly , in perfect condition.  Beautiful scent and last.  This is a very good product, will buy again.</li>
            <li> For those who are looking for a light, pretty flowery subtle scent without giving yourself and everyone around you a chemical headache....search no more.&lt;br /&gt;I am one of those who suffers from throat lock up and headaches from so many perfume products.  This seems to be the only scent I can count on to not make me sick. One spritz on the back of neck and I&#x27;m feeling pretty all day long.</li>
            <li> great deal..my wifes favorite</li>
            <li> requested as a gift to other</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have found Anais Anais eau de toilette since the department stores no longer sell it.  I have been using it for several years and decided to try Amazon.  And, \\&quot;voila\\&quot;, there it was!  Thank you, Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful, very lush and flowery fragrance which was a gift for my mother. One if our all-time favorites. Arrived quickly. Well pkgd.</li>
            <li> A gift for my mom who requested this scent.  My mom has been wearing this for as long as I can remember.  If one of my sisters does not get it for her for Christmas, then I do.  Must have been my turn.</li>
            <li> This has been a favorite of my wife for years, still the same excellent quality as before. Excellent product would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I went to local department stores and found they had stopped stocking this favorite. I was equally delighted to find it on-line then and had the added benefit of not having to go to the mall to get it.</li>
