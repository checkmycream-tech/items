            <li>Leaves my face feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>was lucky to receive this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li>I originally couldn&#x27;t afford the higher priced items that compared to this</li>
            <li>It was a great decision to go with this product versus other higher priced ones.</li>
            <li>Its a great little package, and comes with everything to get the pampering job done.</li>
            <li>For the price its so worth it</li>
            <li>But other than that, its good.</li>
            <li>I will be honest, when I first got this and turned it on I though, &amp;#34;There is no way this is going to be powerful enough to cleanse my face&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>the rotation is just right.</li>
            <li>Really like this, just seems to lose power quickly.</li>
            <li>Stay away from this one, simply very cheaply made and will not last!</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t cost very much</li>
            <li>My face feels soft and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li>I bought a different brand as a replacement, but the cleansing power of this Loel brand was actually better.</li>
            <li>I have seen similar products that cost insanely more than this.</li>
            <li>I love the multiple attachments.</li>
            <li>it looks pretty feminine to be toting around.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty satisfied and have no intention of sending it back, I will, and have already been using it.</li>
            <li>Thanks for taking the time to read my review!</li>
            <li>Overall I would say good value for a basic hygiene tool.</li>
            <li>the four different head attachments: brush, sponge, massage roller, and pumice help in giving smooth skin right at your home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You can just pop them back in really easy but still....</li>
            <li>Nice little tool.</li>
            <li>Too weak to be very effective, no matter how often I swap out the batteries.</li>
            <li>It worked amazingly well for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I expected more for the price.</li>
            <li>the power on this item is very week ......</li>
            <li>but I really wanted something like this.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m giving it a five because it works very well.</li>
            <li>I really could feel it working.</li>
            <li>Very nice,very mobile.</li>
            <li>The product did very well.</li>
            <li>Afterwards my face is really smooth and usually stays pretty smooth for about 2 days after.</li>
            <li>very upset about the purchase.</li>
            <li>It really gets into your pores and leaves your face glowing</li>
            <li>This product is really good at removing old dead skin particals.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, not very powerful though.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s okay .</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the pumice stone yet, mainly because I bought it for my face and haven&#x27;t had the time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t go with the more expensive choices I was considering.</li>
            <li>Yes I sure like this little scrubber.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and was pleasantly surprised at how much I have used it since I received</li>
            <li>I use it after I take off all my makeup to get the extra dirt off my face and it pretty much helped to  clear my face.</li>
            <li>Brush stopped working even after new batteries were put in.</li>
            <li>It is a basic electric motor brush that is geared to give it a little more torque</li>
            <li>have seen similar products in the market for very high price</li>
            <li>I try to provide you with simple reviews that get straight to the point without a lot of jargon or repeating the product description.</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s 11 years old</li>
            <li>With that, the brush itself rotates at about 60 rpm on high with a low speed setting that is about 2/3</li>
            <li>The brush attachment has stiff bristles that leave my skin feeling nice and tight.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine, but if you try to use the sponge for microdermabrasion it&#x27;s not strong enough.</li>
            <li>soft enough to accomodate people with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the other attachments much but see how they could be useful on a callouss and the other for removing makeup.</li>
            <li>This little kit carries a powerful punch.  </li>
            <li>I apply my facial cleanser directly to the brush and use it as an applicator too.</li>
            <li>The different brushes for different functions provide a complete skin care.</li>
            <li>I leaves my face soft and clean after every use, it may not be for those with sensitive skin due to the fact that  the brush is a little rough, but I don&#x27;t mind  .</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a timer, so you should time how long you&#x27;re using the device on your skin, as it is a bit rough and may leave your face pretty red if you use for too long per session.</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a timer, so you should time how long you&#x27;re using the device on your skin, as it is a bit rough and may leave your face pretty red if you use for too long per session.</li>

            <li> Unfortunately, the case arrived with a flimsy closure that broke off in the first ten seconds of opening the packaging.  </li>
            <li> I was really anxious to get this product in the mail simply because it is a 4-in-1 product that you can use for different parts of your body.  </li>
            <li> It was money well spent.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> but i got the pink instead</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a product to give you a deep cleaning a few times a week this is it.</li>
            <li> and I spent under 10 on it</li>
            <li> I plan on using rechargeables in it to cut down on AA battery usage.</li>
            <li> Not worth a dime!  </li>
            <li> Very fast delivery, I was a little disappointed in the product as it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped, but it does do what its advertised to do just not very powerful.....</li>
            <li> I use this everyday 😁</li>
            <li> After using for a few weeks the switch froze and stopped working.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the same thing, not happy.</li>
            <li> Water got inside and killed it.</li>
            <li> then the spinning began to slow down and even stopped ...</li>
            <li> but the brush is little bit too hard</li>
            <li> Very little power for exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if its my skin having problems</li>
            <li> Again I&#x27;m not sure if is this product</li>
            <li> It slows to a stop with a small amount of pressure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it about 10 times now and am noticing the batteries getting a little tired.</li>
            <li> this brush turns so slow.. cannot imagine it being exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Very weak product.</li>
            <li> but let me tell you how wrong I was</li>
            <li> I bought it as a trial to see what the expensive ones might do for me, and I don&#x27;t even think I&#x27;m going to need to buy another !</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;massaging&amp;#34; attachment is worthless, I thought my hair would get caught in it and get ripped out.</li>
            <li> Horrible product, broke after 2 uses.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This product is just ok. One of the reasons I bought it was because it came with it&#x27;s own case and I thought that would make this portable for overnight trips.  Unfortunately, the case arrived with a flimsy closure that broke off in the first ten seconds of opening the packaging.  So while the product works fine, if I put the case in an overnight bag, the brush and attachments would fall out of the case almost immediately.  I expected more for the price.</li>
            <li> Really like this, just seems to lose power quickly. I can see going through a lot of batteries with this. Wish I had a rechargeable one. I like the various heads for it though!</li>
            <li> Very little power for exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Looks and actually is cheap. Immediate send back.</li>
            <li> Horrible product, broke after 2 uses.</li>
            <li> The facial bush kit is a dream. All of the heads work. It&#x27;s compact for easy carrying. Leaves my face feeling clean and fresh. It does not come with AAA batteries so make sure you have some on hand if you intend to use it immediately after getting it.</li>
            <li> The product worked for two weeks.. then the spinning began to slow down and even stopped ... im guessing its not waterproof.. now i need to purchase  another cleaner</li>
            <li> amazing product for a really great price.&lt;br /&gt;I have seen similar products in the market for very high price but this one is very reasonable and also comes with so many attachment.&lt;br /&gt;The box in which it comes in is really cute. It has slots for keeping the brush and extra heads all in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product in itself is very good. The different brushes for different functions provide a complete skin care. the four different head attachments: brush, sponge, massage roller, and pumice help in giving smooth skin right at your home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this twice a week and get a glow just like i would if i went for a salon facial. Now i do not need to spend extra money at the salon. I can look gorgeous conveniently and economically right at home.&lt;br /&gt;This product did not give me any problems and worked smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky to receive this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li> It would be absolutley perfect if the little balls on one of the applicators wouldn&#x27;t fall off after you put it away.....You can just pop them back in really easy but still....</li>
            <li> the power on this item is very week ...... but it does its job</li>
            <li> Really good ! I asked for a blue one but they gave me a pink one. But other than that, its good.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for&lt;br /&gt;Cute toy or maybe pre teen</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price! Its a great little package, and comes with everything to get the pampering job done. This is great for a girls party or sleepover, and I love the cute case it comes in! Def. worth the wait!</li>
            <li> soft enough to accomodate people with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> nice to have, perfectly done what l needed for my personal pumper facial cleaning. For the price its so worth it</li>
            <li> I originally couldn&#x27;t afford the higher priced items that compared to this but I really wanted something like this. When I received the product, I was very satisfied with how it works. Just put in the batteries and go! I personally received a pink case with a pink massager and I love using it. My face feels soft and smooth after using it. It was a great decision to go with this product versus other higher priced ones. It was money well spent.</li>
            <li> Needed a back up for remote or at home facials. Not what I expected. But got the job done. Recommend</li>
            <li> This facial cleaner provides the perfect amount of spin and pressure for a good cleanse. My only concern is that it broke soon after I bought it. I don&#x27;t know if it was just a faulty one, or if it is made too cheaply. I bought a different brand as a replacement, but the cleansing power of this Loel brand was actually better.</li>
            <li> Brush stopped working even after new batteries were put in. DONT BUY!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if its my skin having problems but I have a oily T zone,all of a sudden my face is really dry. Again I&#x27;m not sure if is this product BUT I like. Also I feel burning after</li>
            <li> Nice little tool. Doesn&#x27;t have a timer, so you should time how long you&#x27;re using the device on your skin, as it is a bit rough and may leave your face pretty red if you use for too long per session. Rated it with 4 stars bc it would&#x27;ve been great if the brush rotated both ways, however,  for the price the brush is well worth it :-).</li>
            <li> This little kit carries a powerful punch.  Make sure you use good batteries and not the dollar store batteries because they don&#x27;t give it much power.  This product works just as good if not better than the expensive one.  The devise itself is not waterproof so don&#x27;t make the mistake of running it under water to clean the heads.</li>
            <li> It cleans my skin and makes my face feel so smooth. I haven&#x27;t tried the pumice stone yet, mainly because I bought it for my face and haven&#x27;t had the time. I have not had problems with it not working with the used batteries I have and it works great to wash my face in the shower!</li>
            <li> This little tool isn&#x27;t of the best quality but I&#x27;m giving it a five because it works very well. I leaves my face soft and clean after every use, it may not be for those with sensitive skin due to the fact that  the brush is a little rough, but I don&#x27;t mind  .</li>
            <li> The brush is so soft I love it! I use this everyday 😁✌️✨</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have seen similar products that cost insanely more than this. I love the multiple attachments. The only reason that I gave it four stars and not five is because only the head can get wet. The body is not waterproof.</li>
            <li> I loooove it!!! works well and the rotation is just right.</li>
            <li> Love to you makes my skin feel really good!!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice.I like the case to to keep everything neat and clean. works great clearing blackheads leaving my skin fresh and smooth.just use good quality batterys.</li>
            <li> Yes I sure like this little scrubber.  It gets rid of the goop and gunk in my pores.  Wish I had bought this before I bought all those cleansers, talk about saving money!!</li>
            <li> Same one I bought before.  After using for a few weeks the switch froze and stopped working.  I purchased the same thing, not happy.</li>
            <li> The brush could&#x27;ve been faster . It came within literally two days . Other than that it&#x27;s okay .</li>
            <li> Bought for my granddaughter for Christmas. She likes it and it does great for her.</li>
            <li> It worked amazingly well for a few weeks. Water got inside and killed it. For the price it did what it said it would do but I would rather invest in a more sturdy product.</li>
            <li> Too weak to be very effective, no matter how often I swap out the batteries. Sometimes the switch turns the unit on, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t, on two out of two I have owned. Spend more for a more powerful cleanser or nail buffer. Skip this one!</li>
            <li> This is not one of those &amp;#34;Sonic&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Micro-pulse&amp;#34; brushes you see for $30+. It is a basic electric motor brush that is geared to give it a little more torque so you get a nice scrub. With that, the brush itself rotates at about 60 rpm on high with a low speed setting that is about 2/3 that. The brush attachment has stiff bristles that leave my skin feeling nice and tight. I apply my facial cleanser directly to the brush and use it as an applicator too. I haven&#x27;t used the other attachments much but see how they could be useful on a callouss and the other for removing makeup. The &amp;#34;massaging&amp;#34; attachment is worthless, I thought my hair would get caught in it and get ripped out. I&#x27;ve used it about 10 times now and am noticing the batteries getting a little tired. I plan on using rechargeables in it to cut down on AA battery usage. Mine was pink, I wish there was an option for a different color since as a dude it looks pretty feminine to be toting around. Overall I would say good value for a basic hygiene tool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the jafra one, it&#x27;s amazing it doesn&#x27;t bring as many brushes though. This one does it&#x27;s job for the price, it may be slow if you don&#x27;t have the right batteries but over all I love it cause it does the job for it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> I will be honest, when I first got this and turned it on I though, &amp;#34;There is no way this is going to be powerful enough to cleanse my face&amp;#34;. But I decided to give it a try. I shaved, and used the brush attachment with a facial cleanser. I really could feel it working. I then applied my aftershave to the sponge applicator and am really impressed with what this product could do. For the price it gets the job done. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t go with the more expensive choices I was considering.</li>
            <li> I love this thing! I bought it as a trial to see what the expensive ones might do for me, and I don&#x27;t even think I&#x27;m going to need to buy another ! The pumice attachment is perfect for getting rid of dry skin, and the brush makes my skin feel so soft afterwards ! I love it 💜</li>
            <li> I was really anxious to get this product in the mail simply because it is a 4-in-1 product that you can use for different parts of your body.  It includes a callus remover which is perfect for getting your feet soft and smooth for the upcoming summer months as well as using it as a facial cleaning system and a massaging tool. This product is simple and easy to use and it comes in a handy little case and is perfect for traveling.  I highly recommend this product and was pleasantly surprised at how much I have used it since I received it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for my honest thoughts and opinions.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the greenish/blue but i got the pink instead and my wife hates pink.i should have ask for the greenish one.</li>
            <li> I like it but the brush is little bit too hard</li>
            <li> Very nice,very mobile.</li>
            <li> I HAD ONE YEARS AGO! I LOVED THE WAY IT WORKED SO I ORDERED ANOTHER ONE. I LOVE THE WAY MY SKIN LOOKS AND FEELS AFTER USING IT!</li>
            <li> Cheap!  Worked a week!  Not worth a dime!  Stay away from this one, simply very cheaply made and will not last!</li>
            <li> I like this product but i would like instructions with it.  The price is good too.  I bought two so I can give one as a gift.  Just a note:  Doesn&#x27;t work well with cheap batteries.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, not very powerful though.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. Brushes did not spin. Changed batteries several times but&lt;br /&gt;still didn&#x27;t rotate.</li>
            <li> The product did very well.I&#x27;m very happy with product.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery, I was a little disappointed in the product as it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped, but it does do what its advertised to do just not very powerful.....it didn&#x27;t cost very much so I probably should have realized if wouldn&#x27;t have the power I had hoped.  But al in all I&#x27;m pretty satisfied and have no intention of sending it back, I will, and have already been using it.</li>
            <li> I cant say enough good stuff about this product. I use this with a cream cleanser with Benzoyl Peroxide and a Oatmeal exfoliating cleanser. Afterwards my face is really smooth and usually stays pretty smooth for about 2 days after. This product is really good at removing old dead skin particals. I have only used the brush and not any of the other tools that come with. If you are looking for a product to give you a deep cleaning a few times a week this is it. All in all I recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Very weak product. It stops spinning the second it touches my face. I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> If you use the brush with cleanser it&#x27;s fine, but if you try to use the sponge for microdermabrasion it&#x27;s not strong enough. It slows to a stop with a small amount of pressure.</li>
            <li> this brush turns so slow.. cannot imagine it being exfoliating. very upset about the purchase.</li>
            <li> My teen age granddaughter thinks its a miricale worker</li>
            <li> Good product. Arrived on time. Works great and leaves my face feeling good.</li>
            <li> So far so good! I can feel the difference in my face. It feels so clean.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:4b1c2ed6f39f205034c08c64f1e32ef2]] This is a nice product for keeping my skin beautiful.
