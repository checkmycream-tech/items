    <ol>
            <li>Awesome product.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff!</li>
            <li>ALSO I find that this works best if you purchase the day eye cream and use it together.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Prevage Eye serum is the best...</li>
            <li>A very good prize and quality of production.</li>
            <li>Good luck everyone!</li>
            <li>The good is very famous and having very excellent effection on whitening.</li>
            <li>Love it the best, can&#x27;t be out of it!</li>
            <li>-- One thing I noticed is that the lady that sold it to me has beautiful skin and specially around her eyes.  </li>
            <li>The person at the spa who sold it to me said most of her clients get good results; maybe it just doesn&#x27;t work on everybody.  </li>
            <li>It would have been nice if there was a trial size; this way I wouldn&#x27;t have had to spend $70 on something that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I have tried La Mer, and many of Lancomes eye products, Dermalogica, and chanel to name a few of the best brands, and this is the best yet...</li>
            <li>Always works, Prevage by Elizabeth Arden is the best treatment I have try so far</li>
            <li>Have used this product for many years &amp; am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>and they love it as well.  </li>
            <li>And it truly works :)  ...</li>
            <li>About to try their lash enhancer :)</li>
            <li>I love Prevage...</li>
            <li>Whenever I try something else, I&#x27;m never as satisfied as I am with Prevage.</li>
            <li>keeps eyes bright and young looking.</li>
            <li>I am on my  second prevage eye serum, and I must say, I love it!!</li>
            <li>Great for dark circles</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for several months and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>The bottle will last you for many months!</li>
            <li>Great for Asian skin in early 40s.</li>
            <li>It definitely is worth the price.</li>
            <li>It is in an airtight pump container, so you get a fresh dab of serum every time.</li>
            <li>I think the investment is worth it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smear my eye makeup and really brightens eye area.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Real deal.</li>
            <li>Be sure to depress the top straight down and not at an angle to dispense the serum.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, however, the pump does not work properly and the product does not seem to last as long as the ones I purchase in the store.</li>
            <li>It is a great product although it is somewhat expensive.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if I would use it alone, but as a combination it is potent ...</li>
            <li>Comes boxed in an overly fancy sliding thing with clear window...</li>
            <li>I have clear smooth skin with a few wrinkles coming up.  </li>
            <li>and I have mostly just thin lines and a tiny bit of eye puffiness, but</li>
            <li>I am 27 and notided crows feet which really scared me, I also used to show dark circles</li>

            <li> I am 27 and notided crows feet which really scared me, I also used to show dark circles</li>
            <li> ; like i usually get from other eye creams in the past, and the formula is moisturizing and light creamy, without being greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is the bottle is almost the size of a can of hair mousse, and 0.5 ounce I suspect takes up less than half the container.</li>
            <li> Other eye cosmetics often do make my eyes itch</li>
            <li> I have been using this product every day for the past 5-6 weeks and have seen absolutely no results.  </li>
            <li> Actually, the puffiness around my eyes looks worse.  </li>
            <li> I use both creams twice a day, everyday.</li>
            <li> Tried it but not sure it worked</li>
            <li> Sometimes I will try other less expensive eye creams when I run out of Prevage.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 30s</li>
            <li> but nothing really dramatic.  </li>
            <li> and now I dont even see them! :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great for Asian skin in early 40s. No &amp;#34;white dots&amp;#34; like i usually get from other eye creams in the past, and the formula is moisturizing and light creamy, without being greasy or heavy. Doesn&#x27;t smear my eye makeup and really brightens eye area. My only gripe is the bottle is almost the size of a can of hair mousse, and 0.5 ounce I suspect takes up less than half the container. Comes boxed in an overly fancy sliding thing with clear window...peeves me when manufacturers over-package.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I bought this item. I even bought an extra one to give to my sister. It definitely is worth the price. My eye wrinkles diminish over time after using this serum. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, however, the pump does not work properly and the product does not seem to last as long as the ones I purchase in the store.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years &amp; am pleased with the results.  I have allergies &amp; this eye serum does not make my eyes itch.  Other eye cosmetics often do make my eyes itch so I am sticking with this one.</li>
            <li> My wife always has be get this from Amazon whenever she runs out.  She uses it all the time and loves it!</li>
            <li> Great for dark circles</li>
            <li> I have been using this product every day for the past 5-6 weeks and have seen absolutely no results.  I am in my late 30s and I have mostly just thin lines and a tiny bit of eye puffiness, but this did nothing to help either of those issues at all.  Actually, the puffiness around my eyes looks worse.  The person at the spa who sold it to me said most of her clients get good results; maybe it just doesn&#x27;t work on everybody.  I will never buy this product again.  Very disappointed.  It would have been nice if there was a trial size; this way I wouldn&#x27;t have had to spend $70 on something that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several months and am very pleased with it. The price on Amazon saves me over the store costs.</li>
            <li> Husband bought this for me. Awesome product. Real deal. Leaves skin feeling velvety. Waiting for results(too soon to tell).Great buy!!</li>
            <li> It is a great product although it is somewhat expensive. It works well and I will continue to order and use it.</li>
            <li> Love it the best, can&#x27;t be out of it! Always works, Prevage by Elizabeth Arden is the best treatment I have try so far</li>
            <li> This is great stuff! I have used it for years - switched to something else being promoted by another company - and ALWAYS return to this!!!</li>
            <li> A very good prize and quality of production. The good is very famous and having very excellent effection on whitening.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I will try other less expensive eye creams when I run out of Prevage. And then the crows&#x27; feet start coming back!  Nothing moisturizes the eye area like this product. It is in an airtight pump container, so you get a fresh dab of serum every time. Be sure to depress the top straight down and not at an angle to dispense the serum. I have firmer and smoother skin around my eye in my 60&#x27;s because of Prevage eye serum. The bottle will last you for many months!</li>
            <li> I have clear smooth skin with a few wrinkles coming up.  I think it helps somwhat but nothing really dramatic.  It does soften the skin.  I would probably buy it again if it was cheaper but I find that it does not work enough for me to pay the price it did of $67.00 plus shipping and handling.</li>
            <li> I am on my  second prevage eye serum, and I must say, I love it!! I have tried La Mer, and many of Lancomes eye products, Dermalogica, and chanel to name a few of the best brands, and this is the best yet... ALSO I find that this works best if you purchase the day eye cream and use it together. I am not sure if I would use it alone, but as a combination it is potent ... it is incredible.&lt;br /&gt;I have told a lot of friends about it and they love it as well.  I am 27 and notided crows feet which really scared me, I also used to show dark circles and now I dont even see them! :( -- One thing I noticed is that the lady that sold it to me has beautiful skin and specially around her eyes.  I think the investment is worth it. I use both creams twice a day, everyday. And it truly works :)  ...About to try their lash enhancer :) Good luck everyone!</li>
            <li> I love Prevage...I&#x27;ve been using it for years and I&#x27;m very happy with the results. Whenever I try something else, I&#x27;m never as satisfied as I am with Prevage.</li>
            <li> Tried it but not sure it worked</li>
            <li> May work for some people; but it made my under eye area puff up like never before.  Maybe I am allergic; but I have no problem with the Prevage MD for my face.</li>
            <li> Prevage Eye serum is the best...I use every day.. keeps eyes bright and young looking. This and the face serum are the only products I use and would recommend without reservation</li>
            <li> Save your money. Product does nothing. Very disappointed</li>
