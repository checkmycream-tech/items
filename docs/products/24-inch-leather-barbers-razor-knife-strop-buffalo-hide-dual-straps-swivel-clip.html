            <li>Great price for a great product.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Used the money saved on on some WM Nueman soaps or a really nice brush.</li>
            <li>Made from very cheap materials.</li>
            <li>ive gave this for my dad on his birthday and love it&lt;</li>
            <li>Good product, useful for sharpening knives.</li>
            <li>I was able to remove the beige leather by unscrewing the top nut on the strop.</li>
            <li>OK, so its not what is described, I didn&#x27;t get the correct product.  </li>
            <li>…..YOU COULD FIND A BETTER STROP ELSEWHERE…</li>
            <li>This strop helped put a great shaving edge on my vintage straight razors.</li>
            <li>Spend more money and get something better.  </li>
            <li>But a have it two stars because atleast the leather strap is ok quality.</li>
            <li>The rouge can stick better if I use a lighter to go through it melting it in the process.</li>
            <li>Great price for the features it offers - dual straps.</li>
            <li>The leather is from Pakistan, that may be the reason why it is cheap and good real leather.</li>
            <li>You use it to heat up the blade you are about to strop which in turns makes your stropping task much faster and more effective.</li>
            <li>it doesnt take compound as well as some nice leather, but its good enough.</li>
            <li>A good honest seller who reduces the mail charges with multiple items purchased.</li>
            <li>Ok, Best I have found so far, just not the quality I have found on the old barber chairs.</li>
            <li>and you have a pretty nice strop for knife sharpening.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it has pretty thick, semi spongey leather, which is good because it is forgiving, and if you are a newbie knife sharpener it is perfect.</li>
            <li>If the description and picture of the product i was buying was accurate.</li>
            <li>Have not used it enough to give a great review</li>
            <li>Those strops of days gone by just don&#x27;t seem to be available from anyone for any price.</li>
            <li>This product is actually two 12 inch strops and they are decent at best.</li>
            <li>you want higher quality you have to pay more.  </li>
            <li>however i am pretty sure that&#x27;s not such a good idea,</li>
            <li>Works well, nothing special.</li>
            <li>I am still learning a good technique to use this item properly.</li>
            <li>A good product indeed especially when you need to touch up your kitchen knives.</li>
            <li>It kept getting in my way of using he awesome back side of the use able dark leather piece.</li>
            <li>Fell apart rather quickly.</li>
            <li>This does exactly as it should!  </li>
            <li>MEDIOCRE AT BEST</li>
            <li>This is my second strop and is much better than my first beginner strop.</li>
            <li>I have tried many blades on it, and if anything it makes them more dull</li>
            <li>Gives a nice sharp edge to my razor!</li>
            <li>Pretty decent.  </li>
            <li>its amazing but i digress), but it just made the useless lighter leather stiffer and more creased.</li>
            <li>bought 3 of these for me and my roommates who are getting into straight shaving.</li>
            <li>This strop comes in 2 piece held together by a stainless steel gold plated holder.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and prompt.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting very much from a strop at this price point but was surprised by the quality.</li>
            <li>As I am new to the straight razor shave and strop</li>
            <li>one of the strops had a significant gouge in the top middle portion [not cool] but salvageable as long as I avoid that part and 2)</li>
            <li>The only explanation to that is it&#x27;s suede which would explain why it sucked in the first place as a strop.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty low grade</li>
            <li>The black leather side has a sort of nylon fabric on the opposite side, I love this part of it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item to replace my twenty year old strop.</li>
            <li>The leather strop finishes my blades to near surgical grade .</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>The black leather piece is a decent strop and worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have  been sharpening knives, straight razors, and anything with an edge for a long time.</li>
            <li>but I had no issue with crease damage, perhaps this was due to the humid northern summer weather here in Wisconsin but at any rate the product works well enough and certainly maintains the edge on my straight razor so for that I recommend it.</li>
            <li>I can tell you this is a mid level quality and is barely good enough to use on a straight razor, but if your on a budget, you probably wont beat this for the price and as long as you have a goodwet stone of at least 8000 grit or above, this strop will definitely get the finishing job done.</li>
            <li>Keeps my straight razor sharp</li>
            <li>/&gt;i can hold up news paper by one corner, and cut the other end of the newspaper without it bending, and that is really saying something.</li>
            <li>the creases it comes with are hard to get out, though i was finally able to get them out on the soft black leather side with the use of Ballistol on it</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Shipped folded and now there is a big crease in it and anyone who has sharpened anything knows you need a flat surface.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a fast way to keep a sharp knife sharp then this is what you want.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say the length is long enough.  </li>
            <li> My only issue is that I wish the strop was 3in which is roughly the size of my blade</li>
            <li> there is a competition on yt to see who can get their knives sharp enough to do that with computer paper, and that is alot stiffer than news</li>
            <li> The strop is about 18 inch long and 2 inch wide.</li>
            <li> Quality is as expected.  </li>
            <li> and I am here to tell you not to use the harder, lighter piece of leather.</li>
            <li> I now began to understand why a leather strop is used instead of a wet stone.</li>
            <li> Well nothing technical involved in the product, so the origin is not important.</li>
            <li> load this up with some green compound and lay it on a flat two by 4</li>
            <li> I will always have a sharp razor</li>
            <li> (remember to draw towards the back of the blade to avoid cutting the leather) and I can save the time of using the wet stone frequently.</li>
            <li> As a beginner it takes some time and practice to get it down.</li>
            <li> ive got my knife very sharp with this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The black strop suited my needs as the beige one feels way too rugged.</li>
            <li> Little hardware defects.</li>
            <li> The 2nd strop is much harder and in my opinion useless.</li>
            <li> I also bought the green colour rouge to apply on the leather to enhance the stopping effect.</li>
            <li> Just need to strop it a few times</li>
            <li> I sharpen something with blade on it at least once a day on average</li>
            <li> but it came with a beige leather strop which was a thick stiff hunk of leather.</li>
            <li> One piece seems to be a synthetic canvas like material for honing and another piece of thick cowhide.</li>
            <li> Not sure it is buffalo hide!</li>
            <li> but I feel its too thin and no very good leather.</li>
            <li> and I was glad that it can be hung straightaway for use without the dreadful kink in the leather through bad packing.</li>
            <li> There are worse products out there.</li>
            <li> there was no canvas portion of the strop like advertised but rather a felt backing to the thin leather.</li>
            <li> NOT WELL MADE, THIN LEATHER STRIPES…</li>
            <li> WTF Amazon!?  </li>
            <li> Then you have the gall to tell me \\&quot;too bad, so sad!\\&quot;    </li>
            <li> Well I was disappointed because I was hoping looking for a stop strap with a cnavas strap.</li>

            <li> Shipped folded and now there is a big crease in it and anyone who has sharpened anything knows you need a flat surface. Cheap and thin save your money.</li>
            <li> It works great but I feel its too thin and no very good leather.</li>
            <li> Meh. Pretty decent.  Have not used it enough to give a great review but here are some words anyway.</li>
            <li> ive gave this for my dad on his birthday and love it&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> Quality is as expected.  Equal to the cash you dish out.  I you want higher quality you have to pay more.  I&#x27;d say the length is long enough.  There are worse products out there.</li>
            <li> Fell apart rather quickly. Made from very cheap materials.</li>
            <li> Ok, Best I have found so far, just not the quality I have found on the old barber chairs. Those strops of days gone by just don&#x27;t seem to be available from anyone for any price.</li>
            <li> purchased as a gift. they came on time and as described, just what he wanted</li>
            <li> This does exactly as it should!  Gives a nice sharp edge to my razor!</li>
            <li> Good product, useful for sharpening knives.</li>
            <li> For the price its great. Little hardware defects. But its a great size and price</li>
            <li> bought 3 of these for me and my roommates who are getting into straight shaving. The product works well enough to maintain the edge on my blade. The leather feels kinda cheap and thin but it came with a beige leather strop which was a thick stiff hunk of leather. I was able to remove the beige leather by unscrewing the top nut on the strop. The black strop suited my needs as the beige one feels way too rugged. I gave this a 3 star for a couple reasons: 1) one of the strops had a significant gouge in the top middle portion [not cool] but salvageable as long as I avoid that part and 2) there was no canvas portion of the strop like advertised but rather a felt backing to the thin leather. When the package arrived the strop was folded but I had no issue with crease damage, perhaps this was due to the humid northern summer weather here in Wisconsin but at any rate the product works well enough and certainly maintains the edge on my straight razor so for that I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Keeps my straight razor sharp</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a fast way to keep a sharp knife sharp then this is what you want. Great price for the features it offers - dual straps.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to replace my twenty year old strop. Well made and works great . However no documents were provided to explain the use of the composite strop that came with the kit. The leather strop finishes my blades to near surgical grade .</li>
            <li> The black leather piece is a decent strop and worth the money. the creases it comes with are hard to get out, though i was finally able to get them out on the soft black leather side with the use of Ballistol on it (i swear Ballistol  works on everything, its amazing but i digress), but it just made the useless lighter leather stiffer and more creased. The only explanation to that is it&#x27;s suede which would explain why it sucked in the first place as a strop. However, the reason i am giving this product a 1 star, is because this product is not as described, not even close. This product is actually two 12 inch strops and they are decent at best. If the description and picture of the product i was buying was accurate. i would have given this 4 stars. The black leather side has a sort of nylon fabric on the opposite side, I love this part of it. You use it to heat up the blade you are about to strop which in turns makes your stropping task much faster and more effective. The 2nd strop is much harder and in my opinion useless. I have tried many blades on it, and if anything it makes them more dull then they were when finished sharping the blade on my 1200 grit diamond stone. I have  been sharpening knives, straight razors, and anything with an edge for a long time. I sharpen something with blade on it at least once a day on average so i am very good at this art and I am here to tell you not to use the harder, lighter piece of leather. Its garbage and i just threw it away finally. It kept getting in my way of using he awesome back side of the use able dark leather piece. And nothing even came on the back side of the lighter leather piece, you could use it with some strop paste or aluminum oxide however i am pretty sure that&#x27;s not such a good idea, hence why i threw the piece away. I can tell you this is a mid level quality and is barely good enough to use on a straight razor, but if your on a budget, you probably wont beat this for the price and as long as you have a goodwet stone of at least 8000 grit or above, this strop will definitely get the finishing job done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a 24&amp;#34; strop, it&#x27;s 2 12&amp;#34; strops.&lt;br /&gt;For the money it&#x27;s a great product, the buffalo hide strop is in pristine condition and works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;The poly strop has cupping issues.</li>
            <li> Good product. Well made. I&#x27;m going to order another one.</li>
            <li> I would like to call B.S. on this!!    I just got this in the mail today and it is 2 strips of leather with no canvas.  OK, so its not what is described, I didn&#x27;t get the correct product.  Mistakes happen.    Here&#x27;s the B.S. part, this product is NOT eligible for return!  WTF Amazon!?  You wanted my money and you got it! I wanted the strop as shown and described and I did not get it...! Then you have the gall to tell me \\&quot;too bad, so sad!\\&quot;    (Additionally, I have uploaded a photo of the strop that I actually received so everyone who is considering this can know what they can expect)</li>
            <li> NOT WELL MADE, THIN LEATHER STRIPES…….DEFINITELY NOT WHAT YOU WOULD FIND IN AN OLDE TIME BARBER SHOP……MEDIOCRE AT BEST…..YOU COULD FIND A BETTER STROP ELSEWHERE…SAVE YOUR MONEY…..</li>
            <li> Mar in the leather on one side. Functional, but not in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in great condition. As I am new to the straight razor shave and strop I am still learning a good technique to use this item properly. But it&#x27;s great quality and would recommend it to anyone. My only issue is that I wish the strop was 3in which is roughly the size of my blade so I don&#x27;t have to maneuver the blade across it to strop it. As a beginner it takes some time and practice to get it down. YouTube helped a lot.</li>
            <li> Does the job. Not sure it is buffalo hide!</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product. This strop helped put a great shaving edge on my vintage straight razors. I was not expecting very much from a strop at this price point but was surprised by the quality. Save the money and buy this strop. Used the money saved on on some WM Nueman soaps or a really nice brush.</li>
            <li> load this up with some green compound and lay it on a flat two by 4 and you have a pretty nice strop for knife sharpening. it doesnt take compound as well as some nice leather, but its good enough. ive got my knife very sharp with this.&lt;br /&gt;i can hold up news paper by one corner, and cut the other end of the newspaper without it bending, and that is really saying something. there is a competition on yt to see who can get their knives sharp enough to do that with computer paper, and that is alot stiffer than news paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it has pretty thick, semi spongey leather, which is good because it is forgiving, and if you are a newbie knife sharpener it is perfect.</li>
            <li> Spend more money and get something better.  It&#x27;s pretty low grade</li>
            <li> Well I was disappointed because I was hoping looking for a stop strap with a cnavas strap. What I received was a leather strap and a plyleather strap wll felt on the backside. But a have it two stars because atleast the leather strap is ok quality.</li>
            <li> Wore out already.  However, it worked well while it lasted.</li>
            <li> I will always have a sharp razor</li>
            <li> I bought this as a memory of my father who use this type of strop to sharpen his shaving razor. I now began to understand why a leather strop is used instead of a wet stone. This will retain the sharpness of the blade and at the same time does not wear out the metal of the blade. This strop comes in 2 piece held together by a stainless steel gold plated holder. One piece seems to be a synthetic canvas like material for honing and another piece of thick cowhide. Package came well packed and I was glad that it can be hung straightaway for use without the dreadful kink in the leather through bad packing. The strop is about 18 inch long and 2 inch wide. I also bought the green colour rouge to apply on the leather to enhance the stopping effect. The rouge can stick better if I use a lighter to go through it melting it in the process. A good product indeed especially when you need to touch up your kitchen knives. Just need to strop it a few times (remember to draw towards the back of the blade to avoid cutting the leather) and I can save the time of using the wet stone frequently. The leather is from Pakistan, that may be the reason why it is cheap and good real leather. Well nothing technical involved in the product, so the origin is not important. A good honest seller who reduces the mail charges with multiple items purchased. Delivery was fast and prompt.</li>
            <li> Works well, nothing special.</li>
            <li> Wow. I just got a $40.00 strop for $15.00. Quite a deal. This is my second strop and is much better than my first beginner strop.</li>
