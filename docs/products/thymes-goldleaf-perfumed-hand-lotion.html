            <li>Smells good too.</li>
            <li>good smell and nice feeling.</li>
            <li>When I pay $14 for a bottle of lotion I&#x27;d like to be able to get it out of the bottle!</li>
            <li>Smelled so lovely I had to order it again!</li>
            <li>My girl friends favorite!</li>
            <li>Does a nice job of softening hands, too.  </li>
            <li>kind of an ammonia smell to it.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous lotion besides I love the smell!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, but I like others fragrances better</li>
            <li>Bought for a gift because my friend LOVES it.&lt;br /&gt;Makes gift giving a pleasure and shopping a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;Simple and easy!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great... as long as you don&#x27;t mind smelling like your Great Aunt Esther...</li>
            <li>this is something alot of women in my family love.</li>
            <li>Wish I could afford it more often.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product, and have purchased it before, and I will continue to do so.  </li>
            <li>But did not like the way Amazon split the orders and shipped it seperately and collected more money.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful , lasts a long time and can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>Smells lovely, light and clean.  </li>
            <li>Really nice fragrance and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This lotion prevents chapping, soaks in nicely &amp; does not leave you out of action for 30+min as there is no greasy film on your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice, light, non-cloying fragrance.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like really sweet fragrances you might not appreciate this one.</li>
            <li>A little strong smelling untill rubbed in but once applied smells and works great.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>The lotion smells nice but is not as rich and creamy as I expected.</li>
            <li>I have used the Mandarin Coriander lotion from Thymes and it is wonderfully rich, but this,  not so much.</li>
            <li>The smell is sweet and highly fragrant.</li>
            <li>Love the Thymes products (use the soap regularly) and this lotion did not disappoint.</li>
            <li>I first found this brand in a shop in Virginia.  </li>
            <li>And I can get it much cheaper on line.</li>
            <li>Found that this product was a reasonable purchase and arrived on time with no problems.  </li>
            <li>Wife is very fond of this lotion.</li>
            <li>Fragrance seemed to have been old.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t help but wondering if this lotion has been previously used and just placed in a little cheap shrink wrap to make it seem new.</li>

            <li> Long story short</li>
            <li> It last a long time.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m not near a store that sells Thymes, I tried Goldleaf.  </li>
            <li> My sister in Dallas bought me and my other 3 sisters this fragrance several years ago that she found in a boutique</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to choose between dry hands and using a mouse  (or paper clips) with this lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great every day lotion to soothe and protect your dry hands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Winter in Alaska is very dry.</li>
            <li> Had previously used this product for a long time.  </li>
            <li> and then we treat each other or ourselves to Goldleaf.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years &amp; it smells a little off......</li>
            <li> thought i would love this based on the reviews but absolutely hated the smell</li>
            <li> Smell was not good.</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong with it.</li>

            <li> Fragrance seemed to have been old. Smell was not good. Had previously used this product for a long time.  Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Long story short this is something alot of women in my family love. You cant go wrong with it. A little strong smelling untill rubbed in but once applied smells and works great.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m not near a store that sells Thymes, I tried Goldleaf.  It&#x27;s nice, but I like others fragrances better</li>
            <li> The lotion smells nice but is not as rich and creamy as I expected. I have used the Mandarin Coriander lotion from Thymes and it is wonderfully rich, but this,  not so much. I won&#x27;t buy it again. And the pump doesn&#x27;t work. When I pay $14 for a bottle of lotion I&#x27;d like to be able to get it out of the bottle!</li>
            <li> Really nice fragrance and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely, light and clean.  Does a nice job of softening hands, too.  Would definitely buy again.  Wish I could afford it more often.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous lotion besides I love the smell!! And I can get it much cheaper on line. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Smelled so lovely I had to order it again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll order this again and again.  Smells good too. I put this on my legs, arms and hands every day.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to choose between dry hands and using a mouse  (or paper clips) with this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great hand lotion.  Does not leave your hands greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winter in Alaska is very dry. This lotion prevents chapping, soaks in nicely &amp; does not leave you out of action for 30+min as there is no greasy film on your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice, light, non-cloying fragrance.  Still feel hands protected a day later after washing, etc. (one application).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great every day lotion to soothe and protect your dry hands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great... as long as you don&#x27;t mind smelling like your Great Aunt Esther...</li>
            <li> All you get is the bottle of lotion in shrink wrap.  I can&#x27;t help but wondering if this lotion has been previously used and just placed in a little cheap shrink wrap to make it seem new.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product, and have purchased it before, and I will continue to do so.  It last a long time.</li>
            <li> Bought for a gift because my friend LOVES it.&lt;br /&gt;Makes gift giving a pleasure and shopping a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;Simple and easy!</li>
            <li> made GREAT Christmas GIFTS</li>
            <li> Love the Thymes products (use the soap regularly) and this lotion did not disappoint. The smell is sweet and highly fragrant. If you don&#x27;t like really sweet fragrances you might not appreciate this one. It is definitely a \\&quot;girly\\&quot; smell (no citrus notes) but I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> My sister in Dallas bought me and my other 3 sisters this fragrance several years ago that she found in a boutique and it is wonderful. Now and then we treat each other or ourselves to Goldleaf. Recommend!</li>
            <li> My girl friends favorite!</li>
            <li> A must have lotion.  Smells wonderful , lasts a long time and can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> good smell and nice feeling. But did not like the way Amazon split the orders and shipped it seperately and collected more money.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years &amp; it smells a little off......kind of an ammonia smell to it.</li>
            <li> thought i would love this based on the reviews but absolutely hated the smell</li>
            <li> Bought as gift.  Appears as advertised.  Have been told it is very nice.</li>
            <li> I have used the Goldleaf line for several years now.  Found that this product was a reasonable purchase and arrived on time with no problems.  Recommend for the price as it was cheaper than local stores.</li>
            <li> Wife is very fond of this lotion.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied. Thank you</li>
            <li> I first found this brand in a shop in Virginia.  Being from the south, I could not find it anywhere in store and could not be bought online ... until now!  Thymes has a great line of products.  Worth the price.</li>
