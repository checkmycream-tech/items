            <li>This is a great eye product at a price just a fraction of what you pay at the kiosks in the mall.</li>
            <li>well, that explains the great price, it&#x27;s expired.</li>
            <li>and it works great for that.</li>
            <li>This is really a good product.  </li>
            <li>While I loved the feel of the eye gel</li>
            <li>It is a good product for eye skin, good for me in all season.</li>
            <li>Was very glad to find it on Amazon at a competitive price.</li>

            <li>THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST I HAVE TRIED SO FAR.</li>
            <li>Love the products and love to get them off Amazon.</li>
            <li>however, the story gets better...</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting a pretty good deal...now to look on Amazon and find it for $23, I am livid.  </li>
            <li>but instead she was super nice and told me not to worry....</li>
            <li>Great product clean scent, really does moisturize area around eyes and reduces wrinkles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with the whole experience... highly recommend this eye gel AND this seller.</li>
            <li>it was much cheaper and just as good.  </li>
            <li>It helps smoothe out fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>The agressive sales lady tried some of the  eye cream on me and said there was a huge difference.</li>
            <li>but this one is fantastic, haven&#x27;t had a headache,</li>
            <li>It reduces the puffiness under the eyes and also helps smooth out the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>and you should know something important...</li>
            <li>great product low price</li>
            <li>This is not the original product.  </li>
            <li>It was their \\&quot;SPECIAL PRICE AND A 1 DAY DEAL!!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I am so pleased the product is just what I have bought before but in the mall at the high price.  </li>
            <li>Got it is just a few days and am very pleased to get such a great price.</li>
            <li>I bought this gel because of all the positive reviews but the first time I put it on I was overwhelmed by the strong perfume smell.</li>
            <li>Dollars.&lt;br /&gt;It is worth 40-50</li>
            <li>They apologized and said they would send me out another eye gel right away... which they did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had great difficulty with eye creams in the past as they often give me a headache</li>
            <li>I am allergic to so many products that I have to use the same items that I know work for me.  </li>
            <li>I was willing to pay.  </li>
            <li>I have talked to friends and read reviews on Amazon and most of the   feedback is similar.</li>
            <li>does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>smooths wrinkles, helps remove dark circles, great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I tried this product first through a Mall sale.</li>
            <li>I first opened the package and saw an expiration date of Nov. of 2010 (this being May of 2011)</li>
            <li>it gives me white flakes around my eyes in the morning &amp; fine wrinkles added to the flakes; didn&#x27;t notice any differences.      </li>
            <li>The price at the mall is three times as much.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much for the product yet.  </li>
            <li>Really at the Mall should you be going through this hassle.  </li>
            <li>I really like the eye gel product.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled to have found it on line at such a reasonable cost as the mall was quoting prices from $110 to $250 a jar to various friends  I had sent to them.</li>
            <li>then you have a whole year - and even then it won&#x27;t \\&quot;go bad\\</li>
            <li>I will not use it again as I dislike the smell so much.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product, it didn&#x27;t really do anything for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used expensive products from spas and nothing is as good as this product!</li>
            <li>I also have some of their other productsthe mud musk which I also love and the face serum.  </li>
            <li>This is the 3rd jar of Seacret eye gel and love it, I had been plagued with circles under my eyes and no one has told me I look tired since using this product, love it!</li>
            <li>This is the same eye gel that I have bought in the mall for their \\&quot;special price\\&quot; of $80.00.  </li>
            <li>LIVE &amp; LEARN and shop AMAZON!</li>
            <li>It is the new version which does nothing to really help tighten skin.</li>
            <li>I love this eye eye very much when I use the sample, but it is hard to find in my country.</li>
            <li>here it is, the EXACT SAME eye gel for $17.00....</li>
            <li>I cannot tell the difference so far.</li>
            <li>i will continue to use it to see if it will make any difference, but so far, haven&#x27;t seen any.  </li>
            <li>i purchased this product to see if it will make any difference; first couple of time, i didn&#x27;t really know what to expect, and as i used it everyday for over a week, i am not sure if i purchased the right one.  </li>
            <li>Generally, if a product works then it sells itself by word of mouth  and customer loyalty.   </li>
            <li>somewhat making it worse with white flakes and more wrinkles around my eyes.......</li>

            <li> This is the 3rd jar of Seacret eye gel and love it, I had been plagued with circles under my eyes and no one has told me I look tired since using this product, love it!</li>
            <li> This is really a good product.  It helps smoothe out fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This product is the same product you are seeing at the malls.  The price at the mall is three times as much.  They will always negotiate and get you down to 70 dollars which is still overpriced.  I can&#x27;t say much for the product yet.  I have been using for approximately 3 weeks.  I cannot tell the difference so far.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to so many products that I have to use the same items that I know work for me.  This is the same eye gel that I have bought in the mall for their \\&quot;special price\\&quot; of $80.00.  Online it was much cheaper and just as good.  Got it is just a few days and am very pleased to get such a great price.</li>
            <li> I am one of the ones that got ripped off at the mall.  I had to look it up after being haggled on two different mall trips.  I must say,  they put it on at the mall and I couldn&#x27;t stop thinking of it.  The price did go down over 50% but I still would just like a price.  Really at the Mall should you be going through this hassle.  Well, I did have to go back because nothing else seemed to work like this... really instantly.  I was willing to pay.  Although, I thought at $65 I thought I was getting a pretty good deal...now to look on Amazon and find it for $23, I am livid.  So, for that price, buy it now! It&#x27;s a steal.  DO NOT....WHATEVER YOU DO...GO TO THE MALL KIOSK.  Oh, did I mention I bought their cleansers and make-up for $200 the month before.  LIVE &amp; LEARN and shop AMAZON!</li>
            <li> I am so pleased the product is just what I have bought before but in the mall at the high price.  this has been such a blessing as my husband has been unemployed and every bit helps..</li>
            <li> I,too, have been \\&quot;ACCOSTED\\&quot; at the mall kiosk by these overbearing salespeople.  I really have to question a company when they have to go to drastic and questionable measures   to sell products. Generally, if a product works then it sells itself by word of mouth  and customer loyalty.   I have talked to friends and read reviews on Amazon and most of the   feedback is similar. DO NOT purchase these products at a kiosk. My advice would   be to buy them on Amazon if you want to try them. Or, go with products from   companies such as Clinique,Sephora,Philosophy,etc. Those products sell themselves  with no pushiness necessary!   This same eye cream listed here for $27.00 was trying to be sold to me for $130 at the mall.   It was their \\&quot;SPECIAL PRICE AND A 1 DAY DEAL!!\\&quot; The agressive sales lady tried some of the  eye cream on me and said there was a huge difference. I looked in the mirror and saw none, only  that she managed to mess my up my makeup! lol   I am also suprised that the malls in town will continue to let these people sell  their products with all the complaints they recieve.    As always, BUYER BEWARE..........</li>
            <li> Great product clean scent, really does moisturize area around eyes and reduces wrinkles. This makes about my 4 purchase of the product. It works well for me.</li>
            <li> does exactly what it says. smooths wrinkles, helps remove dark circles, great for sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve used expensive products from spas and nothing is as good as this product!</li>
            <li> My eyes are perfect now</li>
            <li> I tried this product first through a Mall sale. I actually tested it there on just one eye and it felt great and within a few minutes I could already visually in their mirror tell the difference between the eye with and without. I had great difficulty with eye creams in the past as they often give me a headache (maybe the fragrance or maybe they were just too heavy) but this one is fantastic, haven&#x27;t had a headache, in fact had less and it makes a real difference to dark circles and lines. I love it! I also have some of their other productsthe mud musk which I also love and the face serum.  Love the products and love to get them off Amazon.</li>
            <li> Had used this product before and realy liked it. Was very glad to find it on Amazon at a competitive price.</li>
            <li> If you buy this in the mall they will try to start the price at 145 Dollars.&lt;br /&gt;It is worth 40-50 Dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again when i am out!</li>
            <li> I really like the eye gel product.  It reduces the puffiness under the eyes and also helps smooth out the wrinkles.  I am thrilled to have found it on line at such a reasonable cost as the mall was quoting prices from $110 to $250 a jar to various friends  I had sent to them.</li>

            <li> TRIED LOTS OF EYE GELS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO HELP WITH MY ALLERGY PUFFY EYES. THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST I HAVE TRIED SO FAR.</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, too, was approached about this eye gel and a few other products by a young man in the mall. While I loved the feel of the eye gel there was no way I would every pay $169.00 for eye gel!! I came home and checked Amazon and voila! There/here it is, the EXACT SAME eye gel for $17.00.... wahoo. I ordered from Cosmetics For Less/Amazon and received for a total of $22.00.... I&#x27;m very happy with this eye gel. It feels great going on, nice and cool, and I&#x27;m thrilled with the price I paid....however, the story gets better...and you should know something important...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the package and saw an expiration date of Nov. of 2010 (this being May of 2011) I was bummed and thought, well, that explains the great price, it&#x27;s expired. But, I went ahead and called the 800 number listed for Seacret products (on the box)and told the woman my story. I thought she might be mad that I bought online for cheap but instead she was super nice and told me not to worry....the expiration does not matter until you open the seal inside the pot of eye gel...then you have a whole year - and even then it won&#x27;t \\&quot;go bad\\&quot; in the sense that it would hurt you.....so, I was o.k. with it but decided to complain to Cosmetics For Less about selling expired products...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left seller feedback directly to Cosmetics for Less.... to their credit they replied to me immediately... by the next morning. They apologized and said they would send me out another eye gel right away... which they did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with the whole experience... highly recommend this eye gel AND this seller.</li>
            <li> I bought this gel because of all the positive reviews but the first time I put it on I was overwhelmed by the strong perfume smell. This is an eye gel. Why does it need heavy perfume? I will not use it again as I dislike the smell so much.</li>
            <li> This product shows no improvement for me under my eyes. It&#x27;s so expensive though that I started using it as facial moisturizer just to use it and it works great for that. I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product, it didn&#x27;t really do anything for me.</li>
            <li> This is not the original product.  It is the new version which does nothing to really help tighten skin.</li>

            <li> great product low price</li>
