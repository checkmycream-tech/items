    <ol>
            <li>GOOD LUCK!</li>
            <li>Great delivery time, great cost.</li>
            <li>Regenetresse treatments are pleasant smelling and don&#x27;t make flakes.</li>
            <li>Received in a timely fashion every thing was good</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the manageability of my hair, so I will continue to use to see if it works.</li>
            <li>This product is no longer available in stores, so I am happy amazon carries it</li>
            <li>but I liked using it.</li>
            <li>I bought this more than a year ago.</li>
            <li>whenever I would stop using it (because I needed more)</li>
            <li>Price is right for a good product.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!!!</li>
            <li>i have a receding hairline, fine blonde/brown hair</li>
            <li>Works great just wish they&#x27;d make a slightly larger DHT blocker spray supply, so it doesn&#x27;t run out way before the Shampoo and gel.</li>
            <li>It is no longer in the stores and even the product online is not the original three step treatment in all cases.</li>
            <li>After the first wash I could already tell my scalp felt better, and my hair has been growing like a weed ever since.</li>
            <li>It sure stoped my hair from falling but there is more to hair loss than just good treatment, do not wash your hair with hot water, just room temp to use this product, water has chemicals in it to maket &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; to drink not pure but when heated the effect of those chemicals intensify causing  more hair loss regardless of treatment, it would be nice if companies tested and mentioned the factors of hair loss along with their products and give some pointers as to how to curve the external causes, I say filter the water you drink with a carbon filter, and use a shower filter you will notice the diference in the water smell and taste inmidiately.</li>
            <li>using this product faithfully according to instructions, i have found that the remaining hair looks healthy and prevents further loss of hair on the top of the head.</li>
            <li>I noticed it right away; that at the end of the day, I didn&#x27;t feel the need to take another shower.  </li>
            <li>After the first use, my oily scalp stopped being oily, even in 90+ degree weather.  </li>
            <li>just pay more when you order on line instead of going into the store where it is becoming hard to find.</li>
            <li>This product really works as advertised and I have been using it for over three years.  </li>
            <li>Besides, Regenetress definitely makes me look like I actually have more than 3 hairs on my head.</li>
            <li>Was a good (not great) price.</li>
            <li>not sure if the DHT blocker works well because I always forget to use it because I mostly use the shampoo and it takes about 6 weeks for results with the DHT blocker.</li>
            <li>There still would be a lot of shedding after a shower, but less, and significantly fewer hairs would fall out the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li>I think I can no longer fear going completely</li>
            <li>I developed dandruff something I never had before.</li>
            <li>I still use other products to wash my hair and switch this one in and out of my regimen a few times a week, but results have been outstanding!</li>
            <li>Product works better than other more expensive hair products.</li>
            <li>A week later, hairs are coming out, but perhaps the normal amt that people shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did not grow new hair but made the individual hairs appear thicker and thus hide the scalp.</li>
            <li>I have mid-length fine brunette hair, and am always frustrated by how easily it sheds.</li>
            <li>In fact, I have ordered this product a total of 3 times and have yet to be disappointed by how effective it really is, just make sure you use an extra moisturizer if your hair runs dry because the shampoo alone can make your hair look less shiny.</li>

            <li> No matter how much attention I focused on split ends and moisturizing, I still saw slow growth and a lot of hair in my brushes, but Regentresse definitely slowed that problem, if not put an end to it altogether.</li>
            <li> Used exactly as directed and with in a few days i notices less hair loss and healthier appearance all around.</li>
            <li> I plan to keep using it as long as I can find a source for this product.  </li>
            <li> What I disliked about that one was the gunkiness and smelliness of the foam, which when dried, ended up making large dandruff-looking flakes.  </li>
            <li> After the 2nd use, the effect on my scalp was similar - less oily - and I could definitely tell that less hair was falling out.  </li>
            <li> When I use it regularly there is less hair in the sink and in brush and comb.  </li>
            <li> But had been previously using this produce from different vendor source and knew the product.</li>
            <li> only problem is that I am having trouble finding the product.</li>
            <li> The product did not come in the packaging, but was what I expected I did not see much change in the restoration of my hair unfortunately.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also has a DHT blocker for someone that is struggling with a receding hair line, DHT blockers seem hard to find with other different brand hair loss treatments so that is a plus.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only shampoo that allows me to look decent in winter (or, whenever it&#x27;s cold).  </li>
            <li> but I thought the quantity appeared less (but who knows without counting every strand - which I can&#x27;t be bothered to do).  </li>
            <li> Before trying Regentresse, I was going &amp;#34;slick bald&amp;#34; over half of my head.</li>
            <li> tried it for a few weeks but seemed to speed up my hair loss..</li>
            <li> My hair would fall out in clumps after showering; and throughout the day, a strand or two would cascade like snowflakes every few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was rather skeptical about the effectiveness of this product but was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> but when I started using it again, it would reduced my hair loss, if you are reading this review because your hair is starting to thin</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin, and keeping it from being static is almost impossible unless I use Regenetresse (none of other shampoos worked).  </li>
            <li> For some reason, I was skeptical that the shampoo could do anything, so I only used the other two treatments in the kit.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it made any difference</li>
            <li> While I am not sure you would label my hair as &amp;#34;thinning&amp;#34;, I decided to try this product to help me grow out my locks.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product as it does slow hair loss.  </li>

            <li> Product works better than other more expensive hair products. Price is right for a good product. Helps maintain body and fullness of hair.</li>
            <li> tried it for a few weeks but seemed to speed up my hair loss.. i have a receding hairline, fine blonde/brown hair</li>
            <li> I just started using this product this week, so I can&#x27;t tell how the product works for thickening my hair.  I am very pleased with the manageability of my hair, so I will continue to use to see if it works.</li>
            <li> using this product faithfully according to instructions, i have found that the remaining hair looks healthy and prevents further loss of hair on the top of the head. This product is no longer available in stores, so I am happy amazon carries it</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product as it does slow hair loss.  When I use it regularly there is less hair in the sink and in brush and comb.  When I stop using it there is hair all over the place.</li>
            <li> This product really works as advertised and I have been using it for over three years.  I plan to keep using it as long as I can find a source for this product.  Thanks Amazon!!!!</li>
            <li> Was a good (not great) price. But had been previously using this produce from different vendor source and knew the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this more than a year ago. For some reason, I was skeptical that the shampoo could do anything, so I only used the other two treatments in the kit.  They didn&#x27;t do diddly squat.  My hair would fall out in clumps after showering; and throughout the day, a strand or two would cascade like snowflakes every few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Than I decided to finally try the shampoo last week. After the first use, my oily scalp stopped being oily, even in 90+ degree weather.  I noticed it right away; that at the end of the day, I didn&#x27;t feel the need to take another shower.  My hair still was falling out a lot but I thought the quantity appeared less (but who knows without counting every strand - which I can&#x27;t be bothered to do).  After the 2nd use, the effect on my scalp was similar - less oily - and I could definitely tell that less hair was falling out.  There still would be a lot of shedding after a shower, but less, and significantly fewer hairs would fall out the rest of the day.  A week later, hairs are coming out, but perhaps the normal amt that people shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, now I bought another kit to see if the shampoo AND the treatments will make a further difference.  I also did try the Nioxin treatment (again not the shampoo, just the foamy scalp treatment).  What I disliked about that one was the gunkiness and smelliness of the foam, which when dried, ended up making large dandruff-looking flakes.  Regenetresse treatments are pleasant smelling and don&#x27;t make flakes.</li>
            <li> It sure stoped my hair from falling but there is more to hair loss than just good treatment, do not wash your hair with hot water, just room temp to use this product, water has chemicals in it to maket &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; to drink not pure but when heated the effect of those chemicals intensify causing  more hair loss regardless of treatment, it would be nice if companies tested and mentioned the factors of hair loss along with their products and give some pointers as to how to curve the external causes, I say filter the water you drink with a carbon filter, and use a shower filter you will notice the diference in the water smell and taste inmidiately. GOOD LUCK!</li>
            <li> Was rather skeptical about the effectiveness of this product but was pleasantly surprised.  When used regularly, it made the hair on the crown of my head look thicker.  It did not grow new hair but made the individual hairs appear thicker and thus hide the scalp. You can miss a couple days treatment before any \\&quot;regression\\&quot; can be seen.  I&#x27;m on my second batch and have recommended it to friends with the same problem as mine.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it made any difference but I liked using it.</li>
            <li> The product did not come in the packaging, but was what I expected I did not see much change in the restoration of my hair unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Received in a timely fashion every thing was good just pay more when you order on line instead of going into the store where it is becoming hard to find.</li>
            <li> Works great just wish they&#x27;d make a slightly larger DHT blocker spray supply, so it doesn&#x27;t run out way before the Shampoo and gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Regentresse for several years now and consider it as having saved my life. Before trying Regentresse, I was going &amp;#34;slick bald&amp;#34; over half of my head. Just by chance, I saw an ad for Regentresse and decided to try it. Within several weeks, the thinning stopped and the remaining hair became longer and fuller. I have used it ever since and have regained my confidence. I think I can no longer fear going completely bald.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that I am having trouble finding the product. It is no longer in the stores and even the product online is not the original three step treatment in all cases.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only shampoo that allows me to look decent in winter (or, whenever it&#x27;s cold).  My hair is very thin, and keeping it from being static is almost impossible unless I use Regenetresse (none of other shampoos worked).  Besides, Regenetress definitely makes me look like I actually have more than 3 hairs on my head.</li>
            <li> I have mid-length fine brunette hair, and am always frustrated by how easily it sheds. While I am not sure you would label my hair as &amp;#34;thinning&amp;#34;, I decided to try this product to help me grow out my locks. No matter how much attention I focused on split ends and moisturizing, I still saw slow growth and a lot of hair in my brushes, but Regentresse definitely slowed that problem, if not put an end to it altogether. I still use other products to wash my hair and switch this one in and out of my regimen a few times a week, but results have been outstanding!

In fact, I have ordered this product a total of 3 times and have yet to be disappointed by how effective it really is, just make sure you use an extra moisturizer if your hair runs dry because the shampoo alone can make your hair look less shiny.</li>
            <li> Great delivery time, great cost. Product did what is promised! Used exactly as directed and with in a few days i notices less hair loss and healthier appearance all around.</li>
            <li> Product does not work. Stopped using it within a week because it made my scalp itch. A lot! I developed dandruff something I never had before.</li>
            <li> Been using it for almost 2 years. whenever I would stop using it (because I needed more) I would notice hair loss but when I started using it again, it would reduced my hair loss, if you are reading this review because your hair is starting to thin then I would definitely suggest buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a DHT blocker for someone that is struggling with a receding hair line, DHT blockers seem hard to find with other different brand hair loss treatments so that is a plus. not sure if the DHT blocker works well because I always forget to use it because I mostly use the shampoo and it takes about 6 weeks for results with the DHT blocker. As for hair growing back it my help you but hair loss is different for everybody.</li>
