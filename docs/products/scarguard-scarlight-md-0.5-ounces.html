    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Best of all</li>
            <li>This stuff WAS great!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a great an experience with this product.  </li>
            <li>, I will tell anyone who will listen how great it is.  </li>
            <li>it feels great on my face and neck, not greasy at all and absorbs well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They feel great</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this product because ScarGuard was very effective for me in scar reduction.  </li>
            <li>This product is simply amazing!</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research and found this to be one of the best products for lightening and corrcting hyperpigmentation, and I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li>It is a good moisturizer, too.  </li>
            <li>Good for OTC use and people unfamiliar with hydroquinone.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a good experience with this product.</li>
            <li>and this one had excellent reviews, but honestly and in my experience with scars and the way my skin reacts to simple scratches this is the best product ever for that purposes.</li>
            <li>Kind of makes you wonder what you&#x27;re putting on your face.  </li>
            <li>Exfoliation is a necessity in effectively lightening spots.  </li>
            <li>So many reasons I&#x27;m happy with this :-)&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product does an awesome job at helping to lower raise scars and make them fade fast.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with the product because it delivers results, its a clear liquid that doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes.</li>
            <li>It is incredible how much lighter the circles under my eyes are.  </li>
            <li>Before this purchase I have been using the original scarguard (which in my opinion is the absolute best one and works faster than mederma).</li>
            <li>and I can see a huge difference  under my eyes!</li>
            <li>whereas the Obagi (et al.) products tend to come in tubes or bottles of 1.7 ounces or more.    </li>
            <li>use again, but love the scar guard.</li>
            <li>This product not only softened the depth of my freckles, but has removed blemishes and created a wonderful glow.</li>
            <li>Since using this on those spots they are much better.</li>
            <li>So all in all, the product is just okay.  </li>
            <li>And I have to agree - this stuff is working wonders on my melasma :-)  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product and will be recommending it to my friends.</li>
            <li>I figured Scarlight was worth a shot as well, and I&#x27;m happy to say my instincts were right.</li>
            <li>Enjoy it because I love this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d easily recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>Its so easy to use.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m seeing very quick results!&lt;br /&gt;FYI</li>
            <li>Maybe they decided to change the formula because it was uber strong before, and perhaps they received complaints.</li>
            <li>It takes awhile for you to notice any changes, but it does lighten the scars and make a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I recommended this to my best friend a few months ago, who rushed to order it off Amazon.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;the product, I discovered light discolorations or splotches on my face.  </li>
            <li>However, the remaining spot is so light that no one else would ever notice it.  </li>
            <li>I feel more secure and not insecure..</li>
            <li>The product is pleasant but has not been useful so far.  </li>
            <li>As usual Amazon had the best price.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t completely lightened the skin however I am confident with more use</li>
            <li>It was completely successful and the skin is flat and without any scar tissue.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get how this this has such good review..</li>
            <li>I had no side effects of any kind so far.</li>
            <li>but, by the next morning my skin was all good again.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I had an acne medication I put on to counteract that.</li>
            <li>Prescription brands like Aclaro is more effective at removing hyperpigmentation due to its increased concentration of hydroquinone.  </li>
            <li>This product really works!!</li>
            <li>.) I&#x27;ve been using this for just 4 days and already have had someone ask what I&#x27;m doing differently because they can tell that my skin is looking more even!  </li>
            <li>After having success with Scarguard</li>
            <li>I am in LOVE with it completely.</li>
            <li>But for me, this was the ONLY product I&#x27;d tried that was effective for my spots.</li>
            <li>My plastic sergeon recommed scarguard right after my sugery.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve never had such clear skin my life and am loving it!  </li>
            <li>I will update if further use is better than the first six weeks.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I have melasma that is pretty noticeable.</li>
            <li>really works!</li>
            <li>fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I have made the conclusion that Scarguard Scarlight MD deserved a try because it contains several potent ingridients proven to deliver results.</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks of consistent application I still did not see any difference.</li>
            <li>At first, it looks like it makes the scar \\&quot;brighter\\&quot; which in turn made me nervous.</li>
            <li>/&gt;4 years later, I have lots more freckles/sun spots that I want to get rid of.  </li>
            <li>Well, since using it again I know for sure this product just doesn&#x27;t work the same as it used to.  </li>
            <li>Applicator is a super comfortable brush similar to nail polish brush.</li>
            <li>However, this product initially impressed me because of how quickly it produced such dramatic results.  </li>
            <li>It is slightly raised and it&#x27;s easy to see, because i&#x27;m light skinned.</li>
            <li>I recently went back to my plastic sergeon and he was very pleased, and said in 2 years you won&#x27;t even know there was a scar.</li>
            <li>It barely makes a significant difference</li>
            <li>You will actually see results like scars being minimized and quickly!</li>
            <li>Bought it because I loved the original Scarguard from the same company, that actually works not only for scars but also for dark spots better than Scarlight.</li>
            <li>Then last year I had a punch biopsy which basically made a huge hole in my skin.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to wear as much makeup to cover them.</li>
            <li>and it really has made a difference.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this and for it to work, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>and it runs out fast.</li>
            <li>I have been very satified with this product since I have been using it.  </li>
            <li>I am mixed race (light skinned)</li>
            <li>so the scars were very noticeable until I used this product.</li>
            <li>I tried laser surgeries it didn&#x27;t remove much</li>
            <li>I tried Vivite but didn&#x27;t remove much either.  </li>
            <li>I have light olive skin and back in 2010</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and I would buy from here again when I need another refill.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>In the evenings, I use &amp;#34;Retinol Cream (Vitamin A) - 2 Oz.&amp;#34; (It&#x27;s currently sold on Amazon with  &amp;#34;+ FREE Herbal Authority Blemish Roll-</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyhow, I am supremely happy with all three beauty products - Scarguard Scarlight MF, 0.5 Ounces, Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay - 2 lbs, and Retinol Cream (Vitamin A) - 2 Oz, that I purchased on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m a 30 yr old caucasian with fair skin (blonde, blue eyes...)</li>
            <li>My opinion is spend the extra money and get the original Scarguard.</li>
            <li>Since I know exactly where to look, I can still see a light pink spot, and I&#x27;m hoping that continued use of Scarlight will take it away.  </li>
            <li>I had surgery a few years ago and had a large incision on the top of my foot.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly reccommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I look great and let me tell you guys my dark circles were DARK!</li>
            <li>I have had no negative effects (redness, peeling etc.)  </li>
            <li>I let it set in for several minutes, until it&#x27;s absorbed, and then I apply my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Currently the scar is a very light pink color.</li>
            <li>But seeing as it is recommended to use HQ for only 90 days before taking a break from it for a couple months, I didn&#x27;t want to risk any more time on this product just to achieve minimal or no results.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It certainly feels more effective because it&#x27;s just a thick liquid, of which I needed only a few drops to do my whole decollete area, whereas with the hydroquinone creams I need a big blob of it.    </li>
            <li>Thank God it was not canceruous, but as a young female I felt self concious left with this huge scar.</li>
            <li>but they are completely gone!</li>
            <li>It is so noticeable that people have commented that my face looks different, even if they can&#x27;t pinpoint exactly why.    </li>
            <li>I purchased this for the first time back in 2010.  </li>
            <li>Just imagine how your eyes will look after a month all I can say is wow!</li>
            <li>I read that a mix of different actives works much better than each active alone one at a time.</li>
            <li>First used this product to remove 2 old scar marks on my upper arm and chest.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Obagi system to clear up my melasma, liver/age spots, brown spots.  </li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>I will continue using it untill its faded completely.</li>
            <li>but I developed severe dryness around the areas where it was treated.  </li>
            <li>Considering this newer version still felt like applying water after almost two weeks twice daily use, I don&#x27;t have much confidence it will cause any exfoliation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would have given five stars but the scar has not faded completely as of yet.</li>
            <li>I showed my doc at a return visit and even he was surprised.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Scarguard Scarlight for about a month and it has lightened my skin considerably.  </li>
            <li>The spot is still visible, although it has lightened considerably.  </li>
            <li>On fresh wounds or scars I&#x27;ve applied Mederma, but found it left an unsightly shiny sheen (especially on my face)</li>
            <li>They are slowly, but surely, fading away.  </li>
            <li>That is the main reason I purchased thisa second time.  </li>
            <li>This product really works and it does not take a long time to start to work.</li>
            <li>After trying countless other products, without much success, I decided to try Scarlight.  </li>
            <li>My doctor recomended this product to me and eventhough it is a little pricey, it is worth the money because it works.</li>
            <li>I distinctly remember that after a couple days use, it would cause my skin to tingle and burn a little at the site of application.</li>
            <li>Thus far, it has helped to repair some recent damage.  </li>
            <li>They were barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I picked this up from a Harmon drug store completely expecting to achieve the same results.</li>
            <li>apparently I am beyond the return period</li>
            <li>and I always felt embarresed when someone said to me these famous words (you look tired)</li>
            <li>I did experience some slight burning the first week or so</li>
            <li>So I got a few microderm abrasion and that removed some but then came right back.  </li>
            <li>I see a fading on some old scars and a few age spots (only 50-but too much time in the sun).  </li>
            <li>I have applied it 2x a day (more or less) and still have about 1/3 of the small bottle left..</li>
            <li>The result: Scarlight makes the Dark Eye Circle area become \\&quot;Lighter\\&quot;; The old, dry, dark-looking, skin peels away; and, The moisturizer makes new, moist, good-looking, skin \\&quot;Re-Grow\\&quot;.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> /&gt;Anyhow, I am supremely happy with all three beauty products - Scarguard Scarlight MF, 0.5 Ounces, Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay - 2 lbs, and Retinol Cream (Vitamin A) - 2 Oz, that I purchased on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m a 30 yr old caucasian with fair skin (blonde, blue eyes...)</li>
            <li> My opinion is spend the extra money and get the original Scarguard.</li>
            <li> Since I know exactly where to look, I can still see a light pink spot, and I&#x27;m hoping that continued use of Scarlight will take it away.  </li>
            <li> I had surgery a few years ago and had a large incision on the top of my foot.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly reccommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I look great and let me tell you guys my dark circles were DARK!</li>
            <li> I have had no negative effects (redness, peeling etc.)  </li>
            <li> I let it set in for several minutes, until it&#x27;s absorbed, and then I apply my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Currently the scar is a very light pink color.</li>
            <li> But seeing as it is recommended to use HQ for only 90 days before taking a break from it for a couple months, I didn&#x27;t want to risk any more time on this product just to achieve minimal or no results.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It certainly feels more effective because it&#x27;s just a thick liquid, of which I needed only a few drops to do my whole decollete area, whereas with the hydroquinone creams I need a big blob of it.    </li>
            <li> Thank God it was not canceruous, but as a young female I felt self concious left with this huge scar.</li>
            <li> but they are completely gone!</li>
            <li> It is so noticeable that people have commented that my face looks different, even if they can&#x27;t pinpoint exactly why.    </li>
            <li> I purchased this for the first time back in 2010.  </li>
            <li> Just imagine how your eyes will look after a month all I can say is wow!</li>
            <li> I read that a mix of different actives works much better than each active alone one at a time.</li>
            <li> First used this product to remove 2 old scar marks on my upper arm and chest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Obagi system to clear up my melasma, liver/age spots, brown spots.  </li>
            <li> I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I will continue using it untill its faded completely.</li>
            <li> but I developed severe dryness around the areas where it was treated.  </li>
            <li> Considering this newer version still felt like applying water after almost two weeks twice daily use, I don&#x27;t have much confidence it will cause any exfoliation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would have given five stars but the scar has not faded completely as of yet.</li>
            <li> I showed my doc at a return visit and even he was surprised.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Scarguard Scarlight for about a month and it has lightened my skin considerably.  </li>
            <li> The spot is still visible, although it has lightened considerably.  </li>
            <li> On fresh wounds or scars I&#x27;ve applied Mederma, but found it left an unsightly shiny sheen (especially on my face)</li>
            <li> They are slowly, but surely, fading away.  </li>
            <li> That is the main reason I purchased thisa second time.  </li>
            <li> This product really works and it does not take a long time to start to work.</li>
            <li> After trying countless other products, without much success, I decided to try Scarlight.  </li>
            <li> My doctor recomended this product to me and eventhough it is a little pricey, it is worth the money because it works.</li>
            <li> I distinctly remember that after a couple days use, it would cause my skin to tingle and burn a little at the site of application.</li>
            <li> Thus far, it has helped to repair some recent damage.  </li>
            <li> They were barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I picked this up from a Harmon drug store completely expecting to achieve the same results.</li>
            <li> apparently I am beyond the return period</li>
            <li> and I always felt embarresed when someone said to me these famous words (you look tired)</li>
            <li> I did experience some slight burning the first week or so</li>
            <li> So I got a few microderm abrasion and that removed some but then came right back.  </li>
            <li> I see a fading on some old scars and a few age spots (only 50-but too much time in the sun).  </li>
            <li> I have applied it 2x a day (more or less) and still have about 1/3 of the small bottle left..</li>
            <li> The result: Scarlight makes the Dark Eye Circle area become \\&quot;Lighter\\&quot;; The old, dry, dark-looking, skin peels away; and, The moisturizer makes new, moist, good-looking, skin \\&quot;Re-Grow\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many products to like this and even the more expensive ones have been ineffective on dark spots, so I may be a tough case.  </li>
            <li> The other place that I have used it is on a large, dark age spot on my wrist.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m aware that the common knowledge is that it takes time and patience to get rid of melasma and sun spots.</li>
            <li> long story short use this</li>
            <li> Read all the positive and negative reviews and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Wow my under eye dark circles are almost gone!</li>
            <li> However, I found that applying Scarlight TWICE daily, to my Dark Eye Circles, resulted in the area&#x27;s \\&quot;Very Thin Skin\\&quot; becoming: Too Dry, Irritated, and Red.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this specific one because I wanted to get rid of this dark colored scar I have from a recent surgery.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t know how long it will take to work.</li>
            <li> I have done a few hours of research on the Internet reading professional recomendations and user reviews on what ingredients work for lightening sun spots.</li>
            <li> /&gt;1.) I&#x27;m currently living overseas and have items shipped to an APO (military) address.  </li>
            <li> Completely inaffective, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Applied it on the side I previously didn&#x27;t and left the other side bare.</li>
            <li> Recently the scar has been peeling almost every other day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all sorts of products before Scarlight: Mederma, Bio Oil, Silicone gel, Silicone gel sheets, and other various products.</li>
            <li> Same thing, in terms of both acne, and pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;So this product is um, a total waste.</li>
            <li> Over the next few days my skin would turn red and eventually peel, leaving lightened skin underneath.  </li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin is somewhat \\&quot;Different\\&quot;, and my experience with treating Dark Eye Circles might not be the same as someone else&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I ordered Scarguard MD, used it, not only around my eyes, but on dark marks on my face.  </li>
            <li> I apply it only where the dark discolorations are.  </li>
            <li> I started using Scarlight several months after my foot surgery to lighten the dark scars on my ankle.</li>
            <li> Looks like this little bottle will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I started using scar guard for the last month or less</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very expensive for a tiny little bottle, and it just sat on top of my skin and didn&#x27;t lighten any scars.  </li>
            <li> I have used several other product that claim to reduce the apperance of dark scars or spot.</li>
            <li> it was ok, scars aren&#x27;t that bad</li>
            <li> Everyone reacts differently to different products, this simply was not effective for me.</li>
            <li> I used this for about 8 months and saw absolutely no effect.</li>
            <li> I started seeing improvement within a couple of weeks, which is what I expected.</li>
            <li> but it take awhile before you can see minimal results.  </li>
            <li> planned a few months later</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll probably mix half water and half vinegar in the future :</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used a few cheaper drug store products prior with no success.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand</li>
            <li> As to its efficacy I trust it before seeing results because hydroquinone is a proven bleaching agent and has worked well for me before in other formulations.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using it on one side, and continued using it on the other side, and noticed that I would get breakouts where I applied this.</li>
            <li> Unlike some other products that can cause burning, redness and peeling.</li>
            <li> I have around 2 weeks using it and the difference on some recent scars is just unbelievable...</li>
            <li> You just brush on the liquid after you shower before bed and let it dry a little before you dress.</li>
            <li> My primary concern was a dog bite, and now it is almost impossible to see.  </li>
            <li> The other was quite dark and has faded by half.  </li>
            <li> I had a dark keloid on the side of my cheek around the jaw area.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my scar which has dark skin on either side</li>
            <li> the dark spots on my arms aren&#x27;t as noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes on dark spots.</li>
            <li> I had extremely dark circles under my eyes and age spots across my nose and cheeks.  </li>
            <li> &quot; Dark Eye Circles.  </li>
            <li> After a shower, I apply a moisturizer -- Vaseline, Petroleum Jelly, Eucerin, etc. -- on my Dark Eye Circles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned that \\&quot;Patience Is A Virtue\\&quot; when treating my Dark Eye Circles.  </li>
            <li> I put it under my eyes to fade my dark circles, also a blemish on my nose and on my forehead.</li>
            <li> I have a dark scar and this product did help lighten it.</li>
            <li> I am going in to have laser scar treatments on the dark scar.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even see the scar shrink a half an inch.</li>
            <li> After three days, it seemed like my freckles were slightly lighter</li>
            <li> I use Less concealer</li>
            <li> I used this for abut 1 and a half months.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a few dark spots I noticed forming on my hands and on my face.</li>
            <li> If you guys have dark circles use this I promise you will see results after a week!</li>
            <li> I am a light-skinned African-American woman who has very dark circles around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Of course, I couldn&#x27;t resist being in the sun and ended up with a very dark scar.  </li>
            <li> I had used the silicone before and it was great.i clearly ordered the wrong thing.</li>
            <li> I discontinued the product on my face and used heavy cream to hydrate my skin to repair it.</li>
            <li> I asked her a few weeks in if it was working</li>
            <li> I used this for a few months and was amazed how well it worked.  </li>
            <li> In the morning, the dried, yellow-colored, coating on my skin just washes off with either ordinary soap and water, or shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I bought the small bottle.</li>
            <li> My bigest sun spot on my face has already disappeared and another small spot has faded 50%.</li>
            <li> it turn my discolotion scar turn yellow on after a week of using WTF...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, waste of money!</li>
            <li> It also left a weird scar and once again, I used Scarlight and it lightened up immediately.  </li>
            <li> So, unless this makes my dark areas miraculously white before the bottle runs out, I&#x27;m unlikely to be a repeat customer!  </li>
            <li> I already tried silicon gel with applicator, which was seriously a rip off since it contains so little of it</li>
            <li> I am a freckled-face redhead; and have always been hit hard by the sun.  </li>
            <li> Scarlight MD sucks...</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product but after using it for about 3 weeks (and I just brush on a little and rub it in)</li>
            <li> It was red and ugly in spots even 2 years after surgery.  </li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t tired...</li>
            <li> have twice now used &amp;#34;Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay - 2 lbs&amp;#34; after washing my face and before doing the Scarguard/moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I hate the dark spots on my lower arms but don&#x27;t want to spend the money on pricey procedures.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been two months since I started using the product and not only did my sun spots fade, but Scarlight also did a number on my annoying freckles--they&#x27;re gone too!</li>
            <li> Been skeptical as I was with this type of products</li>
            <li> left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased Scarlight and was skeptical that it would work.  </li>
            <li> Now I have just a faint shadow of the stitches and no discoloration.  </li>
            <li> Was the wrong product....</li>
            <li> Two of them are getting difficult to find to treat anymore, so I will stop soon.  </li>
            <li> I just figured that maybe she got a bad bottle.  </li>
            <li> and I was shocked when she told me that nothing was happening.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> so I am stuck with an inferior product that they do NOT stand behind!!!</li>
            <li> Yep, looks like I&#x27;m an idiot.    </li>
            <li> plus I had a horrible scar on my face afterwards.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am so disappointed in this product. I had used the silicone before and it was great.i clearly ordered the wrong thing. I paid $30, for something sold in ebay for $13.00. Don&#x27;t buy this&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using Scarlite for about 3 weeks, but already my sun damage spots seem to be getting lighter and I don&#x27;t have to wear as much makeup to cover them.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an affordable hydroquinone product.  Obagi and similar products are about $60 and up...so when I saw Scarlight I snapped it up, even though I simply want it for skin bleaching and not to remove any scars.  I didn&#x27;t consider the fact that Scarlight only comes in a half-ounce bottle for $25 (Amazon&#x27;s price) whereas the Obagi (et al.) products tend to come in tubes or bottles of 1.7 ounces or more.    Scarlight &#x3D; $50 per ounce. 2% hydroquinone.  Obagi Sunfader (for example) &#x3D; $32 per ounce.  4% hydroquinone.    Yep, looks like I&#x27;m an idiot.    I do know it&#x27;s easier to apply the Scarlight than the Obagi.  On the other hand Scarlight smells like sickroom-in-a-bottle.  Ugh.  So, unless this makes my dark areas miraculously white before the bottle runs out, I&#x27;m unlikely to be a repeat customer!  It certainly feels more effective because it&#x27;s just a thick liquid, of which I needed only a few drops to do my whole decollete area, whereas with the hydroquinone creams I need a big blob of it.    As to its efficacy I trust it before seeing results because hydroquinone is a proven bleaching agent and has worked well for me before in other formulations.  I just don&#x27;t know how long it will take to work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on and off for about 3 months, along with applying Vitamin E from capsules to the scar. I had a dark keloid on the side of my cheek around the jaw area. It is slightly raised and it&#x27;s easy to see, because i&#x27;m light skinned. Recently the scar has been peeling almost every other day. Each time it peels, it reveals lighter skin and i&#x27;m also noticing the scar is flattening too. Currently the scar is a very light pink color. I&#x27;ve used all sorts of products before Scarlight: Mederma, Bio Oil, Silicone gel, Silicone gel sheets, and other various products. I&#x27;d easily recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my scar which has dark skin on either side and it really has made a difference. It hasn&#x27;t completely lightened the skin however I am confident with more use I will continue to see improvement.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this product because ScarGuard was very effective for me in scar reduction.  I have been using ScarLight for about six weeks and I detect no improvement.  I have tried many products to like this and even the more expensive ones have been ineffective on dark spots, so I may be a tough case.  The product is pleasant but has not been useful so far.  I will update if further use is better than the first six weeks.</li>
            <li> This product works, but must be used for a extended period of time. I would recommend using Scar-light in conjunction with this product for maximum effect.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have melasma that is pretty noticeable. I did a lot of research and found this to be one of the best products for lightening and corrcting hyperpigmentation, and I&#x27;m really glad I bought the small bottle. I used this for about 8 months and saw absolutely no effect. I kept having breakouts and acne in the area I was using it in, so I tried to see if there was a correlation between the two. I stopped using it on one side, and continued using it on the other side, and noticed that I would get breakouts where I applied this. I also noticed there was no difference in pigmentation on both sides: the side I used this on looked same as the side I didn&#x27;t in terms of lightening. I did this for 5 weeks, and then switched sides to make sure this wasn&#x27;t random. Applied it on the side I previously didn&#x27;t and left the other side bare. Same thing, in terms of both acne, and pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;So this product is um, a total waste. I really wanted to like this and for it to work, but it didn&#x27;t. Oh well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a few dark spots I noticed forming on my hands and on my face. After having success with Scarguard I figured Scarlight was worth a shot as well, and I&#x27;m happy to say my instincts were right. I started seeing improvement within a couple of weeks, which is what I expected. It&#x27;s been two months since I started using the product and not only did my sun spots fade, but Scarlight also did a number on my annoying freckles--they&#x27;re gone too!</li>
            <li> Turned my skin yellow..won&amp;#34;t use again, but love the scar guard.</li>
            <li> Thus far, it has helped to repair some recent damage.  Over all I don&#x27;t see a drastic change.  It made the scar tissue peel a bit.  Regular washing and perhaps using an exfoliator , too, will help to get rid of anything that will only clog pores.  It is a good moisturizer, too.  I am not saying it should be used for that sole purpose.  I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I am a freckled-face redhead; and have always been hit hard by the sun.  This product not only softened the depth of my freckles, but has removed blemishes and created a wonderful glow. I look years younger.</li>
            <li> Good for OTC use and people unfamiliar with hydroquinone.  Prescription brands like Aclaro is more effective at removing hyperpigmentation due to its increased concentration of hydroquinone.  Also, after a while, the label started deteriorating because of the product.  Kind of makes you wonder what you&#x27;re putting on your face.  Product consistency is like a serum and comes with a brush.</li>
            <li> I think this actually be working.  I hate the dark spots on my lower arms but don&#x27;t want to spend the money on pricey procedures.  I was skeptical of this product but after using it for about 3 weeks (and I just brush on a little and rub it in) the dark spots on my arms aren&#x27;t as noticeable.  Looks like this little bottle will last a long time.  The results are noticeable enough that I intend to keep using it.</li>
            <li> really works! fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes on dark spots. Bought it because I loved the original Scarguard from the same company, that actually works not only for scars but also for dark spots better than Scarlight.</li>
            <li> I tried this for a dime size scar i got from a scratch wound. I already tried silicon gel with applicator, which was seriously a rip off since it contains so little of it and it runs out fast. The silicon did improve lightening the scar only by 20% ish which is not a lot so I decided not to buy it again. I did some research and found this product. I don&#x27;t get how this this has such good review.. I&#x27;ve been testing this thing for over 3 months.</li>
            <li> I have been very satified with this product since I have been using it.  My doctor recomended this product to me and eventhough it is a little pricey, it is worth the money because it works.</li>
            <li> I have done a few hours of research on the Internet reading professional recomendations and user reviews on what ingredients work for lightening sun spots. I have made the conclusion that Scarguard Scarlight MD deserved a try because it contains several potent ingridients proven to deliver results. I read that a mix of different actives works much better than each active alone one at a time. As usual Amazon had the best price. I purchased on Amazon and used it twice a day as directed wearing sunscreen during the day for about 6-7 weeks. My bigest sun spot on my face has already disappeared and another small spot has faded 50%. I will continue using it untill its faded completely. I am caucasian.  I am very happy with the product because it delivers results, its a clear liquid that doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes. Applicator is a super comfortable brush similar to nail polish brush. Its so easy to use. I had no side effects of any kind so far. Unlike some other products that can cause burning, redness and peeling. Finally a product that works!</li>
            <li> Approved promptly and worked as reported.</li>
            <li> I have used several other product that claim to reduce the apperance of dark scars or spot. This product really works and it does not take a long time to start to work. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use a lot the reviews in order to acquire the products I intend to buy online and this one had excellent reviews, but honestly and in my experience with scars and the way my skin reacts to simple scratches this is the best product ever for that purposes. I have around 2 weeks using it and the difference on some recent scars is just unbelievable... Been skeptical as I was with this type of products I would never believe it....I am in LOVE with it completely.</li>
            <li> Scarlight MD sucks...it turn my discolotion scar turn yellow on after a week of using WTF...DONT BUY THIS AT ALL</li>
            <li> Before this purchase I have been using the original scarguard (which in my opinion is the absolute best one and works faster than mederma). I purchased this specific one because I wanted to get rid of this dark colored scar I have from a recent surgery. After 2 weeks of consistent application I still did not see any difference. I didn&#x27;t even see the scar shrink a half an inch. My opinion is spend the extra money and get the original Scarguard. You will actually see results like scars being minimized and quickly!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a scar on my hip from hip replacement surgery.  It was red and ugly in spots even 2 years after surgery.  Since using this on those spots they are much better.</li>
            <li> First used this product to remove 2 old scar marks on my upper arm and chest. I am mixed race (light skinned) so the scars were very noticeable until I used this product. Also used it on my left forehead to remove a mark too. Took about almost 4 weeks but they are completely gone! This product really works!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, waste of money!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 months.  I had extremely dark circles under my eyes and age spots across my nose and cheeks.  It is incredible how much lighter the circles under my eyes are.  I used to have to cover them with concealer before putting on my foundation.  I&#x27;m no longer using concealer at all.  The age marks on my face are totally gone.  It is so noticeable that people have commented that my face looks different, even if they can&#x27;t pinpoint exactly why.    I did experience some slight burning the first week or so but it went away after that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Obagi system to clear up my melasma, liver/age spots, brown spots.  It cleared up a lot but there was still spots left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased Scarlight and was skeptical that it would work.  It only had 2% Hydroquinone and Obagi had 4% Hydroquinone.  But after just 1 month of using it, Scarlight took care of the rest of the spots that Obagi couldn&#x27;t get to!  I&#x27;m simply amazed at this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the brown spots on my face for almost 2 decades.  I tried laser surgeries it didn&#x27;t remove much plus I had a horrible scar on my face afterwards.  I tried Vivite but didn&#x27;t remove much either.  So I got a few microderm abrasion and that removed some but then came right back.  Then I tried a chemical skin peel + Obagi system and that cleared up a lot.  Now I&#x27;m using Scarlight and that simply took care of the rest of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had such clear skin my life and am loving it!  Best of all it&#x27;s the CHEAPEST out of all the products I&#x27;ve tried!  I can see results from Scarlight within 2 weeks.  I can see LOTS of results after 1 month.  This product is simply amazing!</li>
            <li> I am a Male who has \\&quot;Hereditary\\&quot; Dark Eye Circles.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is somewhat \\&quot;Different\\&quot;, and my experience with treating Dark Eye Circles might not be the same as someone else&#x27;s.  After trying countless other products, without much success, I decided to try Scarlight.  The instructions on the Scarlight bottle say to apply the product TWICE daily.  However, I found that applying Scarlight TWICE daily, to my Dark Eye Circles, resulted in the area&#x27;s \\&quot;Very Thin Skin\\&quot; becoming: Too Dry, Irritated, and Red.  Looked like my skin was BURNED.  Uh, Oh!  Now, I apply Scarlight ONCE a day, at night.  In the morning, the dried, yellow-colored, coating on my skin just washes off with either ordinary soap and water, or shampoo.  After a shower, I apply a moisturizer -- Vaseline, Petroleum Jelly, Eucerin, etc. -- on my Dark Eye Circles.  I repeat this application cycle each day.  The result: Scarlight makes the Dark Eye Circle area become \\&quot;Lighter\\&quot;; The old, dry, dark-looking, skin peels away; and, The moisturizer makes new, moist, good-looking, skin \\&quot;Re-Grow\\&quot;.  Scarlight increases my skin&#x27;s \\&quot;Sensitivity\\&quot; to sunlight, and I don&#x27;t want to get \\&quot;Burned\\&quot;.  Whenever possible, I wear a hat, and/or, sunglasses, and avoid prolonged exposure to sunlight.  I&#x27;ve learned that \\&quot;Patience Is A Virtue\\&quot; when treating my Dark Eye Circles.  They are slowly, but surely, fading away.  Hooray!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a good experience with this product. I put it under my eyes to fade my dark circles, also a blemish on my nose and on my forehead. Each place I put the product broke out with lots of zits/pimples, and it was only in those places where I put the product. Luckily I had an acne medication I put on to counteract that. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, everyone is different, but I&#x27;m off to try a different product.</li>
            <li> This product does work but it take awhile before you can see minimal results.  At first, it looks like it makes the scar \\&quot;brighter\\&quot; which in turn made me nervous. It barely makes a significant difference but I want to finish the bottle anyway. I noticed it also treats freckles and so I also applied the Scarlight on my face...After three days, it seemed like my freckles were slightly lighter but I developed severe dryness around the areas where it was treated.  My face was chafing and was embarassing to go out in public.  I discontinued the product on my face and used heavy cream to hydrate my skin to repair it. So all in all, the product is just okay.  Would I buy it again...NO...would I recommend it...NO.</li>
            <li> Read all the positive and negative reviews and decided to give it a try.  I have applied it 2x a day (more or less) and still have about 1/3 of the small bottle left.. I have had no negative effects (redness, peeling etc.)  I see a fading on some old scars and a few age spots (only 50-but too much time in the sun).  On fresh wounds or scars I&#x27;ve applied Mederma, but found it left an unsightly shiny sheen (especially on my face)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s doing the job and help me to cure my scars</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a great an experience with this product.  It&#x27;s very expensive for a tiny little bottle, and it just sat on top of my skin and didn&#x27;t lighten any scars.  Everyone reacts differently to different products, this simply was not effective for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for the first time back in 2010.  I have light olive skin and back in 2010 I had two nickel sized brown melasma spots, one on each cheek. I&#x27;d used a few cheaper drug store products prior with no success.  I came across Scarlight on Amazon and decided to take a chance.  I used this product for about 12 weeks, applying it once or twice a day.  This stuff WAS great!  I distinctly remember that after a couple days use, it would cause my skin to tingle and burn a little at the site of application. Over the next few days my skin would turn red and eventually peel, leaving lightened skin underneath.  Then the process would start all over again.  The skin peeling would happen about once a week, and my face looked messed up with red and peeling spots almost constantly during the entire time I treated my face.  But I could see it was working and persisted. Each time there was peeling, it revealed lighter and lighter skin underneath until eventually my spots were about 90% gone. They were barely noticeable.  Having gotten to a satisfactory point with my spots and not wanting to use HQ longer than 12 weeks, I haven&#x27;t used it since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 years later, I have lots more freckles/sun spots that I want to get rid of.  I picked this up from a Harmon drug store completely expecting to achieve the same results. I used it twice a day for almost two weeks. They must have changed the formula because now my skin doesn&#x27;t peel at all, doesn&#x27;t turn red and no tingling whatsoever.  It feels like I might as well be applying water.  Maybe they decided to change the formula because it was uber strong before, and perhaps they received complaints. But for me, this was the ONLY product I&#x27;d tried that was effective for my spots. I&#x27;m aware that the common knowledge is that it takes time and patience to get rid of melasma and sun spots. However, this product initially impressed me because of how quickly it produced such dramatic results.  That is the main reason I purchased thisa second time.  So in fairness, it may have lightened my spots if I persisted longer.  But seeing as it is recommended to use HQ for only 90 days before taking a break from it for a couple months, I didn&#x27;t want to risk any more time on this product just to achieve minimal or no results.  Exfoliation is a necessity in effectively lightening spots.  Considering this newer version still felt like applying water after almost two weeks twice daily use, I don&#x27;t have much confidence it will cause any exfoliation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such a shame because I recommended this product to anyone who would listen.  I recommended this to my best friend a few months ago, who rushed to order it off Amazon.  I asked her a few weeks in if it was working and I was shocked when she told me that nothing was happening. I just figured that maybe she got a bad bottle.  Well, since using it again I know for sure this product just doesn&#x27;t work the same as it used to.  I can no longer recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wow my under eye dark circles are almost gone! I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a week and I can see a huge difference  under my eyes! I use Less concealer and I look great and let me tell you guys my dark circles were DARK! If you guys have dark circles use this I promise you will see results after a week! Just imagine how your eyes will look after a month all I can say is wow! Ive had circles almost all my life and I always felt embarresed when someone said to me these famous words (you look tired) but I wasn&#x27;t tired... long story short use this and you will see! Enjoy it because I love this I feel more secure and not insecure..[[ASIN:B000RAFEAO Scarguard Scarlight MD, 0.5-Ounces]] (P.S yes ladies you can wear your makeup over this and it still works....)</li>
            <li> I recently had surgery for a tumor in my breast. Thank God it was not canceruous, but as a young female I felt self concious left with this huge scar. I started using scar guard for the last month or less and I can already see the scar fading. I have very sensitive skin and it does irritate or burn. You just brush on the liquid after you shower before bed and let it dry a little before you dress. It leaves a film that dries and flakes away as you sleep. I re apply again in the morning.The instructions say to re apply as desired, but I cannot constantly take off my shirt all day to do so. I would have given five stars but the scar has not faded completely as of yet. I would highly reccommend this product.</li>
            <li> This did nothing for me!!</li>
            <li> sI order this product before in 1oz  size and it works ok,&lt;br /&gt;but later I ordered 0.5oz size and it does not work at all and the product color is different&lt;br /&gt;can some body tell me what is going on??&lt;br /&gt;it supposed to be same product only different size??&lt;br /&gt;thank!</li>
            <li> I am a light-skinned African-American woman who has very dark circles around my eyes.  I ordered Scarguard MD, used it, not only around my eyes, but on dark marks on my face.  After two weeks of applying&lt;br /&gt;the product, I discovered light discolorations or splotches on my face.  I discontinued using Scarguard and made an appointment with a dermatologist. (Paid out of pocket because of lack of insurance).  Prior to ordering, I called Scarguard 800-Customer Service#, twice, to ask about how the product effects&lt;br /&gt;darker skin tones.  I did not get any feedback or response.  My advice is to see a dermatologist before using this product.</li>
            <li> It takes awhile for you to notice any changes, but it does lighten the scars and make a huge difference. Shipping was fast and I would buy from here again when I need another refill.</li>
            <li> This stuff works so well, I will tell anyone who will listen how great it is.  I had surgery a few years ago and had a large incision on the top of my foot.  I had a trip to Cancun planned a few months later and my surgeon told me to keep it out of the sun or the scar would darken and never fade.  Of course, I couldn&#x27;t resist being in the sun and ended up with a very dark scar.  I used this for a few months and was amazed how well it worked.  I showed my doc at a return visit and even he was surprised.  Now I have just a faint shadow of the stitches and no discoloration.  Then last year I had a punch biopsy which basically made a huge hole in my skin.  It also left a weird scar and once again, I used Scarlight and it lightened up immediately.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> So many reasons I&#x27;m happy with this :-)&lt;br /&gt;1.) I&#x27;m currently living overseas and have items shipped to an APO (military) address.  This item arrived a week before it&#x27;s estimated arrival date! Win!&lt;br /&gt;2.) Super-easy to use.  Seriously.  Just follow the directions, and you&#x27;re golden.&lt;br /&gt;3.) I&#x27;ve been using this for just 4 days and already have had someone ask what I&#x27;m doing differently because they can tell that my skin is looking more even!  And I have to agree - this stuff is working wonders on my melasma :-)  I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how well it&#x27;s worked after several weeks of use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More info:  I&#x27;m using this product in conjunction with two others that I purchased through Amazon, and one product I already had.  I use &amp;#34;Scarguard Scarlight  MD, 0.5 Ounces&amp;#34; morning and evening, after washing my face.  I apply it only where the dark discolorations are.  I let it set in for several minutes, until it&#x27;s absorbed, and then I apply my moisturizer.  In the morning, I use a L&#x27;oreal moisturizer that contains SPF30.  In the evenings, I use &amp;#34;Retinol Cream (Vitamin A) - 2 Oz.&amp;#34; (It&#x27;s currently sold on Amazon with  &amp;#34;+ FREE Herbal Authority Blemish Roll-On Stick with Tea Tree Oil&amp;#34; but I haven&#x27;t been using the Tea Tree Oil).  I looove the Retinol Cream - it feels great on my face and neck, not greasy at all and absorbs well.&lt;br /&gt;I have twice now used &amp;#34;Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay - 2 lbs&amp;#34; after washing my face and before doing the Scarguard/moisturizer.  Once I mixed the clay with water, and once with organic apple cider vinegar (the instructions allow for either).  I must say, the vinegar time, I was freaked out for a bit afterward because my skin went Super-Pink!  Like, magenta!  I&#x27;m guessing the vinegar caused that... but, by the next morning my skin was all good again.  I think I&#x27;ll probably mix half water and half vinegar in the future :-)&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I am supremely happy with all three beauty products - Scarguard Scarlight MF, 0.5 Ounces, Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay - 2 lbs, and Retinol Cream (Vitamin A) - 2 Oz, that I purchased on Amazon.  They feel great and I&#x27;m seeing very quick results!&lt;br /&gt;FYI, I&#x27;m a 30 yr old caucasian with fair skin (blonde, blue eyes...) that does tan but also is prone to freckles and especially to melasma.</li>
            <li> Completely inaffective, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> it was ok, scars aren&#x27;t that bad</li>
            <li> Was the wrong product.... Thought I ordered scar guard for scars... This was for discoloration.</li>
            <li> I started using Scarlight several months after my foot surgery to lighten the dark scars on my ankle. Within a couple weeks I noticed my foot had yellow-orange marks where I had been applying to my 3 surgery scars. I continued using but realized the orangy look was getting darker!  I stopped using Scarlight, scrubbed my foot several times a day, even used nailpolish remover to try to get the orange off my foot (I had a wedding to go to and didn&#x27;t want people to see orange blotches on my foot!). Nothing worked!!!  It took about 6 weeks for it to lighten, but it is still NOT gone!!!  Do yourself a favor and get Mederma!!  Do NOT NOT NOT buy this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;PS- apparently I am beyond the return period so I am stuck with an inferior product that they do NOT stand behind!!!</li>
            <li> This was for age spots.  Buy the scarguard for scars and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> My plastic sergeon recommed scarguard right after my sugery. I puchased a bottle at my Drs. office it was $70.00 for 1 oz. I used the scarguard for 3 months. I Found another 0.5 oz. bottle at Target. I used this for abut 1 and a half months. I called my plastic sergeons office and they said to start using scarlight it was thr second stage.I looked at stores and could not find it. I went online and found it at the scarguard web site, but they wanted $30.00 for .05 oz. I went online to amazon and found it for 18.95. I recently went back to my plastic sergeon and he was very pleased, and said in 2 years you won&#x27;t even know there was a scar. And keep using the scarlight.</li>
            <li> This product does an awesome job at helping to lower raise scars and make them fade fast.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this about 5 weeks ago, and the three spots I am treating are fading away.  Two of them are getting difficult to find to treat anymore, so I will stop soon.  The other was quite dark and has faded by half.  Love this product and will be recommending it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I have a dark scar and this product did help lighten it. However, it did not give me the results I was looking for. I am going in to have laser scar treatments on the dark scar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Scarguard Scarlight for about a month and it has lightened my skin considerably.  My primary concern was a dog bite, and now it is almost impossible to see.  After the initial healing, I used Scarguard MD on the raised scar tissue.  It was completely successful and the skin is flat and without any scar tissue.  There was still some redness, so I ordered Scarguard Scarlight especially for that.  Since I know exactly where to look, I can still see a light pink spot, and I&#x27;m hoping that continued use of Scarlight will take it away.  However, the remaining spot is so light that no one else would ever notice it.  The other place that I have used it is on a large, dark age spot on my wrist.  The spot is still visible, although it has lightened considerably.  I&#x27;m hoping that continued use will eventually get rid of it.  I do recommend this product.</li>
