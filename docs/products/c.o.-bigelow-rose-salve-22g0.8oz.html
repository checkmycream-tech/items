            <li>Nice smell and works like a charm.</li>
            <li>For me, this Rose Salve has made night and day difference.  </li>
            <li>rose and the soothing texture of the ointment.  </li>
            <li>Nice salve.</li>
            <li>I prefer the scent of the Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve product, but the Bigelow product is nice, too.</li>
            <li>Just be carfeul not to get it to warm</li>
            <li>update-&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Rose Salve close to 3 months now.</li>
            <li>No lie, I used the rose salve and within 10 minutes it had healed my split skin in my lips.</li>
            <li>the plus side, I feel like my lips are getting a lot of hydration, and it leaves a nice sheen on my lips.</li>
            <li>it has a nice, not too overpowering rose smell.</li>
            <li>But, it is good regardless and smells really nice. :-)</li>
            <li>Great price for such a great product!</li>
            <li>I love Rose Salve -</li>
            <li>This is by far the best product I have used.  </li>
            <li>It makes my lips soft and it smells delicious.</li>
            <li>because the rose salve is the right texture, I can apply it and know that it wont wear off and will be good until I am done working out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is very comfortable on lips.</li>
            <li>Nice mild rose scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>I LOVE rose so this was a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have bought some more to share with my daughters.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this.</li>
            <li>I love it love it love it.</li>
            <li>Beyond those many more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided to try it and fell in love with it, and now its a part of my bedtime routine.</li>
            <li>I love the tin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite skin care item, ever.</li>
            <li>Really love this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I love the product.....</li>
            <li>And it also seems my lips seem to be peeling more often than they did before.</li>
            <li>Definitely one of the best!!</li>
            <li>We both love it.</li>
            <li>I love the cute tin it comes in.</li>
            <li>it would take forever to heal on top of it.</li>
            <li>This also soothes my lips and nourishes them way more.</li>
            <li>I love this salve.</li>
            <li>It worked overnight, and it is better than any product I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>Wished they had a better packaging for my purse.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, the container and the quality.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the feel of this stuff</li>
            <li>I truly thought that there might be a light rose scent or flavor.  </li>
            <li>My lips are soft, and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Good product , nice to use an item developed by a fellow pharmacist !</li>
            <li>love this for my chapped lips, good price, fast shipping</li>
            <li>This rose salve is very moisturizing, but it also smells VERY strongly of...roses?</li>
            <li>Smooth, and a lovely smell.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF, however, it&#x27;s $5.50 at Nordys AND free shipping.</li>
            <li>I googled what was the best chap stick, and this one and one other came up</li>
            <li>Worth every penny! :)</li>
            <li>I get chapped lips in the winter time easy.</li>
            <li>the balm easily goes on my lips.</li>
            <li>But my granddaughter was happy to take them off my hands and seems to be enjoying smearing the salve on various parts of her body.  </li>
            <li>People say it has a strong smell</li>
            <li>smells too strong.  </li>
            <li>I applied the Rose salve the first night and by morning my lips were moist and healed.</li>
            <li>While this is for the most part true I do have some issues with it.</li>
            <li>something more suitable for being intimate).</li>
            <li>I like the fragrance which is a light</li>
            <li>You honestly don&#x27;t need that much to coat your lips because it spreads.</li>
            <li>The packaging is perfect - a compact, sturdy round tin with a lid that stays on.  </li>
            <li>I wait until bath and body works has buy 2, get 1 free</li>
            <li>I can use it on my cuticles, lips, and anywhere else I see fit.</li>
            <li>Smells good and makes lips soft</li>
            <li>It feels good and natural not like I have coated my lips with wax.</li>
            <li>It makes your lips uber soft and smells so good.</li>
            <li>on a good day its easy to open.</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I use it for my lip therapy, for my cuticles, and when my hands feel dry &amp; cracked, it&#x27;s great to use between &amp; on my fingers.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great on dry winter lips and also on cuticles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great during the winter when my skin and lips tends to dry out.</li>
            <li>Rose Salve is very effective, easy to use, and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>My lips feel soft and it gives my cheeks a nice glow.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After 2 days of using Rose Salve I completely got rid of my dryness around my mouth.</li>
            <li>Smells good and does not leave lips chapped or need constant application-</li>
            <li>It goes on glossy and looks nice and feels mosturizing while it is on, but it does not absorb into the lips and leave them feeling soft.</li>
            <li>My whole family love it and using it from head to toe.  </li>
            <li>It does smell lovely and it goes on nicely, but it leaves a dry feeling on my lips as it wears off.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll be buying many more of these just to keep only in case.</li>
            <li>So far good for the price, seems to really help with smoothing the skin, I also used on hands,</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend. :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even softer and smells like roses (and apparently has rose extract).</li>
            <li>and they also have new really cute</li>
            <li>I read that this product was good for hands, lips and even dry feet.</li>
            <li>I use lip balm a lot and this by far, is my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li>This has a strong rose scent but I am so happy that there is no more dry skin on my lips.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t effective and I do not recommend it especially for this price.</li>
            <li>I bought the rose salve at around 11:00 that same day.</li>
            <li>but it was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in AK &amp; we don&#x27;t have bath and body works, so this was so worth the $10 bucks.</li>
            <li>Either way, yes it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>It will harden right up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overly sticky and provides just the right amount of moisture when I need it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really enjoy the smell, partially because it&#x27;s so overwhelming, and don&#x27;t plan to purchase it again.</li>
            <li>My 13-year-old son has inherited my dry lips but hates using product; he still screams his head off if I suggest any kind of cream.  </li>
            <li>This gave me instant gratification--it smelled nice, it was very lubricating.</li>
            <li>But, like most cheaply made lip balms, it ultimately left my lips more dry than they were before I used it.</li>
            <li>At first I needed to use it</li>
            <li>I personally have found my lips to be a lot more moist.</li>
            <li>I feel like it actually soaks in instead of just sitting on top.  </li>
            <li>I put this on first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>I purchased this salve in hopes of finding a better balm than the ones I currently use.</li>
            <li>The first being the smell.</li>
            <li>this salve made it ten times better.</li>
            <li>The first day I put it on, by the end of the day</li>
            <li>So make sure if you leave it in the car that it lays flat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit more oily almost, like it feels more natural and less plasticy like some balms can.</li>
            <li>Pretty much like all the others.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased how long it lasts too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty much feels like tinted vasoline</li>
            <li>love it for my dry lips....</li>
            <li>It certainly helps with chapped lips, but can also help chapped hands or elbows.</li>
            <li>All I need is mascara and a little bit of Rose Salve on my lips, cheeks, and around my eyes.</li>
            <li>It does not stay on very well, have to keep reapplying.  </li>
            <li>It really is a miracle worker.</li>
            <li>and I wanted something gentle but that still worked.</li>
            <li>It does not have much of taste for those wondering about any off-putting taste when it is used for your lips.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this old-fashioned salve.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>This buyer ships fast.</li>
            <li>&amp; yes it really works,</li>
            <li>I feel like I have tried every product under the sun to help alleviate the splitting, cracking, and peeling, but nothing seems to really help longer than 5 or 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Then I got the flu, and the area under my nose was chapped and peeling from blowing my nose so much, so I decided to try this.</li>
            <li>The smell is terrific, not at all overpowering and the tin is very easy to open.  </li>
            <li>Bummed, because I love other Bigelow products.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my lips first, and WOW.</li>
            <li>Reading all the good things about this lip balm I personally had my hopes a little high.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different lip balms, but this is certainly my favorite.</li>
            <li>I am going to have my older sister try it out for her psoriasis.</li>
            <li>I woke up the next day and my face felt soft, supple, and smooth.</li>
            <li>i was a little disappointed that the rose scent is not stronger, but it is an excellent salve.....</li>
            <li>I wish the cap stayed on more tightly though, or screwed on.</li>
            <li>$11.19 is really high.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I just pop a little salve on it and it feels much better).</li>
            <li>A little tacky, but otherwise OK.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite go-to everyday beauty items, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Nice rose smell that won&#x27;t overwhelm you, goes on smoothly, long lasting, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>But you really can&#x27;t complain about a natural product can you?</li>
            <li>It is really soothing and soft, and not sticky at all (and looking at it in the tin, it really looks like it would be sticky, so I was pleasantly surprised).</li>
            <li>I love the smell of roses, but I find that this is a little overpowering especially when I&#x27;m putting it right on my lips.</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve my new must have.</li>
            <li>I wanted something a little less intense (honestly,</li>
            <li>it acted like a clear lip bandage that kept the area moisturized and &#x27;protected&#x27; so that when I opened my mouth, the corners did not tear.</li>
            <li>My husband even used to use it to clear up his cchemical burns from his old job.</li>
            <li>I have tried plain Vaseline, Burt&#x27;s Bees, and countless brands that promote healthy lips.  </li>
            <li>That balm was the first item to ever cure my dry winter lips that peeled (how embarrassing!)</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s more than double the price I usually pay for it.</li>
            <li>I then tried it on my cuticles and the skin in between my thumbs and my hands (which also gets super dry to the point of cracking and bleeding) and this stuff made my dry cuticles and skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Yet he will use this when he reaches the point of major discomfort.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way for an even and smooth application.  </li>
            <li>Finally I can clear up my dryness around my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does leave a natural looking red tint to your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I leave the tin barely covered on my bathroom shelf.  </li>
            <li>This had such great reviews, but I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li>my lips were smooth &amp; soft, no exaggeration, &amp; they were peeling pretty bad that day.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also other new flavors apple + blueberry</li>
            <li>i was hoping it would give a pink tint, but it&#x27;s clear.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It makes my lips soft and it smells delicious.</li>
            <li> because the rose salve is the right texture, I can apply it and know that it wont wear off and will be good until I am done working out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is very comfortable on lips.</li>
            <li> Nice mild rose scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> I LOVE rose so this was a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have bought some more to share with my daughters.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this.</li>
            <li> I love it love it love it.</li>
            <li> Beyond those many more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to try it and fell in love with it, and now its a part of my bedtime routine.</li>
            <li> I love the tin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite skin care item, ever.</li>
            <li> Really love this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I love the product.....</li>
            <li> And it also seems my lips seem to be peeling more often than they did before.</li>
            <li> Definitely one of the best!!</li>
            <li> We both love it.</li>
            <li> I love the cute tin it comes in.</li>
            <li> it would take forever to heal on top of it.</li>
            <li> This also soothes my lips and nourishes them way more.</li>
            <li> I love this salve.</li>
            <li> It worked overnight, and it is better than any product I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> Wished they had a better packaging for my purse.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, the container and the quality.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the feel of this stuff</li>
            <li> I truly thought that there might be a light rose scent or flavor.  </li>
            <li> My lips are soft, and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Good product , nice to use an item developed by a fellow pharmacist !</li>
            <li> love this for my chapped lips, good price, fast shipping</li>
            <li> This rose salve is very moisturizing, but it also smells VERY strongly of...roses?</li>
            <li> Smooth, and a lovely smell.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF, however, it&#x27;s $5.50 at Nordys AND free shipping.</li>
            <li> I googled what was the best chap stick, and this one and one other came up</li>
            <li> Worth every penny! :)</li>
            <li> I get chapped lips in the winter time easy.</li>
            <li> the balm easily goes on my lips.</li>
            <li> But my granddaughter was happy to take them off my hands and seems to be enjoying smearing the salve on various parts of her body.  </li>
            <li> People say it has a strong smell</li>
            <li> smells too strong.  </li>
            <li> I applied the Rose salve the first night and by morning my lips were moist and healed.</li>
            <li> While this is for the most part true I do have some issues with it.</li>
            <li> something more suitable for being intimate).</li>
            <li> I like the fragrance which is a light</li>
            <li> You honestly don&#x27;t need that much to coat your lips because it spreads.</li>
            <li> The packaging is perfect - a compact, sturdy round tin with a lid that stays on.  </li>
            <li> I wait until bath and body works has buy 2, get 1 free</li>
            <li> I can use it on my cuticles, lips, and anywhere else I see fit.</li>
            <li> Smells good and makes lips soft</li>
            <li> It feels good and natural not like I have coated my lips with wax.</li>
            <li> It makes your lips uber soft and smells so good.</li>
            <li> on a good day its easy to open.</li>
            <li> Worth the price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use it for my lip therapy, for my cuticles, and when my hands feel dry &amp; cracked, it&#x27;s great to use between &amp; on my fingers.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great on dry winter lips and also on cuticles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great during the winter when my skin and lips tends to dry out.</li>
            <li> Rose Salve is very effective, easy to use, and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> My lips feel soft and it gives my cheeks a nice glow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After 2 days of using Rose Salve I completely got rid of my dryness around my mouth.</li>
            <li> Smells good and does not leave lips chapped or need constant application-</li>
            <li> It goes on glossy and looks nice and feels mosturizing while it is on, but it does not absorb into the lips and leave them feeling soft.</li>
            <li> My whole family love it and using it from head to toe.  </li>
            <li> It does smell lovely and it goes on nicely, but it leaves a dry feeling on my lips as it wears off.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll be buying many more of these just to keep only in case.</li>
            <li> So far good for the price, seems to really help with smoothing the skin, I also used on hands,</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even softer and smells like roses (and apparently has rose extract).</li>
            <li> and they also have new really cute</li>
            <li> I read that this product was good for hands, lips and even dry feet.</li>
            <li> I use lip balm a lot and this by far, is my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li> This has a strong rose scent but I am so happy that there is no more dry skin on my lips.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t effective and I do not recommend it especially for this price.</li>
            <li> I bought the rose salve at around 11:00 that same day.</li>
            <li> but it was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in AK &amp; we don&#x27;t have bath and body works, so this was so worth the $10 bucks.</li>
            <li> Either way, yes it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> It will harden right up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overly sticky and provides just the right amount of moisture when I need it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really enjoy the smell, partially because it&#x27;s so overwhelming, and don&#x27;t plan to purchase it again.</li>
            <li> My 13-year-old son has inherited my dry lips but hates using product; he still screams his head off if I suggest any kind of cream.  </li>
            <li> This gave me instant gratification--it smelled nice, it was very lubricating.</li>
            <li> But, like most cheaply made lip balms, it ultimately left my lips more dry than they were before I used it.</li>
            <li> At first I needed to use it</li>
            <li> I personally have found my lips to be a lot more moist.</li>
            <li> I feel like it actually soaks in instead of just sitting on top.  </li>
            <li> I put this on first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> I purchased this salve in hopes of finding a better balm than the ones I currently use.</li>
            <li> The first being the smell.</li>
            <li> this salve made it ten times better.</li>
            <li> The first day I put it on, by the end of the day</li>
            <li> So make sure if you leave it in the car that it lays flat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit more oily almost, like it feels more natural and less plasticy like some balms can.</li>
            <li> Pretty much like all the others.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased how long it lasts too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pretty much feels like tinted vasoline</li>
            <li> love it for my dry lips....</li>
            <li> It certainly helps with chapped lips, but can also help chapped hands or elbows.</li>
            <li> All I need is mascara and a little bit of Rose Salve on my lips, cheeks, and around my eyes.</li>
            <li> It does not stay on very well, have to keep reapplying.  </li>
            <li> It really is a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> and I wanted something gentle but that still worked.</li>
            <li> It does not have much of taste for those wondering about any off-putting taste when it is used for your lips.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this old-fashioned salve.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> This buyer ships fast.</li>
            <li> &amp; yes it really works,</li>
            <li> I feel like I have tried every product under the sun to help alleviate the splitting, cracking, and peeling, but nothing seems to really help longer than 5 or 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Then I got the flu, and the area under my nose was chapped and peeling from blowing my nose so much, so I decided to try this.</li>
            <li> The smell is terrific, not at all overpowering and the tin is very easy to open.  </li>
            <li> Bummed, because I love other Bigelow products.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my lips first, and WOW.</li>
            <li> Reading all the good things about this lip balm I personally had my hopes a little high.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different lip balms, but this is certainly my favorite.</li>
            <li> I am going to have my older sister try it out for her psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I woke up the next day and my face felt soft, supple, and smooth.</li>
            <li> i was a little disappointed that the rose scent is not stronger, but it is an excellent salve.....</li>
            <li> I wish the cap stayed on more tightly though, or screwed on.</li>
            <li> $11.19 is really high.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I just pop a little salve on it and it feels much better).</li>
            <li> A little tacky, but otherwise OK.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite go-to everyday beauty items, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Nice rose smell that won&#x27;t overwhelm you, goes on smoothly, long lasting, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> But you really can&#x27;t complain about a natural product can you?</li>
            <li> It is really soothing and soft, and not sticky at all (and looking at it in the tin, it really looks like it would be sticky, so I was pleasantly surprised).</li>
            <li> I love the smell of roses, but I find that this is a little overpowering especially when I&#x27;m putting it right on my lips.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve my new must have.</li>
            <li> I wanted something a little less intense (honestly,</li>
            <li> it acted like a clear lip bandage that kept the area moisturized and &#x27;protected&#x27; so that when I opened my mouth, the corners did not tear.</li>
            <li> My husband even used to use it to clear up his cchemical burns from his old job.</li>
            <li> I have tried plain Vaseline, Burt&#x27;s Bees, and countless brands that promote healthy lips.  </li>
            <li> That balm was the first item to ever cure my dry winter lips that peeled (how embarrassing!)</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s more than double the price I usually pay for it.</li>
            <li> I then tried it on my cuticles and the skin in between my thumbs and my hands (which also gets super dry to the point of cracking and bleeding) and this stuff made my dry cuticles and skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Yet he will use this when he reaches the point of major discomfort.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way for an even and smooth application.  </li>
            <li> Finally I can clear up my dryness around my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does leave a natural looking red tint to your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I leave the tin barely covered on my bathroom shelf.  </li>
            <li> This had such great reviews, but I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> my lips were smooth &amp; soft, no exaggeration, &amp; they were peeling pretty bad that day.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also other new flavors apple + blueberry</li>
            <li> i was hoping it would give a pink tint, but it&#x27;s clear.</li>
            <li> It does smell like roses, but it is very subtle and not too strong.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff - I just got over a major cold....</li>
            <li> But if it does melt then its perfectly flat again and looks brand new(just throw it in the freezer +</li>
            <li> This tin will last a really long time.</li>
            <li> stuff is going to last a REALLY long time.</li>
            <li> This tin will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> long lasting product- will buy again.  </li>
            <li> I had a spot on my upper lip that my lips got so dry they split and began to bleed.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to buy it.</li>
            <li> I wish they sold it in a tub as it helps my feet after a long day in heels.  </li>
            <li> I will repurchase this in the future, but I&#x27;m probably going to cut back on my use and use other lip balms as well to see if that keeps my lips from peeling!</li>
            <li> I primarily use it on my lips, but I have also put it on my cuticles and on areas that are dry and irritated (for example, when I have a cold, constantly blowing my nose leaves it sore and red.</li>
            <li> Now I use it a couple of times a day and wouldn&#x27;t dream of going back to any other product.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this salve on a whim at a Bath and Body Works store when I was there getting some other items.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with extremely dry, chapped lips in the winter and sometimes in the spring.</li>
            <li> When I wake up, I don&#x27;t have dry lips.  </li>
            <li> , I also use it on dry areas.</li>
            <li> last tin lasted forever but finally ran out, long lasting moisture with subtle scent, use every day and night, recommend</li>
            <li> And a little seems to go a long way, so I have a feeling this tin will last quite awhile.</li>
            <li> so the air is very dry</li>
            <li> I have very dry cuticles and hands</li>
            <li> i had very dry patches of skin on my eyes that just wouldn&#x27;t come off no matter</li>
            <li> After a few days I was using it a lot less frequently</li>
            <li> and my lips get dry often due to medication that I take so</li>
            <li> Only warning: don&#x27;t let it melt or the lid will get stuck and it will be hard to open.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with dry lips for years and feel like I have tried a very wide variety of products, done a lot of research, reached out to my Doctor, etc.  </li>
            <li> I found out I can use it on rough patches of skin like: heels, knuckles, elbows, and knees.</li>
            <li> am not a fan of the tin;a lot of trouble to open and close.  </li>
            <li> It can also be used on dry patches of skin and a little bit goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to apply much, little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> only thing I wish it came in small tube for the lips.</li>
            <li> It does not have a strong or bad taste, does not tingle nor burn.  </li>
            <li> I have sand paper dry lips almost year round.</li>
            <li> have extremely dry lips and cuticles year round, but they get unbearable in the winter.</li>
            <li> I applied a little on a rough spot on my hand and it was gone in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I found it greasy and not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re getting more moisture or not, but it&#x27;s gotten a little painful at times.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> It also feels slightly drying after it starts to wear off.</li>
            <li> The scent is stronger than other products but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> + Dab a little on your cheeks</li>
            <li> My lips peel off a few times a year.  </li>
            <li> empty tin containers and counting must mean something.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> My lips will get really dry with red vertical lines all over my lips and they tend to burn and itch really bad.</li>
            <li> you suffer from dry, cracked, painful lips and skin, especially in the winter, do yourself a favor and give this salve a try.</li>
            <li> you can hardly notice it.</li>
            <li> I do have a hard time opening it at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> its hard to get it off</li>
            <li> No more chapped lips!</li>
            <li> I have also used it as a hand lotion, and it leaves every other lotion I have tried in the dust (even the really expensive &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I never really use anything besides crazy rumors lip balm</li>
            <li> I place a lot of emphasis on lip care because having dry chapped lips is painful and not pleasing to the eye.</li>
            <li> it was dry to the point of being painful and itchy.</li>
            <li> due to working out, that area gets chafed and it gets so painful that Ihave to stop whatever I am doing.</li>
            <li> Wish it were not so expensive, but I buy it anyway because you can use it literally ANYWHERE.</li>
            <li> but lately I&#x27;ve been having a awful time with dry cracked lips, even in the corners (opening mouth is painful).</li>
            <li> oh so painful until they healed.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how well it worked, to be something so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement lip balm since they discontinued the colorless lip balm at MAC :(  .</li>
            <li> My oldest son has eczema which flares up horribly this time of year</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Nice smell and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Rose Salve is very effective, easy to use, and long lasting.  I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve tried several different lip balms, but this is certainly my favorite. The smell is wonderful. It does smell like roses, but it is very subtle and not too strong. It certainly helps with chapped lips, but can also help chapped hands or elbows. I sometimes use it as an alternative for lotions. It also lasts a LOOONG time. I bought my tin sometime last year, and I still have a lot left. LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Smells good and makes lips soft</li>
            <li> This is the BEST lip balm I have ever tried. I have put this on maybe 3 times now and my lips are the smoothest they have been in years! Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with dry lips for years and feel like I have tried a very wide variety of products, done a lot of research, reached out to my Doctor, etc.  For me, this Rose Salve has made night and day difference.  My lips are no longer peeling or chapped and I am no longer constantly picking at them.  The scent is stronger than other products but not overwhelming.  At first I needed to use it 24/7.  After a few days I was using it a lot less frequently but my lips were still happy.  Now I use it a couple of times a day and wouldn&#x27;t dream of going back to any other product.</li>
            <li> I applied the Rose salve the first night and by morning my lips were moist and healed. The salve lasts all day, so you rant applying lip balm every two hours. It feels good and natural not like I have coated my lips with wax. I have bought some more to share with my daughters.</li>
            <li> Smells great and adds a bit of color to your lips in addition to moisturizing. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> I read that this product was good for hands, lips and even dry feet. It wasn&#x27;t effective and I do not recommend it especially for this price.</li>
            <li> Smooth, and a lovely smell. I get chapped lips in the winter time easy. I wish the cap stayed on more tightly though, or screwed on.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this. I have sand paper dry lips almost year round. This balm cured that!</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past that&#x27;s why I ordered it again.  I like the fragrance which is a light rose and the soothing texture of the ointment.  I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Nice salve. I prefer the scent of the Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve product, but the Bigelow product is nice, too.</li>
            <li> This is my go to lip gloss. It makes your lips uber soft and smells so good. It&#x27;s also great for dry skin. + Dab a little on your cheeks it works for anything. I have one in my coat at all times + one for the car. Just be carfeul not to get it to warm cause it will melt. So make sure if you leave it in the car that it lays flat. But if it does melt then its perfectly flat again and looks brand new(just throw it in the freezer + it&#x27;ll harden back up). This tin will last a really long time. I use a toothpick to push it all to one side when it looks like its getting low(it lasts FOREVER). I love it love it love it. Best lip gloss ever. So give it a try. There&#x27;s also other new flavors apple + blueberry and they also have new really cute tins.&lt;br /&gt;(retails for $5.50 fyi)</li>
            <li> No fault of the seller, it is the product.  I googled what was the best chap stick, and this one and one other came up so I ordered.  Pretty much like all the others.  It does not stay on very well, have to keep reapplying.  I am looking for one that will stand the test of time.  It may not exist but I will keep looking.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! All I need is mascara and a little bit of Rose Salve on my lips, cheeks, and around my eyes. And I can head out the door. My lips feel soft and it gives my cheeks a nice glow. Worth every penny! :)</li>
            <li> Best lip salve ever!!just like heaven :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this salve! It&#x27;s super moisturizing and smells good too! Plus so versatile! I use it on my lips, cuticles, and elbows and it moisturizes all three incredibly well.</li>
            <li> This rose salve is very moisturizing, but it also smells VERY strongly of...roses? I&#x27;m not sure. I don&#x27;t really enjoy the smell, partially because it&#x27;s so overwhelming, and don&#x27;t plan to purchase it again. Bummed, because I love other Bigelow products.</li>
            <li> Reading all the good things about this lip balm I personally had my hopes a little high. I live in Arizona so the air is very dry but lately I&#x27;ve been having a awful time with dry cracked lips, even in the corners (opening mouth is painful). I have tried Eos, Carmex, Vasline, Softlips and Nivea. Beyond those many more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose Salve works! You don&#x27;t have to apply much, little goes a long way. Plus you don&#x27;t have to  keep reapplying every 30 mins. I personally have found my lips to be a lot more moist. Plus you can use this lip balm anywhere that&#x27;s dry. People say it has a strong smell but honestly it smells good you can hardly notice it. I&#x27;m happy I took the chance and bought this lip balm. Finally I can clear up my dryness around my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 days of using Rose Salve I completely got rid of my dryness around my mouth. I&#x27;ve been trying over 5 months to do this and I&#x27;m beyond happy I found something that actually works. It&#x27;s my go to lip balm from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July 1st 2014 update-&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Rose Salve close to 3 months now. It really is a miracle worker. I found out I can use it on rough patches of skin like: heels, knuckles, elbows, and knees. It will leave a shinny coat when applied but it&#x27;s not a sticky gloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is going to last a REALLY long time. You honestly don&#x27;t need that much to coat your lips because it spreads. I also found out, put the gloss in the freezer for 15 mins if you \\&quot;accidentally\\&quot; leave it in your car. It will harden right up.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with extremely dry, chapped lips in the winter and sometimes in the spring. My lips will get really dry with red vertical lines all over my lips and they tend to burn and itch really bad. Started researching what lip products help with issue, and this one was one of them listed. I decided to try it and fell in love with it, and now its a part of my bedtime routine.</li>
            <li> This product is very comfortable on lips. Also, it stays put for a while even when eating and drinking. I wish something this creamy was made in stick form. If it exists I have not found it. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I bought this Saturday at B&amp;BW. I had a spot on my upper lip that my lips got so dry they split and began to bleed. They bled Saturday morning. I bought the rose salve at around 11:00 that same day. No lie, I used the rose salve and within 10 minutes it had healed my split skin in my lips. I could never get this with Carmex which I used to swear by. The smell was overpowering with Carmex and I wanted something gentle but that still worked. This rose salve is amazing! My lips are soft, and beautiful. I love the tin. This tin will last me a long time. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> i received this rose salve in a timely fashion and in good condition.  i was a little disappointed that the rose scent is not stronger, but it is an excellent salve.....love it for my dry lips....</li>
            <li> I love Rose Salve - I have very dry cuticles and hands and my lips get dry often due to medication that I take so I always have one of these on me or nearby to use throughout the day.  It&#x27;s not overly sticky and provides just the right amount of moisture when I need it.  The packaging is perfect - a compact, sturdy round tin with a lid that stays on.  I have several of these laying around the house to use.  The smell is very pleasant (rosy and with a subtly sweet scent) and not at all overwhelming.  It does not have much of taste for those wondering about any off-putting taste when it is used for your lips.  One of my favorite go-to everyday beauty items, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this for years but never tried it. I&#x27;m so glad I did and I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to buy it. One I&#x27;ve my new must have.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Helps with cuts from scaring and acne as well. Doesn&#x27;t have any scent, I highly recommend. :)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Only warning: don&#x27;t let it melt or the lid will get stuck and it will be hard to open.</li>
            <li> My lips peel off a few times a year.  For the last 25 years, I put on lip balm before going to bed to help.  I have tried plain Vaseline, Burt&#x27;s Bees, and countless brands that promote healthy lips.  This is by far the best product I have used.  A little goes a long way for an even and smooth application.  It does not have a strong or bad taste, does not tingle nor burn.  When I wake up, I don&#x27;t have dry lips.  I feel like it actually soaks in instead of just sitting on top.  I applied a little on a rough spot on my hand and it was gone in the morning.  I wish they sold it in a tub as it helps my feet after a long day in heels.  My 13-year-old son has inherited my dry lips but hates using product; he still screams his head off if I suggest any kind of cream.  Yet he will use this when he reaches the point of major discomfort.  He said that he likes it and it works.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this old-fashioned salve. Wish it were not so expensive, but I buy it anyway because you can use it literally ANYWHERE.</li>
            <li> Great item.  Smells good and does not leave lips chapped or need constant application- long lasting product- will buy again.  Thank you amazon!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite skin care item, ever. My oldest son has eczema which flares up horribly this time of year and this is the only thing I  can put anywhere he breaks out and it clears it up. My husband even used to use it to clear up his cchemical burns from his old job. I am going to have my older sister try it out for her psoriasis. I can&#x27;t  find it in Bath &amp; Body Works anymore so I&#x27;ll be buying many more of these just to keep only in case.</li>
            <li> Good product , nice to use an item developed by a fellow pharmacist !</li>
            <li> I put this on first thing in the morning. Lasts longer than stick type moisturizers.  Nice mild rose scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> Really love this product. I use it for my lip therapy, for my cuticles, and when my hands feel dry &amp; cracked, it&#x27;s great to use between &amp; on my fingers. I&#x27;m pleased how long it lasts too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Christmas, I put one in each of my 5 children&#x27;s stockings...My Son loves it too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I love the product.....I do have a hard time opening it at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to all my friends.  Gloria Novak</li>
            <li> So far good for the price, seems to really help with smoothing the skin, I also used on hands, only thing I wish it came in small tube for the lips.</li>
            <li> best lip gloss I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> I never really use anything besides crazy rumors lip balm but i saw this and got it and its AMAZING. smells SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOKRAGAETHOARTJOKAROTYJOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO gooood! just like roses!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great on dry winter lips and also on cuticles. It can also be used on dry patches of skin and a little bit goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> love this for my chapped lips, good price, fast shipping</li>
            <li> i had very dry patches of skin on my eyes that just wouldn&#x27;t come off no matter what. So i was recommended this product. when i put some on my eye it worked SO well. the skin literally just came off, i didn&#x27;t have to wait overnight or anything. the best part is that it dosen&#x27;t irritate sensetive skin like mine. i&#x27;ve had it for almost 2 months and have barely made a dent in the salve, so this will last you a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing i don&#x27;t like is the cover. its hard to get it off and i had to use pliers once. so what i recommend is not closing it all the way after you use it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff - I just got over a major cold....and that was not only my lip lube, but my nose lube as well (all those tissues and sneezing and rubbing!) - Recommend - lasts FOREVER too!  Worth the price!</li>
            <li> This gave me instant gratification--it smelled nice, it was very lubricating. But, like most cheaply made lip balms, it ultimately left my lips more dry than they were before I used it. Never again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this salve in hopes of finding a better balm than the ones I currently use. While this is for the most part true I do have some issues with it. The first being the smell. I love the smell of roses, but I find that this is a little overpowering especially when I&#x27;m putting it right on my lips. And it also seems my lips seem to be peeling more often than they did before. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re getting more moisture or not, but it&#x27;s gotten a little painful at times.&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, I feel like my lips are getting a lot of hydration, and it leaves a nice sheen on my lips. I actually like wearing this over lip gloss now. I will repurchase this in the future, but I&#x27;m probably going to cut back on my use and use other lip balms as well to see if that keeps my lips from peeling!</li>
            <li> last tin lasted forever but finally ran out, long lasting moisture with subtle scent, use every day and night, recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement lip balm since they discontinued the colorless lip balm at MAC :(  . That balm was the first item to ever cure my dry winter lips that peeled (how embarrassing!) so I had to find a replacement. This balm might be better! It&#x27;s even softer and smells like roses (and apparently has rose extract). Definitely one of the best!!</li>
            <li> Ordered at my mother-in-law&#x27;s request and decided to get one for myself as well. We both love it. She uses on her elbows and I on my heels.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have to state that I am lip balm whore. why? because it should imply that I have tried just about (not there yet) every lip balm I can get my hands on. I place a lot of emphasis on lip care because having dry chapped lips is painful and not pleasing to the eye. I try whatever lip balm I can get my hands on because I have to try it for myself and see the consistency, ease with which it goes on, smell, how it sits on my lips, what it does for my lips. etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is one of my favorites. I love the cute tin it comes in. on a good day its easy to open. it has a nice, not too overpowering rose smell. I LOVE rose so this was a huge plus for me. the balm easily goes on my lips. I am not sitting there digging my finger into it trying to get the product on my finger. it sits on my lips and moisturizes them. it does not feel gooey and sticky. a while back my lips were rebelling and every time I yawned or even opened my mouth to eat, the inner corners of my lips would tear and it was oh so painful until they healed. it would take forever to heal on top of it. I had no idea why and nothing seemed to fix the problem. they would heal then tear again. numerous times. this salve made it ten times better. it acted like a clear lip bandage that kept the area moisturized and &#x27;protected&#x27; so that when I opened my mouth, the corners did not tear. eventually the problem disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in addition to the lips, I also use it on dry areas. the lid states lips, cuticles, elbows, knees, face. I forgot my moisturizer once and my face felt like the Sahara Desert. it was dry to the point of being painful and itchy. I applied it to my face to relieve it. my face did look a bit shiny but this was not an issue for me since I was not going out in public. I woke up the next day and my face felt soft, supple, and smooth. one area that is not stated on the lid that I do apply it to is the nipple area. due to working out, that area gets chafed and it gets so painful that Ihave to stop whatever I am doing. because the rose salve is the right texture, I can apply it and know that it wont wear off and will be good until I am done working out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as a last note. $11.19 is really high. that&#x27;s more than double the price I usually pay for it. I wait until bath and body works has buy 2, get 1 free and I stock up. 6+ empty tin containers and counting must mean something.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an addict to Burt&#x27;s Bees for 6 years of my life. I used that chapstick religiously. As I got into my 20s I wanted something a little less intense (honestly, something more suitable for being intimate). This salve is amazing. I can use it on my cuticles, lips, and anywhere else I see fit. It makes my lips soft and it smells delicious. It doesn&#x27;t have the regular balm texture. It&#x27;s a bit more oily almost, like it feels more natural and less plasticy like some balms can. This also soothes my lips and nourishes them way more. I used to constantly have to apply Burt&#x27;s Bees but with this stuff it&#x27;s like my lips have learned to soften themselves again. I recommend it to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> I love this salve. I primarily use it on my lips, but I have also put it on my cuticles and on areas that are dry and irritated (for example, when I have a cold, constantly blowing my nose leaves it sore and red. I just pop a little salve on it and it feels much better). It&#x27;s great during the winter when my skin and lips tends to dry out.</li>
            <li> No more chapped lips! Cuticles appreciate it too..haha. Smells delish!</li>
            <li> This has a strong rose scent but I am so happy that there is no more dry skin on my lips.  It worked overnight, and it is better than any product I have ever tried.  Not greasy or waxy, and it seems compatible with my lipsticks and glosses.  It does leave a natural looking red tint to your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a fan of the tin;a lot of trouble to open and close.  So I leave the tin barely covered on my bathroom shelf.  Wished they had a better packaging for my purse.</li>
            <li> It goes on glossy and looks nice and feels mosturizing while it is on, but it does not absorb into the lips and leave them feeling soft. It also feels slightly drying after it starts to wear off. But, it is good regardless and smells really nice. :-)</li>
            <li> Great product, I would encourage looking at all the products like this one for an even better deal on this product.</li>
            <li> I use lip balm a lot and this by far, is my absolute favorite! I love the smell, the container and the quality. Perfect for keeping lips hydrated and smooth in the summer and winter. Highly recommend. This buyer ships fast.</li>
            <li> Pretty much feels like tinted vasoline</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s this! It says nowhere on the description on-line that this is a petroleum based product! I would NOT have bought it if I knew.  The smell is terrific, not at all overpowering and the tin is very easy to open.  Maybe, they&#x27;ve upgraded my tin!  But for God&#x27;s sake, let people know when they are buying petroleum, Mr. / Miss Advertiser!</li>
            <li> Cannot open the tin no matter what. Need to return. I threw my money away with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Tried it and now I am hooked. Nice rose smell that won&#x27;t overwhelm you, goes on smoothly, long lasting, and a little goes a long way. And best of all IT REALLY WORKS!!! I was concerned because of the price but it was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> This had such great reviews, but I was disappointed.  It does smell lovely and it goes on nicely, but it leaves a dry feeling on my lips as it wears off.  I like products that soak into my lips and leave them feeling softer after the gloss is gone.  Philosophy&#x27;s lip shines are really good about this, so that is what I look for in balms and salves.</li>
            <li> My whole family love it and using it from head to toe.  It will give you enough moisture yet not too greasy.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the feel of this stuff</li>
            <li> Great price for such a great product! it works wonders and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> smells too strong.  my fiance hates the smell.  so do i frankly.  the feel is very nice though.  i was hoping it would give a pink tint, but it&#x27;s clear.</li>
            <li> I can never find a Chapstick or a balm that actually heals my lips &amp; keeps them that way. My lips are constantly peeling, chapping, etc. but this...I will never buy another Chapstick. The first day I put it on, by the end of the day my lips were smooth &amp; soft, no exaggeration, &amp; they were peeling pretty bad that day. I&#x27;m in AK &amp; we don&#x27;t have bath and body works, so this was so worth the $10 bucks. But I guess it does retail for like $5 in store. Either way, yes it&#x27;s worth it &amp; yes it really works,</li>
            <li> You almost get what you would expect.  I truly thought that there might be a light rose scent or flavor.  But you really can&#x27;t complain about a natural product can you? Or am I?</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this salve on a whim at a Bath and Body Works store when I was there getting some other items. It was only $6 plus I had a 20% off coupon, so I figured that even if I didn&#x27;t like it, I wasn&#x27;t out a ton of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely dry lips and cuticles year round, but they get unbearable in the winter. I feel like I have tried every product under the sun to help alleviate the splitting, cracking, and peeling, but nothing seems to really help longer than 5 or 10 minutes. I bought this salve to keep in my desk at work. I tried it on my lips first, and WOW. It is really soothing and soft, and not sticky at all (and looking at it in the tin, it really looks like it would be sticky, so I was pleasantly surprised). I then tried it on my cuticles and the skin in between my thumbs and my hands (which also gets super dry to the point of cracking and bleeding) and this stuff made my dry cuticles and skin soft and supple. I have also used it as a hand lotion, and it leaves every other lotion I have tried in the dust (even the really expensive &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; lotions I have tried from Sephora).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you suffer from dry, cracked, painful lips and skin, especially in the winter, do yourself a favor and give this salve a try. I was shocked at how well it worked, to be something so inexpensive. And a little seems to go a long way, so I have a feeling this tin will last quite awhile. I think I will go pick up another couple of tins for the car and the house!</li>
            <li> I am in my 70s, and my skin is quite wrinkled.  This product removes a lot of those wrinkles.  I like it.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews. I bought this years ago and it sat in a drawer because I didn&#x27;t know what to do with it. Then I got the flu, and the area under my nose was chapped and peeling from blowing my nose so much, so I decided to try this. 24 hours later I&#x27;m still blowing my nose, but my skin is healed. I&#x27;m definitely impressed.</li>
            <li> I found it greasy and not worth the money.  But my granddaughter was happy to take them off my hands and seems to be enjoying smearing the salve on various parts of her body.  I guess it takes all kinds.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF, however, it&#x27;s $5.50 at Nordys AND free shipping. I&#x27;d recommend getting it there!!</li>
            <li> A little tacky, but otherwise OK.  Overnight repair of lips, cracks between toes, etc.</li>
    </ol>
