            <li>Make sure you use sun-screen products on top of this.</li>

            <li>Its more sticky.  </li>
            <li>Love this product - ordered on a Monday - received on Thursday. :)</li>
            <li>The eye cream in this line is my favorite.</li>
            <li>, I was told that my skin looked so much more hydrated, blah, blah, blah - and</li>
            <li>I have tried so many others</li>
            <li>Had been rx by a dermatologist as one of the better products on the market.</li>
            <li>Love this skin care line.</li>
            <li>It is very rich and creamy, but it doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to be oily.</li>
            <li>It was pretty moisturizing and made my skin look so good that strangers used to stop me and ask about my skincare.</li>
            <li>Glad it&#x27;s available on Amazon at a lower price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the smooth product, the look and feel of it gliding on my face.</li>
            <li>the shipper was good and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s another product for the eye which does not have this strong plastic scent.  </li>
            <li>This product tightened my skins and pores, make it smooth and even.  </li>
            <li>This does not go on smooth like the one in the photo.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t quite get over the aborted babies, I quit using, if ur conscious can handle that the product works good.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good treatment but not a moisturizer (this was confirmed at a later visit to my dermatologist).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will now pay full price for it at derm&#x27;s office to get the greatness of what this products does for my skin.</li>
            <li>I love, it is light weight and really takes care of your skin with great results and no greasy or heavy feel</li>
            <li>it absorbs quickly, has no fragrance or dyes.</li>
            <li>I used Neocutis once, about 12 yrs ago and wasn&#x27;t too impressed, but I only used it for about a month and my skin really didn&#x27;t need it back then.</li>
            <li>Like this product very much.</li>
            <li>Although it is a bit pricey compared to other popular department store products, it will worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>and as the price seems to keep getting higher, I decided to look around for a cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li>I paid for this product $110.00 the first time</li>
            <li>Seems to have helped with those fine lines that we fight especially if you have exposed your skin to a lot of sun over the years .</li>
            <li>The one in the white bottle goes on super silky smooth and leaves my skin feeling dewy and soft.</li>
            <li>Find it to be very hydrating.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using sparingly and really you don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li>It feels very sticky when applying.</li>
            <li>I ordered this as it is priced about as much as &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; moisturizer, but I really see no difference.  </li>
            <li>First time got from a MD in Florida and half the size for more money.  </li>
            <li>I finished using one bottle (last about 2 months, using twice daily) and bought 2 more to use it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Seems to have made my fine lines less noticeable.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little strong also.</li>
            <li>With the old one, a little went a long way and it was very emollient, now you have to use much more product.</li>
            <li>I really wish they would bring the old product back.</li>
            <li>My under eye skin is so soft and clear.  </li>
            <li>I definitely saw much improvement on my skin and will continue using this product.  </li>
            <li>So far, I think I will stick with it, since it is almost $30 cheaper than SkinMedica.</li>
            <li>Originally developed to help heal burns.  </li>
            <li>I thought that my skin was adjusting and kept using it,I then developed this growth on my forehead that looked like cancer about size of pea.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that it has an old smell.  </li>
            <li>The amount needed to moisturize reminds me of an old brill cream commercial...</li>
            <li>I spent about 120.00 for whole package, which Im reviewing.</li>
            <li>If you are still skeptical about this review I invite you to take a moment of your time to investigate this on your own.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to everyone who has dry skin.</li>

            <li> and I don&#x27;t care what the other reviewers are saying, this is not the same product.</li>
            <li> I used it on one half of my face to compare the performance to my current products.</li>

            <li> Package different than before..  also this cream different than before...Seems not effective on my face.</li>
            <li> Eat food that is unprocessed and organic and wear sunscreen.</li>
            <li> it is not very creamy.</li>
            <li> And the product feels differernt than what I bought at the skin care center.</li>
            <li> Meaning the cells are from human babies who have been essentially killed from their mother&#x27;s wombs with the consent of the mother and then processed to make beauty creams.</li>
            <li> lotion has a medium consistency and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and just turned 60 a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> the product is expensive though .i wish it was cheaper and for that reason i won&#x27;t be ordering it very often.</li>
            <li> This product is expensive and high end.  </li>
            <li> No good results, had these red spots/splotches developing.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Just a little dab will do ya&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I quit use after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Really not sure what the hype is.  </li>
            <li> This feels thick and as if it is leaving residue on my face and neck ~ it does not moisturize well at all.</li>
            <li> It is less expensive to purchase at Amazon then to purchase in a department store or plastic surgeons office.</li>
            <li> Not good for undermake up.</li>
            <li> Duh!</li>
            <li> It was awful, barely moisturizing at all</li>
            <li> Sick, you are putting dead baby parts on your face!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> When I discontiued the growth flaked off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, I&#x27;m sick to death and hope others realize this company does use fetal cells how this got by me!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Sick, you are putting dead baby parts on your face! Don&#x27;t do it! Just stop! Everything about this is wrong. Eat food that is unprocessed and organic and wear sunscreen. Duh!</li>
            <li> Like this product very much. Skin definitely feels smoother and i believe it does help reduce wrinkles</li>
            <li> the cream does improve my skin. i can see improvement in my skin texture after 3-4 weeks: softer skin without oiliness and more even complexion. i also like the consistency of this product. it is not very creamy. perfect wear for the day (i am a dancer so i sweat a lot) :)</li>
            <li> This product is expensive and high end.  Recommend by my esthitician.  The only problem is that it has an old smell.  I think it had been sitting on a shelf for awhile.  I hope it still does what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> It is the best eye cream that I&#x27;ve come across. Highly recommended by my dermatologist.  My under eye skin is so soft and clear.  I don&#x27;t have any crow&#x27;s feet.  Find it to be very hydrating.  I use it morning and night.</li>
            <li> luv another brand better!</li>
            <li> Really not sure what the hype is.  Didn&#x27;t make a lot of difference for me.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist.  Good product for the 50+ age group.  Seems to have helped with those fine lines that we fight especially if you have exposed your skin to a lot of sun over the years .</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my aesthetician as a moisturizer. I think it&#x27;s a good treatment but not a moisturizer (this was confirmed at a later visit to my dermatologist).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion has a medium consistency and a little goes a long way. It does not have any off-putting smell, which I appreciate. It&#x27;s good product to include as part of a routine, look elsewhere for moisture though.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t leave the house without this on my face feels wonderful I have very dry skin and my face feels moist all day!  suzanne</li>
            <li> This product had a yucky, chemical, plastic smell. I like and use the Lumiere Riche Eye Balm and the tinted moisturize with sunscreen but don&#x27;t like this at all.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m loving it!!!!! I&#x27;m using sparingly and really you don&#x27;t need a lot. I apply on back of my hand and then dab on areas and blend.</li>
            <li> The skin care lines were recommended to me by my plastic surgeon.  It is less expensive to purchase at Amazon then to purchase in a department store or plastic surgeons office.</li>
            <li> I wanted the eye cream and this was a package deal. I am not overly impressed because of the way it feels on my face. Not good for undermake up. I would recommend it only for night use. The smell is a little strong also.</li>
            <li> I have asian skin (oily in T-zone and dry on cheeks and chin), and some uneven tone &amp; redness on my cheeks.  This product tightened my skins and pores, make it smooth and even.  I finished using one bottle (last about 2 months, using twice daily) and bought 2 more to use it.  I definitely saw much improvement on my skin and will continue using this product.  Although it is a bit pricey compared to other popular department store products, it will worth every penny.  It will help your skin looks youthful and your skin will works better with make up.  Make sure you use sun-screen products on top of this.</li>
            <li> This product works better than many I have tried for smoothing out wrinkles and hydrating my skin.  It is very rich and creamy, but it doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to be oily.</li>
            <li> My daughter works at a medical health spa and guided me into using this cream. I love, it is light weight and really takes care of your skin with great results and no greasy or heavy feel</li>
            <li> Been using this product for over 15 years. Glad it&#x27;s available on Amazon at a lower price. I am disappointed that they keep raising the price, as it seems I&#x27;m paying what I paid for when I had to buy it at a dermatologists office.</li>
            <li> The amount needed to moisturize reminds me of an old brill cream commercial...&amp;#34;Just a little dab will do ya&amp;#34;. I like it.</li>
            <li> Would not order, again. Lessened learned, you get what you pay for. I will now pay full price for it at derm&#x27;s office to get the greatness of what this products does for my skin. This was a fake, and did nothing for me or my skin.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s another product for the eye which does not have this strong plastic scent.  It feels very sticky when applying.</li>
            <li> The picture shown here is not what I got when it shipped. And the product feels differernt than what I bought at the skin care center. Its more sticky.  Im using it anyway to see if I get the same results.</li>
            <li> I had been using SkinMedica TNS Recovery for about 9 mos. and as the price seems to keep getting higher, I decided to look around for a cheaper alternative. I used Neocutis once, about 12 yrs ago and wasn&#x27;t too impressed, but I only used it for about a month and my skin really didn&#x27;t need it back then. I&#x27;m really happy using Neocutis (as someone already mentioned,it is in a cream base), along with the Journee tinted version with Spf for daytime. So far, I think I will stick with it, since it is almost $30 cheaper than SkinMedica. From my understanding, it takes about 4 1/2 months for skin to go through an entire \\&quot;cycle,\\&quot; which is probably why some people don&#x27;t experience a big difference immediately.</li>
            <li> Love this product - ordered on a Monday - received on Thursday. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the smooth product, the look and feel of it gliding on my face.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of it, not greasy. Seems to have made my fine lines less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this purchase. I feel duped.  I received a blue bottle unlike the white one in the photo and I don&#x27;t care what the other reviewers are saying, this is not the same product. This does not go on smooth like the one in the photo. This feels thick and as if it is leaving residue on my face and neck ~ it does not moisturize well at all. The one in the white bottle goes on super silky smooth and leaves my skin feeling dewy and soft. I want to return this, but I have opened it and threw out the packaging before I realized...</li>
            <li> These products were recommended to me by my dermatologist.  They are a good base to use under your moisturizer.  Originally developed to help heal burns.  The eye cream in this line is my favorite.</li>
            <li> 3rd time getting this cream.  First time got from a MD in Florida and half the size for more money.  Very effective nd helps with Rosacea.</li>
            <li> This used to come in a tube and was made in Europe. It was pretty moisturizing and made my skin look so good that strangers used to stop me and ask about my skincare. Now it is in a fancier pump package and is made in the USA. With the old one, a little went a long way and it was very emollient, now you have to use much more product. I used it on one half of my face to compare the performance to my current products. It was awful, barely moisturizing at all and I swear it gave me wrinkles. I quit use after a few weeks. I really wish they would bring the old product back. For Growth Factors, I prefer ReVive.</li>
            <li> i like this face cream. it absorbs quickly, has no fragrance or dyes. it doesn&#x27;t cause skin irritation or acne. the shipper was good and fast delivery. the product is expensive though .i wish it was cheaper and for that reason i won&#x27;t be ordering it very often.</li>
            <li> This is o.k.  I had gotten some samples from my dermatologist and when I went back for a check-up on my skin, I was told that my skin looked so much more hydrated, blah, blah, blah - and then the attempt at a sell of a line of these products for about $400!  I ordered this as it is priced about as much as &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; moisturizer, but I really see no difference.  I&#x27;ll finish the bottle but won&#x27;t reorder.</li>
            <li> This product makes my face moist without having to use alot.  I highly recommend to everyone who has dry skin.</li>
            <li> This cream is my guilty pleasure... Was introduced to it six years ago, and I love it! Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and I have try all over the counter products waisting my time and money. I started using this product four months ago when it was recomended to me at my skin care place. Since day one my skin started to improve. I paid for this product $110.00 the first time so getting it from here is a great deal!!</li>
            <li> Effective as described. I recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a hastening of healing with no or minimize scar. I will purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product at all!.&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy again.  Doesn&#x27;t do anything at all I can see.&lt;br /&gt;Too costly when it does nothing!</li>
            <li> I wish that my eyes looked like they did when I was 19, but they don&#x27;t. I tried this product and feel that it is the best one on the market. I have tried so many others I couldn&#x27;t begin to list them all. I have very dry skin, and just turned 60 a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I use this every night.  It is creamy but not at all greasy or oily.  Great moisturizer.  I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> this product DOES contains an ingredient by the name of Processed Skin Cell Proteins, or PSP which comes from medically donated aborted human fetuses. Meaning the cells are from human babies who have been essentially killed from their mother&#x27;s wombs with the consent of the mother and then processed to make beauty creams. Most of the line of this brand contains this ingredient, so if you are pro life or just find it creepy where the ingredient comes from I recommend you do not buy this product. If you are still skeptical about this review I invite you to take a moment of your time to investigate this on your own. Thank you.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen any difference.  probably won&#x27;t buy again.  Had been rx by a dermatologist as one of the better products on the market.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product.</li>
            <li> Package different than before..  also this cream different than before...Seems not effective on my face.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Works great and lasts a while (you don&#x27;t need a lot to get problem areas on your face)</li>
            <li> Love this skin care line.</li>
            <li> There was an ingredient in this product that caused my skin to get a rash.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the cleanser and tinted make-up from my dermatologist. I spent about 120.00 for whole package, which Im reviewing. This is the only item that caused me an allergic reaction. No good results, had these red spots/splotches developing.I thought that my skin was adjusting and kept using it,I then developed this growth on my forehead that looked like cancer about size of pea. When I discontiued the growth flaked off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, I&#x27;m sick to death and hope others realize this company does use fetal cells how this got by me!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t quite get over the aborted babies, I quit using, if ur conscious can handle that the product works good. U can google the aborted babies, tons of researcher docs</li>
