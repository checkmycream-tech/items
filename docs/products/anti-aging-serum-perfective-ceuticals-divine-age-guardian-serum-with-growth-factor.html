            <li>/&gt;The packaging and bottles are attractive and look well on the vanity.</li>
            <li>I love this Serum!!  </li>

            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>and she had nothing but good things to say  as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nonetheless, it is a pleasant product to use in an attractive package, and making allowances for the many skin conditions and types, perhaps others will have a better result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m sure you will be please with the results.can use all help I can get to fight aging all the way!</li>
            <li>It really is amazing.</li>
            <li>After about two weeks of using this serum my husband was watching me wash my face and said, \\&quot;your skin looks younger,\\&quot; to which I smiled.</li>
            <li>I have one of those really nice wall mounted, lighted, magnifying mirrors in the bathroom now....</li>
            <li>After reading a number of enthusiastic 5-star reviews, I had hoped for some noticeable improvement in the tone and tautness of my 60-year skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I received sample products from the manufacturer for my trials.se in an attractive package, and making allowances for the many skin conditions and types, perhaps others will have a better result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclosure: I received this product from Perfective Ceuticals in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>The gene pool has not always been kind to me.  </li>
            <li>If you are thinking about putting out this kind of money on this type of product...go with something you know.</li>
            <li>serum spreads nicely, leaves no shine</li>
            <li>I decided I didn&#x27;t have anything to lose, so I accepted their generous offer and made it known that I would write an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have referred this product to many of my girl friends and family and they have been very pleased with the results.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this serum in conjunction with the Perfective Ceuticals skin cream, and couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a facelift in a tube, but it&#x27;s the most effective serum</li>
            <li>In my opinion, I think the product work best if you use the complete skin care system in tandem.    </li>
            <li>All natural and great!</li>
            <li>Most important, it works, and my skin is very smooth and feels good.</li>
            <li>Some of Perfective Ceuticals products have a rose scent, and because this one does not it is my preferred night time treatment as strong scents tend to keep me from falling asleep quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this serum.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to even better skin as the weeks go by.</li>
            <li>This is for people (men &amp; women) wanting to stop more wrinkles from appearing.</li>
            <li>This is one of the BEST FACIAL PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>I got this at the same time as an anti wrinkle cleanser, which is perfect, between the 2 products I would really be able to see improvement of my wrinkles disappearing</li>
            <li>I love this serum for a number of reasons.</li>
            <li>so was able to start this routine with both products.  </li>
            <li>glad</li>
            <li>All the wrinkles, bags and spots are still there :)</li>
            <li>I love the serum.</li>
            <li>For something like this, I had to take before and after photos to be sure I&#x27;m not kidding</li>
            <li>/&gt;Without telling my children which photos were before and after, or even the reason for my questions, I asked my kids to pick which photos my skin looks better in.</li>
            <li>Have you noticed how &#x27;most&#x27; of the 5☆ ratings are from \\&quot;Non</li>
            <li>And my d&amp;eacute;colletage area looks much better.</li>
            <li>And my décolletage area looks much better.</li>
            <li>When I heard I was going to be able to do a review for the serum</li>
            <li>It did not cause a problem when using it under my night creams as so many serums I have tried can do.</li>
            <li>really love everything about it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you will be please with the results.</li>
            <li>I started using Divine Age Guardian Serum, I wasn&#x27;t sure what my results would be.</li>
            <li>I love the results I got from using Divine Age Guardian Serum with Growth Factor.</li>
            <li>And then before the lines on my face, I discovered I have a very significant crease on my neck.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>have pretty good skin, but I am aging, and there are all kinds of things going on around my mouth, eyes, and neck.  </li>
            <li>I had tried and and reviewed the night cream and eye cream from this line and loved them so much they did wonders for my skin!</li>
            <li>More importantly, it does not leave a \\&quot;skin\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m the only one who notices, but I&#x27;ll happily take softening lines and wrinkles and more supple feeling over just letting signs of age</li>
            <li>The problem is with most serums is they can cause your heavier night creams to pill and simply roll off your face so the benefits from a night cream are greatly compromised.&lt;br /&gt;Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Serum with Growth Factor</li>
            <li>/&gt;EGF works by reducing the length and depth of fine lines.</li>
            <li>really love this serum for many reasons, first its a very quick drying thinner serum that absorbs into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li>After using for 2 weeks, I can feel a huge difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>It is light and not oily at all.</li>
            <li>My skin started to feel nice and smooth again within a few nights and my friend said your great skin has returned.</li>
            <li>Please feel free to check out my experiences on these products in my video review.</li>
            <li>this bottle should last you a great while.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m in my early-fifties, with fair and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The light colored age spots on my face have lightened but are still there, the wrinkles from my nose to mouth have improved significantly.</li>
            <li>The light colored age spots on my face have lightened but are still there, the wrinkles from my nose to mouth have improved significantly.</li>
            <li>It spreads easily and quickly.  </li>
            <li>-- that is, it gets absorbed into the skin instead of becoming an overlay, as some serums do.  </li>
            <li>I am so excited to tell you all about my experiences with Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Serum with Growth Factor.</li>
            <li>in my mid 60&#x27;s, have a fair complexion which is sprinkled with light colored freckles.</li>
            <li>The serum glides on smooth and absorbs quickly with no stickiness.</li>
            <li>It is very light and extremely gentle.</li>
            <li>pretty it will do so much for your skin because of the really effective Ingredients in it.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>Skin cancer cells have receptors that bind to EGF, causing you to develop full blown cancer.     </li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved the instant effects and</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be sure, I use the whole Perfective Ceuticals regimen twice a day.</li>
            <li>Cool.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any fragrance, which is nice for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was great and shipped the items on time, and even included samples of other products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been quite pleased with how well this anti-aging system has worked, and have noticed some fading now also on the much more obvious neck crease.</li>
            <li>: I like how my skin feels with it on, I like how quickly it rubs into the skin,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, and does not have a greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Divine Age Guardian  line -- serum, eye cream, and face cream -- for two weeks now, and I&#x27;m stunned at how quickly I noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li>so I started looking at pics of older people &amp; noticed many of them have wrinkles in this area.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using  Perfective Ceutical Anti-aging Guardian Serum with Growth Factor  for about 2 1/2 weeks now and saw results quickly.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re working for me, and they worked quickly.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re working for me, and they worked quickly.</li>
            <li>Not only are the results nice, but the feeling of moist, well-hydrated skin lasts all day - not because of unabsorbed product, but because the face and neck really are in better shape and hydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used a professional grade Canon EOS 5D Mark III full frame camera with an L (top of the line) lens, with identical camera and lens settings for the before and after images.</li>
            <li>If you have had extensive sun exposure then it&#x27;s best to visit your dermatologist first to test yourself for potential skin cancer risk.</li>
            <li>It is totally odorless which is very important to me as I prefer fragrance free cosmetics.</li>
            <li>I have been an Elizabeth Arden or Estee Lauder user most of my adult life, so I am familiar with quality products and these really are something special.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing just how much it will continue to smooth out my skin, with continued use.</li>
            <li>I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth the expense.</li>
            <li>Direction say to use 3-5 drops to the freshly cleansed face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My mother is even more sensitive to products than I am</li>
            <li>The price may be offset by the fact that these products are rich and require a smaller amount which may make them comparable in price to the better department store brands.</li>
            <li>a convert.s are rich and require a smaller amount which may make them comparable in price to the better department store brands.</li>
            <li>It mixes well, and rubs right into my skin</li>
            <li>In all, it smoothes and reduces fine lines and wrinkles for a more vibrant, youthful appearance.&lt;br /&gt;Incorporated with a cocktail of powerful anti-oxidants and the moisture binding Hyaluronic Acid, it also restores radiance and suppleness and boosts the skin&#x27;s immune function to shield against future aging.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was happy to see that I finally found a product that actually does what it promises.</li>
            <li>After using for 3 weeks, using once a day, sometimes 2 times a day, I have been able to see: my forehead wrinkles aren&#x27;t as deep set, and aren&#x27;t as noticeable when my face is calm and still.  </li>
            <li>I also got my Dad&#x27;s good skin, so while I am in the middle of my  seventh decade, I am not as yet a wrinkled old crone.  </li>
            <li>it will dry nicely</li>
            <li>realize the cost on this is up there, but really not that much more than many of the high end brands</li>
            <li>While my skin was fairly wrinkle free to start with, it was starting to look dry and crepey...</li>
            <li>It absorbed into the skin quickly and left the area feeling hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that the texture of my skin has improved in the first week of use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In addition, I&#x27;ve experienced no sensitivity, and this pump-container that it is stored in, will last a long time.</li>
            <li>my neck &amp; waist are too short, my shoulders more like those of a football player.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After cleansing, the serum is the first product in the line that you apply.  </li>
            <li>That means that when you apply the facial cream on top, you won&#x27;t be pulling up the serum in the process.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first thought: &#x27;If this product line works, how will I prove it?&#x27;...</li>
            <li>, I suggest you email their customer service department to inquire if the seller you&#x27;re interested in purchasing Perfective Ceutical&#x27;s products from is an authorized reseller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I suggest you email their customer service department to inquire if the seller you&#x27;re interested in purchasing Perfective Ceutical&#x27;s products from is an authorized reseller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>are some of the many reasons this serum and the entire line of Perfective Ceuticals works so well.&lt;br /&gt;Divine</li>
            <li>/&gt;After two weeks, both of us have smoother and brighter skin, but more than that have seen actual reduction of lines.</li>
            <li>like the pretty cobalt blue packaging, and the serum is pleasant to use, but at an investment of ~$1+ per day (given the currently displayed price), I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be continuing with this product in the hope that some improvement will eventually occur.</li>
            <li>In addition, I really like how smooth and soft it keeps my skin all day.</li>
            <li>If you have oily skin and want to buy only one product in the line, I recommend the serum because it&#x27;s so light and easily absorbed.  </li>
            <li>Would this magic serum really turn back the hands of time?</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s OK; I&#x27;ve earned them all, but I do miss the supple, smooth and soft face of my not so distant past.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take long for me to discover that I had much better results when I used  the serum twice a day.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have many deep wrinkles, just normal aging wrinkles.</li>
            <li>The serum doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance, is clear &amp; absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>, it works well, is easy to apply and you get a whole lot of serum in this bottle, because you only need to use 3-5 drops of it</li>
            <li>The directions are to apply 3-5 drops to a freshly cleansed face, and I find that one pump squirts out a little more than 5 drops, so use a little more sparingly than you are tempted!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how they do it but the effectiveness of how it makes both fine and relatively deep lines on my face just disappear is beyond comprehension.</li>
            <li>We have both used both products everyday for a little over two weeks and the results are a delightful surprise.</li>
            <li>This stuff intensely fights wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>The seller response and delivery were fast.</li>
            <li>very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>much better!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It’s very non-disruptive to my skin care and makeup routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Age Guardian Serum with Growth Factor is an intense wrinkle serum that features an unparalleled physiological combination of Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) and Amino Peptide.</li>
            <li>Actually, they were nice enough to send samples of the face cream with the orders, so I started with all three at once.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Perfect Ceuticals serum is a thin liquid substance that promises younger looking skin.</li>
            <li>As a natural stawberry blonde, I sunburn easily.</li>
            <li>One application of a small amount and my skin  felt and looked amazing - even before I applied the eye cream</li>
            <li>This is a good price for an anti-aging serum with a long list of active ingredients.</li>
            <li>In fact, you could technically wear this without a moisturizer on top because it is moisturizing enough (but, of course, you should always wear moisturizer with SPF regardless).</li>
            <li>I think this article sets up a realistic expectation of the type of improvement one might expect.</li>
            <li>I think this article sets up a realistic expectation of the type of improvement one might expect.</li>
            <li>first change I noticed was that after the first few weeks, my makeup wasn&#x27;t settling into my smile lines as much anymore.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now after a little more than 2 weeks I can see an improvement.</li>
            <li>Applied to clean skin before the anti-aging cream, this product is extremely light, almost silky, not the least bit greasy or sticky and without any of that \\&quot;slime\\&quot; factor.  </li>
            <li>My face really feels refreshed after using it, and I&#x27;ve completely replaced my moisturizer and have been using just this.  </li>
            <li>As far as my neck, I haven&#x27;t really noticed any changes, with my skin, or the neck wrinkles there.  </li>
            <li>When you&#x27;ve had problem skin all your life, it&#x27;s exciting to find something that actually works and does what it says it will do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;ve had problem skin all your life, it&#x27;s exciting to find something that actually works and does what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>Granted, I didn&#x27;t have a large amount of early signs of aging to begin with, but a youthful face will never go out of style, and its never too early to baby your face!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not oily at all and has not caused me to break out, which sometimes happens with a new product.</li>
            <li>My skin felt more supple and soft within a few days.  </li>
            <li>Mom has light to moderate wrinkles on her face and moderate wrinkling on her</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick, slow to absorb, which in my book means it&#x27;s working rather than evaporating, and best of all,  produces a noticeable result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The delivery system is a pump, which delivers a small amount of cream and is easy to control not to use too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them in the recommended order of first applying this serum, then applying the eye cream, then finally the face</li>
            <li>It is the first step in a regimen to make your skin look younger and brighter.  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>For years I&#x27;ve believed the people who told me I could get the same results using drugstore brands as the higher end brands.</li>
            <li>I also have a couple light colored age spots on my face which I&#x27;ve noticed  on other 45+ year old people too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Every pore in your face looks like our local, poorly maintained county roads around here, but it DOES afford you the opportunity to really get a good look at your skin!&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>so I figure anything that will keep my skin firm for as long as possible is a good product.</li>
            <li>It does moisturize my skin somewhat, but my skin is naturally very dry, so I apply the moisturizing cream after the serum has been fully absorbed into my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finally pulled the trigger and thought I&#x27;ve spent more than this on high quality products before and had only minimal results.&lt;br /&gt;Also, because of the dryness, I have to use WAY more product than the average person.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>:B0030DK7E8 Anti-aging Serum - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Serum with Growth Factor]], is clear and odorless.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive combination skin.</li>
            <li>However the sticky factor is eliminated once its completely rubbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li>It gives the skin a radiant, soft and refined complexion and it noticeable lessens pores and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>This serum is completely non-annoying.</li>
            <li>how soft it made my skin feel.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Having this direct line to them I wrote to them asking the details about the &amp;#34;growth&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I wanted to understand better what this was and whether it could have any negative effects by penetrating my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see these</li>
            <li>It Will make your face so soft and</li>
            <li>My only concern is that the few spider veins on my cheeks *seem* slightly more visible.</li>
            <li>(photo can be located by following &#x27;customer photos&#x27; link under the main photo).</li>
            <li>Other details that I noticed: the cream isn&#x27;t cream; its more of a gel liquid, clear, no scent, a little sticky to the touch.  </li>
            <li>It only takes a few drops, and it makes my skin feel silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>reduction in the size of my pores is probably the most dramatic result so far AND the texture on my skin is SSSOOOO</li>
            <li>It has a texture slightly thicker than water, and one quick pump from the tube covers your entire face and neck.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how quickly this product is absorbed, eventhough the consistency feels like a very thin liquid.</li>
            <li>Because my complexion requires daily sunscreen, I apply the serum under my old SPF 15 moisturizer in the morning and under the entire Perfective Ceuticals line at night.</li>
            <li>Not long after a box landed on my doorstep containing three of their Anti-aging products -  [[ASIN:B004B9C8MO Anti-aging Cream - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Cream with Growth Factor]],</li>
            <li>Apparently the cameras used to take before photos are of a different quality than my point and shoot.</li>
            <li>BUT I really can use less of these products</li>
            <li>I am in my mid-forties and my mother is in her mid-sixties and both of us have dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have a tiny line under each of my eyes and small laugh lines begging, that I notice every time I apply my eyeliner and foundation.</li>
            <li>I have been using Perfective Ceuticals anti-ageing serum (in combination with Perfective Ceuticals anti-ageing cream and eye cream) for slightly over 3 weeks to improve the somewhat uneven coloring of my skin and fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It is very large in size and not able to penetrate into the skin topically.</li>
            <li>I cannot say that about any of the other multitudes of creams and serums I&#x27;ve spent big $$$ on!&lt;br /&gt;After cleansing and toning, I applied the serum first.  </li>
            <li>Those new cheek area wrinkles have almost disappeared..I can see them, but other people don&#x27;t notice them.</li>
            <li>Those new cheek area wrinkles have almost disappeared..I can see them, but other people don&#x27;t notice them.</li>
            <li>First, you need very little of it each time it is applied.</li>

            <li> Its so great</li>
            <li> /&gt;The packaging and bottles are attractive and look well on the vanity.</li>
            <li> I love this Serum!!  </li>
            <li> There was also an immediate and pleasant tightening of the skin upon application.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> and she had nothing but good things to say  as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nonetheless, it is a pleasant product to use in an attractive package, and making allowances for the many skin conditions and types, perhaps others will have a better result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so glad you started selling this on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you will be please with the results.can use all help I can get to fight aging all the way!</li>
            <li> It really is amazing.</li>
            <li> After about two weeks of using this serum my husband was watching me wash my face and said, \\&quot;your skin looks younger,\\&quot; to which I smiled.</li>
            <li> I have one of those really nice wall mounted, lighted, magnifying mirrors in the bathroom now....</li>
            <li> After reading a number of enthusiastic 5-star reviews, I had hoped for some noticeable improvement in the tone and tautness of my 60-year skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I received sample products from the manufacturer for my trials.se in an attractive package, and making allowances for the many skin conditions and types, perhaps others will have a better result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product from Perfective Ceuticals in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> The gene pool has not always been kind to me.  </li>
            <li> If you are thinking about putting out this kind of money on this type of product...go with something you know.</li>
            <li> serum spreads nicely, leaves no shine</li>
            <li> I decided I didn&#x27;t have anything to lose, so I accepted their generous offer and made it known that I would write an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have referred this product to many of my girl friends and family and they have been very pleased with the results.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this serum in conjunction with the Perfective Ceuticals skin cream, and couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a facelift in a tube, but it&#x27;s the most effective serum</li>
            <li> In my opinion, I think the product work best if you use the complete skin care system in tandem.    </li>
            <li> All natural and great!</li>
            <li> Most important, it works, and my skin is very smooth and feels good.</li>
            <li> Some of Perfective Ceuticals products have a rose scent, and because this one does not it is my preferred night time treatment as strong scents tend to keep me from falling asleep quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this serum.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to even better skin as the weeks go by.</li>
            <li> This is for people (men &amp; women) wanting to stop more wrinkles from appearing.</li>
            <li> This is one of the BEST FACIAL PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I got this at the same time as an anti wrinkle cleanser, which is perfect, between the 2 products I would really be able to see improvement of my wrinkles disappearing</li>
            <li> I love this serum for a number of reasons.</li>
            <li> so was able to start this routine with both products.  </li>
            <li> glad</li>
            <li> All the wrinkles, bags and spots are still there :)</li>
            <li> I love the serum.</li>
            <li> For something like this, I had to take before and after photos to be sure I&#x27;m not kidding</li>
            <li> /&gt;Without telling my children which photos were before and after, or even the reason for my questions, I asked my kids to pick which photos my skin looks better in.</li>
            <li> Have you noticed how &#x27;most&#x27; of the 5☆ ratings are from \\&quot;Non</li>
            <li> And my d&amp;eacute;colletage area looks much better.</li>
            <li> And my décolletage area looks much better.</li>
            <li> When I heard I was going to be able to do a review for the serum</li>
            <li> It did not cause a problem when using it under my night creams as so many serums I have tried can do.</li>
            <li> really love everything about it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you will be please with the results.</li>
            <li> I started using Divine Age Guardian Serum, I wasn&#x27;t sure what my results would be.</li>
            <li> I love the results I got from using Divine Age Guardian Serum with Growth Factor.</li>
            <li> And then before the lines on my face, I discovered I have a very significant crease on my neck.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> have pretty good skin, but I am aging, and there are all kinds of things going on around my mouth, eyes, and neck.  </li>
            <li> I had tried and and reviewed the night cream and eye cream from this line and loved them so much they did wonders for my skin!</li>
            <li> More importantly, it does not leave a \\&quot;skin\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m the only one who notices, but I&#x27;ll happily take softening lines and wrinkles and more supple feeling over just letting signs of age</li>
            <li> The problem is with most serums is they can cause your heavier night creams to pill and simply roll off your face so the benefits from a night cream are greatly compromised.&lt;br /&gt;Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Serum with Growth Factor</li>
            <li> /&gt;EGF works by reducing the length and depth of fine lines.</li>
            <li> really love this serum for many reasons, first its a very quick drying thinner serum that absorbs into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li> After using for 2 weeks, I can feel a huge difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> It is light and not oily at all.</li>
            <li> My skin started to feel nice and smooth again within a few nights and my friend said your great skin has returned.</li>
            <li> Please feel free to check out my experiences on these products in my video review.</li>
            <li> this bottle should last you a great while.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m in my early-fifties, with fair and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The light colored age spots on my face have lightened but are still there, the wrinkles from my nose to mouth have improved significantly.</li>
            <li> The light colored age spots on my face have lightened but are still there, the wrinkles from my nose to mouth have improved significantly.</li>
            <li> It spreads easily and quickly.  </li>
            <li> -- that is, it gets absorbed into the skin instead of becoming an overlay, as some serums do.  </li>
            <li> I am so excited to tell you all about my experiences with Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Serum with Growth Factor.</li>
            <li> in my mid 60&#x27;s, have a fair complexion which is sprinkled with light colored freckles.</li>
            <li> The serum glides on smooth and absorbs quickly with no stickiness.</li>
            <li> It is very light and extremely gentle.</li>
            <li> pretty it will do so much for your skin because of the really effective Ingredients in it.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> Skin cancer cells have receptors that bind to EGF, causing you to develop full blown cancer.     </li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved the instant effects and</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be sure, I use the whole Perfective Ceuticals regimen twice a day.</li>
            <li> Cool.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any fragrance, which is nice for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was great and shipped the items on time, and even included samples of other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been quite pleased with how well this anti-aging system has worked, and have noticed some fading now also on the much more obvious neck crease.</li>
            <li> : I like how my skin feels with it on, I like how quickly it rubs into the skin,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, and does not have a greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Divine Age Guardian  line -- serum, eye cream, and face cream -- for two weeks now, and I&#x27;m stunned at how quickly I noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> so I started looking at pics of older people &amp; noticed many of them have wrinkles in this area.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using  Perfective Ceutical Anti-aging Guardian Serum with Growth Factor  for about 2 1/2 weeks now and saw results quickly.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re working for me, and they worked quickly.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re working for me, and they worked quickly.</li>
            <li> Not only are the results nice, but the feeling of moist, well-hydrated skin lasts all day - not because of unabsorbed product, but because the face and neck really are in better shape and hydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used a professional grade Canon EOS 5D Mark III full frame camera with an L (top of the line) lens, with identical camera and lens settings for the before and after images.</li>
            <li> If you have had extensive sun exposure then it&#x27;s best to visit your dermatologist first to test yourself for potential skin cancer risk.</li>
            <li> It is totally odorless which is very important to me as I prefer fragrance free cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I have been an Elizabeth Arden or Estee Lauder user most of my adult life, so I am familiar with quality products and these really are something special.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing just how much it will continue to smooth out my skin, with continued use.</li>
            <li> I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s worth the expense.</li>
            <li> Direction say to use 3-5 drops to the freshly cleansed face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mother is even more sensitive to products than I am</li>
            <li> The price may be offset by the fact that these products are rich and require a smaller amount which may make them comparable in price to the better department store brands.</li>
            <li> a convert.s are rich and require a smaller amount which may make them comparable in price to the better department store brands.</li>
            <li> It mixes well, and rubs right into my skin</li>
            <li> In all, it smoothes and reduces fine lines and wrinkles for a more vibrant, youthful appearance.&lt;br /&gt;Incorporated with a cocktail of powerful anti-oxidants and the moisture binding Hyaluronic Acid, it also restores radiance and suppleness and boosts the skin&#x27;s immune function to shield against future aging.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was happy to see that I finally found a product that actually does what it promises.</li>
            <li> After using for 3 weeks, using once a day, sometimes 2 times a day, I have been able to see: my forehead wrinkles aren&#x27;t as deep set, and aren&#x27;t as noticeable when my face is calm and still.  </li>
            <li> I also got my Dad&#x27;s good skin, so while I am in the middle of my  seventh decade, I am not as yet a wrinkled old crone.  </li>
            <li> it will dry nicely</li>
            <li> realize the cost on this is up there, but really not that much more than many of the high end brands</li>
            <li> While my skin was fairly wrinkle free to start with, it was starting to look dry and crepey...</li>
            <li> It absorbed into the skin quickly and left the area feeling hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that the texture of my skin has improved in the first week of use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In addition, I&#x27;ve experienced no sensitivity, and this pump-container that it is stored in, will last a long time.</li>
            <li> my neck &amp; waist are too short, my shoulders more like those of a football player.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After cleansing, the serum is the first product in the line that you apply.  </li>
            <li> That means that when you apply the facial cream on top, you won&#x27;t be pulling up the serum in the process.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first thought: &#x27;If this product line works, how will I prove it?&#x27;...</li>
            <li> , I suggest you email their customer service department to inquire if the seller you&#x27;re interested in purchasing Perfective Ceutical&#x27;s products from is an authorized reseller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I suggest you email their customer service department to inquire if the seller you&#x27;re interested in purchasing Perfective Ceutical&#x27;s products from is an authorized reseller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> are some of the many reasons this serum and the entire line of Perfective Ceuticals works so well.&lt;br /&gt;Divine</li>
            <li> /&gt;After two weeks, both of us have smoother and brighter skin, but more than that have seen actual reduction of lines.</li>
            <li> like the pretty cobalt blue packaging, and the serum is pleasant to use, but at an investment of ~$1+ per day (given the currently displayed price), I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be continuing with this product in the hope that some improvement will eventually occur.</li>
            <li> In addition, I really like how smooth and soft it keeps my skin all day.</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin and want to buy only one product in the line, I recommend the serum because it&#x27;s so light and easily absorbed.  </li>
            <li> Would this magic serum really turn back the hands of time?</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s OK; I&#x27;ve earned them all, but I do miss the supple, smooth and soft face of my not so distant past.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long for me to discover that I had much better results when I used  the serum twice a day.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have many deep wrinkles, just normal aging wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The serum doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance, is clear &amp; absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> , it works well, is easy to apply and you get a whole lot of serum in this bottle, because you only need to use 3-5 drops of it</li>
            <li> The directions are to apply 3-5 drops to a freshly cleansed face, and I find that one pump squirts out a little more than 5 drops, so use a little more sparingly than you are tempted!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they do it but the effectiveness of how it makes both fine and relatively deep lines on my face just disappear is beyond comprehension.</li>
            <li> We have both used both products everyday for a little over two weeks and the results are a delightful surprise.</li>
            <li> This stuff intensely fights wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> The seller response and delivery were fast.</li>
            <li> very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> much better!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It’s very non-disruptive to my skin care and makeup routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Age Guardian Serum with Growth Factor is an intense wrinkle serum that features an unparalleled physiological combination of Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) and Amino Peptide.</li>
            <li> Actually, they were nice enough to send samples of the face cream with the orders, so I started with all three at once.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Perfect Ceuticals serum is a thin liquid substance that promises younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> As a natural stawberry blonde, I sunburn easily.</li>
            <li> One application of a small amount and my skin  felt and looked amazing - even before I applied the eye cream</li>
            <li> This is a good price for an anti-aging serum with a long list of active ingredients.</li>
            <li> In fact, you could technically wear this without a moisturizer on top because it is moisturizing enough (but, of course, you should always wear moisturizer with SPF regardless).</li>
            <li> I think this article sets up a realistic expectation of the type of improvement one might expect.</li>
            <li> I think this article sets up a realistic expectation of the type of improvement one might expect.</li>
            <li> first change I noticed was that after the first few weeks, my makeup wasn&#x27;t settling into my smile lines as much anymore.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now after a little more than 2 weeks I can see an improvement.</li>
            <li> Applied to clean skin before the anti-aging cream, this product is extremely light, almost silky, not the least bit greasy or sticky and without any of that \\&quot;slime\\&quot; factor.  </li>
            <li> My face really feels refreshed after using it, and I&#x27;ve completely replaced my moisturizer and have been using just this.  </li>
            <li> As far as my neck, I haven&#x27;t really noticed any changes, with my skin, or the neck wrinkles there.  </li>
            <li> When you&#x27;ve had problem skin all your life, it&#x27;s exciting to find something that actually works and does what it says it will do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;ve had problem skin all your life, it&#x27;s exciting to find something that actually works and does what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li> Granted, I didn&#x27;t have a large amount of early signs of aging to begin with, but a youthful face will never go out of style, and its never too early to baby your face!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not oily at all and has not caused me to break out, which sometimes happens with a new product.</li>
            <li> My skin felt more supple and soft within a few days.  </li>
            <li> Mom has light to moderate wrinkles on her face and moderate wrinkling on her</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, slow to absorb, which in my book means it&#x27;s working rather than evaporating, and best of all,  produces a noticeable result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The delivery system is a pump, which delivers a small amount of cream and is easy to control not to use too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them in the recommended order of first applying this serum, then applying the eye cream, then finally the face</li>
            <li> It is the first step in a regimen to make your skin look younger and brighter.  </li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve believed the people who told me I could get the same results using drugstore brands as the higher end brands.</li>
            <li> I also have a couple light colored age spots on my face which I&#x27;ve noticed  on other 45+ year old people too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Every pore in your face looks like our local, poorly maintained county roads around here, but it DOES afford you the opportunity to really get a good look at your skin!&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> so I figure anything that will keep my skin firm for as long as possible is a good product.</li>
            <li> It does moisturize my skin somewhat, but my skin is naturally very dry, so I apply the moisturizing cream after the serum has been fully absorbed into my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally pulled the trigger and thought I&#x27;ve spent more than this on high quality products before and had only minimal results.&lt;br /&gt;Also, because of the dryness, I have to use WAY more product than the average person.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> :B0030DK7E8 Anti-aging Serum - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Serum with Growth Factor]], is clear and odorless.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin.</li>
            <li> However the sticky factor is eliminated once its completely rubbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li> It gives the skin a radiant, soft and refined complexion and it noticeable lessens pores and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This serum is completely non-annoying.</li>
            <li> how soft it made my skin feel.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Having this direct line to them I wrote to them asking the details about the &amp;#34;growth&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I wanted to understand better what this was and whether it could have any negative effects by penetrating my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see these</li>
            <li> It Will make your face so soft and</li>
            <li> My only concern is that the few spider veins on my cheeks *seem* slightly more visible.</li>
            <li> (photo can be located by following &#x27;customer photos&#x27; link under the main photo).</li>
            <li> Other details that I noticed: the cream isn&#x27;t cream; its more of a gel liquid, clear, no scent, a little sticky to the touch.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a few drops, and it makes my skin feel silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> reduction in the size of my pores is probably the most dramatic result so far AND the texture on my skin is SSSOOOO</li>
            <li> It has a texture slightly thicker than water, and one quick pump from the tube covers your entire face and neck.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how quickly this product is absorbed, eventhough the consistency feels like a very thin liquid.</li>
            <li> Because my complexion requires daily sunscreen, I apply the serum under my old SPF 15 moisturizer in the morning and under the entire Perfective Ceuticals line at night.</li>
            <li> Not long after a box landed on my doorstep containing three of their Anti-aging products -  [[ASIN:B004B9C8MO Anti-aging Cream - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Cream with Growth Factor]],</li>
            <li> Apparently the cameras used to take before photos are of a different quality than my point and shoot.</li>
            <li> BUT I really can use less of these products</li>
            <li> I am in my mid-forties and my mother is in her mid-sixties and both of us have dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have a tiny line under each of my eyes and small laugh lines begging, that I notice every time I apply my eyeliner and foundation.</li>
            <li> I have been using Perfective Ceuticals anti-ageing serum (in combination with Perfective Ceuticals anti-ageing cream and eye cream) for slightly over 3 weeks to improve the somewhat uneven coloring of my skin and fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It is very large in size and not able to penetrate into the skin topically.</li>
            <li> I cannot say that about any of the other multitudes of creams and serums I&#x27;ve spent big $$$ on!&lt;br /&gt;After cleansing and toning, I applied the serum first.  </li>
            <li> Those new cheek area wrinkles have almost disappeared..I can see them, but other people don&#x27;t notice them.</li>
            <li> Those new cheek area wrinkles have almost disappeared..I can see them, but other people don&#x27;t notice them.</li>
            <li> First, you need very little of it each time it is applied.</li>
            <li> I got my mother&#x27;s hair, still nearly as thick, almost as shiny and exactly the same color as it was the day I turned 16</li>
            <li> never expected to see such a dramatic and immediate difference -- with the first use!  </li>
            <li> Prior to using this product, my skin was extremely dry with several cracks in the skin, and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> With all the positive ratings, even though it was quite expensive, I thought it must really work.</li>
            <li> I intend to update the review as soon as I can ascertain how long the products last.</li>
            <li> As much as I try not to pay attention to them, it&#x27;s hard not to when your makeup actually ends up settling into them.</li>
            <li> a bottle goes a long way&lt;</li>
            <li> A couple weeks before I received this offer, I noticed some wrinkles starting in the center of my cheek area.</li>
            <li> There is not a strong scent, if any, so it won&#x27;t bother anyone sensitive to smells on their face.  </li>
            <li> It kinda tightens the skin without making it feel stretched or dry like some face care items can.</li>
            <li> It doesn’t burn, irritate, or dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Granted, I didn&#x27;t expect it to roll back the clock 10 years, but I had hoped for at least a modest improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is a nice base serum that provides the proper ingredients to maximize the effectiveness of the creme.  </li>
            <li> Next I started noticing that I had less and less problems applying my eye makeup, since it wasn&#x27;t bleeding into the tiny lines under each of my eyes.</li>
            <li> I normally do not write reviews, but everyone should try this!</li>
            <li> My skin is moister and my lines less apparent,  I&#x27;ve particularly noticed a fairly dramatic difference in the scars, which have become pretty hard to differentiate from ordinary wrinkles, and the no-longer-crepey skin of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> Only a small amount of product is needed each application so the bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This serum comes out as thin as water, perhaps feeling a little oilier in texture, but just as clear and fluid when it comes out.  </li>
            <li> Therefore a little bit goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Before I started the regimen (with this serum as well as 3 other Perfective Ceuticals products), I took my picture in the bathroom mirror (with no makeup) after applying the products.</li>

            <li> It’s a clear, thin liquid that smells and feels like nothing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel any tingling other than a cooling effect as it dried on my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this on my forehead where I tend to be a little oilier and have not had any oil issues or greasy residue</li>
            <li> I discovered a little bottle of Heaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t feel tight or dried up, which is sometimes the case with cleansers, nor does my face feel oily or layered.  </li>
            <li> After a few applications, a noticeable improvement was seen.</li>

            <li> few weeks ago the folks at Perfective Ceuticals asked me if I would like to try some of their products.  </li>
            <li> My face is smoother than it was a few months ago.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s so thin, as serum should be, a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> There is no strong fragrance, or any scent.</li>
            <li> AND my skin has always been very, very dry and getting worse with the years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These products are expensive but a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> On small squirt in the palm of your hands and you can spread it all over your face and neck.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This serum comes out as thin as water, perhaps feeling a little oilier in texture, but just as clear and fluid when it comes out.  There is not a strong scent, if any, so it won&#x27;t bother anyone sensitive to smells on their face.  The directions are to apply 3-5 drops to a freshly cleansed face, and I find that one pump squirts out a little more than 5 drops, so use a little more sparingly than you are tempted!  This stuff intensely fights wrinkles.  It literally improves radiance and suppleness and shields against future aging.  My face really feels refreshed after using it, and I&#x27;ve completely replaced my moisturizer and have been using just this.  My face doesn&#x27;t feel tight or dried up, which is sometimes the case with cleansers, nor does my face feel oily or layered.  It feels nourished, moisturized, healed, and cleared of blemishes and spots.  Granted, I didn&#x27;t have a large amount of early signs of aging to begin with, but a youthful face will never go out of style, and its never too early to baby your face!</li>
            <li> I have a tiny line under each of my eyes and small laugh lines begging, that I notice every time I apply my eyeliner and foundation. As much as I try not to pay attention to them, it&#x27;s hard not to when your makeup actually ends up settling into them. And then before the lines on my face, I discovered I have a very significant crease on my neck. While I may be in my early 30&#x27;s, the &amp;#34;lines&amp;#34; are slowly sneaking up on me, and just putting a little moisturizer on my face isn&#x27;t making them go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for the last several weeks I&#x27;ve been using the Perfective Ceuticals anti-aging system to see if it would help with my situation. I&#x27;ve been using this Divine Age Guardian Serum with Growth Factor, along with the Divine Age Guardian Cream with Growth Factor and also the and Anti-imperfection Eye Therapy with Growth Factor. I&#x27;ve been using them in the recommended order of first applying this serum, then applying the eye cream, then finally the face cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first change I noticed was that after the first few weeks, my makeup wasn&#x27;t settling into my smile lines as much anymore. Some days I can&#x27;t see the lines at all. Next I started noticing that I had less and less problems applying my eye makeup, since it wasn&#x27;t bleeding into the tiny lines under each of my eyes. Before the lines themselves started to fade, my makeup was showing my the difference, by not settling into them. I&#x27;ve been quite pleased with how well this anti-aging system has worked, and have noticed some fading now also on the much more obvious neck crease. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing just how much it will continue to smooth out my skin, with continued use. The trio of anti-aging facial products works well to target each area specifically, and all at the same time. I&#x27;m very happy with how well they work together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample was provided for reviewing purposes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this in conjunction with the eye serum and the anti aging cream. I love this serum. It only takes a few drops, and it makes my skin feel silky and smooth. It is light and not oily at all. While my skin was fairly wrinkle free to start with, it was starting to look dry and crepey...lets call a spade a spade, I was looking my age.and not liking it. Now after a little more than 2 weeks I can see an improvement. I am looking dewy(cliche, I know) and moisturised, but not greasy. And my skin does feel and look great. Looking forward to even better skin as the weeks go by.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin. I started to notice some wrinkles around my mouth and forehead. My friend recommended me to use the serum. Within a few weeks of usage, the wrinkles decreased and appeared less defined. My skin started to feel nice and smooth again within a few nights and my friend said your great skin has returned. This is for people (men &amp; women) wanting to stop more wrinkles from appearing.</li>
            <li> Perfective Ceuticals delivers on the promise that this serum is anti aging.  It&#x27;s thick, slow to absorb, which in my book means it&#x27;s working rather than evaporating, and best of all,  produces a noticeable result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty good skin, but I am aging, and there are all kinds of things going on around my mouth, eyes, and neck.  That&#x27;s OK; I&#x27;ve earned them all, but I do miss the supple, smooth and soft face of my not so distant past.&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve been using this serum, my skin is visibly improving.  Maybe I&#x27;m the only one who notices, but I&#x27;ll happily take softening lines and wrinkles and more supple feeling over just letting signs of age happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this serum in conjunction with the Perfective Ceuticals skin cream, and couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled with the results.  It&#x27;s not a facelift in a tube, but it&#x27;s the most effective serum I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received for review.</li>
            <li> pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. a bottle goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;2. no tearing of the eyes (i&#x27;m allergic to fragrance)&lt;br /&gt;3. acne seems to heal faster&lt;br /&gt;4. shrinks pores&lt;br /&gt;5. wrinkles and complexion are improved&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. not for people of color (has some lightening ingredients)&lt;br /&gt;2. need to take care of the bottle if put into luggage (pump could break)</li>
            <li> Buyer beware:     Please conduct ample research on epidermal growth factor and the affects it has in producing skin cancer. If you have had extensive sun exposure then it&#x27;s best to visit your dermatologist first to test yourself for potential skin cancer risk. Skin cancer cells have receptors that bind to EGF, causing you to develop full blown cancer.     EGF is NOT controlled by the FDA.     An educated consumer is the best concumer.</li>
            <li> This serum goes on skin without leaving you feeling sticky or greasy. It absorbed into the skin quickly and left the area feeling hydrated and smooth. After a few applications, a noticeable improvement was seen. Skin looks refreshed and noticeably younger. Only a small amount of product is needed each application so the bottle goes a long way. I was happy to see that I finally found a product that actually does what it promises. It is a must have!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the BEST FACIAL PRODUCT! Perfective Ceuticals is the best skin care product for my face I have ever used. The product has drastically improved the look of my skin in every way. The wrinkles are not as pronounced, my skin glows and is so even that I have stopped wearing foundation! I am so glad you started selling this on Amazon! The seller response and delivery were fast. I normally do not write reviews, but everyone should try this! I have referred this product to many of my girl friends and family and they have been very pleased with the results.    5 STARS ALL THE WAY!!!!</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Review:  I got this at the same time as an anti wrinkle cleanser, which is perfect, between the 2 products I would really be able to see improvement of my wrinkles disappearing or I wouldn&#x27;t.  After using for 3 weeks, using once a day, sometimes 2 times a day, I have been able to see: my forehead wrinkles aren&#x27;t as deep set, and aren&#x27;t as noticeable when my face is calm and still.  I have also noticed that my pores aren&#x27;t as noticeable on my nose, and chin.  I feel like my skin is healthier, and smoother, and cleaner.  As far as my neck, I haven&#x27;t really noticed any changes, with my skin, or the neck wrinkles there.  Other details that I noticed: the cream isn&#x27;t cream; its more of a gel liquid, clear, no scent, a little sticky to the touch.  However the sticky factor is eliminated once its completely rubbed into the skin.  In the morning I sometimes mix this creamer with my liquid foundation.  It mixes well, and rubs right into my skin very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I like how my skin feels with it on, I like how quickly it rubs into the skin,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I have only been using this for 3 weeks, I will keep using it and see how it continues to work.</li>
            <li> It gives the skin a radiant, soft and refined complexion and it noticeable lessens pores and wrinkles. This is a good price for an anti-aging serum with a long list of active ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love this serum for a number of reasons. First, you need very little of it each time it is applied. I use it in the morning and at night. On small squirt in the palm of your hands and you can spread it all over your face and neck. It&#x27;s not oily at all and has not caused me to break out, which sometimes happens with a new product. After about two weeks of using this serum my husband was watching me wash my face and said, \\&quot;your skin looks younger,\\&quot; to which I smiled. I&#x27;m 46 going on 47 so I figure anything that will keep my skin firm for as long as possible is a good product. While it&#x27;s a bit expensive, it lasts a long time so it&#x27;s worth the expense. Plus, my skin feels softer. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Perfective Ceuticals Guardian Serum with Growth Factor is a great product to use before applying the Divine Age Guardian Creme.  It is a nice base serum that provides the proper ingredients to maximize the effectiveness of the creme.  It is the first step in a regimen to make your skin look younger and brighter.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have one of those really nice wall mounted, lighted, magnifying mirrors in the bathroom now....&lt;br /&gt;Pros and cons to this decision, obviously!  Every pore in your face looks like our local, poorly maintained county roads around here, but it DOES afford you the opportunity to really get a good look at your skin!&lt;br /&gt;At 50, my biggest complaint is the lack of elasticity, ever increasing pore size, wrinkles and dryness.&lt;br /&gt;I also have VERY sensitive skin, so I have to be very careful what I use AND my skin has always been very, very dry and getting worse with the years.&lt;br /&gt;I debated for weeks on this product line - putting it in my cart, taking it out, putting it back in...Finally pulled the trigger and thought I&#x27;ve spent more than this on high quality products before and had only minimal results.&lt;br /&gt;Also, because of the dryness, I have to use WAY more product than the average person.&lt;br /&gt;I got the serum and the eye cream at the same time so was able to start this routine with both products.  Actually, they were nice enough to send samples of the face cream with the orders, so I started with all three at once.&lt;br /&gt;I never expected to see such a dramatic and immediate difference -- with the first use!  I cannot say that about any of the other multitudes of creams and serums I&#x27;ve spent big $$$ on!&lt;br /&gt;After cleansing and toning, I applied the serum first.  WOW!  One application of a small amount and my skin  felt and looked amazing - even before I applied the eye cream and  face cream!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for just a short time, but the magnifying mirror don&#x27;t lie, baby!&lt;br /&gt;The reduction in the size of my pores is probably the most dramatic result so far AND the texture on my skin is SSSOOOO much better!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens after extended use with actual results like these.  I just ordered the face cream since I&#x27;m about out of the samples they sent.&lt;br /&gt;I realize the cost on this is up there, but really not that much more than many of the high end brands BUT I really can use less of these products so it&#x27;s a wash for me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hooked!  When you&#x27;ve had problem skin all your life, it&#x27;s exciting to find something that actually works and does what it says it will do.&lt;br /&gt;So glad I found this line!!!ese products so it&#x27;s a wash for me.  I&#x27;m hooked!  When you&#x27;ve had problem skin all your life, it&#x27;s exciting to find something that actually works and does what it says it will do.  So glad I found this line!!!</li>
            <li> This serum is completely non-annoying. I am even going to buy one for my mom for Christmas and she is the pickiest person on earth. This feels just like putting water on your face. It’s a clear, thin liquid that smells and feels like nothing. It doesn’t burn, irritate, or dry out my skin. It’s just a layer of liquid…there’s no added shininess or issues. It’s very non-disruptive to my skin care and makeup routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of how it works, it feels great! It kinda tightens the skin without making it feel stretched or dry like some face care items can. In fact, you could technically wear this without a moisturizer on top because it is moisturizing enough (but, of course, you should always wear moisturizer with SPF regardless). Good stuff. I loved the instant effects and how soft it made my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how quickly this product is absorbed, eventhough the consistency feels like a very thin liquid. Therefore a little bit goes a long way!  There was also an immediate and pleasant tightening of the skin upon application. In addition, I really like how smooth and soft it keeps my skin all day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know where to begin with my praises for the Perfective Ceuticals&#x27; serum. It truly can only be described as being like a face lift in a bottle. I don&#x27;t know how they do it but the effectiveness of how it makes both fine and relatively deep lines on my face just disappear is beyond comprehension.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3D7MRZHGD58MX]]This video review is for [[ASIN:B0030DE8F2 Anti-aging Eye Cream for Wrinkles and Puffiness Under Eyes - Perfective Ceuticals Anti-imperfection Eye Therapy Cream with Growth Factor]], [[ASIN:B0030DK7E8 Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) Skin Care - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Serum with Growth Factor]] and [[ASIN:B004B9C8MO Anti-aging Cream with Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) and Peptides - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Cream with Growth Factor]]. I have taken some before and after photos and put them in the video.     My experience with Divine Age Guardian Serum:    So far so good! I&#x27;m using it in conjunction with the Perfective Ceuticals&#x27; Anti-imperfection Eye Therapy and Divine Age Guardian Cream and I have nothing but luv for this stuff! In my opinion, I think the product work best if you use the complete skin care system in tandem.    Please feel free to check out my experiences on these products in my video review.</li>
            <li> After reading a number of enthusiastic 5-star reviews, I had hoped for some noticeable improvement in the tone and tautness of my 60-year skin. I have used the Serum as directed, morning and night, for ~8 weeks. The vial is not yet depleted, though it is difficult to determine how much remains due to the sealed packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I started the regimen (with this serum as well as 3 other Perfective Ceuticals products), I took my picture in the bathroom mirror (with no makeup) after applying the products. I used a professional grade Canon EOS 5D Mark III full frame camera with an L (top of the line) lens, with identical camera and lens settings for the before and after images. (I uploaded a before and after image - look in customer images for the eye cream.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is virtually odorless and colorless. It has a texture slightly thicker than water, and one quick pump from the tube covers your entire face and neck. I didn&#x27;t feel any tingling other than a cooling effect as it dried on my skin. It does moisturize my skin somewhat, but my skin is naturally very dry, so I apply the moisturizing cream after the serum has been fully absorbed into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 8 weeks however, I could not discern any changes at all in the appearance of my skin in the before and after images. All the wrinkles, bags and spots are still there :) Granted, I didn&#x27;t expect it to roll back the clock 10 years, but I had hoped for at least a modest improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the pretty cobalt blue packaging, and the serum is pleasant to use, but at an investment of ~$1+ per day (given the currently displayed price), I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be continuing with this product in the hope that some improvement will eventually occur. It seems like 2 months is enough of a trial period. I will continue to use it until the vial is depleted, and if I note any changes in my skin condition, will post an addendum to this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, it is a pleasant product to use in an attractive package, and making allowances for the many skin conditions and types, perhaps others will have a better result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received sample products from the manufacturer for my trials.se in an attractive package, and making allowances for the many skin conditions and types, perhaps others will have a better result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received sample products from the manufacturer for my trials.</li>
            <li> I love the serum. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. Unlike the cream, it doesn&#x27;t have a noticeable scent.  It absorbs quickly, and does not have a greasy feeling.  I have noticed that the texture of my skin has improved in the first week of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was great and shipped the items on time, and even included samples of other products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only 2 weeks. Not only can I see a difference, but can feel it working as my skin feels like silk. Prior to using this product, my skin was extremely dry with several cracks in the skin, and wrinkles. After using for 2 weeks, I can feel a huge difference in the texture of my skin. I have been applying this in a very small amount to face and neck twice a day, morning and evening. There is no strong fragrance, or any scent. It is very light and extremely gentle. In addition, I&#x27;ve experienced no sensitivity, and this pump-container that it is stored in, will last a long time. Most important, it works, and my skin is very smooth and feels good. I would use this product again in the future. Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product from Perfective Ceuticals in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> The gene pool has not always been kind to me.  I didn&#x27;t get tall or small,  my neck &amp; waist are too short, my shoulders more like those of a football player.  I did hit the jackpot in two ways though.  I got my mother&#x27;s hair, still nearly as thick, almost as shiny and exactly the same color as it was the day I turned 16 - no gray to be seen.  (My sisters, both younger, both gray for a decade, are livid.)  I also got my Dad&#x27;s good skin, so while I am in the middle of my  seventh decade, I am not as yet a wrinkled old crone.  Still, I have my share of lines, a couple of scars and the beginnings of a few crows&#x27;s feet around my eyes.  You might not notice them, but I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago the folks at Perfective Ceuticals asked me if I would like to try some of their products.  Not long after a box landed on my doorstep containing three of their Anti-aging products -  [[ASIN:B004B9C8MO Anti-aging Cream - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Cream with Growth Factor]], [[ASIN:B0030DK7E8 Anti-aging Serum - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Serum with Growth Factor]] and [[ASIN:B00AYARK2C Anti-aging Eye Cream - Perfective Ceuticals Anti-imperfection Eye Therapy Cream with Growth Factor ]].  Since then, I&#x27;ve been using my regular cleaning regimen, followed by the application of the Perfective products.  I must say, I am impressed.  My skin is moister and my lines less apparent,  I&#x27;ve particularly noticed a fairly dramatic difference in the scars, which have become pretty hard to differentiate from ordinary wrinkles, and the no-longer-crepey skin of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0030DK7E8 Anti-aging Serum - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Serum with Growth Factor]], is clear and odorless.  Applied to clean skin before the anti-aging cream, this product is extremely light, almost silky, not the least bit greasy or sticky and without any of that \\&quot;slime\\&quot; factor.  The product is non-comedogenic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandma&#x27;s $0.02 - While it won&#x27;t turn back time, this has made a definite difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the list of ingredients contained in this product -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water (Aqua), 1-Butylene Glycol, 3-Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), Palmitoyl Hexapeptide, Gentiana Lutea Root Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Trisodium EDTA, Methylparabene, this has made a definite difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the list of ingredients contained in this product -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water (Aqua), 1-Butylene Glycol, 3-Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), Palmitoyl Hexapeptide, Gentiana Lutea Root Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Trisodium EDTA, Methylparaben</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve believed the people who told me I could get the same results using drugstore brands as the higher end brands. Maybe a lot people can, but I can tell the difference when I use the anti-aging serum Perfective Ceuticals. My skin is smoother and softer, the lines have decreased around my mouth and my neck. I use this on my forehead where I tend to be a little oilier and have not had any oil issues or greasy residue feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sample provided</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Divine Age Guardian  line -- serum, eye cream, and face cream -- for two weeks now, and I&#x27;m stunned at how quickly I noticed a difference.  My skin felt more supple and soft within a few days.  After two weeks, the difference is visually noticeable.  No, my existing lines did not disappear, but the skin itself looks and feels younger.  In only two weeks!  My only concern is that the few spider veins on my cheeks *seem* slightly more visible. (I&#x27;ll report back if that worsens over time.)  Because I use the entire regimen, I cannot isolate the effects of the serum alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After cleansing, the serum is the first product in the line that you apply.  Because it&#x27;s so thin, as serum should be, a little bit goes a long way.  It spreads easily and quickly.  More importantly, it does not leave a \\&quot;skin\\&quot; -- that is, it gets absorbed into the skin instead of becoming an overlay, as some serums do.  That means that when you apply the facial cream on top, you won&#x27;t be pulling up the serum in the process.  It fully integrates with the Perfective Ceuticals line -- or any moisturizer, for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my early-fifties, with fair and sensitive skin.  I had no adverse reactions to the serum.  I use this twice a day.  Because my complexion requires daily sunscreen, I apply the serum under my old SPF 15 moisturizer in the morning and under the entire Perfective Ceuticals line at night. If you have oily skin and want to buy only one product in the line, I recommend the serum because it&#x27;s so light and easily absorbed.  (Note: The manufacturer gave me a sample for review.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</li>
            <li> Perfect Ceuticals serum is a thin liquid substance that promises younger looking skin. For something like this, I had to take before and after photos to be sure I&#x27;m not kidding myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without telling my children which photos were before and after, or even the reason for my questions, I asked my kids to pick which photos my skin looks better in. They picked the after photos. I asked why. They said I have fewer liver spots on my skin and my daughter actually said, &amp;#34;Your skin looks younger.&amp;#34; Call me a convert!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be sure, I use the whole Perfective Ceuticals regimen twice a day. In the morning, I use the serum, eye therapy, cream, and sunscreen (in that order). At night, I do the same thing but leave out the sunscreen. Three weeks, and I&#x27;m already seeing results. It&#x27;s pretty amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for review by Perfective Ceuticals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_____________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDENDUM 6/8/13: I would like to add that I noticed today that I no longer have a problem with blackheads and whiteheads. Cool.</li>
            <li> Does not do anything! With all the positive ratings, even though it was quite expensive, I thought it must really work. What a WASTE of money! If you are thinking about putting out this kind of money on this type of product...go with something you know. Not a product like this.  P.S.  Have you noticed how &#x27;most&#x27; of the 5☆ ratings are from \\&quot;Non Verified Purchase\\&quot; reviewers?</li>
            <li> I love this Serum!!  Smells good and works wonderfully!!  All natural and great!</li>
            <li> I have been using Perfective Ceuticals anti-ageing serum (in combination with Perfective Ceuticals anti-ageing cream and eye cream) for slightly over 3 weeks to improve the somewhat uneven coloring of my skin and fine wrinkles. Overall, I like it. I see some improvement, although it is only a relative improvement not total obliteration of daker areas and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am attaching a photo of the serum in my hand (photo can be located by following &#x27;customer photos&#x27; link under the main photo). The serum is transparent, almost liquid and totally unscented. The delivery system is a pump, which delivers a small amount of cream and is easy to control not to use too much. Direction say to use 3-5 drops to the freshly cleansed face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum spreads nicely, leaves no shine so I can put it on and go out without worrying about tell-tell shine on my skin. It is totally odorless which is very important to me as I prefer fragrance free cosmetics. Some of Perfective Ceuticals products have a rose scent, and because this one does not it is my preferred night time treatment as strong scents tend to keep me from falling asleep quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this serum for testing and evaluation from the manufacturer. Having this direct line to them I wrote to them asking the details about the &amp;#34;growth&amp;#34; factor mentioned in the name. I wanted to understand better what this was and whether it could have any negative effects by penetrating my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received an explanation that Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) is a protein with 53 amino acids. It is very large in size and not able to penetrate into the skin topically. It is approved for cosmetic use by the FDA and there is no evidence topically applied EGF causes skin cancer cells to multiply faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EGF works by reducing the length and depth of fine lines. Hyaluronic Acid bind moisture and restores suppleness to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complete list of ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Water (Aqua), 1-Butylene Glycol, 3-Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), Palmitoyl Hexapeptide, Gentiana Lutea Root Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Trisodium EDTA, Methylparaben&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In response to my inquiry the manufacturer also sent me an article published in a Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (&amp;#34;Human growth factor and cytokine skin cream for facial skin rejuvenation as assessed by 3D in vivo optical skin imaging&amp;#34; Journal of Drugs in Dermatology, Oct, 2007 by Michael H. Gold, Mitchel P. Goldman, Julie Biron) which describes the results of placebo-controlled study investigating the effects of skin cream containing EFG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I checked that you can find this article by Googling for its name if you want to read the entire study.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this study the skin was analyzed clinically and with with imaging hardware. This study found that skin surface roughness decreased between 10% and 18% after 2 months of twice-daily application of the cream.

It provides improvement, but don&#x27;t expect miracles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review, 1-Butylene Glycol, 3-Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), Palmitoyl Hexapeptide, Gentiana Lutea Root Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Trisodium EDTA, Methylparaben&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In response to my inquiry the manufacturer also sent me an article published in a Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (&amp;#34;Human growth factor and cytokine skin cream for facial skin rejuvenation as assessed by 3D in vivo optical skin imaging&amp;#34; Journal of Drugs in Dermatology, Oct, 2007 by Michael H.

            <li> When I was asked if I&#x27;d like to try Perfective Ceuticals products containing Growth Factor, I was skeptical. I am a &#x27;Doubting Thomas&#x27;. You know &#x27;seeing is believing&#x27;. I decided I didn&#x27;t have anything to lose, so I accepted their generous offer and made it known that I would write an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first thought: &#x27;If this product line works, how will I prove it?&#x27;...you know &#x27;seeing is believing&#x27;. So I got out my point and shoot camera &amp; took some before pictures. Oh, my gosh, the pictures I took wouldn&#x27;t prove anything. Apparently the cameras used to take before photos are of a different quality than my point and shoot. So, I am sorry, but I will not be able to provide evidence for you to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my mid 60&#x27;s, have a fair complexion which is sprinkled with light colored freckles. As a natural stawberry blonde, I sunburn easily. I&#x27;ve never been a sun worshiper so I don&#x27;t have many deep wrinkles, just normal aging wrinkles. However, my d&amp;eacute;colletage has been severely sunburned in the past &amp; is wrinkly. A couple weeks before I received this offer, I noticed some wrinkles starting in the center of my cheek area. I was surprised to see these so I started looking at pics of older people &amp; noticed many of them have wrinkles in this area.  I also have a couple light colored age spots on my face which I&#x27;ve noticed  on other 45+ year old people too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using  Perfective Ceutical Anti-aging Guardian Serum with Growth Factor  for about 2 1/2 weeks now and saw results quickly.  I&#x27;ve been applying it as instructed, twice a day, to my neck, face &amp; d&amp;eacute;colletage (applying to this area isn&#x27;t mentioned, but I wanted to see if my d&amp;eacute;colletage area improved).  Being a thrifty person, I also experimented by using this product once a day. It didn&#x27;t take long for me to discover that I had much better results when I used  the serum twice a day. So twice a day it is.  The serum doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance, is clear &amp; absorbs quickly.  On the days I use sunless tanner, I wait about 4 hours before I apply  Perfective Ceutical&#x27;s product line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this serum along with [[ASIN:B004B9C8MO Anti-aging Cream - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Cream with Growth Factor]] and [[ASIN:B0030DE8F2 Anti-aging Eye Cream - Perfective Ceuticals Anti-imperfection Eye Therapy Cream with Growth Factor]] about 2 1/2 weeks now. The light colored age spots on my face have lightened but are still there, the wrinkles from my nose to mouth have improved significantly. Those new cheek area wrinkles have almost disappeared..I can see them, but other people don&#x27;t notice them. The deep wrinkles (marionette lines?) around my mouth have not changed.  The skin on my neck has improved...still not a pretty sight, but could be worse.  And my d&amp;eacute;colletage area looks much better. All in all, I&#x27;ve seen a definite improvement &amp; saw it within two days of use. I&#x27;ve been told I look 10 years younger. Keep in mind that my skin is not sun damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not store this product in extreme heat or cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product guarantee copied from Perfective Ceutical&#x27;s website:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Perfective Ceuticals&#x27; products are designed to be sold exclusively by dermatologists and dermatology professionals.

            <li> I am so excited to tell you all about my experiences with Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Serum with Growth Factor. I had tried and and reviewed the night cream and eye cream from this line and loved them so much they did wonders for my skin! When I heard I was going to be able to do a review for the serum I could not wait to get it in.&lt;br /&gt;I really love this serum for many reasons, first its a very quick drying thinner serum that absorbs into the skin quickly. It did not cause a problem when using it under my night creams as so many serums I have tried can do. The problem is with most serums is they can cause your heavier night creams to pill and simply roll off your face so the benefits from a night cream are greatly compromised.&lt;br /&gt;Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Serum with Growth Factor, dose not do this it will dry nicely so when you put on a night cream it stays put. It Will make your face so soft and pretty it will do so much for your skin because of the really effective Ingredients in it.&lt;br /&gt;Here are some of the many reasons this serum and the entire line of Perfective Ceuticals works so well.&lt;br /&gt;Divine Age Guardian Serum with Growth Factor is an intense wrinkle serum that features an unparalleled physiological combination of Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) and Amino Peptide. Each ingredient interacts synergistically, signaling cellular activity for renewed collagen, elastin and other skin proteins. In all, it smoothes and reduces fine lines and wrinkles for a more vibrant, youthful appearance.&lt;br /&gt;Incorporated with a cocktail of powerful anti-oxidants and the moisture binding Hyaluronic Acid, it also restores radiance and suppleness and boosts the skin&#x27;s immune function to shield against future aging.&lt;br /&gt;I really love everything about it, it works well, is easy to apply and you get a whole lot of serum in this bottle, because you only need to use 3-5 drops of it this bottle should last you a great while. I have just turned 53, so I can use all help I can get to fight aging all the way! I hope you consider using  Divine Age Guardian Serum with Growth Factor. Its so great I&#x27;m sure you will be please with the results.can use all help I can get to fight aging all the way! I hope you consider using  Divine Age Guardian Serum with Growth Factor.

            <li> I have been trying Perfective Ceuticals Anti-Aging Serum in conjunction with [[ASIN:B004B9C8MO Anti-aging Cream - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Cream with Growth Factor]] in a semi-controlled experiment on my mother and myself. I am in my mid-forties and my mother is in her mid-sixties and both of us have dry, sensitive skin. We have both used both products everyday for a little over two weeks and the results are a delightful surprise. I can&#x27;t say I have a lot of wrinkles yet, but I do have the tell tale neck rings beginning as well as some softening around the eyes. Mom has light to moderate wrinkles on her face and moderate wrinkling on her neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks, both of us have smoother and brighter skin, but more than that have seen actual reduction of lines. It really is amazing. My neck wrinkles/creases are either reduced or gone and my mom has had visible reduction in that problematic area as well. These products are expensive but a little does go a long way. I put two pumps of the serum on my fingers and spread it over the face and neck and wait a minute or two for it to absorb before applying the moisturizer. The serum glides on smooth and absorbs quickly with no stickiness. I didn&#x27;t notice any fragrance, which is nice for those with sensitive skin. I have been an Elizabeth Arden or Estee Lauder user most of my adult life, so I am familiar with quality products and these really are something special. Not only are the results nice, but the feeling of moist, well-hydrated skin lasts all day - not because of unabsorbed product, but because the face and neck really are in better shape and hydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging and bottles are attractive and look well on the vanity. My mother is even more sensitive to products than I am and she had nothing but good things to say  as well. I will buy again. I intend to update the review as soon as I can ascertain how long the products last. The price may be offset by the fact that these products are rich and require a smaller amount which may make them comparable in price to the better department store brands. I am definitely a convert.s are rich and require a smaller amount which may make them comparable in price to the better department store brands. I am definitely a convert.</li>
            <li> I discovered a little bottle of Heaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started using Divine Age Guardian Serum, I wasn&#x27;t sure what my results would be. Would this magic serum really turn back the hands of time? Had I discovered Heaven in a bottle? All I can say is yes! My face is smoother than it was a few months ago. I love the results I got from using Divine Age Guardian Serum with Growth Factor.</li>
