            <li>It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>The light beige shade works perfectly for me!</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>I love it, it does the job</li>
            <li>What I like most about this brand is it&#x27;s moist and therefore glides well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, but definitely not the best.</li>
            <li>But w/o the moisturizer, it stays on better.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite drugstore concealer/hi lighter.  </li>
            <li>I really do love this concealer</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this product and it will be my new #1 go to.</li>
            <li>This cover stick is very useful to set the makeup, but does not completely cover blemishes, imperfections understand that it takes another kind and color of concealer according to the problem, but are very good products Maybelline</li>
            <li>I tryed using it on my pimples and it made my skin look as if it was ashy but every where else it fine</li>
            <li>Trying to find something not too light or too dark, I&#x27;m very happy this cover stick works very well for my needs.</li>
            <li>This seems to be the only color that matches my skin and looks good under my eyes..</li>
            <li>Oh...and it seems to help to speed up the recovery of acne and washes off pretty easily at night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and have an olive skin complexion which is quite light now since I spend so much more time indoors than when I was much younger.</li>
            <li>conceals spots and dark circles, works well on my fair skin</li>
            <li>Just a very thin layer is best.</li>
            <li>I have tried many concealers, including very expensive ones, but I always come back to this product since it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li>Too much will look cakey and get into wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Can be cakey if you apply too much.</li>
            <li>I am a middle aged man whose skin has become more sensitive with age.</li>
            <li>Heavy coverage, smooth.  </li>
            <li>It was a gift requested directly by her.</li>
            <li>The shades are so close to my  natural shade</li>
            <li>Just small amounts on the  fending spots patted gently with my finger helps it to blend right in.</li>
            <li>It really does the job of covering all those imperfections and lasts a long time too!!</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s a thick cream stick you should mix in some moisture cream on your hand and smooth it on sparingly.</li>

            <li> This is such an affordable concealer. I love it, it does the job and you dont have to spend a ton. Coverage is excellent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and have an olive skin complexion which is quite light now since I spend so much more time indoors than when I was much younger. Trying to find something not too light or too dark, I&#x27;m very happy this cover stick works very well for my needs.</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay all day.. It&#x27;s OK, but definitely not the best. Will not purchase again.I prefer physicians formula or cover girl.</li>
            <li> I do like it. The only negative is that it&#x27;s hard to apply without moisturizer. But w/o the moisturizer, it stays on better. It&#x27;s a good product. I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to blend in to your skin.  I have to add moisturizer to it in order to blend it in.  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I am a middle aged man whose skin has become more sensitive with age. Just small amounts on the  fending spots patted gently with my finger helps it to blend right in. Different colors do produce different results so online it is a little hard to pick the right one. I went to the local Rite-Aide and picked what seemed to be the correct shade for my face. Very pleased. Oh...and it seems to help to speed up the recovery of acne and washes off pretty easily at night. Small enough to  discreetly carry with you.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite drugstore concealer/hi lighter.  Heavy coverage, smooth.  Can be cakey if you apply too much.</li>
            <li> My wife likes the color and texture. It was a gift requested directly by her. No complains about the product.</li>
            <li> This seems to be the only color that matches my skin and looks good under my eyes.. however it seems to not last a long time.. every 2 hours or so It has already slid off.. : /</li>
            <li> The light beige shade works perfectly for me! I am so happy with this product and it will be my new #1 go to.</li>
            <li> conceals well but is quite thick</li>
            <li> I really do love this concealer The shades are so close to my  natural shade The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the product is hard to find</li>
