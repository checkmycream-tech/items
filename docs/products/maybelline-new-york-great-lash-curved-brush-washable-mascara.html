            <li>Goes on nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Love all Cover Girl Products</li>
            <li>I am happy that Maybelline still makes a mascara that works well and is reasonable in price.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, great product.  </li>
            <li>Most of make up is top of the line</li>
            <li>I love the curved brush as well.</li>
            <li>I love the curved brush because it curls my eyelashes up and separates them well.</li>
            <li>Love the curved brush and that it can be washed off with any face cleanser, or soap.  </li>
            <li>This line has gotten great reviews as a drugstore mascara, so I think I had high expectations.  </li>
            <li>I have used Maybelline Great Lash for about 42 years and have never complained.</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>Maybelline has been our trusted and true favorite mascara for many years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and is not clumpy, and exceeds my expectations for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to smudge on my skin accidentally.  </li>
            <li>It goes on really easy.</li>
            <li>It washes off easy and has never irritated my eyes while using contact lenses.</li>
            <li>Light application to Kardashian racoon eyes</li>
            <li>People are always telling me how long and beautiful my lashes are</li>
            <li>It is even better than some of the higher end brands.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this mascara so much that I have been wearing it since 2006!</li>
            <li>There was a fat brush they had that I liked better, but I&#x27;ve not seen it in a long time.  :</li>
            <li>A true classic mascara!!!</li>
            <li>gave it to my friend who is loyal to this brand, and she likes it.</li>
            <li>so it made me eyelashes look much fuller and longer definitely  would recommend this product, great sellers as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very prone to eye infections and that is an easy reminder.  </li>
            <li>It was okay, nothing that blew me away, but I have really short and light lashes to begin with.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s great stuff, no doubt about it, but formulations have improved and are now not as clumpy as this offering.&lt;br /&gt;Still, as an everyday mascara, it wears well, and if gently and skillfully applied, you can avoid some of the clumps.&lt;br /&gt;Remove any visible globs from the wand with the tines of a clean fork, and apply.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does the job and the price is right.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply to inner lashes too</li>
            <li>Very Black Mascara is a very nice product.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t my FAVORITE mascara, but it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation like others do and the price is right for daily use.</li>
            <li>I wear MAC, Urban Decay and ColourPop mostly</li>
            <li>This item is OK, I personally don&#x27;t like the bend on the applicator as I thought I would.</li>
            <li>This mascara is alright but not my first choice.</li>
            <li>I have tried different and more expensive ones over the years, but this one is the best!  </li>
            <li>The same iconic I grew up with, and it still gives you well coated, feathery</li>
            <li>One reason I keep returning to this particular Maybelline mascara is the curved brush, and the consistent quality of the mascara.</li>
            <li>Can clump if you put to much on.</li>
            <li>and you control how much impact you want to have.</li>
            <li>Although my eyelashes are straight, I still managed to make them curl with this mascara.</li>
            <li>I like this because it does not cause an allergic reaction to my eyes as most other products do.  </li>
            <li>definitely makes my eyes look more open and brighter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent mascara for the price.</li>
            <li>Classic that I always return to.</li>
            <li>This product seemed older than the mascara I was trying to replace.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried high end mascaras before and they never beat this.</li>
            <li>I use it every single day, it was amazing and lasted all day long</li>
            <li>With some other mascaras, I would transfer easily to my skin from my lashes but that didn&#x27;t happen with this mascara.</li>
            <li>It is of course easy to find and well priced based on other products.</li>
            <li>I swear this is more runny and messy then the ones I buy at the store.</li>
            <li>but I always come right back to this.</li>
            <li>I live in humid Florida.</li>
            <li>Wife didn&#x27;t like the brush that came with this produce and even though she wipes it , the brushy, down with a kleenex the mascara clumps and feels cheap.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to remember when it&#x27;s time to throw away my old one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moist, there&#x27;s a lot of fluid inside and the brush gets coated well.</li>
            <li>Ive been using this product since early summer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve stopped using it after trying it out a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the applicator goes on smooth without clumping my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I DON&#x27;T really have long eyelashes at all!</li>
            <li>but this is the mascara I always go back to after trying out the higher end, more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I ordered this item and it clearly states \\&quot;6 tubes of mascara\\&quot; but only one was shipped.</li>
            <li>but I only received one mascara when it clearly says, \\&quot;(6 Mascaras)\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>When one arrives, open it, and pitch the old one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised at how maybelline can come out with such products!!!!</li>
            <li>i have a different version of this with a green top instead of pink.</li>
            <li>Save yourself the trouble and purchase Maybelline Cat Eyes Colossal instead if you like curved wands.</li>
            <li>A little too glossy (wet looking) for me personally, but it doesn&#x27;t clump, goes on easy, no need to use another brush to separate lashes.</li>
            <li>Old &amp; Dry.</li>
            <li>Every other mascara I&#x27;ve tried that was of a similar price range was clumpy, dry, or came off within the first hour of wearing it.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy, hardly clumps, it&#x27;s not dry inside the tube like a lot of other mascaras.</li>

            <li> It goes on easy, hardly clumps, it&#x27;s not dry inside the tube like a lot of other mascaras.</li>
            <li> And this particular one leaves my eyelashes stuck together and the black won&#x27;t come out from under my eyes when I&#x27;m in the shower, even if I have removed the makeup already before hand!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be switching my brand of mascara for a long time.</li>
            <li> I use department store foundation and powder and have experimented with other expensive mascaras but nothing is a better value than my trusty pink maybelline.</li>
            <li> Have tried other high-end brands and they&#x27;re just not the same quality.</li>
            <li> Not as dark as the one I get in my local Walgreens, I would not buy online again.</li>
            <li> It does nothing in terms of volume or length, and only curls lashes slightly.</li>
            <li> I close my eye half way and put the mascara on the tops of the lashes and then open to get them from underneath.</li>
            <li> This mascara is so wet it will give you raccoon eyes in minutes.</li>
            <li> I have moved on to the L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous Mascara, but the smell is not good and it is much more expensive than Maybelline.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Maybelline mascara and other of their eye makeup for years.  </li>
            <li> it seems to work when combined with other mascaras.</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of other ones</li>
            <li> Sometimes it smears on my eyelid through out the day because I have long eyelashes, which sucks because I will have black mark and not know it.</li>
            <li> At first I was not too crazy about the curved brush but that difference was soon over come.  </li>
            <li> A little tip....</li>
            <li> it was very dark as well</li>
            <li> It does &amp;#34;bleed&amp;#34; and give you raccoon eyes after a few hours.</li>
            <li> It leaves me rubbed raw from trying to get it off</li>
            <li> I usually buy it at Target in person and usually pay ~$3 per tube.</li>
            <li> This mascara comes cheap but its horrible!!!!</li>
            <li> No runny or too thick</li>
            <li> Not a good choice if you wear contacts or tend to use water-proof</li>
            <li> Bitter disappointment.</li>
            <li> do not order this from target because it&#x27;s a rip-off.</li>
            <li> Goes on perfectly - no smears until late in the day.</li>
            <li> but I never tell them my secret.</li>
            <li> I like applying two coats for a dramatic look!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this mascara in retail stores before but this one STINKS!</li>
            <li> Very Bad Product, don&#x27;t Buy.</li>
            <li> There is an awful smell associated with this product.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Works well. Can clump if you put to much on. definitely makes my eyes look more open and brighter.</li>
            <li> I swear this is more runny and messy then the ones I buy at the store. It gets the job done but it can get really messy really fast should you decide to blink within 30-45 seconds of applying.</li>
            <li> I love Maybelline mascaras! I use this one more on my bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item and it clearly states \\&quot;6 tubes of mascara\\&quot; but only one was shipped. do not order this from target because it&#x27;s a rip-off.</li>
            <li> It was good for about a week or so, then immediately started clumping up.</li>
            <li> I love the product but I only received one mascara when it clearly says, \\&quot;(6 Mascaras)\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This is used most in the modeling industry and you need to find out why. No runny or too thick and you control how much impact you want to have. Light application to Kardashian racoon eyes, this bottle will take care of it all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this mascara in retail stores before but this one STINKS! Literally. There is an awful smell associated with this product. I do not recommend this product, even with the low price.</li>
            <li> This line has gotten great reviews as a drugstore mascara, so I think I had high expectations.  It was okay, nothing that blew me away, but I have really short and light lashes to begin with.  I like the curved wand.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara. I wear MAC, Urban Decay and ColourPop mostly but this is the mascara I always go back to after trying out the higher end, more expensive brands. It&#x27;s easy to apply and is not clumpy, and exceeds my expectations for the price.</li>
            <li> Love it! Thanks for the wonderful price. Saved a bundle. Love the way it makes my rues pop. Very easy to apply to inner lashes too</li>
            <li> I like this because it does not cause an allergic reaction to my eyes as most other products do.  Also I love how I can wash it off with water and soap. It does not come off . It stay on . I live in humid Florida. I can be outside all day and it stays on until I wash it off.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it smears on my eyelid through out the day because I have long eyelashes, which sucks because I will have black mark and not know it.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as good as I thought but I still use it</li>
            <li> i have a different version of this with a green top instead of pink. And this particular one leaves my eyelashes stuck together and the black won&#x27;t come out from under my eyes when I&#x27;m in the shower, even if I have removed the makeup already before hand! It leaves me rubbed raw from trying to get it off and I&#x27;ve lost a lot of lashes because of the clumping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Maybelline mascara and other of their eye makeup for years.  I especially like the curved brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does the job and the price is right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent mascara for the price. It does &amp;#34;bleed&amp;#34; and give you raccoon eyes after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Great product. Goes on perfectly - no smears until late in the day. But they all do that. Love a curved brush.</li>
            <li> Not as dark as the one I get in my local Walgreens, I would not buy online again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the curved brush.  It&#x27;s easy to smudge on my skin accidentally.  There was a fat brush they had that I liked better, but I&#x27;ve not seen it in a long time.  :(&lt;br /&gt;I do like keeping this on subscribe and save so I don&#x27;t have to remember when it&#x27;s time to throw away my old one.  I&#x27;m very prone to eye infections and that is an easy reminder.  When one arrives, open it, and pitch the old one.</li>
            <li> i bought this mascara based on reviews here and on youtube. it was just ok. did not see any drastic change with this. would not buy again. maybe it was the way applied it. it seems to work when combined with other mascaras.</li>
            <li> This item is OK, I personally don&#x27;t like the bend on the applicator as I thought I would. But it works</li>
            <li> Lalalalove this mascara! Classic that I always return to. Great price!</li>
            <li> The only thing that I like about this is the curved wand. This mascara is so wet it will give you raccoon eyes in minutes. It does nothing in terms of volume or length, and only curls lashes slightly. Save yourself the trouble and purchase Maybelline Cat Eyes Colossal instead if you like curved wands.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best mascaras you can get for a decent price. It is even better than some of the higher end brands. Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> This mascara is great. It goes on really easy. With some other mascaras, I would transfer easily to my skin from my lashes but that didn&#x27;t happen with this mascara. This is a must have for any makeup bag.</li>
            <li> Love the curved brush my reliable stand by brand is great product works well and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Runs. Not a good choice if you wear contacts or tend to use water-proof mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it to my friend who is loyal to this brand, and she likes it. I personally couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> a nice cosmetic for a woman.a nice gift and not to expensize. a nice color for lashes and works good.</li>
            <li> This mascara is alright but not my first choice. Although it does give a bit of volume and length it made my lashes look and feel brittle. It is of course easy to find and well priced based on other products. If necessary I would use it in a \\&quot;pinch\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> This is my go-to mascara! I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a decade and absolutely love it. Have tried other high-end brands and they&#x27;re just not the same quality.</li>
            <li> A true classic mascara!!! It should be a staple in every make-up bag.  I prefer this great curved brush, it gets the roots really well.  I have come back to thisagain and again for over 30 years after trying others.  Love it. No clumping. Stays on. Washes off easily!</li>
            <li> I have used this mascara for more than 10 years.  I have tried different and more expensive ones over the years, but this one is the best!  I am glad they have it on subscribe and save now.</li>
            <li> Goes on nice and smooth.  Stays on all day from one application.</li>
            <li> Love all Cover Girl Products</li>
            <li> One reason I keep returning to this particular Maybelline mascara is the curved brush, and the consistent quality of the mascara. Would like ti see it in brown/black, however.</li>
            <li> At first I was not too crazy about the curved brush but that difference was soon over come.  It arrived a fresh product and I am happy.</li>
            <li> Terrible mascara! This product seemed older than the mascara I was trying to replace. Old &amp; Dry. Total rip off.</li>
            <li> This product, the Maybelline Great Lash Curved - Very Black Mascara is a very nice product. I have used various Maybelline products for years and this one did not disappoint.  Color is perfect, and it was fresh and went on easily.</li>
            <li> Maybelline has been our trusted and true favorite mascara for many years. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara that I care to buy</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have used this mascara for yrs. We especially love the curved brush. I have moved on to the L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous Mascara, but the smell is not good and it is much more expensive than Maybelline. I am happy that Maybelline still makes a mascara that works well and is reasonable in price.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great product.  Great price!</li>
            <li> I Use This All The Time. Works Great</li>
            <li> Really nice looking , many compliments</li>
            <li> Wife didn&#x27;t like the brush that came with this produce and even though she wipes it , the brushy, down with a kleenex the mascara clumps and feels cheap. Was not what she was expecting from Maybelline.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Great Lash mascara for probably 18 years. I&#x27;m a licensed cosmetologist and do hair and makeup all the time. I&#x27;ve tried high end mascaras before and they never beat this. Most of make up is top of the line but I never trade in my Great Lash for anything else! I love the curved brush as well. A little tip....I like applying two coats for a dramatic look! I close my eye half way and put the mascara on the tops of the lashes and then open to get them from underneath. I wait about a minute and do it all over again.</li>
            <li> used this kind for years</li>
            <li> Every other mascara I&#x27;ve tried that was of a similar price range was clumpy, dry, or came off within the first hour of wearing it. Maybelline stays on all day, all evening and still looked good when I wake up in the morning. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be switching my brand of mascara for a long time.</li>
            <li> The same iconic I grew up with, and it still gives you well coated, feathery lashes.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great stuff, no doubt about it, but formulations have improved and are now not as clumpy as this offering.&lt;br /&gt;Still, as an everyday mascara, it wears well, and if gently and skillfully applied, you can avoid some of the clumps.&lt;br /&gt;Remove any visible globs from the wand with the tines of a clean fork, and apply.</li>
            <li> This mascara comes cheap but its horrible!!!! I&#x27;m surprised at how maybelline can come out with such products!!!! Bitter disappointment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara ever since I was a teenager. It goes on easy, hardly clumps, it&#x27;s not dry inside the tube like a lot of other mascaras. It&#x27;s very moist, there&#x27;s a lot of fluid inside and the brush gets coated well. It washes off easy and has never irritated my eyes while using contact lenses.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product since early summer and I have JUST finished using it. I use it every single day, it was amazing and lasted all day long it was very dark as well so it made me eyelashes look much fuller and longer definitely  would recommend this product, great sellers as well.</li>
            <li> I have used Maybelline Great Lash for about 42 years and have never complained. But, I do not like the curved brush and will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Very Bad Product, don&#x27;t Buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for years. This isn&#x27;t my FAVORITE mascara, but it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation like others do and the price is right for daily use.</li>
            <li> Pretty good. Although my eyelashes are straight, I still managed to make them curl with this mascara. It doesn&#x27;t clump which is a great thing!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara so much that I have been wearing it since 2006! I have tried all kinds of other ones but I always come right back to this. I usually buy it at Target in person and usually pay ~$3 per tube. I love the curved brush because it curls my eyelashes up and separates them well. People are always telling me how long and beautiful my lashes are but I never tell them my secret. I DON&#x27;T really have long eyelashes at all! Give it a try. Worst case- you&#x27;re out $3-$4.</li>
            <li> The only mascara I will use. I use department store foundation and powder and have experimented with other expensive mascaras but nothing is a better value than my trusty pink maybelline.</li>
            <li> This mascara smudges through-out the entire day. I find myself having to wipe below my eyes every time I see a mirror because the mascara creates a shadow under my eyes. It makes me look like a raccoon. I&#x27;ve stopped using it after trying it out a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the applicator goes on smooth without clumping my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara that I use. I&#x27;ve been through many different and expensive brands, but nothing compares to this. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, stays on all day and does not clump. I wear it alone or with me Younique 3d mascara.</li>
            <li> A little too glossy (wet looking) for me personally, but it doesn&#x27;t clump, goes on easy, no need to use another brush to separate lashes. So even though it&#x27;s not for me it is a quality product and that&#x27;s why I gave it 5 stars. Sometimes you just have to buy makeup products to see if they work for you, and this was priced low enough that it didn&#x27;t break the bank to give it a try. I might still use it for going out, just not my work-daily style.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years!  Love the curved brush and that it can be washed off with any face cleanser, or soap.  No oils or chemicals needed to remove.</li>
