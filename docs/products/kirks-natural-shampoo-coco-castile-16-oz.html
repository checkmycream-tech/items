            <li>great stuff,.</li>
            <li>, perhaps someone else will, again, for me, nope, does not make my hair happy at all.</li>

            <li>Never have to worry about over-perfumed product  especially important since I have breathing issues.  </li>
            <li>it produces great bounty of soapy suds.</li>

            <li>Wonderful, clean smell!</li>
            <li>Their hand soap is good too.  </li>
            <li>Have always struggled with what made a good shampoo.</li>
            <li>so this isn&#x27;t good for me.</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells wonderful, sudses beautifully, and does NOT rob your hair of natural oils!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Amazing product.  </li>
            <li>Nice shampoo.</li>
            <li>Smells nice</li>
            <li>Really good product..using it for many years, also use the bar soap.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is mild and lathers beautifully.  </li>
            <li>All natural ingredients--I am so happy!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, It is not tested on animals , smells amazing and leaves me deadlocks very clean.</li>
            <li>I like it better than the bar of soap...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>love this product, it arived as they said ti would even tho there were snow storms,..</li>
            <li>Mostly these are for our nose and eyes.</li>
            <li>With more and more &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;  and &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; shampoos, I had given up on not having sores on my scalp from washing my hair; but when I saw the Kirk&#x27;s shampoo, I had to try it.  </li>
            <li>Love, Love , Love .</li>
            <li>I love the soap</li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves my hair quite silky and healthy feeling.</li>
            <li>I love Kirk&#x27;s Castile bar soap and was hoping their shampoo worked just as well.</li>
            <li>I was in search of an alternative to Aveda shampoo at a decent price, and this is a good one.  </li>
            <li>This strikes a nice balance, leaving the hair looking full bodied (increasingly important at my age) and clean.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be performing just fine anyway.</li>
            <li>It has strong, chemical-like, smell and the ingredients sound like chemicals to me.</li>
            <li>I purchased Kirk&#x27;s Original Coco Castille Shampoo from the company&#x27;s website and have been using it for months now.</li>
            <li>Clean and organic,</li>
            <li>So clean smelling  and lathers up a storm .</li>
            <li>Clean hair, no residue, and no synthetic chemicals.  </li>
            <li>We took a bottle of this Shampoo to the BVI&#x27;S last summer and the girls loved it</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say if the price is good as I have not found it locally to compare.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and rinses clean.</li>
            <li>- gets it clean the first time.</li>
            <li>I would recommend wetting your hair very well and scrunching your hair around to make sure it is very saturated before you apply the shampoo.</li>
            <li>so it is quite economical.</li>
            <li>In an attempt to remove chemicals from things ingested or absorbed, I turned to this product and it satisfies.  </li>
            <li>if there already is existing irritation, massaging this shampoo into the scalp clears the irritation right up.</li>
            <li>Just like Kirks bar soap, this shampoo cleans well and gently, and then washes clean.  </li>
            <li>Bought it for the first time</li>
            <li>I would recommend that if you are interested  give it a try.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s organic and natural made primarily of coconut oil and coconut oil products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a very pleasent mild smell and leaves my head and hair feeling clean  but not over dry after use.</li>
            <li>I finally found this natural shampoo that gives me full body and squeaky clean and shiny hair.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works great on my hair, does not make it dry and fluffy, but makes it feel clean and soft.</li>
            <li>fast shipping</li>
            <li>that are free enough of perfumes and dyes.  </li>
            <li>No fragrance, no nonsense shampoo that cleans hair and is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Never irritating.</li>
            <li>, It lathered right up in ocean water and left their hair soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I have thick, fine, wavy hair and a strong shampoo</li>
            <li>I live in Indiana where the water weighs my very fine hair down.  </li>
            <li>I am really digging into natural products that are not very expensive.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel much softer and natural than using store bought shampoo!</li>
            <li>I use it along with Kirk&#x27;s castile bar soap to have a completely natural bathing experience!</li>
            <li>It has a delightful smell and it was extremely affordable for the large quantity of the product you get for your money unlike many organic products that give you 4 ounces for $20 or something outrageous to that effect.</li>
            <li>We all have sensitive skin and are prone to psoriasis, dandruff, dermatitis, etc.</li>
            <li>cleans well, leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable without the need for a conditioner.</li>
            <li>Products containing citric acid cause my skin to not just rash, but bleed.&lt;br /&gt;The description and list of ingredients seemed complete, yet</li>
            <li>leave my sensitive scalp itchy and my hair feeling like straw.  </li>
            <li>The kids don&#x27;t really like the smell, but it beats having us broken out in rashes from the ingredients in many shampoos.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this is a decent less chemical-filled shampoo than many name brands out there.</li>
            <li>It does use up faster compared to my old traditional smelly soap though.</li>
            <li>The scent is ok, not great.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the scent of this shampoo is very strong, and at times I think overpowering.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad smell, just not a good one.  </li>
            <li> This will last me for a long time!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the  soap for about 6 months now and its gentle and creates mounds of suds even in hard water.</li>
            <li> At first it dried my hair and scalp out a little</li>
            <li> a leave it dry and brittle, and</li>
            <li> However, one of the things I really like about the bar soap that did not carry over to the shampoo is the subtle frangance.  </li>
            <li> I have dry hair</li>
            <li> I am not sure how natural this shampoo is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey with shipping costs, so I&#x27;l intensify the search to find it locally.</li>
            <li> Oh, by the way, minimal odor, which I like.</li>
            <li> Not much difference between this and the liquid soap...cleans well and rinses thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long long way</li>
            <li> Because I use less of it than other products, it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> Tried other brands  Dr. something .</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this shampoo is sometimes it doesn&#x27;t lather so well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used worse natural shampoos, but I&#x27;ve also found some that don&#x27;t leave my hair as tangled and frizzy as this one.</li>
            <li> If Kirks could tone down the smell, then it would be a 5 star product.</li>
            <li> I guess it is just a less chemical alternative.</li>
            <li> Could use a little less scent, though</li>
            <li> suspected lather had little to do with it.</li>
            <li> harsh on your skin.</li>
            <li> Citric acid.&lt;br /&gt;I am homebound and depend heavily on internet shopping to obtain everyday products.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Been using for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> other shampoos, which generally leave residue which just makes the hair look matted and dirty.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find.</li>
            <li> But at least it&#x27;s not chemical</li>
            <li> Less expensive than anyplace  SueS</li>
            <li> Well, all hair types different but this shampoo did nothing for my hair, left it looking terrible</li>
            <li> was a bitter disappointment.</li>
            <li> As weird as it sounds it seemed to take my hair a few days to get used to it.</li>
            <li> the bottle says to shake well, but it&#x27;s difficult to shake the thick liquid efficiently.  </li>
            <li> A very subtle baby shampoo fragrance.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very expensive.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo and cream rinse have a chemical bad smell.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I live in Indiana where the water weighs my very fine hair down.  I finally found this natural shampoo that gives me full body and squeaky clean and shiny hair.  All natural ingredients--I am so happy!</li>
            <li> Great product. fast shipping</li>
            <li> I like it better than the bar of soap...easiert to use and 1 bottle last me over a year...leaves my hair easier to manage and sets up well in blow drying</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Clean and organic, but I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Bought it for the first time a Lehman&#x27;s several years ago, but they don&#x27;t have it in the catalog and it&#x27;s very expensive.  I have oily hair, so I tend to alternate between clarifying shamppos, which strip my hair a leave it dry and brittle, and other shampoos, which generally leave residue which just makes the hair look matted and dirty.  This strikes a nice balance, leaving the hair looking full bodied (increasingly important at my age) and clean.  Hard to find. All the laureth and laurel sulfates are derived from coconut oil.  Their hand soap is good too.  Oh, by the way, minimal odor, which I like.</li>
            <li> We took a bottle of this Shampoo to the BVI&#x27;S last summer and the girls loved it, It lathered right up in ocean water and left their hair soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Just like Kirks bar soap, this shampoo cleans well and gently, and then washes clean.  However, one of the things I really like about the bar soap that did not carry over to the shampoo is the subtle frangance.  Unfortunately, the scent of this shampoo is very strong, and at times I think overpowering.  If Kirks could tone down the smell, then it would be a 5 star product.</li>
            <li> I purchased Kirk&#x27;s Original Coco Castille Shampoo from the company&#x27;s website and have been using it for months now. It has a delightful smell and it was extremely affordable for the large quantity of the product you get for your money unlike many organic products that give you 4 ounces for $20 or something outrageous to that effect. My only complaint about this shampoo is sometimes it doesn&#x27;t lather so well. I would recommend wetting your hair very well and scrunching your hair around to make sure it is very saturated before you apply the shampoo. Other than that, this is a decent less chemical-filled shampoo than many name brands out there.</li>
            <li> great stuff,. love this product, it arived as they said ti would even tho there were snow storms,.. thank you</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t like the smell.  It&#x27;s not a bad smell, just not a good one.  You can&#x27;t have it all, huh.</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo. Have always struggled with what made a good shampoo. Knew it was not fragrance and suspected lather had little to do with it. Mostly these are for our nose and eyes. This stuff works great on my hair, does not make it dry and fluffy, but makes it feel clean and soft. Can&#x27;t say if the price is good as I have not found it locally to compare. Because I use less of it than other products, it lasts a very long time. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wanted a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t take the oil out, this doesn&#x27;t cut it. I have dry hair so this isn&#x27;t good for me.</li>
            <li> This castile soap shampoo is the best thing my family has ever used. We all have sensitive skin and are prone to psoriasis, dandruff, dermatitis, etc. This shampoo has no SLS in it, so, it does not only not irritate our scalps, but, if there already is existing irritation, massaging this shampoo into the scalp clears the irritation right up. No need for chemical dandruff or tar shampoos. Smells nice too! A very subtle baby shampoo fragrance. Not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I have difficulty finding soaps, shampoos, etc. that are free enough of perfumes and dyes.  With more and more &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;  and &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; shampoos, I had given up on not having sores on my scalp from washing my hair; but when I saw the Kirk&#x27;s shampoo, I had to try it.  Kirk&#x27;s was a trusted name way back when I was a child and still is.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Love, Love , Love . So clean smelling  and lathers up a storm . Tried other brands  Dr. something . YUK!!!!!!!Keep my house with always extra . Bring to Canada to my aunt as she has haed water . she loves it.  .Not harsh on your skin.Best buy is drugstore.com . Less expensive than anyplace  SueS</li>
            <li> I am really digging into natural products that are not very expensive.  This will last me for a long time!  Makes my hair feel much softer and natural than using store bought shampoo!</li>
            <li> Excellent for our family&#x27;s allergies.  Cleans well, and you don&#x27;t need to use it often.  The kids don&#x27;t really like the smell, but it beats having us broken out in rashes from the ingredients in many shampoos.</li>
            <li> Well, all hair types different but this shampoo did nothing for my hair, left it looking terrible and I do not have problem hair, so what gives here? I do not know but I didn&#x27;t like it, perhaps someone else will, again, for me, nope, does not make my hair happy at all. Smells nice but that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry Castile you just don&#x27;t have what it takes and I like Castile, not this one.&lt;br /&gt;Sign Me..........Hey What Happened To My Beautiful Locks??? Mystery to me.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, clean smell!</li>
            <li> Not much difference between this and the liquid soap...cleans well and rinses thoroughly.  I would recommend that if you are interested  give it a try.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It smells fresh and rinses clean. Doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling the need to rinse lather and repeat - gets it clean the first time.</li>
            <li> cleans well, leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable without the need for a conditioner. Could use a little less scent, though</li>
            <li> The shampoo and cream rinse have a chemical bad smell.  I love the soap have used it for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the  soap for about 6 months now and its gentle and creates mounds of suds even in hard water. It does use up faster compared to my old traditional smelly soap though.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  Works great.  Clean hair, no residue, and no synthetic chemicals.  Virtually no scent.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me but it did work for my sister</li>
            <li> I was in search of an alternative to Aveda shampoo at a decent price, and this is a good one.  The coconut derived surfactant lathers quite well.  The scent is ok, not great.  But at least it&#x27;s not chemical fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;One thing though...the bottle says to shake well, but it&#x27;s difficult to shake the thick liquid efficiently.  It seems to be performing just fine anyway.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how natural this shampoo is. It has strong, chemical-like, smell and the ingredients sound like chemicals to me. It leaves build up on my scalp, which becomes itchy after 2-3 days and my hair is frizzy and becomes greasy after 2-3 days. I guess it is just a less chemical alternative.</li>
            <li> No fragrance, no nonsense shampoo that cleans hair and is very inexpensive. I have used this product for several years and it is a bargain.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on the listing of ingredients. I am allergic/hypersensitive to citric acid, not just internally, but externally. Products containing citric acid cause my skin to not just rash, but bleed.&lt;br /&gt;The description and list of ingredients seemed complete, yet when my shampoo arrived, there it was. Citric acid.&lt;br /&gt;I am homebound and depend heavily on internet shopping to obtain everyday products.&lt;br /&gt;This was a bitter disappointment.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is mild and lathers beautifully.  I have thick, fine, wavy hair and a strong shampoo leave my sensitive scalp itchy and my hair feeling like straw.  This shampoo leaves my hair quite silky and healthy feeling.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, It is not tested on animals , smells amazing and leaves me deadlocks very clean. I recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> I love Kirk&#x27;s Castile bar soap and was hoping their shampoo worked just as well. I&#x27;ve used worse natural shampoos, but I&#x27;ve also found some that don&#x27;t leave my hair as tangled and frizzy as this one. I will stick with their soap, but wouldn&#x27;t buy the shampoo again.</li>
            <li> Been using for a few weeks now. As weird as it sounds it seemed to take my hair a few days to get used to it. At first it dried my hair and scalp out a little but after about three or four uses everything is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very pleasent mild smell and leaves my head and hair feeling clean  but not over dry after use.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells wonderful, sudses beautifully, and does NOT rob your hair of natural oils! I use it along with Kirk&#x27;s castile bar soap to have a completely natural bathing experience!</li>
            <li> Really good product..using it for many years, also use the bar soap.  Never have to worry about over-perfumed product  especially important since I have breathing issues.  Never irritating. I .  A small amount goes a long long way bc it produces great bounty of soapy suds. so it is quite economical.</li>
            <li> Kirk&#x27;s Castile products are great.  In an attempt to remove chemicals from things ingested or absorbed, I turned to this product and it satisfies.  From the ingredient list, there appear to be no chemical additives and it&#x27;s organic and natural made primarily of coconut oil and coconut oil products.  It&#x27;s a little pricey with shipping costs, so I&#x27;l intensify the search to find it locally.</li>
