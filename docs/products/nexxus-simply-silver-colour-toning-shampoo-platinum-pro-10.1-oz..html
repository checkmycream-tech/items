            <li>They consistently want more!</li>
            <li>It gave a beautiful SILVER tone without the purple or blue highlights.  </li>
            <li>Nexxus has pulled this product from the market and repackaged it as \\&quot;Platinum Pro\\&quot; also available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>On the web page, however, was Nexus Simply Silver, which is a GREAT product.</li>
            <li>original  coloe and sheen back TO SUN-YELLOWING great product,</li>
            <li>Product pictured is the original &amp;#34;Simply Silver&amp;#34; shampoo by Nexxus, however the product I received was &amp;#34;Platinum Pro&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>5-star raring  recommend for all who enjoy  their true gray  hair</li>
            <li>Great - keeps the grey - silver</li>
            <li>Love it makes my hair nice and white</li>
            <li>I was able to return the product for a full refund which I greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li>Using product to keep highlights true color.</li>
            <li>Good stuff to keep gray hair shiny and the yellow away.</li>
            <li>does a wonderful job of keeping yellow tones out of  my completely white hair.  </li>
            <li>looking, so I tried this product and so far, I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>It is significantly more concentrated (therefore more effective) than other, similar, products.</li>
            <li>Since I needed it right away, I kept it.</li>
            <li>I remember it giving my hair a great silver sheen when using it previously, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do so as much now.</li>
            <li>I was trying to get my gray hair to look more white and radiant; but they turned kind of blue.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I decided to check on-line for a different shampoo that would be just as effective without the intense purple color.</li>
            <li>I went to Amazon to order this exact item, which is an o.k. product.</li>
            <li>I purchase this product for my husband and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>A real pain in the neck!  </li>
            <li>Love this shampoo... but only use it once a week</li>
            <li>Exactly what I&#x60;ve been looking for and now have found a way to get it.</li>
            <li>I have white hair and have tried other toning shampoos, but this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>Love this shampoo for grey hair.</li>
            <li>So far results are keeping color true.</li>
            <li>I have used other brands but they do not do near the good job as this.</li>
            <li>thanks for stocking this product</li>
            <li>My gray hair really shines and I get lots of compliments.  </li>
            <li>This was much appreciated.</li>
            <li>Very heppy with the results.</li>
            <li>Simply Silver Shampoo much better and will order it again and hope that I will receive the right one next time.</li>
            <li>if you are looking for the original Simply Silver, this is not it.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, I only use it once or twice a week, but it really makes a difference with my white hair.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect for removing discolorations caused by other shampoos, conditioners, the sun or other elements, returning your hair to its natural color, be it gray, white, or platinum.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly the same formula and usually only available at salons or beauty supply stores that carry Nexxus.  </li>
            <li>I noticed more split ends than usual, so I followed a friend&#x27;s advice and bought this product.  </li>
            <li>It is shown in the same bottle as the original Simply Silver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used simply silver in the past and liked it.</li>
            <li>(PP being available from your local salon products distributor; at about the same price as Simply Silver.)</li>
            <li>It really tones your hair evenly if you have been blonde all your life, but now have graying hair...</li>
            <li>both the nexus shampoo and the Jhirmack conditioner make my hair shine and soft.</li>
            <li>I have tried them all, believe me, but this one has an extra shine and sparkle missing in most of the others.  </li>
            <li>I have used product before and really liked it, but was unable to find it in stores here.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see that it made much difference on my hair than any other shampoo.</li>

            <li> Turned my grey hair blue after several washings.</li>
            <li> Everyone with white or grey hair should try this..</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo for grey hair and it is hard to locate in the stores.  </li>
            <li> I use it twice a week per my hair stylist&#x27;s instructions, no more, no less.</li>
            <li> I was not aware that gray hair becomes brittle and dry.</li>
            <li> They should have advised me that they had no more Simply Silver shampoo before sending me something I didn&#x27;t order.</li>
            <li> I use it every other washing.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want my gray to be dull or yellow</li>
            <li> My only concern is that it&#x27;s getting hard to find - I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it!</li>
            <li> it was a little bit cheaper</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too much trouble.</li>
            <li> It does cut the brassiness down, yet leaves my hair rather dull and with a residue feeling.</li>
            <li> I have highlighted blond hair and have well water, with a softner, so my hair tends to get very limp (from the softened water) and I also pick up a lot of brassiness from the well water.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product if you have dull lifeless gray hair.</li>
            <li> and you need a very small amount to shampoo your hair</li>
            <li> When contacting customer service, no record of the transaction, very rude to deal with, and will never deal with Amazon again!</li>
            <li> This product is falsely represented!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;THIS was FALSE ADVERTISING!!</li>
            <li> Too bad they do not make it anymore.</li>
            <li> But disappointed.</li>
            <li> After ordering a product called &amp;#34;Simply Silver,&amp;#34; I was disappointed to receive a product called &amp;#34;Aloxxi Platinum Pro.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Could be my water, so I hate to blame the product.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed that what I ordered was NOT what I received!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is great for toning up the silver or gold that is in your hair as you age.  It helps to bring out the highlights that you thought were no longer existant.  I use it twice a week per my hair stylist&#x27;s instructions, no more, no less.</li>
            <li> Using product to keep highlights true color. So far results are keeping color true.</li>
            <li> I was using another product which was leaving my hair too purple. Therefore, I decided to check on-line for a different shampoo that would be just as effective without the intense purple color. Someone suggested NEXXUS Platinum Pro and that did the trick. Now I am sold on this product. Wonderful results with the first application.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, I only use it once or twice a week, but it really makes a difference with my white hair.</li>
            <li> Order Nexxus Silver, received a product totally different.  When contacting customer service, no record of the transaction, very rude to deal with, and will never deal with Amazon again!</li>
            <li> This shampoo keeps my naturally blonde hair blonde instead of brassy with red streaks.  It also smells good and leaves hair shiny and manageable.    Nexxus has pulled this product from the market and repackaged it as \\&quot;Platinum Pro\\&quot; also available on Amazon.  It is exactly the same formula and usually only available at salons or beauty supply stores that carry Nexxus.  Glad I can still buy it here.</li>
            <li> I order this product for a couple who have no computer savvy. They consistently want more! My only concern is that it&#x27;s getting hard to find - I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it!</li>
            <li> It looks like Nexxus just dropped the name Simply Silver and &#x27;brought out&#x27; Platinum Pro. From what I can tell, they&#x27;re identical. (PP being available from your local salon products distributor; at about the same price as Simply Silver.)</li>
            <li> Substituted ALOXXI PLATINUM PRO for SIMPLY SLVER</li>
            <li> Leaves great highlights</li>
            <li> This product was purchased for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s a platinum gray, and it keep her beautiful gray, just that way, beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;We love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Pastor in Detroit</li>
            <li> I have been getting many comments about my &amp;#34;beautiful silver hair&amp;#34; since I started using this product.  I have tried them all, believe me, but this one has an extra shine and sparkle missing in most of the others.  I am going to stay with this.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo for grey hair and it is hard to locate in the stores.  Thank you for sending this.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for white hair and you need a very small amount to shampoo your hair</li>
            <li> I ordered Simply Silver for my mother who lives in another state. She called to thank me but that is when I found out that they sent her Nexxus PRO PLATINUM Shampoo. Even though Pro Platinum is in the description it is NOT Simply Silver. So if you are looking for Simply Silver exclusively, DO NOT purchase this product. You can purchase Pro Platinum in Walmart or any retail that sells Nexxus products which is about any place now. I didn&#x27;t want to put my mother through trying to re-package and return it so I took the loss. I will read the reviews from here on.</li>
            <li> I ORDERED SIMPLY SILVER NOT PLATINUM PRO IT WAS NOT THE SAME PRODUCT I HAVE USED BEFORE. IT TURNED THE HAIR WHITE.</li>
            <li> Nexus puts out this great product and I have used it for years. My hair is continually being complimented as to color and shine. I share all my hair beauty secrets when asked.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want my gray to be dull or yellow looking, so I tried this product and so far, I&#x27;m satisfied with it. A relative tried it as well and loves it too.</li>
            <li> I have used product before and really liked it, but was unable to find it in stores here. It really tones your hair evenly if you have been blonde all your life, but now have graying hair...I have used other brands but they do not do near the good job as this.</li>
            <li> Product pictured is the original &amp;#34;Simply Silver&amp;#34; shampoo by Nexxus, however the product I received was &amp;#34;Platinum Pro&amp;#34;. I was told that it was the same product but with updated packaging, but it was quite obvious from the ingredients (and by the smell!) that it is a different formulation. Just a heads up if you are looking for the original Simply Silver, this is not it. I was able to return the product for a full refund which I greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li> Not only the product is an excellent one, it also has an excellent price. Very easy to buy, pay and get it shipped. I recommended to anyone that wants to have great looking hair and healthy also. A must have.</li>
            <li> Have used this shampoo for several years.  Cannot purchase any where but online although Nexxus products are everywhere.  It keeps my almost white hair from turning yellow.</li>
            <li> Perfect to prevent yellowing grey hair..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see that it made much difference on my hair than any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> both the nexus shampoo and the Jhirmack conditioner make my hair shine and soft. They don&#x27;t make it looking blue.</li>
            <li> Good stuff to keep gray hair shiny and the yellow away.</li>
            <li> Turned my grey hair blue after several washings.</li>
            <li> I went to Amazon to order this exact item, which is an o.k. product. On the web page, however, was Nexus Simply Silver, which is a GREAT product. I ordered Simply Silver but got Platinum Pro. Since I needed it right away, I kept it. But disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product for my husband and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> It arrive and it had exploded all over the inside of the box. They gave me my money back but I couldn&#x27;t try it out. Don&#x27;t want to order shampoo online anymore. Found a nice selection of purple shampoos at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Simply Silver product and they had none in stock, so they sent me a different shampoo in it&#x27;s place.  I called them and had to go through a return order process.  A real pain in the neck!  They should have advised me that they had no more Simply Silver shampoo before sending me something I didn&#x27;t order.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed that what I ordered was NOT what I received!  Even the wording &amp;#34;Simply Silver&amp;#34; is not listed anywhere on the bottle and what I received is for all hair colours, NOT blonde, gray, or white which is what I use Simply Silver for!  I&#x27;m a former hairdresser and what I received is NOT Simply Silver and I do know the difference!&lt;br /&gt;The photo in the description IS Simply Silver.  What is being sent is NOT Simply Silver!&lt;br /&gt;This is misleading and I would venture to say on the edge of being fraudulent!</li>
            <li> There are a lot of men and women who have gray or white hair and do not use hair coloring at all.  This product is perfect for removing discolorations caused by other shampoos, conditioners, the sun or other elements, returning your hair to its natural color, be it gray, white, or platinum.  This stuff WORKS. Just leave it lathered in for 5-10 minutes while you shower.  Amazing results every time.  I am a man, mid 60&#x27;s, with white/gray hair, and use this product twice weekly, with regular shampoo the remainder of the time.  I order two bottles on-line via Amazon.com every couple of years.</li>
            <li> Love it makes my hair nice and white</li>
            <li> Keeps my white hair white especially after swimming</li>
            <li> Keeps the sparkle in my gray hair!!!  Love this shampoo... but only use it once a week or you&#x27;ll be a &amp;#34;blue hair&amp;#34;!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I&#x60;ve been looking for and now have found a way to get it. Thank you</li>
            <li> I ordered the Nexus Simply Silver Shampoo but received Nexus Platinum Pro Color Toning Shampoo.  I&#x27;m using what was sent because I didn&#x27;t want to send it back. It&#x27;s too much trouble. I like the Nexus Simply Silver Shampoo much better and will order it again and hope that I will receive the right one next time.</li>
            <li> As a not quite silver haired lady, it is helping to even out the coloring and leaves my hair manageable and looking great.</li>
            <li> 5-star raring  recommend for all who enjoy  their true gray  hair color.brings  original  coloe and sheen back TO SUN-YELLOWING great product, thanks for stocking this product</li>
            <li> given as a gift for sister who uses it only!</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that takes the yellow out of my gray hair.  I use it every other washing.  My gray hair really shines and I get lots of compliments.  I recommend this product if you have dull lifeless gray hair.</li>
            <li> does a wonderful job of keeping yellow tones out of  my completely white hair.  makes it simply silver!!  am often asked what I put on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have highlighted blond hair and have well water, with a softner, so my hair tends to get very limp (from the softened water) and I also pick up a lot of brassiness from the well water. I have used simply silver in the past and liked it. I thought I would try this product. It does cut the brassiness down, yet leaves my hair rather dull and with a residue feeling. Could be my water, so I hate to blame the product. It just seems like I had shiner results with Simply Silver.</li>
            <li> This product is exceptional; perfect for brightening blonde, silver, and platinum tresses. It is significantly more concentrated (therefore more effective) than other, similar, products.</li>
            <li> I was trying to get my gray hair to look more white and radiant; but they turned kind of blue.</li>
            <li> Not many products left for Gray hair that wants to be silver or platinum, this product does the job will buy again and again</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo for grey hair. At 70 I get compliments on the color and I tell people it&#x27;s mother nature and Nexxus.&lt;br /&gt;Mary Ann</li>
            <li> because it keep my hair white  not purple and I reall liked it I wih it was a little bit cheaper</li>
            <li> I remember it giving my hair a great silver sheen when using it previously, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do so as much now.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at the recommendation of my hair dresser.  It did not remove the brassiness that silver/white hair is prone to.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Having gray hair is a pain.  I was not aware that gray hair becomes brittle and dry.,  I noticed more split ends than usual, so I followed a friend&#x27;s advice and bought this product.  I noticed great improvement in my hair&#x27;s dryness right away.  Just know that this also brings out the gray highlights,</li>
            <li> This product is falsely represented!!  They send you a different  product(Platinum Pro) saying that it is the same as Simply Silver, it is NOT!!!&lt;br /&gt;They show you the bottle saying that is Simply Silver and send you a different product.&lt;br /&gt;This product was not advertised at the time as Platinum Pro as it is now.&lt;br /&gt;THIS was FALSE ADVERTISING!! It is shown in the same bottle as the original Simply Silver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They did take back the product and refund my money.  This was much appreciated.</li>
            <li> I have white hair and have tried other toning shampoos, but this one is by far the best.  Very heppy with the results.</li>
            <li> Nexxus Simply Silver out did themselves when they made this shampoo.  It gave a beautiful SILVER tone without the purple or blue highlights.  Too bad they do not make it anymore.</li>
            <li> Great - keeps the grey - silver - I do get many compliments</li>
            <li> Good product, used for years.</li>
            <li> Ordered Simply Silver, as shown, but received a completely different, inferior product called Platinum Pro, which I have tried before and would not have bought again. Will request a refund.</li>
            <li> After ordering a product called &amp;#34;Simply Silver,&amp;#34; I was disappointed to receive a product called &amp;#34;Aloxxi Platinum Pro.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It is the only shampoo that takes the yellow out.  It is great.  Everyone with white or grey hair should try this..</li>
