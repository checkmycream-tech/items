            <li>Price was excellent and product delivered faster than expected.  </li>
            <li>That cream is a good moisturizer buuuuut just for winter times because it is very greasy .</li>
            <li>I had an awesome sking, but when I arrive to america a year and a half ago, my skin start struggling with acne</li>
            <li>It is fine under my makeup, and I like the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li>I purchased it, very good cream when dealing with dry skin!</li>
            <li>I use it as my daily moisurizer and it feels great on and has a SPF of 20</li>
            <li>This cream is a light cream.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and seems to help.  </li>
            <li>Oh, and did I mention being able to get Retinol at such a good price?</li>
            <li>I am really pleased this cream goes on easily, disappears quickly and is actually doing some good with the Retinol.</li>
            <li>- my skin looks very healthy, and I am over 60 years old!</li>
            <li>Best Day cream I have ever used, all year round!</li>
            <li>It makes your face feel so clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Nothing special and used it up in 2 weeks time.</li>
            <li>this cream makes my skin soft and more wrinkle free.</li>
            <li>It also made my skin super tender to the touch</li>
            <li>she raves how this product has helped her with aging spots, wrinkes sun protection and overall a great hydration for the skin leaving you with soft skin!</li>
            <li>pores will clog and make break outs if u apply the cream right after.</li>
            <li>Now is maybe the right time to say I never write reviews of any product for a lot of reasons.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an older guy with a light complexion living in the Sunshine state.  </li>
            <li>I think it works just as well as the more expensive brand names or designer moisturizers and I am happy to recommend it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any wrinkle reduction necessarily, but it makes my skin feel very smooth.</li>
            <li>and my skin is hydrated and appear younger :)</li>
            <li>excellent product, you need to apply small amounts only.</li>
            <li>My skin was getting pretty discolored by age and the sun.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to help with some fresh stretch marks and didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I DO WISH IDT HAD A HIGHER SPF.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t pay more for a similar product.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t know better until not to long ago,and I would always blame the product..</li>
            <li>I love this cream it really does work for my old 59 year old face.</li>
            <li>you certainly don&#x27;t look your age.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>Being a golfer, I really like that it has sunblock built in.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I found it to be very soothing and softening to my skin.  </li>
            <li>Very godd product.</li>
            <li>This is a quality day cream with a reasonable amount of retinal and sunscreen.</li>
            <li>everything bc of the new enviroment, food, situations, everything was to much, I&#x27;ve tried several things and maybe everyting helped a little bit, but since I am using, the ROC Daily Cleaning Re-Surface / Anti-Wrinkle Disk, Babyface night renewal creme, 2% Vitamin A (retinol) plus this cream, my skin had a dramatical change, looks way better!</li>
            <li>It is creamy ( a little oily) but not bad!</li>
            <li>Do not use if you have fine sensitive skin as this product is too harsh.</li>
            <li>and it works great as compared to expensive products that do the same thing.</li>
            <li>Also I don&#x27;t think the ingredients are all that sage or natural.</li>
            <li>I have laid out in the sun since I was 23 and tanning beds and no one would believe I&#x27;m 59 years old.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried it long enough, but the price is definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to really judge the results but</li>
            <li>It feels a tad bit greasy when first applied, but soaks in completely within a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s live it that there is a definite improvement in my facial skin!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it in the summer full sun, but at least for the winter it works well.</li>
            <li>without a doubt,best cream for sensitive and dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It leaves a slight shine on my skin due to the oil but within a very short time it is absorbed totally into the skin.</li>

            <li> Product chosen after long investigation of what works and includes a sun screen.  </li>
            <li> My main goal is the prevent or at least delay newer ones.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using the Retinol Cream for a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> As for the wrinkle remover aspects of this cream.....as I said only been using it for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Not really what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too harsh and that was with only using it sparingly at night.  </li>
            <li> but you will be curious and always wonder what</li>
            <li> Felt really icky going on &amp; couldn&#x27;t use long enough to see any results.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Shortly after applying the cream, I do feel a slight tingle for a few minutes, so something is happening.  </li>
            <li> I USED TO GET WITH OTHER SUNSREENS.  </li>
            <li> It weird to say it, but there is a certain \\&quot;glow\\&quot; to my skin that I haven&#x27;t seen in years.  </li>
            <li> I ended up sending this product back after two days as it caused a severe break out and small little bumps all over my face.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for months, it evens out my skin and has helped my sunspots to not be so dark.</li>
            <li> My skin has a smoother appearance, with significantly less sun coloration.  </li>
            <li> but the scent is a little overpowering.</li>
            <li> It has a little slower absorption into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> I believe a few of my acne scars are diminishing.  </li>
            <li> Too heavy &amp; smells like my grandma.</li>
            <li> and I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand SPF products, they are heavy, thick, so on unevenly and sometimes reflect in flash pictures.</li>
            <li> This cream makes your face so soft and it does not smell bad so ladies and gen&#x27;s that is a plus.</li>
            <li> It is thick and creamy, but blends in well.</li>
            <li> Keeps moisturizer during this very harsh winter!</li>
            <li> Seriously, I like the cream.  </li>
            <li> Very hard to find a product that won&#x27;t give me</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a expensive retinol product</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice cream but the scent is a little overpowering.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the Retinol Cream for a few weeks now.  It feels a tad bit greasy when first applied, but soaks in completely within a few minutes.  My skin does feel very smooth.  I have also noticed that I am not nearly as oily by the end of the day.  I believe a few of my acne scars are diminishing.  Being a golfer, I really like that it has sunblock built in.  As for the wrinkle remover aspects of this cream.....as I said only been using it for a few weeks.  My main goal is the prevent or at least delay newer ones.  Shortly after applying the cream, I do feel a slight tingle for a few minutes, so something is happening.  I am in my &#x27;younger&#x27; fifties.  Will write an updated review when I look 20 again!  :-)  Seriously, I like the cream.  It is a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment, great price, feels comfortable, non sticky, I wanted to give my feedback after I tried for a while and is great, I haven&#x27;t seen more wrinkles, the existing ones have decrease and look smoother.</li>
            <li> My face has improved.  I am pleased with results.</li>
            <li> Not really what I was hoping for. Too heavy &amp; smells like my grandma. Felt really icky going on &amp; couldn&#x27;t use long enough to see any results. Also I don&#x27;t think the ingredients are all that sage or natural.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It makes your face feel so clean and refreshed. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Best Day cream I have ever used, all year round! I am 43 and my skin is hydrated and appear younger :)</li>
            <li> I like the silky creamy feel on my skin.  I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to really judge the results but something I do like is that, often times when I change products, I will experience break-outs on my chin.  So far, so good!  No problems.</li>
            <li> love it my skin is so smooth</li>
            <li> I ended up sending this product back after two days as it caused a severe break out and small little bumps all over my face.  It&#x27;s too harsh and that was with only using it sparingly at night.  If you want to turn your skin red and send it to an uproar, by all means, buy this product.</li>
            <li> without a doubt,best cream for sensitive and dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I love it I love it.&lt;br /&gt;thank you amazon:)&lt;br /&gt;Even if you see a 2 star review..think this way: maybe the cream was not fitted for their skin.Maybe they didn&#x27;t fallow the instruction.Maybe they don&#x27;t know that they have to wait at list 20 min after washing or cleansing your face,before u apply a cream-any type .Your pores will clog and make break outs if u apply the cream right after.Anyway...maybe it won&#x27;t be good for you..but you will be curious and always wonder what if..I did that mistake before.If it is affordable,I wil try it and make my own opinion.I will think more at an expensive cream.I am not paid to write this review so it is my honest belief that not everyone that writes a review has fallow the correct steps.I am not saying they didn&#x27;t or that they didn&#x27;t know.But it is always a possibility .I didn&#x27;t know better until not to long ago,and I would always blame the product..but I was the one not having enough patience:)&lt;br /&gt;Now I hope this helps because this cream is wonderful for me.&lt;br /&gt;skin type info: very sensitive,dry and mixt in the t zone.Very hard to find a product that won&#x27;t give me rashes.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I love this cream it really does work for my old 59 year old face.I have laid out in the sun since I was 23 and tanning beds and no one would believe I&#x27;m 59 years old.This cream makes your face so soft and it does not smell bad so ladies and gen&#x27;s that is a plus.I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have skin cancer and this cream makes my skin soft and more wrinkle free.,  I am older and need the moisture I get from it, plus SPF 20 is great for the day.  The vitamin A helps repair also.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price on this Retinol cream. I use it as my daily moisurizer and it feels great on and has a SPF of 20 so if you want more protection, try something else. I haven&#x27;t seen any wrinkle reduction necessarily, but it makes my skin feel very smooth.</li>
            <li> A great moisturizer and the SPF 20 is an added plus.  I found it to be very soothing and softening to my skin.  I think it works just as well as the more expensive brand names or designer moisturizers and I am happy to recommend it.</li>
            <li> That cream is a good moisturizer buuuuut just for winter times because it is very greasy . I choose to use for my hands :)</li>
            <li> softens and protects skin</li>
            <li> Great product and service!</li>
            <li> excellent product, you need to apply small amounts only.I also use the Retinol day cream.</li>
            <li> Makes me break out but I guess everyone is different. I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Nothing special and used it up in 2 weeks time.</li>
            <li> I bought this product by mistake, but have reordered when I ran out. I needed a sunscreen that wouldn&#x27;t break my skin out while it was protecting it in the sun. This one works!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am a 24 y/o woman, and I like to take care of my skin, I am from Chile and when I was living there I had an awesome sking, but when I arrive to america a year and a half ago, my skin start struggling with acne everything bc of the new enviroment, food, situations, everything was to much, I&#x27;ve tried several things and maybe everyting helped a little bit, but since I am using, the ROC Daily Cleaning Re-Surface / Anti-Wrinkle Disk, Babyface night renewal creme, 2% Vitamin A (retinol) plus this cream, my skin had a dramatical change, looks way better! so I totally recomend this item.</li>
            <li> My mother is over 65 years she raves how this product has helped her with aging spots, wrinkes sun protection and overall a great hydration for the skin leaving you with soft skin!</li>
            <li> I love it and it works!  People have asked, &amp;#34;what are you doing?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Your skin looks so good&amp;#34;. And it smells so good too.i have a thing about that.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin look and feel nice. A little goes a long way. Retinol is so good for your skin and I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> best day cream to use it goes on your face very easily and it keep your skin very soft without wrinkles</li>
            <li> I love the day creme. It is thick and creamy, but blends in well. It is fine under my makeup, and I like the way my skin feels. I use it with the Anti-Wrinkle Facial Serum and my skin looks great all day!  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> works for my skin, on my 2nd jar</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily skin, but I would never go without some kind of a moisturizer - this is wonderful - my skin looks very healthy, and I am over 60 years old!</li>
            <li> Do not use if you have fine sensitive skin as this product is too harsh. I only used it for several days before I noticed the redness around my mouth and cheek area and it took about two months for my skin to recover.</li>
            <li> Have not used yet but another product recommended by dr oz. he suggests a retinol cream. You don&#x27;t need a expensive retinol product</li>
            <li> It has a little slower absorption into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;With SPF 20 in it - not that oily.&lt;br /&gt;I like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an older guy with a light complexion living in the Sunshine state.  My skin was getting pretty discolored by age and the sun.  I gave this product a try and have been very impressed with the results.  My skin has a smoother appearance, with significantly less sun coloration.  It weird to say it, but there is a certain \\&quot;glow\\&quot; to my skin that I haven&#x27;t seen in years.  Now is maybe the right time to say I never write reviews of any product for a lot of reasons.  However, I have been significantly impressed with this product.  I&#x27;d like to say it makes me look younger, but I&#x27;m hoping not to be too vain.  Let&#x27;s live it that there is a definite improvement in my facial skin!  It has changed my facial skin tone and I do feel better using this product.</li>
            <li> Very godd product. It met my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent quality.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery Washington satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend This product 100%.&lt;br /&gt;Considers it in my upcoming purchases.</li>
            <li> The advertising said this product works to remove facial lines and wrinkles.  Possibly it works for someone, but not for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand SPF products, they are heavy, thick, so on unevenly and sometimes reflect in flash pictures. I am really pleased this cream goes on easily, disappears quickly and is actually doing some good with the Retinol. I haven&#x27;t used it in the summer full sun, but at least for the winter it works well.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with some fresh stretch marks and didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference. It also made my skin super tender to the touch so I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> They are as described and arrives as promised.</li>
            <li> This cream is a light cream.  It leaves a slight shine on my skin due to the oil but within a very short time it is absorbed totally into the skin. It has a pleasant light fragrance too.</li>
            <li> Keeps moisturizer during this very harsh winter! Glad I purchased it, very good cream when dealing with dry skin! Keeps my face hydrated.</li>
            <li> I USE THE CREAM FOR A SUNSCREEN, AND I NO LONGER GET THE RTASH I USED TO GET WITH OTHER SUNSREENS.  I DO WISH IDT HAD A HIGHER SPF.</li>
            <li> This is a quality day cream with a reasonable amount of retinal and sunscreen. Don&#x27;t pay more for a similar product.</li>
            <li> I love this.  Goes on smoothly and seems to help.  Haven&#x27;t tried it long enough, but the price is definitely worth it.  Will re-order when its gone.</li>
            <li> This is one of the basic creams that you will need for wrinkles!  Great price! and it works great as compared to expensive products that do the same thing.</li>
            <li> I put this on every morning under my foundation. It is creamy ( a little oily) but not bad! I have been using it for months, it evens out my skin and has helped my sunspots to not be so dark. Will continue to by this.</li>
            <li> I like the product with one exception:  a day cream with just a SPF 20 rate seem low to me.</li>
            <li> Product chosen after long investigation of what works and includes a sun screen.  Price was excellent and product delivered faster than expected.  Product is not greasy and is working in the Winter months.</li>
            <li> Does not do as described. It gives me acne every time I put it on. Any moisturizer would work better.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen  for the face.</li>
            <li> This product is what will help keep you beautiful. Get used to people saying, &amp;#34;My you certainly don&#x27;t look your age.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It feels very smooth on your skin, keeps wrinkles at bay and it has an SPF of 20. What more can a girl ask for? Oh, and did I mention being able to get Retinol at such a good price? How could anyone NOT try it?</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with this product and will continue buying it. I have definitely noticed a difference in lines and wrinkles. At 63 that is saying a lot.</li>
            <li> I am almost done with the product and plan to order again.  Thanks for the beautiful face. I am sharing my great skin with everyone who looks at me.</li>
