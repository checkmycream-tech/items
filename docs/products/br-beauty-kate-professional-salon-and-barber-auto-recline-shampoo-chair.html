            <li>NO PROBLEM , very strong steel frame &amp;#34;recommended&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>

            <li>The end result is fine, but it was kind of a hassle.  </li>
            <li>All my clients love this chair.</li>
            <li>I use it in my salon and have been most pleased with  it .</li>
            <li>I love this chair.</li>
            <li>I love this chair.</li>
            <li>but this one is better.</li>
            <li>If you are super picky about perfect levelness don&#x27;t get this chair, If you don&#x27;t use it enough to care than this chair is perfect and at a perfect price, no need to get a more expensive chair, The padding is also pretty comfy, just don&#x27;t wear shorts, you&#x27;ll stick to it, and ouch rip pull lol.</li>
            <li>easy to put together, sturdy, comfortable, well worth the money, love it!</li>
            <li>But other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>Instructions were easy to understand.</li>
            <li>It moves too easy.</li>
            <li>It works fine</li>
            <li>though it seems to do just fine.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and I was able to put it together all by myself.</li>
            <li>My customers can relax a lot easier and get comfortable being in a chair rather than leaning over a sink getting their hair shampooed.</li>
            <li>but it works and is comfortable</li>
            <li>Does what it should worth my money!</li>
            <li>Clean, well made, sturdy, brand new, works great so far!</li>
            <li>It is heavy and seems to be very good quality.</li>
            <li>Shipping was incredibly fast and the chair was easy to assemble.  </li>
            <li>We got two of these chairs they are very well done, easy to built, all you need is use the tools including with each chair,</li>
            <li>Nice chair except that the screws to attach the leg supports (which are tapered) are too short!  </li>
            <li>Delivery was super fast and set up was too !</li>
            <li>The foam is of a really high quality and the slide mechanism works really smoothly.  </li>
            <li>So I ordered my shampoo chair on the 13 and I received it on the 15th so super fast delivery.</li>
            <li>My chair come with easy instructions, didn&#x27;t take long to assemble and comfortable..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand the more negative reviews on this chair because so far I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>i had to purchase $20 worth of new hardware.</li>
            <li>were to short to fit the back support piece chair is comfortable and works fine but expect to spend money to get better fitting screws and other little pieces, shipped fast with ups for me as well</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at the quality of the chair for that price!!</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and durable.  </li>
            <li>Very durable chair.  </li>
            <li>Chair arrived fast.</li>
            <li>(forget about the nut) and they are not long enough on the top holes to even go all the way through.  </li>
            <li>I was very unsure about ordering from a new website, do to the fact I use another supplier all the time.</li>
            <li>Alright product, a little cheap, the pieces didn&#x27;t line up right</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this chair .</li>
            <li>This chair is well worth the extra money over</li>
            <li>and I had to purchase new ones.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t expect to replace the hardware with a new product</li>
            <li>I am not a small girl</li>
            <li>Its a whole lot easier for my back.</li>
            <li>So no complaints so far.</li>
            <li>I plan to order at least one more</li>
            <li>If you have wood floors however you might want to put soft cane rubber tips on the feet to keep it from denting your floor and sliding.</li>
            <li>so I am  pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t difficult to put together.  </li>
            <li>firm easy to work with one of the leg was not flat</li>
            <li>They barely make it through the bottom hole so that I can attach the screw cap</li>
            <li>the bolts that are included are not long enough.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s the same style as the other I ordered from another beauty supply</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the screws for the legs were too short to screw on both the bolt nut and end cap, I had to go to Home Depot and purchase longer screws, that cost about $10 extra to do that.</li>
            <li> Careful with the install</li>
            <li> was the amount of screws and other pieces</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Only complaint and why it is getting 3 stars is that the screws come loose a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about 5 months now and with regular use the screws have come loose at least 6 times.</li>
            <li> I had to cut down the longer legs with a hack saw to get it to set even on the ground.  </li>
            <li> The screws where too small and very difficult to put together, but it is comfortable.</li>
            <li> Please note that as others have written, the supplied screws will not fit.</li>
            <li> I became disabled and had to have my hair washed in a sink for a while which is why I got this chair and it worked well for what I needed, We turned a contractors garbage bag into a water shoot.</li>
            <li> I had trouble putting one of the legs in but a little bit of muscle power took care of it!!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re all the same length, so it&#x27;s not a question of using the wrong ones.  </li>
            <li> But Came With a Small Rip in it!</li>
            <li> this is absolutely ridiculous.</li>
            <li> a little difficult to put together...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like the wrong ones were put in the box.  </li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong purchasing this chair .</li>
            <li> I had a horrible time putting this together.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> All my clients love this chair. Only complaint and why it is getting 3 stars is that the screws come loose a lot. I&#x27;ve had it for about 5 months now and with regular use the screws have come loose at least 6 times.</li>
            <li> My chair come with easy instructions, didn&#x27;t take long to assemble and comfortable.. I&#x27;m very happy!!! I&#x27;ll recommend this to anyone...</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the quality of this chair. Very sturdy and durable.  Shipping was incredibly fast and the chair was easy to assemble.  I would definitely recommend this chair and company!!!</li>
            <li> Nice chair except that the screws to attach the leg supports (which are tapered) are too short!  They barely make it through the bottom hole so that I can attach the screw cap (forget about the nut) and they are not long enough on the top holes to even go all the way through.  They&#x27;re all the same length, so it&#x27;s not a question of using the wrong ones.  It&#x27;s almost like the wrong ones were put in the box.  Rather inconvenient that I will have to provide my own screws in order to set this chair up correctly.</li>
            <li> Everything you said it was. its a real nice chair easy to put together thank you!!!</li>
            <li> This chair is the best ever ! Delivery was super fast and set up was too ! I highly recommend this chair . I use it in my salon and have been most pleased with  it . You cannot go wrong purchasing this chair . It will be one of the best buys you can make for your salon !!!!</li>
            <li> I love this chair. Its a whole lot easier for my back. My customers can relax a lot easier and get comfortable being in a chair rather than leaning over a sink getting their hair shampooed. So no complaints so far. Everything is good.</li>
            <li> Can in really quick!!!!!!!!!!!! Does what it should worth my money! Will order again if I need anything. Nice price</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this chair.  It is heavy and seems to be very good quality. It automatically glides back when someone sits in it. I don&#x27;t like the chairs with a lever that has to be used to make them recline because they can jerk giving the client a jolt. I don&#x27;t understand the more negative reviews on this chair because so far I am very pleased with it. I plan to order at least one more just like it. I  did  not do the assembly-----a relative put it together for our salon.  I heard no complaints from him on assembling it---so I am  pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t difficult to put together.  No complaints here, especially for the price!!!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and I was able to put it together all by myself. All I needed was a star screwdriver. Instructions were easy to understand. Great value.</li>
            <li> Alright product, a little cheap, the pieces didn&#x27;t line up right so it doesn&#x27;t stay on the floor balanced</li>
            <li> Very durable chair.  Careful with the install though to get the legs to line up evenly, may need some adjusting.</li>
            <li> works great with the sink</li>
            <li> firm easy to work with one of the leg was not flat but overall i like it</li>
            <li> easy to put together, sturdy, comfortable, well worth the money, love it!</li>
            <li> It works fine but the screws it comes with are too short.</li>
            <li> the screws that come with this product DONT FIT!!!!! had to go to home depot and buy  more parts!!!</li>
            <li> Clean, well made, sturdy, brand new, works great so far! The only complaint I have is that the screws for the legs were too short to screw on both the bolt nut and end cap, I had to go to Home Depot and purchase longer screws, that cost about $10 extra to do that. Otherwise, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Chair arrived fast. It works great except I wish it had a lock on it. It moves too easy. Other than that it was a great price for a great chair! I use it daily!</li>
            <li> Chair does what it is supposed to do and is good once setup. Please note that as others have written, the supplied screws will not fit. They were too short to go through the legs and I had to purchase new ones. No big deal but I don&#x27;t expect to replace the hardware with a new product</li>
            <li> I was very unsure about ordering from a new website, do to the fact I use another supplier all the time. But I was so HAPPY!!! I am truly impressed; the price was great, the arrival was earlier than expected  &amp; the quality is AMAZING!!! Don&#x27;t doubt this.....it&#x27;s the best kept &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34;. I will continue to use this website. I am in AWE...... I love this chair. It&#x27;s the same style as the other I ordered from another beauty supply but this one is better.</li>
            <li> After I assembled this chair, it had about a 3” wobble.  I had to cut down the longer legs with a hack saw to get it to set even on the ground.  The end result is fine, but it was kind of a hassle.  It was a very cheap cost, so I guess I got what I paid for....</li>
            <li> do not purchase this chair. the bolts that are included are not long enough. i had to purchase $20 worth of new hardware. this is absolutely ridiculous.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend recently bought this item and I had the luxury of trying to put it together first problem the instructions were not only poor but the ink was faded second problem was the amount of screws and other pieces were to short to fit the back support piece chair is comfortable and works fine but expect to spend money to get better fitting screws and other little pieces, shipped fast with ups for me as well</li>
            <li> Excellent for the price</li>
            <li> screws keep falling out</li>
            <li> This chair is well worth the extra money over it&#x27;s cheaper cousins.  The foam is of a really high quality and the slide mechanism works really smoothly.  If you have wood floors however you might want to put soft cane rubber tips on the feet to keep it from denting your floor and sliding.</li>
            <li> Nice Chair But Came With a Small Rip in it!</li>
            <li> So I ordered my shampoo chair on the 13 and I received it on the 15th so super fast delivery. I was very surprised at the quality of the chair for that price!! Putting it together was a bit of a inconvenience and I had to purchase longer screws. I had trouble putting one of the legs in but a little bit of muscle power took care of it!! Very comfortable and perfect for my in home salon. I would buy it again for that price any day!!</li>
            <li> It served it&#x27;s purpose. Like others mine too is not level or even. It will rock from leg to leg or side to side while on a flat surface. Other than that though it seems to do just fine. I am not a small girl and it still held me so that&#x27;s good. If you do hair care for others at home then this chair would work well, I became disabled and had to have my hair washed in a sink for a while which is why I got this chair and it worked well for what I needed, We turned a contractors garbage bag into a water shoot. If you are super picky about perfect levelness don&#x27;t get this chair, If you don&#x27;t use it enough to care than this chair is perfect and at a perfect price, no need to get a more expensive chair, The padding is also pretty comfy, just don&#x27;t wear shorts, you&#x27;ll stick to it, and ouch rip pull lol.</li>
            <li> a little difficult to put together...something is still bc it looks slanted...but it works and is comfortable</li>
            <li> We got two of these chairs they are very well done, easy to built, all you need is use the tools including with each chair, Big/Large people NO PROBLEM , very strong steel frame &amp;#34;recommended&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roy, Woodbridge,VA</li>
            <li> I had a horrible time putting this together. The screws where too small and very difficult to put together, but it is comfortable.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, works perfectly with her shampoo sink. Assembly was easy, price was fair.</li>
            <li> The screws were wayy too short for the support bars. My dad had to go out and buy longer ones. But other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
