            <li>works good :) heats up fast.</li>
            <li>I got this iron set for christmas and was extremely excited, as I love curling my hair.</li>
            <li>Easy for her to change the wands.</li>
            <li>Just beware that it can also burn you just as easily too.</li>
            <li>I have waist length, fine hair with chin length bangs.</li>
            <li>Worked fine to me.</li>
            <li>Opened it up wasn&#x27;t thrilled, the black liner was banged up and torn, I wasn&#x27;t to happy about it.</li>
            <li>With a little bit of hairspray curls come out perfect with all the barrel sizes.</li>
            <li>Love this iron so much!!</li>
            <li>Easy to use overall fantastic product!!!</li>
            <li>it didnt even fit onto the handle.</li>
            <li>The handle is light cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>but overall im happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this product for a year now and it still works fantastic.</li>
            <li>Overall this product is great</li>
            <li>this cheap</li>
            <li>They heat up fast, are simple to change out, and always provide me with perfect curls.</li>
            <li>I can get so many different styles just off of one product, and it&#x27;s easy to use and read!!</li>
            <li>they work well and heat fast!!!</li>
            <li>fast n is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get my curling iron in the mail and try it out.</li>
            <li>I was so upset because I was really excited to try my curler out.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to get it to the max temp since after the first couple of uses</li>
            <li>It heats up in 30 seconds, gets very hot so the glove really comes in handy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun and easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for 2 months and so far I love it!  </li>
            <li>I was super excited to get it to the salon and try it out.  </li>
            <li>Heats up quickly also</li>
            <li>It heats up really quickly too.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly</li>
            <li>I am trying to find a multi compartment case that I can put all the attachments into so that they are able to be stored better without getting scratched up, instead of the giant box.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, works fine and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Works good so far my girl is loving it;:) she loves curling her hair with it and it is long lasting curls</li>
            <li>It works great but on my hair it falls out sometimes if you don&#x27;t hold the curl long enough , other than that it is a good curling wand with all the barrels to choose from !</li>
            <li>Im a professional stylist and love it.</li>
            <li>Worth your money.</li>
            <li>Worth $250</li>
            <li>I just love doing my hair so perfect for different hair styles and for also short or long hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited about all the new possibilities!</li>
            <li>it has lower temperature settings than any wand I have ever used, which I really love because some irons have a default of much higher heat than what is actually needed... but it also gets very hot for users that like the higher heat settings.  </li>
            <li>Must be very carful as it do get very hot.</li>
            <li>this curling wand heats really fast and is very hot.  </li>
            <li>Must Have , It Heats Up Very Fast</li>
            <li>It heats very fast</li>
            <li>I love the different barrel sizes and it gets hot super fast.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick, so it takes a little while to do, but turnout is great! :)</li>
            <li>everyone wants me to curl their hair!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m starting to use it more.</li>
            <li>It works so well and got to my house really fast!</li>
            <li>I love the different options.</li>
            <li>The love the different sizes and variety they give.</li>
            <li>Works great and curls stay in long lasting!</li>
            <li>EXTREMELY FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li>This item broke within the first month of use.</li>
            <li>I like that there are many different sizes</li>
            <li>unfortunately, i never got the chance.</li>
            <li>but it also came with instructions, booklet of products by the company if interested AND a heat glove as well.</li>
            <li>they get really hot</li>
            <li>Love the interchangeable settings so I can create different looks with one wand!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m starting to use it more.</li>
            <li>I loved how fast the shipping was(it was shipped and delivered to my door in less than 12 hours</li>
            <li>While this curling wand is great due to the pretty color and different sizes of barrels, I have to question the quality.  </li>
            <li>so i could easily try out different curls with an all-in-one kit.</li>
            <li>Also, the attachments were not at all easy to plug in or get back out!!</li>
            <li>very well waves come out awessome!!love</li>
            <li>With this iron it stays, no frizz, and very shiny.</li>
            <li>cause it gives me time to go to the bathroom before I start curling haha</li>
            <li>Heats up fast too</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but you get curls in 3 seconds and it heats up really fast.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast.</li>
            <li>It was more than what I had expected.</li>
            <li>The heat resistant glove really works well.  </li>
            <li>My curls lasted a whole week.</li>
            <li>I have tried over 20 different curling wands and this is by far my favorite set.</li>
            <li>It gets super hot, so it actually works.  </li>
            <li>I was excited about the options of the sizes, and only one cord.</li>
            <li>The disconnect function of the barrels is a bit difficult, but overall I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
            <li>So decent shipping time.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It makes such pretty curls and heats up in no time!</li>
            <li>Absolutely everything your looking for curls natural hair as well as weave temperature reaches 410 and you will burn your hand, arm etc.</li>
            <li>When I opened it, it looked new.</li>
            <li>When I opened it, it looked new.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my other daughter, same quality and priced much better.</li>
            <li>I like the different wand sizes but after the first couple of weeks it started taking longer and longer to get to max temp.</li>
            <li>The glove was a bit big for my hand, but was grateful for that for the first week.</li>
            <li>The wands get hot and curl but curls don&#x27;t last at all !!!</li>
            <li>Guess I&#x27;ll better the same brand of what I have and get bigger or smaller ones</li>
            <li>Most products now days are a minute or less, it just took same time to get use to it.</li>
            <li>The extra size barrels are a real plus.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the use of hair styling products, they either don&#x27;t hold or don&#x27;t feel natural.</li>
            <li>old.</li>
            <li>I recently got a long bob and have not been able to achieve the soft curled look that I was after with any other iron...</li>
            <li>the only con is that it is hard to clip on, also there is times where you won&#x27;t be able to change the sizes because it won&#x27;t clip out</li>
            <li>I can do big loose curls or cute little ones.</li>
            <li>Im surprised no one else in the review section hasn&#x27;t had the same problem.</li>
            <li>The wands broke and barely work</li>
            <li>For my 11 year old daughter...after several attempts of getting aggravated she FINALLY figured it out.  </li>
            <li>This curling Iron heats fast and secures and holds for a long lasting curl all day long.</li>
            <li>It takes some serious strength  and manipulating to get it to fit properly.  </li>
            <li>and I love how I can have tight small curls vs big wavy curls.</li>
            <li>I have super thick hair</li>
            <li>I have used this on my daughter who had long hair, the hair curls right away and stays curled until the next day with little or no hairspray</li>
            <li>I knew that the outlets worked because I had just used them minutes before with my other new irons.</li>
            <li>Paid too much for such little use of this product...</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was so excited to get my curling iron in the mail and try it out.</li>
            <li> I was so upset because I was really excited to try my curler out.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to get it to the max temp since after the first couple of uses</li>
            <li> It heats up in 30 seconds, gets very hot so the glove really comes in handy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun and easy to work with.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for 2 months and so far I love it!  </li>
            <li> I was super excited to get it to the salon and try it out.  </li>
            <li> Heats up quickly also</li>
            <li> It heats up really quickly too.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly</li>
            <li> I am trying to find a multi compartment case that I can put all the attachments into so that they are able to be stored better without getting scratched up, instead of the giant box.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, works fine and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Works good so far my girl is loving it;:) she loves curling her hair with it and it is long lasting curls</li>
            <li> It works great but on my hair it falls out sometimes if you don&#x27;t hold the curl long enough , other than that it is a good curling wand with all the barrels to choose from !</li>
            <li> Im a professional stylist and love it.</li>
            <li> Worth your money.</li>
            <li> Worth $250</li>
            <li> I just love doing my hair so perfect for different hair styles and for also short or long hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited about all the new possibilities!</li>
            <li> it has lower temperature settings than any wand I have ever used, which I really love because some irons have a default of much higher heat than what is actually needed... but it also gets very hot for users that like the higher heat settings.  </li>
            <li> Must be very carful as it do get very hot.</li>
            <li> this curling wand heats really fast and is very hot.  </li>
            <li> Must Have , It Heats Up Very Fast</li>
            <li> It heats very fast</li>
            <li> I love the different barrel sizes and it gets hot super fast.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, so it takes a little while to do, but turnout is great! :)</li>
            <li> everyone wants me to curl their hair!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m starting to use it more.</li>
            <li> It works so well and got to my house really fast!</li>
            <li> I love the different options.</li>
            <li> The love the different sizes and variety they give.</li>
            <li> Works great and curls stay in long lasting!</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li> This item broke within the first month of use.</li>
            <li> I like that there are many different sizes</li>
            <li> unfortunately, i never got the chance.</li>
            <li> but it also came with instructions, booklet of products by the company if interested AND a heat glove as well.</li>
            <li> they get really hot</li>
            <li> Love the interchangeable settings so I can create different looks with one wand!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m starting to use it more.</li>
            <li> I loved how fast the shipping was(it was shipped and delivered to my door in less than 12 hours</li>
            <li> While this curling wand is great due to the pretty color and different sizes of barrels, I have to question the quality.  </li>
            <li> so i could easily try out different curls with an all-in-one kit.</li>
            <li> Also, the attachments were not at all easy to plug in or get back out!!</li>
            <li> very well waves come out awessome!!love</li>
            <li> With this iron it stays, no frizz, and very shiny.</li>
            <li> cause it gives me time to go to the bathroom before I start curling haha</li>
            <li> Heats up fast too</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> but you get curls in 3 seconds and it heats up really fast.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast.</li>
            <li> It was more than what I had expected.</li>
            <li> The heat resistant glove really works well.  </li>
            <li> My curls lasted a whole week.</li>
            <li> I have tried over 20 different curling wands and this is by far my favorite set.</li>
            <li> It gets super hot, so it actually works.  </li>
            <li> I was excited about the options of the sizes, and only one cord.</li>
            <li> The disconnect function of the barrels is a bit difficult, but overall I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
            <li> So decent shipping time.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It makes such pretty curls and heats up in no time!</li>
            <li> Absolutely everything your looking for curls natural hair as well as weave temperature reaches 410 and you will burn your hand, arm etc.</li>
            <li> When I opened it, it looked new.</li>
            <li> When I opened it, it looked new.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my other daughter, same quality and priced much better.</li>
            <li> I like the different wand sizes but after the first couple of weeks it started taking longer and longer to get to max temp.</li>
            <li> The glove was a bit big for my hand, but was grateful for that for the first week.</li>
            <li> The wands get hot and curl but curls don&#x27;t last at all !!!</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;ll better the same brand of what I have and get bigger or smaller ones</li>
            <li> Most products now days are a minute or less, it just took same time to get use to it.</li>
            <li> The extra size barrels are a real plus.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the use of hair styling products, they either don&#x27;t hold or don&#x27;t feel natural.</li>
            <li> old.</li>
            <li> I recently got a long bob and have not been able to achieve the soft curled look that I was after with any other iron...</li>
            <li> the only con is that it is hard to clip on, also there is times where you won&#x27;t be able to change the sizes because it won&#x27;t clip out</li>
            <li> I can do big loose curls or cute little ones.</li>
            <li> Im surprised no one else in the review section hasn&#x27;t had the same problem.</li>
            <li> The wands broke and barely work</li>
            <li> For my 11 year old daughter...after several attempts of getting aggravated she FINALLY figured it out.  </li>
            <li> This curling Iron heats fast and secures and holds for a long lasting curl all day long.</li>
            <li> It takes some serious strength  and manipulating to get it to fit properly.  </li>
            <li> and I love how I can have tight small curls vs big wavy curls.</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair</li>
            <li> I have used this on my daughter who had long hair, the hair curls right away and stays curled until the next day with little or no hairspray</li>
            <li> I knew that the outlets worked because I had just used them minutes before with my other new irons.</li>
            <li> Paid too much for such little use of this product...</li>
            <li> Definitely use the glove that it came with and maybe a long sleeve shirt</li>
            <li> Hold without hair spray, the clipless lasted about 15 to 30 minutes before my hair was flat.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was, the curling barrels had a little scratch mark on each of them near the handle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see this lasting very long.  </li>
            <li> Currently trying different hair sprays for the hold I&#x27;m looking for with a feel I can deal with.emp button, but you have to press them several times up or down to change the settings.</li>
            <li> I plugged it in (in front of my client) and the light in the window displayed &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; but i was unable to get it to turn &amp;#34;on&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Big problem, it wasn&#x27;t PINK.</li>
            <li> but I keep my babies near , so they wont go missing</li>
            <li> I always had trouble curling my hair before because it took forever and by the time I was done with the second half of my head the first half was flat.</li>
            <li> It make my hair so dry</li>
            <li> The John Frieda lasted about the same from root to about 2\\&quot; from tip, a few hours at the tip only.</li>
            <li> Big let down, had to return it.</li>
            <li> you hold down the &amp;#34;+&amp;#34; and it switches back and forth depending on what you would prefer.  </li>
            <li> I have bumped the temp button, but you have to press them several times up or down to change the settings.</li>
            <li> Curling my hair was hard because it&#x27;s so thick and straight, but no matter what, ten seconds on these rods</li>
            <li> the fact that is pink as well</li>
            <li> PINK IRONS PINK GLOVES!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame due to the money spent.  </li>
            <li> But That&#x27;s Why It Comes With A Pink Glove !</li>
            <li> and i would def recomend this to other ppl.</li>
            <li> It work extremely well.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s PINK!</li>
            <li> You can have every type of hairstyle you want from loose waves to tight curls.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the barrels are hard to get back out</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars because it has an irritating learning curve and it takes a long time to curl all my massive hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just going to keep using my other ones !</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to switch the wand to the different sizes</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was, the curling barrels are a little hard to change.</li>
            <li> Just not worth the trouble at all.</li>
            <li> I have really thick long hair</li>
            <li> It bothered me a little bit</li>
            <li> she uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> Bought for a Christmas gift and after just three months of moderate use already broken  </li>
            <li> After reading a few reviews I decided to buy this wand curler.</li>
            <li> Everyday</li>
            <li> She uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> The barrels do not fit in the handle attachment at all.  </li>
            <li> I got it in a few days no problems.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not easy to store because of the size...</li>
            <li> I did have a hard time putting the different sized wands on the base and you will get an error signal if it gets loose from the base but other than that i love my wand</li>
            <li> It usually takes about 4-5 mins when setting the temp to 400 degrees.</li>
            <li> i give this a 4 because the barrels are really hard to get a part and exchange them out.</li>
            <li> The barrels are hard to get off and replace</li>
            <li> but you must becareful it&#x27;s hard to hold the hair on without burning yourself.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s a little frustrating.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I received the package and it was black instead of pink.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just not good for the hair.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> NOT A GOOD PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get me wrong...</li>
            <li> Very poorly made.</li>
            <li> With a sad look of disappointment on mine and my clients face, i realized it was a bust.  </li>
            <li> The oven glove may be awkward, but being burnt hurts for hours.</li>
            <li> Bad ,bad conditions it came already use and dirty and broken!!!</li>
            <li> Disappointed with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> daughter extremely disappointed</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> It damaged my hair and I am so upset :(</li>
            <li> boo!&#x3D;(</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s very disappointing if they would of all worked would have gave 5 ‚òÜ</li>
            <li> but it is very difficult to change the barrels!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and upset with this product, and I hope it begins to work eventually.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> It is the worst wand I have ever had!</li>
            <li> VERY UNHAPPY WITH PURCHASE!!</li>

            <li> Best value for your money with this 5 in 1 curling wand. I have used this on my daughter who had long hair, the hair curls right away and stays curled until the next day with little or no hairspray it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> I love the different barrel sizes and it gets hot super fast. Only problem is one of the barrels stop working one month after I bought it</li>
            <li> I love my wonderful irons ! everyone wants me to curl their hair! but I keep my babies near , so they wont go missing</li>
            <li> Amazing hair curler  üòçüíó</li>
            <li> First of all this company is great. My curling iron came within almost 3 days. As soon as I ordered this product, it shipped immediately. When I opened it, it looked new. I&#x27;ve used it once but it did a great job and I&#x27;m starting to use it more. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was, the curling barrels had a little scratch mark on each of them near the handle. It bothered me a little bit but I would all of them are like that besides mine. Overall this product is great!</li>
            <li> Theses Wand curling iron are the BOMB! I love them ! Great purchase !</li>
            <li> I love this iron! It works so well and got to my house really fast! Everything was perfect! And the curls came out great!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get my curling iron in the mail and try it out. Took it out of the box and tried to attached one of the wands... aaand it didnt even fit onto the handle. Tried another wand and that one wouldnt detatch from the handle! It took both my husband and I to pull the wand off the handle. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to ANYONE. So disappointed. Im surprised no one else in the review section hasn&#x27;t had the same problem. Very poorly made.</li>
            <li> This Curling Wand Is A Must Have , It Heats Up Very Fast &amp; It Does It&#x27;s Job . I&#x27;ve Messed Around With Different Barrels &amp; They Give Outstanding Curls . What I Love About This Wand Is It Gives You The Option To Select The Temperature For Different Hair Types . Definitely Recommend This Product .</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair and this gives me awesome, shiny, bouncy curls that stay in no time. I always had trouble curling my hair before because it took forever and by the time I was done with the second half of my head the first half was flat. With this iron it stays, no frizz, and very shiny. I love the different options. I can do big loose curls or cute little ones. I&#x27;m so excited about all the new possibilities!</li>
            <li> I love this set!!! The love the different sizes and variety they give. I love the color. I loved how fast the shipping was(it was shipped and delivered to my door in less than 12 hours I kid you not). I have tried over 20 different curling wands and this is by far my favorite set. Only thing I have to say is that it takes awhile to heat up but I honestly don&#x27;t mind cause it gives me time to go to the bathroom before I start curling haha</li>
            <li> After reading a few reviews I decided to buy this wand curler. I did have a hard time putting the different sized wands on the base and you will get an error signal if it gets loose from the base but other than that i love my wand and i always get compliments whenever i use it! Heats up quickly also</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I received the package and it was black instead of pink. Otherwise, works fine and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It is the worst wand I have ever had! It make my hair so dry and I will return it. It damaged my hair and I am so upset :(</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this and uses it multiple times every week.  Great set for price.</li>
            <li> Fantastic wand!! Would recommend it to anyone!! Love it! Works great and curls stay in long lasting! Heats up fast too</li>
            <li> Love it! Sizes I wanted to do different curls or waves! I just love doing my hair so perfect for different hair styles and for also short or long hair</li>
            <li> AMAZING ! Everything About This Product Was Just PERFECT! EXTREMELY FAST SHIPPING! CAME WITHIN 2 DAYS OF ORDERING ! It&#x27;s Been About A Month Since Receiving And It&#x27;s Perfectly Fine!  I Don&#x27;t Use It Everyday But When I Do The Curls Are Amazing! It Does Leave A Mark If You Accidently Burn Yourself But That&#x27;s Why It Comes With A Pink Glove !PINK IRONS PINK GLOVES!  PERFECTION!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year now and I absolutely love it. With a little bit of hairspray curls come out perfect with all the barrel sizes. You can have every type of hairstyle you want from loose waves to tight curls. It heats up really quickly too. Just beware that it can also burn you just as easily too. Definitely use the glove that it came with and maybe a long sleeve shirt so you don&#x27;t end up with a scar on the inside of your forearm like me.</li>
            <li> Birthday present.  +1 Happy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even get the 5 pieces that come with the curler. I was so upset because I was really excited to try my curler out. who sends an incomplete set!!!</li>
            <li> This item broke within the first month of use.</li>
            <li> I only got two uses out of it and it broke.</li>
            <li> They arrived right away and they&#x27;re perfect!</li>
            <li> Love this iron so much!! I can get so many different styles just off of one product, and it&#x27;s easy to use and read!! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I like that there are many different sizes but it is very difficult to change the barrels! Sometimes they read error messages, so I have to keep restarting them.&lt;br /&gt;*** After, using this wand for a while! It is not of good quality! The wands broke and barely work and you have to keep turning it off and on to even get it to heat up sometimes. Just not worth the trouble at all. I would rather just buy the different sizes. NOT A GOOD PRODUCT!!! VERY UNHAPPY WITH PURCHASE!!</li>
            <li> i give this a 4 because the barrels are really hard to get a part and exchange them out. i have to have my brother pull while i push on the button. the glove doesnt work at all its like a regular winter glove. but you get curls in 3 seconds and it heats up really fast. you  can choose your temp.  over all its the best hair curler i have had.</li>
            <li> Wish I had seen this before I bought another set at the mall.  I purchased this for my other daughter, same quality and priced much better.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Does everything I want it to do and curls last forever. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5, is it takes patience while it heats up. Most products now days are a minute or less, it just took same time to get use to it. It usually takes about 4-5 mins when setting the temp to 400 degrees.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this curling iron.  Our stylist recommended this model and we couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Even a hair-challenged mom like me can put ringlets in our daughter&#x27;s hair.  It&#x27;s fun and easy to work with.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! My hair is thick, so it takes a little while to do, but turnout is great! :)</li>
            <li> Great for the money. Im a professional stylist and love it.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast. Does a great job at curling and gives you a lot of options. The barrels are hard to get off and replace</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my granddaughter. She used it and said she loved it. Her hair was curled just the way she wanted.</li>
            <li> I received my Curling Wand yesterday and I ordered it on November 1st. So decent shipping time. Opened it up wasn&#x27;t thrilled, the black liner was banged up and torn, I wasn&#x27;t to happy about it. But when I started using the wand it worked WONDERFUL. Beautiful curls! I curled all of my hair looked beautiful then slept with it curly and woke up still looking great! I&#x27;m very happy with it! I suggest getting it! I love that it comes with 5 barrels that make amazing curls! Just love it!</li>
            <li> i love the options. be prepared to get burned with or without the glove, but beauty is pain, SO DEAL WITH IT. :)</li>
            <li> I got this iron set for christmas and was extremely excited, as I love curling my hair. I ran back to my room and put one of the barrels on and plugged it in and- NOTHING. I tried all the outlets in my room and all the different barrels. I knew that the outlets worked because I had just used them minutes before with my other new irons. I am very disappointed and upset with this product, and I hope it begins to work eventually.</li>
            <li> Works good so far my girl is loving it;:) she loves curling her hair with it and it is long lasting curls</li>
            <li> Absolutely everything your looking for curls natural hair as well as weave temperature reaches 410 and you will burn your hand, arm etc. Soo use the glove that comes with it for awhile!</li>
            <li> This was a great find and reminds me why I love Amazon.  It gets super hot, so it actually works.  It also has temperature settings which is really nice.  My daughter was home for the weekend and was amazed by this nice set.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a cosmetologist and was looking for a curling iron just like this so i could easily try out different curls with an all-in-one kit. unfortunately, i never got the chance. I was super excited to get it to the salon and try it out.  I plugged it in (in front of my client) and the light in the window displayed &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; but i was unable to get it to turn &amp;#34;on&amp;#34;.  I hit the +/- tabs several times, checked all my outlets, plugged it in to different outlets...still nothing.  Also, the attachments were not at all easy to plug in or get back out!! With a sad look of disappointment on mine and my clients face, i realized it was a bust.  Big let down, had to return it.</li>
            <li> Bad ,bad conditions it came already use and dirty and broken!!! some parts lose and didn&#x27;t work at all! boo!&#x3D;(</li>
            <li> Great purchase! I have really thick long hair and I love how I can have tight small curls vs big wavy curls. Great buy for a great price!</li>
            <li> This product is perfect. It was more than what I had expected. I thought I would only receive the curlers but it also came with instructions, booklet of products by the company if interested AND a heat glove as well. I am very satisfied!</li>
            <li> This is a great deal on a great item! It gives me so many options to be able to do my hair!</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair and this puts a good curl into it.  I have a lot of curling irons but like this one is one of the better ones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works great had it for a yr now but when I purchased it the biggest wand didn&#x27;t work and that&#x27;s very disappointing if they would of all worked would have gave 5 ‚òÜ</li>
            <li> Works well! I like the different wand sizes but after the first couple of weeks it started taking longer and longer to get to max temp. I haven&#x27;t been able to get it to the max temp since after the first couple of uses so that&#x27;s a little frustrating. But over all it works well with my hair and extensions!</li>
            <li> works good :) heats up fast. gets the job done :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been working great the only con is that it is hard to clip on, also there is times where you won&#x27;t be able to change the sizes because it won&#x27;t clip out</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this and she just loves it!! She uses it everyday. Heats up quickly but you must becareful it&#x27;s hard to hold the hair on without burning yourself.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE my curling irons!! they work wonders but be warned....they get really hot so use the glove that came with them or you will burn tf out of yourself!!!</li>
            <li> Great curling iron! Love it! Makes beautiful curls! Recommend it to eveyone.&lt;br /&gt;.... ..... ..... .... .... .... .... .... .... ....</li>
            <li> It works very good. Love it</li>
            <li> I have bought several curling wands and have plenty of heat tools, but when I saw the versatility of this set, I decided to order it.  It is amazing!  I used it the first night and the curls are perfect... I recently got a long bob and have not been able to achieve the soft curled look that I was after with any other iron... and I finally have it!  Best purchase I have made for my hair... the product does default to Celsius and I did have to google how to switch it to Fahrenheit (couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in the packaging)... you hold down the &amp;#34;+&amp;#34; and it switches back and forth depending on what you would prefer.  The only thing that I wish it had was a travel case... don&#x27;t get me wrong... the packaging is really nice, but it is a HUGE box... and it&#x27;s not easy to store because of the size... I am trying to find a multi compartment case that I can put all the attachments into so that they are able to be stored better without getting scratched up, instead of the giant box. The heat setting options are great... it has lower temperature settings than any wand I have ever used, which I really love because some irons have a default of much higher heat than what is actually needed... but it also gets very hot for users that like the higher heat settings.  Great Product!</li>
            <li> While this curling wand is great due to the pretty color and different sizes of barrels, I have to question the quality.  It just isn&#x27;t there.  When you pay good money for something, you expect a great product.  The barrels do not fit in the handle attachment at all.  It takes some serious strength  and manipulating to get it to fit properly.  The handle is light cheap plastic. I don&#x27;t see this lasting very long.  It&#x27;s a shame due to the money spent.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> My new curling iron works great. The extra size barrels are a real plus. I now only need one curling iron but still have the convenience of different size barrels for different looks.</li>
            <li> This wand is great it curls my hair fast n is very easy to use. It is a little hard to switch the wand to the different sizes but overall im happy with my purchase. The price was a steal and i would def recomend this to other ppl.</li>
            <li> I am going to start with background information. I have waist length, fine hair with chin length bangs. I don&#x27;t like the use of hair styling products, they either don&#x27;t hold or don&#x27;t feel natural. I read tons of reviews, and a lot of them stated this will hold without the need for hair spray. Now to my experience. I was excited about the options of the sizes, and only one cord. I have played with them all. I have now owned mine for over two months. Lesson one I had to learn was how to wrap my hair around the curling iron to were I didn&#x27;t have to hold it. Holding my hair to the iron would eventually start burning my fingers. The glove was a bit big for my hand, but was grateful for that for the first week. It would curl my hair in about 20seconds all the way to the roots. During the week I decided to try a John Frieda clipped curling iron to compare the two. I was honestly wondering if I wanted to keep trying with a clipless. The John Frieda took over a minute to get the same type of curl. So time was in favor of the clipless. Hold without hair spray, the clipless lasted about 15 to 30 minutes before my hair was flat. The John Frieda lasted about the same from root to about 2\\&quot; from tip, a few hours at the tip only. I ended up purchasing an oven glove until I learned how to tuck my hair under itself to hold it on. I have burnt myself several times by the tip pulling my hair off, keep aloe nearby. I would say this is not meant for short hair, if you have short hair invest in a heavy-duty oven glove to save your hand. The oven glove may be awkward, but being burnt hurts for hours. The heat up time is awesome for all but the largest barrel, which I did expect. The smaller ones are heated within a minute or two. The largest can take up to several minutes. I have experienced a glitch with them to were you have to tell it the heat temp a second time. It does show that it is heating, and at what temp it is currently. It is a press and hold for on and off. I have bumped the temp button, but you have to press them several times up or down to change the settings. I have to say overall, I like this a lot. Currently trying different hair sprays for the hold I&#x27;m looking for with a feel I can deal with.emp button, but you have to press them several times up or down to change the settings. I have to say overall, I like this a lot. Currently trying different hair sprays for the hold I&#x27;m looking for with a feel I can deal with.</li>
            <li> Very good curling wand! I am a Paul Mitchell Graduate. This curling Iron heats fast and secures and holds for a long lasting curl all day long.</li>
            <li> best curling wand I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I&#x27;ve had this product for a year now and it still works fantastic. Love the interchangeable settings so I can create different looks with one wand! Easy to use overall fantastic product!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been great, but sometimes it stops heating up.</li>
            <li> In love with this set! It heats up in 30 seconds, gets very hot so the glove really comes in handy. My curls last all days!! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Be forewarned...this curling wand heats really fast and is very hot.  It work extremely well.  Curls stay in all day.  Makes hair shiny and silky.  The heat resistant glove really works well.  Very good quality.  I am very impressed with professional quality.  Warning...do not let your skin touch the heated part if the wand...you will receive burns.  Even if its a tiny touch...be prepared to make the statement &amp;#34; that&#x27;s gonna leave a mark&amp;#34; because it does!</li>
            <li> The wands get hot and curl but curls don&#x27;t last at all !!! I&#x27;m just going to keep using my other ones ! Worked fine to me. Guess I&#x27;ll better the same brand of what I have and get bigger or smaller ones</li>
            <li> My curling iron came within almost 3 days. As soon as I ordered this product, it shipped immediately. When I opened it, it looked new. I&#x27;ve used it once but it did a great job and I&#x27;m starting to use it more. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was, the curling barrels are a little hard to change. Overall this product is great</li>
            <li> Great curling iron! I absolutely love it. The barrels all give very different styles. Sometimes the barrels are hard to get back out but it is possible and its not a big deal. The packaging was amazing and the shipping took no time at all. Very happy with my purchase! Worth your money.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!! It makes such pretty curls and heats up in no time! The only downside is I burned myself but I wasnt using the glove that comes with it! Would definitely recommend to a friend!</li>
            <li> I went back and forth for a while on if I could trust a curling wand this cheap (compared to CHI for example) and have been very pleased.  Heats well, interchangeable barrels are an awesome perk.  Awesome product.  And it&#x27;s PINK!</li>
            <li> loveeeeeeeeee my curly wand , got it a day before it was suppose to get here . my curls look beautiful</li>
            <li> Its a great product and the price is awesome!!! I might order another one for my niece...</li>
            <li> These curling rods are the best thing I&#x27;ve bought. They heat up fast, are simple to change out, and always provide me with perfect curls. Curling my hair was hard because it&#x27;s so thick and straight, but no matter what, ten seconds on these rods and i have a perfectly curled strand.</li>
            <li> Bought for 12 yr. old. there was no instructions with it. She&#x27;s not quite sure how to use it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful! Arrived quickly and details matched item perfectly!</li>
            <li> I love it! It&#x27;s the best! I got it in a few days no problems. It was a gift for daughter and she loves it! It heats very fast it&#x27;s wonderful great time saver! Thank you</li>
            <li> way cheaper than the company price. they work well and heat fast!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for 2 months and so far I love it!  I only used the 32mm barrel and my hair stayed curly throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Love this cause I can make different size cruls. Shipping was great.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE! So amazing. Worth $250 and I would pay even more than what I bought them for any day.</li>
            <li> AWESOME service &amp; delivery. Purchased as a last minute Christmas gift for my daughter. She has already styled her hair and looks lovely. Gift came on time as promised!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I loooove this curling wand. Very easy to use and I like that u can change the temp. My curls lasted a whole week. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the glove that came with it</li>
