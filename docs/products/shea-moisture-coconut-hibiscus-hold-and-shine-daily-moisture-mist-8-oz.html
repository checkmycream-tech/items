            <li>Sta Sof Fro is good for afros and curly styles alike.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, too.</li>
            <li>Giving this three stars because I haven&#x27;t quite figured out what it&#x27;s good for.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t put my finger on it, but when I use this product I always have a good hair day.  </li>

            <li>Perfect For Natural Hair!</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and wonderful and my hairstylist is giving me made compliments about my hair.</li>
            <li>Have ordered more for my daughter&#x27;s curly hair &amp; my own hair.</li>
            <li>This product encourages my hair to wave and curl more, plus it leaves a nice sheen in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Excellent for natural hair styles.</li>
            <li>-yes I said by golly-my hair felt better.  </li>
            <li>is behaving a lot better now, as well.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s organic</li>
            <li>This product was okay for me.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t pay more than that online.</li>
            <li>I love shea moisture product and this one is one of my fave</li>
            <li>I do mostly wash and gos because I have a twa.</li>
            <li>next best results&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>Excellent for Type 4, Coarse, kinky hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s most comparable to [[ASIN:B000S08FPY LOTTABODY</li>
            <li>I would not use it for \\&quot;refreshing curls\\&quot; because it does build up quite a bit that way.      </li>
            <li>I love love love this stuff</li>
            <li>(I try to wash my hair every 2-3 days, and with this it&#x27;s always every 2nd), but it&#x27;s still the best spray I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>, I love their baby products and body lotion.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>This is one of my all time favorite products</li>
            <li>I am thinking of trying the curling gel and maybe giving the spray that is supposed to thicken the hair but for now, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>Smells lovely :)</li>
            <li>I really love Shea Moisture Hold and Shine Moisture Mist.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this moisture mist.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps this works better on someone with a looser curl pattern, but this didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li>It did leave my hair a bit softer, and I liked the fragrance, a light coconut (non chemical) smell.</li>
            <li>I have been layering on top of my wash and go styling product</li>
            <li>The hold is better than it&#x27;s moisturizing ability.</li>
            <li>I love Shea moisture</li>
            <li>Love the smell and this stuff is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years on my 4a-b hair and love it.</li>
            <li>I started using this product and doing more protective hairstyles like buns or just making sure the ends of my hair was tucked away since they were still so damaged/dry.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that I don&#x27;t have any split ends since using this because it seals the cuticles with the healthy oils.</li>
            <li>This is the next best way to use the product, and the best way on dry hair.</li>
            <li>This spray is perfect for dry curly hair.  </li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If available, this product is best purchased locally.</li>
            <li>and I am happy that they are all natural.</li>
            <li>Great product for natural hair</li>
            <li>Loving these products right now.</li>
            <li>Great for refreshing curls the next day.</li>
            <li>With a lot of work it looks curly, but it doesn&#x27;t stick easily.  </li>
            <li>Especially relaxed hair women because this is the answer to having chemically compromised hair that needs a great serum for keeping it as healthy as possible.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and clean.. and healthy.</li>
            <li>The Shea Moisture Mist is my latest lucky find.  </li>
            <li>I have relaxed colored hair and it definitely did a great job helping my hair stay moisturized and holding my \\&quot;curls.\\</li>
            <li>The spray is light, not greasy, and dries without crunch.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and works really well as a heat-protectant mist because of the protein.</li>
            <li>It smells really great, and I recommend it to anyone who wants a natural product to keep your hair healthy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and leaves my hair bouncy.</li>
            <li>It is light weight, smells amazing, and keeps my hair soft and manageable all day long without any reapplying which is great for me because I&#x27;m not a hair person.</li>
            <li>So far Im loving this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading several good reviews.</li>
            <li>It truely defined my twist outs.</li>
            <li>gives your hair a nice sheen and soft feel</li>
            <li>I noticed this product really helps moisturize my ends to keep it shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I thought it might weigh my hair down as most moisture sprays do, but surprisingly, this didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I use this on my fine and straight hair to keep it neat, instead of using a light hairspray.</li>
            <li>It seems as if it would be a good product for flat ironing and blow drying, too.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for the second and third day curl refresher.  </li>
            <li>Great for braids, less breakage when you take the braids out.</li>
            <li>My hair is straight, fine but chemically damaged.  </li>
            <li>They make a fine product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>If you shop carefully you can find it for a good price.  </li>
            <li>I just received this product and I love the moisture and soft texture</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant, soft, and sweet smelling(contains Japanese Honeysuckle).</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>This spray has really helped me with staying on top of moisturizing my new growth to prevent breakage.</li>
            <li>I think it works best when my hair is wet, on dry hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pleasant smelling and it tames her fuzzy, coat without that heavy, greasy look.</li>
            <li>Would probably look for something else first.  </li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s refreshed and ready to go in minutes!</li>
            <li>Try it, you will be pleased (especially if you are natural).&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I want a real curly do I pin curl each twist!</li>
            <li>I actually like this product better as a flat-iron spray than as a curl enhancer.</li>
            <li>Just know, the first ingredient is water, but I don&#x27;t think it will revert the hair.  </li>
            <li>While on vacation with a girlfriend recently, she let me try her bottle of Shea Moisture Hold &amp; Shine Moisture Mist, and I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I love it and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>This product is made by a small, minority owned family business that believes in fair trade, sustainability and natural cruelty free products.</li>
            <li>Once I have used all of this product up, however, I will not be re-buying it because I have a found another flat iron product that works better and is cheaper.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than both IMHO because it leaves far less crunch and more shine.  </li>
            <li>My hair looked and felt nice and soft initially, but became progressively crispy as the day wore on.  </li>
            <li>It took me 6 months of no bleach, minimal heat styling, and good hair products with natural ingredients, like this one, to grow and maintain my hair length.</li>
            <li>(This is rare, since I&#x27;m highly allergic to scents/smells).    </li>
            <li>and it is so soft and full.  </li>
            <li>find, Sta Sof Fro comb out spray is still the best on the market for lasting shine, lasting softness, and lasting moisture in natural hair.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair super shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>Great on natural hair, long and short.</li>
            <li>I gave this as a gift to my daughter and daughter-in-laws - we all live in different climates and all love it.</li>
            <li>and I spray it on in the morning and use a little gel and the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li>This will stay on my hair until it really dissipates.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>I use it in conjunction with the Shea Moisture Smoothie, which leaves my hair very moisturized</li>
            <li>It absolutely met and exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>This seller is doing something very dishonorable by tripling the price of their product and pocketing the difference.</li>
            <li>Also,  I saw it at Target for a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li>I really did not buy this for the hold</li>
            <li>so I cannot speak much on its ability to hold styles.</li>
            <li>As if anyone wants to walk around with milk or pudding in their hair.</li>
            <li>I really think it&#x27;s because of this.</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real winner.</li>
            <li>Loveee it very moisturizing</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and calm.  </li>
            <li>In the mornings, I use oil to keep my hair from becoming dry..</li>
            <li>I also have very porous hair, which means it tends to dry quicker even with moisturizers and it is brittle to the point where it breaks easily.</li>
            <li>It smells absolutely divine; is very light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my curls down.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t leave a review, but I felt that this product deserved one!</li>
            <li>for days&lt;br /&gt;2) on dry hair, after I blow-dried my hair, light spray and style (could use with restorative conditioning</li>
            <li>I mainly used it to refresh my styles in the morning.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend it, but not for use with the Curls Botanical gel (I got mine from Target).</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to all curly head girls.</li>
            <li>and my hair is not thick.</li>
            <li>I used it like the directions say, on wet hair after the shower and my hair feels fabulous.</li>
            <li>My hair is now right above my breast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve long since given up on traditional shine products, as they add shine, but my hair gets really frizzy with all that silicone because it&#x27;s too smooth to grip.</li>
            <li>Due to the way it moisturizes throughout the day and makes my hair more manageable, while giving just enough hold to still have plenty of bounce and movement, I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I discovered the curling smoothie first and this second.</li>
            <li>Not an easy combination to deal with everyday.  </li>
            <li>This product absorbs into the hair and leaves a light oil sheen, without the greasy buildup, but the sheen doesn&#x27;t last long on my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>on dry hair, style and light stray mist-- felt a little heavy but effective</li>
            <li>Smells nice, works ok bit a little to expensive.  </li>
            <li>I am African-American and trying to transition my hair from relaxer to natural.</li>
            <li>Once I spray this mist on my hair, it feels hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>This product is an unexpected keeper.</li>
            <li>Setting Lotion Professional Concentrated Formula 8oz/236ml]] setting lotion or [[ASIN:B000TBXVIS Motions At Home Foaming Wrap Lotion]].  </li>
            <li>was told by a hair care professional that products with a holding aspect contain alcohol.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair soooo soft</li>
            <li>So I get a soft, poofy mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>far, this product seems to add moisture, shine without taking away the curls.  </li>
            <li>But I like that it is an all natural product.  </li>
            <li>I will probably buy this spray again but look elsewhere for a natural hairspray.</li>
            <li>My hair curls softly with no frizz and the cowlicks disappear.  </li>
            <li>I used it,and so did my 7 and 10 year old.</li>
            <li>Use it on my afro and it keeps it so soft.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair soft and moisturized without it being oily.i have been using it to hold curly styles while my hair is in transition from relaxed to natural.</li>
            <li>on natural or straightened</li>
            <li>this adds to my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product for damaged/dry/brittle hair to actually treat hair, instead of coating it with silicone and alcohols that only dry out hair more.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff to spritz on my dry hair in the morning to fluff it back up</li>
            <li>routine so far is to apply it dry hair and smooth my hair down.  </li>
            <li>Added much softness to my dry hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only negative may be the smell, which I love, but some may not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, I look really young for my age and natural hair made me look even younger.</li>
            <li>also noticed a major reduction in hair loss.</li>
            <li>I spritz small sections of my hair with this product and apply Carol&#x27;s Daughter Healthy Hair Butter before twisting then air dry overnight.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but worth it for results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a small bottle, and when you spray it on -- it&#x27;s like a light oil (with silk proteins and shea butter mixed inside).</li>
            <li>My hair has some natural wave, but sometimes not enough in the places I want it.  </li>
            <li>It takes layers of different products to get my hair in professional order for the day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product many times and never experienced this.</li>
            <li>I used the spray on my first day twist out, and it gave it a slight shine.</li>
            <li>What I really like about this product is that you can spray a lot and your hair will never get greasy like how other \\&quot;shine\\&quot; sprays do.</li>
            <li>first sprayed it on dry hair that had been styled earlier in the day and the waves came back instantly.</li>
            <li>My curly hair loves the natural products from this company but this shady seller is tripling the real price.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re lazy and don&#x27;t feel like using cream moisturizer just spray this in every few hours and done :-)  </li>
            <li>With too much moisture it dissolves into a poofy mess.  </li>

            <li> Very impressed</li>
            <li> Smooths and shines my hair so awesomely!</li>
            <li> For curly styles, it&#x27;s best used after shampooing/conditioning, before applying custards, gel, puddings or cremes.</li>
            <li> Awesome Product!</li>
            <li> This is the best thing since sliced bread.  </li>

            <li> mist is great though.  </li>
            <li> Great shine, like I&#x27;d sprayed on a hair gloss.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it has a great scent and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for twist-outs, rod-sets and my wash and gos with great results.  </li>
            <li> It is also great for smoothing your fly-aways around your hairline when you wear updos and puffs or headbands.  </li>
            <li> Great for making your hair neat in ponytails, too.</li>
            <li> I experienced crispness.  </li>
            <li> I still experienced crispness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> Works great and does not make my hair look greasy.  </li>

            <li> Great product, great value.  </li>
            <li> It tames the frizz and is great for use with a flatiron (again, tames the fly</li>
            <li> Smells great too.</li>
            <li> LOL).</li>
            <li> Great</li>

            <li> I love the smell and the sheen, very good product.</li>
            <li> And it smells sooooo good -- almost like a citrus candy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite good.</li>
            <li> and I am good to go.  </li>
            <li> Sta Sof Fro is good for afros and curly styles alike.  </li>
            <li> Smells good, too.</li>
            <li> Giving this three stars because I haven&#x27;t quite figured out what it&#x27;s good for.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t put my finger on it, but when I use this product I always have a good hair day.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a nice product at a good price.  </li>
            <li> I love both products!</li>
            <li> Love the scent!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> It is a huge bottle for the amount you pay, a win.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> great leaves my hair feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> but it is nice</li>
            <li> but it does help with frizz, and smells really nice.</li>

            <li> I love love love love love this spray!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> Perfect For Natural Hair!</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and wonderful and my hairstylist is giving me made compliments about my hair.</li>
            <li> Have ordered more for my daughter&#x27;s curly hair &amp; my own hair.</li>
            <li> This product encourages my hair to wave and curl more, plus it leaves a nice sheen in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Excellent for natural hair styles.</li>
            <li> -yes I said by golly-my hair felt better.  </li>
            <li> is behaving a lot better now, as well.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s organic</li>
            <li> This product was okay for me.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t pay more than that online.</li>
            <li> I love shea moisture product and this one is one of my fave</li>
            <li> I do mostly wash and gos because I have a twa.</li>
            <li> next best results&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> Excellent for Type 4, Coarse, kinky hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s most comparable to [[ASIN:B000S08FPY LOTTABODY</li>
            <li> I would not use it for \\&quot;refreshing curls\\&quot; because it does build up quite a bit that way.      </li>
            <li> I love love love this stuff</li>
            <li> (I try to wash my hair every 2-3 days, and with this it&#x27;s always every 2nd), but it&#x27;s still the best spray I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> , I love their baby products and body lotion.  </li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> This is one of my all time favorite products</li>
            <li> I am thinking of trying the curling gel and maybe giving the spray that is supposed to thicken the hair but for now, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely :)</li>
            <li> I really love Shea Moisture Hold and Shine Moisture Mist.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this moisture mist.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps this works better on someone with a looser curl pattern, but this didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> It did leave my hair a bit softer, and I liked the fragrance, a light coconut (non chemical) smell.</li>
            <li> I have been layering on top of my wash and go styling product</li>
            <li> The hold is better than it&#x27;s moisturizing ability.</li>
            <li> I love Shea moisture</li>
            <li> Love the smell and this stuff is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years on my 4a-b hair and love it.</li>
            <li> I started using this product and doing more protective hairstyles like buns or just making sure the ends of my hair was tucked away since they were still so damaged/dry.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that I don&#x27;t have any split ends since using this because it seals the cuticles with the healthy oils.</li>
            <li> This is the next best way to use the product, and the best way on dry hair.</li>
            <li> This spray is perfect for dry curly hair.  </li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If available, this product is best purchased locally.</li>
            <li> and I am happy that they are all natural.</li>
            <li> Great product for natural hair</li>
            <li> Loving these products right now.</li>
            <li> Great for refreshing curls the next day.</li>
            <li> With a lot of work it looks curly, but it doesn&#x27;t stick easily.  </li>
            <li> Especially relaxed hair women because this is the answer to having chemically compromised hair that needs a great serum for keeping it as healthy as possible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and clean.. and healthy.</li>
            <li> The Shea Moisture Mist is my latest lucky find.  </li>
            <li> I have relaxed colored hair and it definitely did a great job helping my hair stay moisturized and holding my \\&quot;curls.\\</li>
            <li> The spray is light, not greasy, and dries without crunch.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and works really well as a heat-protectant mist because of the protein.</li>
            <li> It smells really great, and I recommend it to anyone who wants a natural product to keep your hair healthy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and leaves my hair bouncy.</li>
            <li> It is light weight, smells amazing, and keeps my hair soft and manageable all day long without any reapplying which is great for me because I&#x27;m not a hair person.</li>
            <li> So far Im loving this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading several good reviews.</li>
            <li> It truely defined my twist outs.</li>
            <li> gives your hair a nice sheen and soft feel</li>
            <li> I noticed this product really helps moisturize my ends to keep it shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I thought it might weigh my hair down as most moisture sprays do, but surprisingly, this didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I use this on my fine and straight hair to keep it neat, instead of using a light hairspray.</li>
            <li> It seems as if it would be a good product for flat ironing and blow drying, too.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for the second and third day curl refresher.  </li>
            <li> Great for braids, less breakage when you take the braids out.</li>
            <li> My hair is straight, fine but chemically damaged.  </li>
            <li> They make a fine product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> If you shop carefully you can find it for a good price.  </li>
            <li> I just received this product and I love the moisture and soft texture</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant, soft, and sweet smelling(contains Japanese Honeysuckle).</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> This spray has really helped me with staying on top of moisturizing my new growth to prevent breakage.</li>
            <li> I think it works best when my hair is wet, on dry hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pleasant smelling and it tames her fuzzy, coat without that heavy, greasy look.</li>
            <li> Would probably look for something else first.  </li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s refreshed and ready to go in minutes!</li>
            <li> Try it, you will be pleased (especially if you are natural).&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I want a real curly do I pin curl each twist!</li>
            <li> I actually like this product better as a flat-iron spray than as a curl enhancer.</li>
            <li> Just know, the first ingredient is water, but I don&#x27;t think it will revert the hair.  </li>
            <li> While on vacation with a girlfriend recently, she let me try her bottle of Shea Moisture Hold &amp; Shine Moisture Mist, and I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I love it and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product is made by a small, minority owned family business that believes in fair trade, sustainability and natural cruelty free products.</li>
            <li> Once I have used all of this product up, however, I will not be re-buying it because I have a found another flat iron product that works better and is cheaper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than both IMHO because it leaves far less crunch and more shine.  </li>
            <li> My hair looked and felt nice and soft initially, but became progressively crispy as the day wore on.  </li>
            <li> It took me 6 months of no bleach, minimal heat styling, and good hair products with natural ingredients, like this one, to grow and maintain my hair length.</li>
            <li> (This is rare, since I&#x27;m highly allergic to scents/smells).    </li>
            <li> and it is so soft and full.  </li>
            <li> find, Sta Sof Fro comb out spray is still the best on the market for lasting shine, lasting softness, and lasting moisture in natural hair.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair super shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Great on natural hair, long and short.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift to my daughter and daughter-in-laws - we all live in different climates and all love it.</li>
            <li> and I spray it on in the morning and use a little gel and the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li> This will stay on my hair until it really dissipates.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with the Shea Moisture Smoothie, which leaves my hair very moisturized</li>
            <li> It absolutely met and exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> This seller is doing something very dishonorable by tripling the price of their product and pocketing the difference.</li>
            <li> Also,  I saw it at Target for a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> I really did not buy this for the hold</li>
            <li> so I cannot speak much on its ability to hold styles.</li>
            <li> As if anyone wants to walk around with milk or pudding in their hair.</li>
            <li> I really think it&#x27;s because of this.</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real winner.</li>
            <li> Loveee it very moisturizing</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and calm.  </li>
            <li> In the mornings, I use oil to keep my hair from becoming dry..</li>
            <li> I also have very porous hair, which means it tends to dry quicker even with moisturizers and it is brittle to the point where it breaks easily.</li>
            <li> It smells absolutely divine; is very light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my curls down.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t leave a review, but I felt that this product deserved one!</li>
            <li> for days&lt;br /&gt;2) on dry hair, after I blow-dried my hair, light spray and style (could use with restorative conditioning</li>
            <li> I mainly used it to refresh my styles in the morning.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend it, but not for use with the Curls Botanical gel (I got mine from Target).</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to all curly head girls.</li>
            <li> and my hair is not thick.</li>
            <li> I used it like the directions say, on wet hair after the shower and my hair feels fabulous.</li>
            <li> My hair is now right above my breast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long since given up on traditional shine products, as they add shine, but my hair gets really frizzy with all that silicone because it&#x27;s too smooth to grip.</li>
            <li> Due to the way it moisturizes throughout the day and makes my hair more manageable, while giving just enough hold to still have plenty of bounce and movement, I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I discovered the curling smoothie first and this second.</li>
            <li> Not an easy combination to deal with everyday.  </li>
            <li> This product absorbs into the hair and leaves a light oil sheen, without the greasy buildup, but the sheen doesn&#x27;t last long on my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> on dry hair, style and light stray mist-- felt a little heavy but effective</li>
            <li> Smells nice, works ok bit a little to expensive.  </li>
            <li> I am African-American and trying to transition my hair from relaxer to natural.</li>
            <li> Once I spray this mist on my hair, it feels hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> This product is an unexpected keeper.</li>
            <li> Setting Lotion Professional Concentrated Formula 8oz/236ml]] setting lotion or [[ASIN:B000TBXVIS Motions At Home Foaming Wrap Lotion]].  </li>
            <li> was told by a hair care professional that products with a holding aspect contain alcohol.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair soooo soft</li>
            <li> So I get a soft, poofy mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> far, this product seems to add moisture, shine without taking away the curls.  </li>
            <li> But I like that it is an all natural product.  </li>
            <li> I will probably buy this spray again but look elsewhere for a natural hairspray.</li>
            <li> My hair curls softly with no frizz and the cowlicks disappear.  </li>
            <li> I used it,and so did my 7 and 10 year old.</li>
            <li> Use it on my afro and it keeps it so soft.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair soft and moisturized without it being oily.i have been using it to hold curly styles while my hair is in transition from relaxed to natural.</li>
            <li> on natural or straightened</li>
            <li> this adds to my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product for damaged/dry/brittle hair to actually treat hair, instead of coating it with silicone and alcohols that only dry out hair more.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff to spritz on my dry hair in the morning to fluff it back up</li>
            <li> routine so far is to apply it dry hair and smooth my hair down.  </li>
            <li> Added much softness to my dry hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only negative may be the smell, which I love, but some may not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, I look really young for my age and natural hair made me look even younger.</li>
            <li> also noticed a major reduction in hair loss.</li>
            <li> I spritz small sections of my hair with this product and apply Carol&#x27;s Daughter Healthy Hair Butter before twisting then air dry overnight.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but worth it for results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small bottle, and when you spray it on -- it&#x27;s like a light oil (with silk proteins and shea butter mixed inside).</li>
            <li> My hair has some natural wave, but sometimes not enough in the places I want it.  </li>
            <li> It takes layers of different products to get my hair in professional order for the day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product many times and never experienced this.</li>
            <li> I used the spray on my first day twist out, and it gave it a slight shine.</li>
            <li> What I really like about this product is that you can spray a lot and your hair will never get greasy like how other \\&quot;shine\\&quot; sprays do.</li>
            <li> first sprayed it on dry hair that had been styled earlier in the day and the waves came back instantly.</li>
            <li> My curly hair loves the natural products from this company but this shady seller is tripling the real price.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re lazy and don&#x27;t feel like using cream moisturizer just spray this in every few hours and done :-)  </li>
            <li> With too much moisture it dissolves into a poofy mess.  </li>
            <li> The curling smoothing makes it soft and my hair lays down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It left my hair straw dry.  </li>
            <li> I use  the Shea Moisture Coconut Hibiscus Hold and Shine Daily Moisture Mist both after cleaning my hair and in between when my twists start to lose shape and are getting dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly, so I don&#x27;t need the hold, but this isn&#x27;t a typical water based hair spray.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like giving your thirsty dry hair a big bottle of water.  </li>
            <li> This is the only thing I use in my hair on a daily basis, no scalp creams, puddings, souffles, milks, or any other item that has been named for food, why do they do that?</li>
            <li> I have coarse thick curly hair that I usually dry straight.</li>
            <li> stuff has helped my hair bounce back from rough days</li>
            <li> So when the other ingredients came I mixed this stuff together and used it and by golly</li>
            <li> /&gt;1) on wet hair, after I wash/condition my hair I sprayed it, blow dry, flat ironed &amp; style--</li>
            <li> When I went natural back in 2012 I had a hard time trying to get the comb to go through my hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick, yet weak at the same time, so this stuff is like magic for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will admit when after I wash and dry my hair</li>
            <li> my hair is straw dry.  </li>
            <li> I use it to keep my hair from getting dry when I wear it curly from a roller set or straw set, but it the oils in it tend to build up if you use it every day.</li>
            <li> I have always suffered from dry hair and now I have a regiment that works.</li>
            <li> on dry hair, spray hands, apply coin size of leave-in conditioner, rub mixture into hair by sections, blow dry, flat&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I then used the Hold and Shine Spray on Dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I have a &amp;#34;frizz zone&amp;#34; on my head and use this every time I wash and dry in that area.  </li>
            <li> and I always air dry it.</li>
            <li> use this every morning on dry hair before I comb through and style.</li>
            <li> My hair was fried, dry, and brittle.</li>
            <li> At one point I was trying this cream that came in a white and green tube and had a male on it!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was natural for about three years and recently went back due partly because I got bored with natural hair.</li>
            <li> and I used it every single day.</li>
            <li> If picked out while still wet, the hair will dry stretched.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the \\&quot;hold\\&quot; but it did give my hair a soft sheen.</li>
            <li> I have 4C extreme coils with extreme shrinkage and this stuff loosened my hair and softened it to where I could actually get a &#x27;comb&#x27; to go through it.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I&#x27;ve used the product on wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s more helpful with cutting down the frizz.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t used this product for very long and I have to use it with other product, I like how lightweight it is.</li>
            <li> My hair was getting harder and harder to comb</li>
            <li> When this dries all I do is get my hands wet and run my wet fingers through my hair reactivating these ingredients.  </li>
            <li> (heavy work out, sweating outside, etc).</li>
            <li> As for hold, not really.  </li>
            <li> Used it for dry/frizzy  hair, my hair is slightly wavy but dry</li>
            <li> it has a tendency to have my hair feel like heavy product instead of the lightness I feel when I apply it wet and then blow dry.</li>
            <li> With other ingredients and by itself.&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li> Usually used as a last misting to lock in the conditioner or curl enhancer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used a little bit of it with the restorative conditioning milk on dry hair.</li>
            <li> Basically, I sprayed it into my hands applied a small coin size amount of the conditioning milk, put on hair, and then flat ironed.</li>
            <li> Plus due to my 4c hair it was so hard to care for without constantly being all up in it!</li>
            <li> It does add a little moisture, but not much.</li>
            <li> I have thin, curly hair with wild cowlicks</li>
            <li> The results have garnered me compliments galore and everyone thinks II have gotten my thick hair back</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t way down my hair like any smoothing serum would.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I managed to find this at Walgreens for less than the online price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> works for black persons&#x27; hair.  </li>
            <li> I dyed it black</li>
            <li> It does weigh my hair down a little</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair, it is curly &amp; wavy</li>
            <li> This stuff is all natural, which is the only thing, besides that creamy crack relaxer, I use on my hair (we need to step away from petroleums, fake processed oils like mineral oil, and anything that is \\&quot;pink\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> It made my hair dry and dull when used as a refresher or even as a styler.</li>
            <li> I used a little water (for me, it always revives my 4a curlies).</li>
            <li> so I use a little bit of spray hair filler (Mane America) spritz with a little shine hair spray</li>
            <li> which was just a little below my chin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just stick with a little coconut oil after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> so I excluded some things and tried it on my hair for a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The amount of alcohol that is in the conditioners I use pays a heavy toll on my hair and always have eversince</li>
            <li> This is one of the few shine mist that doesn&#x27;t have dimethicone.  </li>
            <li> I use it as a finishing spray, after my hair has dried.</li>
            <li> I need to spritz every few hours, if I want a sustained sheen, and my hair isn&#x27;t all that dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your hair stays moisturized and shiny, never greasy or heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> I have been exclusively using Shea Moisture products for the past few months.</li>
            <li> I used it after using the Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner, followed by the Coconut and Hibiscus Curl and Style Milk.  </li>
            <li> I also used a little shea moisture coconut hibiscus hold and shine moisture spray -- this time, curls with no frizz!</li>
            <li> I trimmed 3/4 inches off of damaged hair, but my hair was so bad from the bleach that it didn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> I usually stretch my relaxer to 12 weeks.</li>
            <li> I added this spray a few weeks ago and I won&#x27;t ever be without it!</li>
            <li> I usually end up with a shiny neck by he end of the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian with thick wavy hair, which I unfortunately damaged by bleaching it.</li>
            <li> This spray keeps my hair moisturized through out the day and holds the curls in place without my hair getting hard or crunchy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have curly, thick hair.</li>
            <li> This is not a good product for me, because those aren&#x27;t my hair&#x27;s needs</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed and will likely not purchase from this brand again.</li>
            <li> I have thin curly hair.  </li>
            <li> so it could grow out without having that ugly dark roots/bleach hair look.</li>
            <li> Those items were expensive</li>
            <li> it was expensive</li>
            <li> It is way too expensive here.</li>
            <li> I use this during the day to fix random frizz moments.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> no.. too expensive.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin</li>
            <li> Watered down, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I didn&#x27;t have all of the ingredients and was desperate</li>
            <li> then became frustrated and took a break.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> When I went natural back in 2012 I had a hard time trying to get the comb to go through my hair.  I was trying different things.  At one point I was trying this cream that came in a white and green tube and had a male on it!!&lt;br /&gt;I then turned to Youtube and saw a lady with a moisturizing regime that called for about 14-15 items.  Those items were expensive so I excluded some things and tried it on my hair for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;It left my hair straw dry.  My hair doesn&#x27;t like oils.&lt;br /&gt;So I went to finding a moisturizing grease.  One Youtube video called for Murray&#x27;s Bees Wax and any type of oils of your choice.  I tried that for a week and that left my hair waxy.&lt;br /&gt;I then became frustrated and took a break.  My hair was getting harder and harder to comb and I needed something so I went back to Youtube and found a video on moisturizing spritz.  It was a 4 ingredient product and this coconut hibiscus mist was one of the ingredients.  Online it was expensive so I managed to find this at Walgreens for less than the online price.&lt;br /&gt;Since I didn&#x27;t have all of the ingredients and was desperate I tried this mist first.&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you I could&#x27;ve sworn I heard my hair sing!!  I have 4C extreme coils with extreme shrinkage and this stuff loosened my hair and softened it to where I could actually get a &#x27;comb&#x27; to go through it.  So when the other ingredients came I mixed this stuff together and used it and by golly-yes I said by golly-my hair felt better.  It was softer and easier to comb.  When this dries all I do is get my hands wet and run my wet fingers through my hair reactivating these ingredients.  This will stay on my hair until it really dissipates.&lt;br /&gt;Now I will admit when after I wash and dry my hair my hair is straw dry.  I have to put a lot of this mist in my hair and have to do so for several days until it gets saturated in my hair strands.&lt;br /&gt;The amount of alcohol that is in the conditioners I use pays a heavy toll on my hair and always have eversince I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;This mist is great though.  With other ingredients and by itself.&lt;br /&gt;From April 2012 till now I think I have gone through 10 bottles of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Excellent! I gave this as a gift to my daughter and daughter-in-laws - we all live in different climates and all love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian and shocker...I don&#x27;t have curly, thick hair. My hair is straight, fine but chemically damaged.  This stuff is awesome. I thought it might weigh my hair down as most moisture sprays do, but surprisingly, this didn&#x27;t. My hair actually felt fuller, thicker and it was swinging like silk, no joke. Great shine, like I&#x27;d sprayed on a hair gloss. The smell is divine. I use it on my daughter and her hair is behaving a lot better now, as well.  I love that it&#x27;s organic and it does what it says!</li>
            <li> This product was okay for me. I use it to keep my hair from getting dry when I wear it curly from a roller set or straw set, but it the oils in it tend to build up if you use it every day. I use it in conjunction with the Shea Moisture Smoothie, which leaves my hair very moisturized so I&#x27;m probably just overdoing it. On the plus side, it has a decent amount of hold (less than I would expect from a hairspray, but it keeps my style intact for the day) and it is moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have always suffered from dry hair and now I have a regiment that works. Loving these products right now. They are the best I have ever used on my hair and I am happy that they are all natural. I also have the stylin soufflé, smoothie, shampoo, and curl &amp; style milk.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t leave a review, but I felt that this product deserved one! I am African-American and trying to transition my hair from relaxer to natural. I discovered the curling smoothie first and this second. I love both products! Once I spray this mist on my hair, it feels hydrated and soft. The curling smoothing makes it soft and my hair lays down. These two products combined have made the transition process easier. Every time I feel like slapping a relaxer back in my hair for convenience sake, I just put in some of the curling smoothing and spray the moisture mist and I know that I can persevere! I use both products daily! They both cost $9.99 each at Target so don&#x27;t pay more than that online.</li>
            <li> I like it it takes awhile for it to work but it is nice</li>
            <li> This product is an unexpected keeper. I was looking for Kinky Kurly&#x27;s Knot Today at the store, and found this product instead. It&#x27;s a small bottle, and when you spray it on -- it&#x27;s like a light oil (with silk proteins and shea butter mixed inside). And it smells sooooo good -- almost like a citrus candy. And the best thing was the product&#x27;s scent didn&#x27;t cause me to have a headache or an allergic reaction by day&#x27;s end. (This is rare, since I&#x27;m highly allergic to scents/smells).    I used the spray on my first day twist out, and it gave it a slight shine. But, it&#x27;s more helpful with cutting down the frizz. Second day twist out -- I didn&#x27;t retwist it at night, and slept with a satin cap on. By the time I woke up-- the style was gone. I used a little water (for me, it always revives my 4a curlies). I also used a little shea moisture coconut hibiscus hold and shine moisture spray -- this time, curls with no frizz! It was wonderful. Someone even asked if I was using a \\&quot;curl\\&quot; definer that day.    Note: I don&#x27;t think that the shea moisture is a \\&quot;curl definer\\&quot; but it does help with frizz, and smells really nice. I will be buying this product again in the future.    INGREDIENTS: Deionized Water, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut Oil)\\&quot;, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter)* , Silk Protein, Essential Oil Blend, Melia Azadirachta (Neem) Seed Oil, Algae Extract, Hyssopus Officinalis Extract, Salvia Officinalius (Sage) Leaf and Equistem Arvense Extract, Lonicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower and Lonicera Japonica (Japanese Honeysuckle) Flower Extract , Tocopheral Vitamin E    *Certified Organic</li>
            <li> Smells nice, works ok bit a little to expensive.  Would probably look for something else first.  Used it for dry/frizzy  hair, my hair is slightly wavy but dry</li>
            <li> Watered down, very disappointed. I received the item the end of May but used it today. I&#x27;ve used this product many times and never experienced this.</li>
            <li> So far Im loving this moisturizer. I used it at the end of every styling and I love the smell and the way it helps my hair moisture!! I bought it just a week ago and I used it every single day. I love shea moisture product and this one is one of my fave</li>
            <li> This is the best curl definer and frizz deterrent I have tried. Not to mention it has a great scent and is not greasy. It absolutely met and exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I have 4b/4c low porosity hair. I do mostly wash and gos because I have a twa. I was looking for a product that could refresh my wash and go while providing shine and moisture. I bought this after reading several good reviews. It was a mistake. It made my hair dry and dull when used as a refresher or even as a styler. The only plus is that it does assist with curl/coil definition.</li>
            <li> a MUST for my AA girl&#x27;s curls. This and some argan oil and she&#x27;s refreshed and ready to go in minutes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve written a review for the restorative masque and the conditioning milk, so if I repeat some of my praise so be it. I have relaxed colored hair and it definitely did a great job helping my hair stay moisturized and holding my \\&quot;curls.\\&quot; I&#x27;ve used the product on wet and dry hair. I think it works best when my hair is wet, on dry hair it has a tendency to have my hair feel like heavy product instead of the lightness I feel when I apply it wet and then blow dry. I&#x27;ve also used a little bit of it with the restorative conditioning milk on dry hair. Basically, I sprayed it into my hands applied a small coin size amount of the conditioning milk, put on hair, and then flat ironed. This is the next best way to use the product, and the best way on dry hair. So uses,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) on wet hair, after I wash/condition my hair I sprayed it, blow dry, flat ironed &amp; style-- wonderful results, lasted&lt;br /&gt;  for days&lt;br /&gt;2) on dry hair, after I blow-dried my hair, light spray and style (could use with restorative conditioning milk)-- least&lt;br /&gt;  effective for me&lt;br /&gt;3) on dry hair, spray hands, apply coin size of leave-in conditioner, rub mixture into hair by sections, blow dry, flat&lt;br /&gt;  iron &amp; style-- next best results&lt;br /&gt;4) on dry hair, style and light stray mist-- felt a little heavy but effective&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff has helped my hair bounce back from rough days (heavy work out, sweating outside, etc). My hair feels soft and wonderful and my hairstylist is giving me made compliments about my hair.</li>
            <li> Great price an quality! Smells heavenly.</li>
            <li> Excellent for Type 4, Coarse, kinky hair.  Try it, you will be pleased (especially if you are natural).&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are a plus and your hair will simply soak it all in.</li>
            <li> This spray is perfect for dry curly hair.  If you&#x27;re lazy and don&#x27;t feel like using cream moisturizer just spray this in every few hours and done :-)  I switched to an easier to use bottle that I bought from target.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  It&#x27;s most comparable to [[ASIN:B000S08FPY LOTTABODY Setting Lotion Professional Concentrated Formula 8oz/236ml]] setting lotion or [[ASIN:B000TBXVIS Motions At Home Foaming Wrap Lotion]].  It&#x27;s better than both IMHO because it leaves far less crunch and more shine.  I like the protein--silk and algae.  It makes my curls, curlier.   I&#x27;ve used it for twist-outs, rod-sets and my wash and gos with great results.  It is also great for smoothing your fly-aways around your hairline when you wear updos and puffs or headbands.  Just brush it in.  Great for making your hair neat in ponytails, too. I would not use it for \\&quot;refreshing curls\\&quot; because it does build up quite a bit that way.      DeionizedWater, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut)Oil*, ButyrospermumParkii(SheaButter)*, Silk Protein, Essential Oil Blend, Melia Azadirachta (Neem)SeedOil, Algae Extract, Hyssopus Officinalis Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage)Leaf and Equisetum Arvense Extract, Lonicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle)Flower (and )Lonicera Japonica (Japanese Honeysuckle) FlowerExtract, Tocopherol (VitaminE).</li>
            <li> Great for refreshing curls the next day.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product along with the curl and hold smoothie. I mainly used it to refresh my styles in the morning. I&#x27;m not sure about the \\&quot;hold\\&quot; but it did give my hair a soft sheen.</li>
            <li> I have used the Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus Hold and Shine Spray several times, and in several ways. I used it after using the Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner, followed by the Coconut and Hibiscus Curl and Style Milk.  My hair looked and felt nice and soft initially, but became progressively crispy as the day wore on.  I then used the Hold and Shine Spray on Dry hair.  I experienced crispness.  I then used it after spraying my hair with water to loosen the curl and to add some moisture.  I still experienced crispness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told by a hair care professional that products with a holding aspect contain alcohol.  I can&#x27;t seem to find evidence of alcohol in this product, unless I am over-looking something.  I simply think that it is the coconut that isn&#x27;t agreeing with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice product at a good price.  It just may not be what my hair needs.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my sister but she likes it</li>
            <li> Great product for natural hair</li>
            <li> I have curly frizzy hair and needed something to help with the frizz. I tried this and I absolutely love it!! I use it in combination with the Curls products. This spray keeps my hair moisturized through out the day and holds the curls in place without my hair getting hard or crunchy. I love love love this stuff and it smells soooo good!! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soooo soft like i literally get people to touch my hair lol but i don&#x27;t get defined curls</li>
            <li> I love this stuff to spritz on my dry hair in the morning to fluff it back up</li>
            <li> Found this through a Huffington Post article.  Works great and does not make my hair look greasy.  I have a &amp;#34;frizz zone&amp;#34; on my head and use this every time I wash and dry in that area.  Smells great too.</li>
            <li> Ooooh, how I wanted this to work miracles. It smells wonderful! It is a huge bottle for the amount you pay, a win. But for my hair it didn&#x27;t do a dang thing. I have long thick hair, it is curly &amp; wavy and I always air dry it. This did not help with frizz, it did not help with flyaway&#x27;s and it did nothing to help with shine. I was quite disappointed and will likely not purchase from this brand again.</li>
            <li> I use this on my fine and straight hair to keep it neat, instead of using a light hairspray. It&#x27;s quite good. It does weigh my hair down a little (I try to wash my hair every 2-3 days, and with this it&#x27;s always every 2nd), but it&#x27;s still the best spray I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> My curly hair loves the natural products from this company but this shady seller is tripling the real price. This product sells for around $10 at Walgreen&#x27;s, Target ( stores and online) and a variety of drugstores. This product is made by a small, minority owned family business that believes in fair trade, sustainability and natural cruelty free products. They make a fine product at a reasonable price. This seller is doing something very dishonorable by tripling the price of their product and pocketing the difference.</li>
            <li> I use this to refresh my morning hair. It&#x27;s the best...gives great shine and softness.</li>
            <li> I love this product for adding moisture and de-tangling!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long since given up on traditional shine products, as they add shine, but my hair gets really frizzy with all that silicone because it&#x27;s too smooth to grip. So I get a soft, poofy mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, this product seems to add moisture, shine without taking away the curls.  I don&#x27;t see the hold aspect of it.. Perhaps because it doesn&#x27;t separate a product already holding?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative may be the smell, which I love, but some may not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine so far is to apply it dry hair and smooth my hair down.  My hair is a 2a, I think.  With a lot of work it looks curly, but it doesn&#x27;t stick easily.  With too much moisture it dissolves into a poofy mess.  This helps it sustain that look.</li>
            <li> Smells great, does add moisture and shine.  As for hold, not really.  But I like that it is an all natural product.  I will definitely buy from this company again, I love their baby products and body lotion.  I will probably buy this spray again but look elsewhere for a natural hairspray.</li>
            <li> Smells great and keeps hair and scalp feeling good all day. I&#x27;ve bought it several times now and will continue using.</li>
            <li> Love the scent! The spray is light, not greasy, and dries without crunch. Keeps my curls curly.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. It makes my hair very soft and manageable. I did not have any residue.  Also,  I saw it at Target for a much cheaper price. So I will be buying it there. It is way too expensive here.</li>
            <li> Adds great shine and hold. I have 4b/4c and my hair is not thick. It truely defined my twist outs. Target $10.00.</li>
            <li> Great product, great value.  Delivered before date promised.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t used this product for very long and I have to use it with other product, I like how lightweight it is. It tames the frizz and is great for use with a flatiron (again, tames the fly aways).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend it, but not for use with the Curls Botanical gel (I got mine from Target). I believe the gel has straightened out my curls and made my hair feel gunky.</li>
            <li> I am a type 4b relaxed head. I usually stretch my relaxer to 12 weeks. This spray has really helped me with staying on top of moisturizing my new growth to prevent breakage. I really did not buy this for the hold so I cannot speak much on its ability to hold styles. I also use it to moisturize my daughter&#x27;s hair while its in individual braids.</li>
            <li> Please do not purchase this item. It does NOT do what it claims and it does not even have a smell to it.</li>
            <li> This is one of my all time favorite products and I have bought it multiple times. I have type 4B hair and twists out are the way I manage my hair. I use  the Shea Moisture Coconut Hibiscus Hold and Shine Daily Moisture Mist both after cleaning my hair and in between when my twists start to lose shape and are getting dry. I spritz small sections of my hair with this product and apply Carol&#x27;s Daughter Healthy Hair Butter before twisting then air dry overnight. I get great results every time! If I want a real curly do I pin curl each twist!</li>
            <li> I have used this for a couple of years now.  If you shop carefully you can find it for a good price.  I have thin, curly hair with wild cowlicks and I spray it on in the morning and use a little gel and the results are amazing.  My hair curls softly with no frizz and the cowlicks disappear.  My hair is very thin so I use a little bit of spray hair filler (Mane America) spritz with a little shine hair spray and I am good to go.  The results have garnered me compliments galore and everyone thinks II have gotten my thick hair back and it is so soft and full.  I am thinking of trying the curling gel and maybe giving the spray that is supposed to thicken the hair but for now, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I place in my hands and rub it on her coat.  It&#x27;s pleasant smelling and it tames her fuzzy, coat without that heavy, greasy look.</li>
            <li> I used it,and so did my 7 and 10 year old. Great on natural hair, long and short. Usually used as a last misting to lock in the conditioner or curl enhancer. Smells lovely :)</li>
            <li> I actually like this product better as a flat-iron spray than as a curl enhancer. It has a nice smell and works really well as a heat-protectant mist because of the protein. Once I have used all of this product up, however, I will not be re-buying it because I have a found another flat iron product that works better and is cheaper.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super shiny and soft. Very impressed</li>
            <li> I love love love love love this spray!!! I have coarse thick curly hair that I usually dry straight. I have been exclusively using Shea Moisture products for the past few months. I added this spray a few weeks ago and I won&#x27;t ever be without it! Smooths and shines my hair so awesomely!</li>
            <li> Helped save my swimmer&#x27;s hair after a summer at the beach and pool! Smells great too.</li>
            <li> gives your hair a nice sheen and soft feel</li>
            <li> Love this! Smells so good! I use this during the day to fix random frizz moments.</li>
            <li> This product adds a loft of shine but doesn&#x27;t add moisture. I usually end up with a shiny neck by he end of the day. Maybe because my hair has a very low porosity</li>
            <li> I really love Shea Moisture Hold and Shine Moisture Mist.  It is perfect for the second and third day curl refresher.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few shine mist that doesn&#x27;t have dimethicone.  This product absorbs into the hair and leaves a light oil sheen, without the greasy buildup, but the sheen doesn&#x27;t last long on my naturally curly hair. I purchased to add sheen to my hair.  I use it as a finishing spray, after my hair has dried. I need to spritz every few hours, if I want a sustained sheen, and my hair isn&#x27;t all that dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The scent is pleasant, soft, and sweet smelling(contains Japanese Honeysuckle). My hair is naturally curly, so I don&#x27;t need the hold, but this isn&#x27;t a typical water based hair spray. It doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers who relax their hair, like this product. Just know, the first ingredient is water, but I don&#x27;t think it will revert the hair.  It sprays out of the bottle in a \\&quot;fine\\&quot; mist. Immediately after spritzing, it leaves a moisturizing feel, but the hair doesn&#x27;t get \\&quot;wet\\&quot;. It seems as if it would be a good product for flat ironing and blow drying, too. This is lite. It won&#x27;t take body away from relaxed har.  This is not a good product for me, because those aren&#x27;t my hair&#x27;s needs right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If available, this product is best purchased locally. I paid 9 bucks for mine at Walgreens. This seller has built in delivery cost to their asking price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find, Sta Sof Fro comb out spray is still the best on the market for lasting shine, lasting softness, and lasting moisture in natural hair.  I would recommend that over this product in a heartbeat. Sta Sof Fro is good for afros and curly styles alike.  It also detangles curly and \\&quot;kinky appearing\\&quot; curly hair with----ease. For curly styles, it&#x27;s best used after shampooing/conditioning, before applying custards, gel, puddings or cremes. Afro wearers can use daily.  If picked out while still wet, the hair will dry stretched.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> Use it on my afro and it keeps it so soft. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have medium coarse curly hair. Unfortunately, this product doesn&#x27;t work for me. No refund!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. My hair is relaxed, 4c hair which even after being straightened tends to revert back to wavy/frizzy. This stuff is all natural, which is the only thing, besides that creamy crack relaxer, I use on my hair (we need to step away from petroleums, fake processed oils like mineral oil, and anything that is \\&quot;pink\\&quot;! LOL). I was natural for about three years and recently went back due partly because I got bored with natural hair. Also, I look really young for my age and natural hair made me look even younger. Plus due to my 4c hair it was so hard to care for without constantly being all up in it! I also have very porous hair, which means it tends to dry quicker even with moisturizers and it is brittle to the point where it breaks easily. It&#x27;s very thick, yet weak at the same time, so this stuff is like magic for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this every morning on dry hair before I comb through and style. It is light weight, smells amazing, and keeps my hair soft and manageable all day long without any reapplying which is great for me because I&#x27;m not a hair person. Meaning, once I leave in the morning I don&#x27;t find myself in the mirror checking it or have a comb or brush in my purse for mid day check ups! This is the only thing I use in my hair on a daily basis, no scalp creams, puddings, souffles, milks, or any other item that has been named for food, why do they do that? As if anyone wants to walk around with milk or pudding in their hair. REALLY!?!?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed a major reduction in hair loss. Before I would have a lot of hair in my comb, but now I literally get three maybe four strands and nothing on the back of my shirt as the day goes on. I really think it&#x27;s because of this. Due to the way it moisturizes throughout the day and makes my hair more manageable, while giving just enough hold to still have plenty of bounce and movement, I would highly recommend this to anyone. Especially relaxed hair women because this is the answer to having chemically compromised hair that needs a great serum for keeping it as healthy as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this moisture mist. It keeps my hair soft and moisturized without it being oily.i have been using it to hold curly styles while my hair is in transition from relaxed to natural. It has really made it going natural a lot easier for me because my hair is really thick. It smells really great, and I recommend it to anyone who wants a natural product to keep your hair healthy.</li>
            <li> works for black persons&#x27; hair.  on natural or straightened</li>
            <li> Love this product. Have ordered more for my daughter&#x27;s curly hair &amp; my own hair. Love the smell. It reminds me of the beach.</li>
            <li> I just received this product and I love the moisture and soft texture this adds to my natural hair. Will use daily</li>
            <li> Awesome Product! Perfect For Natural Hair! Fast Delivery, Just As Pictured And Described, Thank You</li>
            <li> While on vacation with a girlfriend recently, she let me try her bottle of Shea Moisture Hold &amp; Shine Moisture Mist, and I fell in love with it.  I ordered some as soon as I got home.  My hair has some natural wave, but sometimes not enough in the places I want it.  This product encourages my hair to wave and curl more, plus it leaves a nice sheen in my hair.  Smells good, too.</li>
            <li> Great but it will make your hair frizz.</li>
            <li> Hair type: 4c (natural)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair density: thin-med.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair diameter: fine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps this works better on someone with a looser curl pattern, but this didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I didn&#x27;t notice any additional shine, sheen, or hold. It did leave my hair a bit softer, and I liked the fragrance, a light coconut (non chemical) smell. I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I have thin curly hair.  Not an easy combination to deal with everyday.  It takes layers of different products to get my hair in professional order for the day.  The Shea Moisture Mist is my latest lucky find.  I spray it on instead of water to finish my hair in the morning.  It smells absolutely divine; is very light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my curls down. It also helps keep the frizzies away.  I would highly recommend this product to all curly head girls. It&#x27;s a real winner.</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells great leaves my hair feeling smooth. Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Excellent for natural hair styles. Adds shine hold and moisture as promised.  A little pricey but worth it for results.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the sheen, very good product.</li>
            <li> Giving this three stars because I haven&#x27;t quite figured out what it&#x27;s good for. It does not work well for me as a refresher-  all I get is frizz. I have been layering on top of my wash and go styling product but I can&#x27;t tell that it does anything for me. I also think the term &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; is infuriate - I was expecting something that would preserve my style but his doesn&#x27;t do anything like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with type 4a/4b hair. Very good product. Added much softness to my dry hair. Great for braids, less breakage when you take the braids out. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> It does add a little moisture, but not much. The hold is better than it&#x27;s moisturizing ability.</li>
            <li> Loveee it very moisturizing</li>
            <li> I love Shea moisture and I use this spray after every wash, before and after I style my hair every day. It smells amazing and works great!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and this stuff is not greasy at all. My hair soaks it up and loves it. Keeper</li>
            <li> This is the best thing since sliced bread.  My products come and go, but the Shea Moisture Hold &amp; Shine Moisture Mist is here to stay.  It leaves my hair soft and calm.  I can&#x27;t put my finger on it, but when I use this product I always have a good hair day.  I am in a bad mood when I&#x27;m out!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years on my 4a-b hair and love it. I use it every night when I retwist my hair for a twist out or when I wear double strand twists, I use for moisture at night. I find that I don&#x27;t need to use the curl enhancing smoothie every day because of this mist product. In the mornings, I use oil to keep my hair from becoming dry.. So shea moisture must at night, oil in the morning, with curl enhancing smoothie used maybe 1-2 times a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian with thick wavy hair, which I unfortunately damaged by bleaching it. My hair was fried, dry, and brittle. The ends would just break off by the inch. I decided to stop bleaching my hair and I stopped using heat tools on it too. I dyed it black so it could grow out without having that ugly dark roots/bleach hair look. I trimmed 3/4 inches off of damaged hair, but my hair was so bad from the bleach that it didn&#x27;t really matter. I just didn&#x27;t want to have a pixie cut so I worked with what I had left which was just a little below my chin. I started using this product and doing more protective hairstyles like buns or just making sure the ends of my hair was tucked away since they were still so damaged/dry. I noticed this product really helps moisturize my ends to keep it shiny and healthy looking. I also noticed that I don&#x27;t have any split ends since using this because it seals the cuticles with the healthy oils. What I really like about this product is that you can spray a lot and your hair will never get greasy like how other \\&quot;shine\\&quot; sprays do. Your hair stays moisturized and shiny, never greasy or heavy feeling. It&#x27;s light weight and leaves my hair bouncy. I definitely recommend this product for damaged/dry/brittle hair to actually treat hair, instead of coating it with silicone and alcohols that only dry out hair more. My hair is now right above my breast. It took me 6 months of no bleach, minimal heat styling, and good hair products with natural ingredients, like this one, to grow and maintain my hair length.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I saw the price tags in the store.. and thought.. no.. too expensive. I&#x27;ll just stick with a little coconut oil after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;But this stuff.. it&#x27;s a concentrated spray.. and it&#x27;s not oily at all! It doesn&#x27;t way down my hair like any smoothing serum would.&lt;br /&gt;I first sprayed it on dry hair that had been styled earlier in the day and the waves came back instantly. WITH TWO SPRAYS. It just.. picked up my hair and brought it back! I was shocked.&lt;br /&gt;Now I used it like the directions say, on wet hair after the shower and my hair feels fabulous. and clean.. and healthy. It&#x27;s like giving your thirsty dry hair a big bottle of water.  I love it and will definitely buy it again.</li>
