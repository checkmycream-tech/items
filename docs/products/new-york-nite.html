            <li>My son was thrilled.  </li>
            <li>Up date its a nice cologne</li>
            <li>But wow it smells great!</li>
            <li>I already got to make the sexy time cause</li>
            <li>Will buy again, looking for more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I love the smell of this perfume.</li>
            <li>When you spray this on yourself you get this overwhelming smell of alcohol.</li>
            <li>Most important, wife likes it.</li>
            <li>Not too strong</li>
            <li>for the price it&#x27;s more than worth it.</li>
            <li>Love the scent and we&#x27;ll worth it.</li>
            <li>To be fair, authentic Bleu De Chanel does the same though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>totally recommend it is very nice.</li>
            <li>Needs improvement on how long it lasts but great product.</li>
            <li>Good enough to keep for the $12 i paid for it.    </li>
            <li>then the seller is quick to replace it, my replacement came within 3 days.</li>
            <li>Smells very very close to the original.</li>
            <li>I got my eight dollars worth</li>
            <li>Well worth it</li>
            <li>the second and final phase are pretty incredible.</li>
            <li>I used Bleu de Chanel for about 3 years,so I am very familiar with its scent, and tried New York Nite as a much cheaper alternative.  </li>
            <li>Axe is better and longer lasting than this rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>Nothing like the real stuff!</li>
            <li>Now, on the other hand, on its own, it&#x27;s not bad as a cologne, but should not claim to have a scent similar to the original.  </li>
            <li>Very good stuff and a bit more expensive than the 5.99 I paid at Rite Aid which they only carried as a specialty item.</li>
            <li>It smells good but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li>smells like the real thing</li>
            <li>Delivered In A Very Timely Manner.</li>
            <li>While it does not smell like Chanel Blue it has a good fragrance, with a slight resemblance.</li>
            <li>The first phase is a tad on the alcohol strong side, but once it breaks down and wears some...</li>
            <li>Not bad at all, especially the price tag.</li>
            <li>Either the reviews were written by the New York Nite company as marketing, or the people never actually tried the original, either way, it is a decent cologne, but does not even come close to even the spirit of Bleu de Chanel.</li>
            <li>As much as this is a take/impression of Bleu De Chanel, New York Nite stands well on</li>
            <li>After about 5 to 10 minutes the overpowering alcohol smell will dissipate and you are left with a distinct scent similar to cool water.</li>
            <li>Bleu de chanel is easily one of the greatest signature scents out there, this impression while not smelling terrible, don&#x27;t come close.</li>
            <li>Really enjoy the smell of this, very similar to the blue.  </li>
            <li>The cologne is as described, it smells almost exactly the same as the Chanel version</li>
            <li>Not an exact version of bleu de chanel, but in the same vein.   </li>
            <li>on the other had I bought mine from &amp;#34;JD Reliant&amp;#34; and it was very well packed to protect it from breaking, and the shipping was lighting fast, just as fast as prime</li>
            <li>Cologne in general does not last long on my body so I dont notice much of a difference between the length of smell from this and the original.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last anywhere near the time the real stuff does.</li>
            <li>Does not smell anywhere near Bleu De Chanel.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, whereas with one spray of Blue De Chanel you&#x27;d be covered for the whole day, 2 or 3 sprays of New York Nite will give you the same effect.</li>
            <li>The opening is a bit harsh but it drys down nicely.  </li>
            <li>Just chalk out the money and buy big bottle of the original, as long as you don&#x27;t bathe in it, it should last you a few years and its worth every penny.</li>
            <li>your New York Nite - Chanel Bleu Impression.&lt;br /&gt;It was well packed, but when I open the box, the perfume had been spilled out all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;The perfume inside the bottle</li>
            <li>Its really the only way for me to get it to last  </li>
            <li>Did not really like the smell does not compare at all to the real chanel cologne.</li>
            <li>the only difference is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long, but what do you expect from a product that is a fraction of the price of the real Bleu De Chanel, reapplying is not a problem.</li>
            <li>Awesome, too bad it last only about couple hours possibly due to</li>
            <li>Sure it doesn&#x27;t last long, you have to apply it a little heavier than more expensive less alcohol(y) fragrances...</li>

            <li> A great substitute for Chanel Bleu</li>
            <li> My husband tried the chanel blue on a cruise we went on it was 109,00 a bottle, he used the sample bottle each day&lt;br /&gt;i said there is no way I am paying $109.00 for it so when we got home I went on line and found this and my husband&lt;br /&gt;is very happy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know it was an imitation.</li>
            <li> The cologne is as described, it smells almost exactly the same as the Chanel version the only difference is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long, but what do you expect from a product that is a fraction of the price of the real Bleu De Chanel, reapplying is not a problem. Mine came leaking but dont let that deter you away from this product, if my experience just so happens to be the same as yours then the seller is quick to replace it, my replacement came within 3 days. All in all it&#x27;s a fantastic cologne, smells wonderful and for the price you just cant beat it. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> Garbage, just got it today, smells nothing like bleu de chanel. Just chalk out the money and buy big bottle of the original, as long as you don&#x27;t bathe in it, it should last you a few years and its worth every penny. Bleu de chanel is easily one of the greatest signature scents out there, this impression while not smelling terrible, don&#x27;t come close. I&#x27;ve giving this away to my dad.</li>
            <li> While it does not smell like Chanel Blue it has a good fragrance, with a slight resemblance. It is on the lighter side so I apply a few sprays.  I got it for only a few bucks at big lots.</li>
            <li> It smells good but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  You could just use it each time you leave the house but if you&#x27;re gone all day it won&#x27;t last.  However, for the price I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> My product was nicely packaged and shipped. It arrived on time with nothing to complain about. The fragrance itself does resemble Bleu De Chanel and yes, of course it doesn&#x27;t last as long as Blue De Chanel does. Nonetheless, whereas with one spray of Blue De Chanel you&#x27;d be covered for the whole day, 2 or 3 sprays of New York Nite will give you the same effect. Not bad at all, especially the price tag.</li>
            <li> I got my eight dollars worth &amp; then some.  Works great!  I already got to make the sexy time cause i smell so good. Next purchase, clock radio.  My a hole neighbor can&#x27;t afford.  Very nice.</li>
            <li> Smells very very close to the original. I love it! I bought it for my fiance and he smells yummy.</li>
            <li> Good price.. Well worth it</li>
            <li> Did not really like the smell does not compare at all to the real chanel cologne. Husband did not like it either.</li>
            <li> Smells like Bleu De Chanel, but way cheaper than BDC. Lasts me all day with no funky smell changes. Will definitely continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> It met  our expectations.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy the smell of this, very similar to the blue.  Cologne in general does not last long on my body so I dont notice much of a difference between the length of smell from this and the original.  would buy again, good value.</li>
            <li> too long to receive for a expensive ship fee. After 1 hour the smell is gone....</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great! Needs improvement on how long it lasts but great product. Will buy again, looking for more.</li>
            <li> Smells great. A good bargain @ 10% of Chanel pricing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last after application. To be fair, authentic Bleu De Chanel does the same though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Delivered In A Very Timely Manner. Scent Smells Great, Although You Need To Spray Quite A Few Times For It To Last.&lt;br /&gt;All In All For The Price, Great Purchase...</li>
            <li> Awesome, too bad it last only about couple hours possibly due to my alkaline/pH skin  balance</li>
            <li> As much as this is a take/impression of Bleu De Chanel, New York Nite stands well on it&#x27;s own.  Sure it doesn&#x27;t last long, you have to apply it a little heavier than more expensive less alcohol(y) fragrances...But wow it smells great! The first phase is a tad on the alcohol strong side, but once it breaks down and wears some... the second and final phase are pretty incredible. for the price it&#x27;s more than worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bought your New York Nite - Chanel Bleu Impression.&lt;br /&gt;It was well packed, but when I open the box, the perfume had been spilled out all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;The perfume inside the bottle is only 25% left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I love the smell of this perfume. They offered me a replacement, so with theirs good customer service and great perfume, I will buy it again :)</li>
            <li> Terrible. Does not smell anywhere near Bleu De Chanel. Also, the tint on the glass bottle began to flake off and get everywhere. We ended up throwing it way.</li>
            <li> Excellent value for the price.  My son was thrilled.  He has been wearing it everyday !  Lot&#x27;s of compliments from all ages.</li>
            <li> Not good at all dont like it</li>
            <li> Not an exact version of bleu de chanel, but in the same vein.   Good enough to keep for the $12 i paid for it.    Longevity is the worst with this one.  Definately takes quiet a few sprays, to stay.  I usually go to town on the inside of my clothes with it. Its really the only way for me to get it to last  The opening is a bit harsh but it drys down nicely.  I have a love/hate with this one, but for $12 we can work it out.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come close to being an impression of Bleu de Chanel.  I used Bleu de Chanel for about 3 years,so I am very familiar with its scent, and tried New York Nite as a much cheaper alternative.  If you are looking for a close impression of it, this product isn&#x27;t it.  Now, on the other hand, on its own, it&#x27;s not bad as a cologne, but should not claim to have a scent similar to the original.  Either the reviews were written by the New York Nite company as marketing, or the people never actually tried the original, either way, it is a decent cologne, but does not even come close to even the spirit of Bleu de Chanel.</li>
            <li> Nothing like the real stuff!</li>
            <li> Smells great. Not too strong</li>
            <li> I did not like that smell,,,,,,,,never compare with the original,,,,,,,,,the product not meet my expectations</li>
            <li> Well I guess I&#x27;ll start at tge beginning. When you spray this on yourself you get this overwhelming smell of alcohol. After about 5 to 10 minutes the overpowering alcohol smell will dissipate and you are left with a distinct scent similar to cool water. That scent will last up to 2 hours and needs to be re applied. So if your going out for the night either load up on it (spraying your clothes) or bring the bottle with you. In no way should you expect this to smell like BLUE de Chanel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on the other had I bought mine from &amp;#34;JD Reliant&amp;#34; and it was very well packed to protect it from breaking, and the shipping was lighting fast, just as fast as prime (But it was not prime). Thank you.</li>
            <li> totally recommend it is very nice.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and we&#x27;ll worth it. Wife loves the smell.</li>
            <li> I got this today an I already know how it smells, some one I know has this so I said I gotta put this on my list. Up date its a nice cologne but does not last.</li>
