            <li>But my 14yr old doesn&#x27;t have long nails, so they are too big for her nails.  </li>

            <li> Too big for wh a t i needed for.</li>
            <li> Too big to fit our nailsto</li>
            <li> I do my own nails and love to bling them up and put unique and sometimes larger embellishments on them.&lt;br /&gt;However, Kitty is really big and the colors on her are a bit faded!&lt;br /&gt;You would have to have extra length of your nails to make it look decent.&lt;br /&gt;The bows, I LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;The color is bright and just as appears with shiny rhinestone.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this if you like having extra large embellishments on your nails.&lt;br /&gt;You could probably find the bows by themselves, but these are great!</li>
            <li> These are so cute and they r a great product and very great price! The shipping was reasonable since they came from Hong Kong. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> If you are considering getting these, get them! I love them and they are perfect for my nails. Suggestion: Use acrylic to apply them not just a top coat or nail glue.</li>
            <li> I like them a lot. They are the too big for average nails. I keep my nails quite long, so it works ok on mine. But my 14yr old doesn&#x27;t have long nails, so they are too big for her nails.  I ordered these for my daughter for her birthday. I did not realize that, they were coming from China.  So delivery time was almost a month.  All in all, I am happy because my daughter will use them for making things, just not on her nails.  Perfect for cell phones and I pods though.</li>
            <li> really love it sooooo much .... im gonna get more of these really soon ... n would definetly suggest all to buy it.</li>
            <li> Never got it and its been 3 months...  I contact seller and they practically beg me to rate them 5 star. I though it was a joke. The ones you don&#x27;t laugh about.. yeah!!! 1 star cause it doesn&#x27;t give me the option to leave it blank</li>
            <li> Very nice there was nothing; 20 bows and 20 hello kitty&#x27;s, I was pleased. Plus the seller is really nice too!</li>
