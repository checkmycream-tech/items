            <li>Good product.</li>

            <li>I tested mine with the head of an electric toothbrush, which fit the snap in holder perfectly.</li>
            <li>I feel good knowing that the unit eliminates up to 99.9 percent of molds, yeast, and bacteria, which can cause heart disease, infection, cavities, and gum disease.</li>
            <li>It serves as a good travel case for my toothbrush.</li>

            <li>I love my sanitizer and thank you for your efforts to educate me!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I truly love the products!</li>
            <li>We love this product!</li>
            <li>The Stericlean Sanitizer also comes with a one-year warranty, which I love!</li>
            <li>Love this product, burn the heck out of batteries, suggest rechargeable batteries!</li>
            <li>However, after using it, I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love them!  </li>
            <li>After all, a clean brushing routine leads to good health!</li>
            <li>Amazing product&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Then again it makes a GREAT night light.</li>
            <li>received this for review purposes, all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>All you need to do is use your own toothbrush and store it in this case.</li>
            <li>this Oral Stericlean UV Portable Toothbrush Sanitizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li>great size, solid piece and perfect for when i travel.</li>
            <li>The auto timer and shutoff ensures that the UV dose is effective, and also saves batteries.</li>
            <li>I did receive my Oral Stericlean at a reduced price for an honest opinion.</li>
            <li>Aside from that it seems nice and sturdy and has a sleek, unobtrusive build that fits nicely in the drawer.</li>
            <li>Liked The Idea</li>
            <li>I am entitled to my own opinion and can publish that opinion.</li>
            <li>I believe that, since your mouth germs grow so well in damp and warm conditions, that even if you protect your toothbrushes from contamination in the bathroom, that it will still act like an incubator for whatever germs are on it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so convenient and we feel great about not using chemicals on our toothbrushes to get them &#x27;clean&#x27; after each use.  </li>
            <li>I liked the product, but what good is it if the light wont come on??</li>
            <li>bought the travel unit to try out first and loved it!</li>
            <li>My brush is a bit shorter than the bottom clip so it doesn&#x27;t do much good for it, but the brush still fits fine with a bit of adjusting.</li>
            <li>This individual kind is the best kind to have rather than any of the others in my opinion, because of many reasons, and I am so glad I bought them!</li>
            <li>We already own the Duo size and love it.  </li>
            <li>This cleaner is so handy, I love it</li>
            <li>This product has a good concept however the Oral B circular electric tooth brush is a bit of a challenge to be in alignment with the UV light.</li>
            <li>Just the right size for my dop kit - and great for traveling anywhere, since it&#x27;s run by battery.</li>
            <li>do love how sleek and slim it is</li>
            <li>Most of these products can cost hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comforting to know this product helps my family stay healthy.</li>
            <li>Ordered two and received next day in perfect condition using Amazon Prime.  </li>
            <li>I love the compact design and ease of use.</li>
            <li>about 3 weeks so make sure you have rechargables.</li>
            <li>He didnt mention if his wife&#x27;s was ok, so I guess it is.</li>
            <li>But they stepped up and took care of everything and made it all ok.</li>
            <li>and I feel so much better knowing my toothbrush head is sanitized.</li>
            <li>I was always nervous about the fact that I probably take in more germs into my mouth when using my toothbrush rather than cleaning my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I received a review sample of the travel model I wanted to be able to verify or validate specs and product description claims.</li>
            <li>So it makes him very happy that he can feel that extra bit of safety.</li>
            <li>This will keep me feeling better about having a sanitized toothbrush.</li>
            <li>We absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I have the Duo and the Portable, outstanding products and quality.</li>
            <li>I also love the portability of this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure how it broke -  perhaps during baggage claim??  </li>
            <li>Glad I found this.  </li>
            <li>The thought of having so many unseen germs growing on one&#x27;s tooth brush with no solution.  </li>
            <li>After brushing my mouth feels better then it has.</li>
            <li>love this Oral SteriClean toothbrush sanitizer.</li>
            <li>I stay in many hotels and needed a dependable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>They were very nice to replace my first one that didnt want to work, and the replacement is still going strong.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>My brush seems to fit pretty great in it.</li>
            <li>You will never have to worry about where to store your toothbrush while traveling again, it will stay safe and clean with this!</li>
            <li>protects my toothbrush, makes sure i have a clean brush every use, and I can take it every where with me!</li>
            <li>Loved these so much that I re-ordered for all of my family members!  </li>
            <li>and I love the fact that I can easily take it with me when I&#x27;m traveling.</li>
            <li>Now I have no worries and know my brush is clean by using this sanitizer!</li>
            <li>After purchasing the SteriClean sanitizer, I was pleased how much more clean my toothbrush was.</li>
            <li>The holder doesn&#x27;t light up any more.</li>
            <li>This nifty device uses UV light which is a more efficient way of killing bacteria, viruses and germs.</li>
            <li>Works great so far...</li>
            <li>Seems to work great so far after you put 2 AAA batteries in.</li>
            <li>Time will tell how durable this product is, but so far so great.</li>
            <li>so I can feel safe and comfortable taking the brush into my mouth.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use, compact and most importantly, AFFORDABLE.</li>
            <li>It’s easy to use, easy to keep clean, very well constructed and is a very effective oral hygiene tool.</li>
            <li>and I only have good things to say about it!</li>
            <li>THEY ARE SO SWEET!</li>
            <li>Instructions are easily understood and unit is easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Oral Stericlean UV Portable Toothbrush Sanitizer is so easy to use</li>
            <li>and I can easily take it with my on vacation, to a friends house for the weekend, or just keep it on my bathroom counter to keep my toothbrush head sanitized day in and day out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use &amp; gives piece of mind.</li>
            <li>If ever anyone finds an easy fix, I hope it will get posted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to find in my carry on when I need it.</li>
            <li>It feels like my normal toothbrush and is really good at cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>So keeping my toothbrush 100% clean with the power of UV light is a must to keep my body healthy.</li>
            <li>Being a clean freak and  a bit of a germaphobe, it&#x27;s great to know that my toothbrush is completely sterilized every time I use it, bacteria free.</li>
            <li>I love that this portable sanitizer is lightweight yet does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do!</li>
            <li>We all have electric toothbrushes, and they all fit in the slots with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  </li>
            <li>The ultra light stopped working about a week of receiving it.</li>
            <li>Close the lid and the light comes on.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Through the six minute cycle of the UV light, it kills 99.9 percent of germs on your toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great if you are a big germaphobe like</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is fantastic for travel, at home, for your gym bag, for anytime use.</li>
            <li>If you want that peace of mind that you&#x27;re not having a toothbrush filled with germs, this is the product for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worked well for about 6 weeks, then the light stopped working.</li>
            <li>It would keep the UV light on until the batteries died, which was about 2hrs (instead of the</li>
            <li>I brush my teeth 2 times a day (once in the morning and once at night) and after each use I put my toothbrush in the portable sanitizer and the UV light lights up and sanitizes my brush which takes about 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact, easy to use and hopefully is keeping my brush sparkly clean</li>
            <li>The light turns on for</li>
            <li>Just brush your teeth, give your toothbrush a couple of shakes to get excess warer off, pop it into the sterilizer with bristles against the light, close it, the light comes on and sterilzes for 6 minutes, then turns itself off.</li>
            <li>After a week of use, the light started to not come on when I&#x27;d shut the unit, until I would thump it against the counter.</li>
            <li>The UV light cleans it and take away the germs</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and it works great!</li>
            <li>But it is attractive enough to leave out.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine 2 months &amp; it no longer stays closed--it has to close for the light to activate.</li>
            <li>And the company has a number of at-home designs available.</li>
            <li>The light shuts off to let you know that the sanitizing process is finished.</li>
            <li>Closing the lid turns on the uv light again as if it is sanitizing again.  </li>
            <li>Light Stays On And Drains Batteries.</li>
            <li>so I can attest to this fact that the UV light is not killing the bacteria.</li>
            <li>LOOKS GOOD SO FAR.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>For best results, leave at least 5 hours between usage to make sure you kill everything that was on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and it fits pretty much every toothbrush perfectly and after it is clean it feels like a brand new tooth brush.</li>
            <li>My brush and of course my teeth felt so clean and germ free like never before.</li>
            <li>It sanitizes and cleans my toothbrush with the SUV light and kills germs and bacteria and knowing that my family and I am using a clean toothbrush every time we brush</li>
            <li>Like advertised, it is very easy to use and it provides a very thorough cleaning process.</li>
            <li>ORIGINAL REVIEW:</li>
            <li>Excitedly received the oral stericlean but it never worked.</li>
            <li>I got more for my entire family and I would recommend the product for anyone who wants a great solution to keep their toothbrush clean.</li>
            <li>Very honest, ethical, and professional!    </li>
            <li>I just received my new Stericlean Sanitizer and I&#x27;m thrilled with the product.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a way to save some money on toothbrushes and ensure you have a clean toothbrush time after time?</li>
            <li>Most, if not all of us, keep our toothbrushes in the bathroom and as we flush our toilets, I can only imagine what kind of airborne bacteria or viruses circulate the air and land on it.</li>
            <li>Only good as a tooth brush holder now as the light will no longer come on.</li>
            <li>I have had a concern about my toothbrush being clean and this works find for me.</li>
            <li>I was always wondering how clean my toothbrush was just sitting in the batheroom or in a bag when I travel.</li>
            <li>Keeps my brush clean while it&#x27;s stored in my travel case for days/weeks</li>
            <li>Well with this system my teeth feel truly clean.</li>
            <li>I am a bit of a bacteria phobic personality, so I like to keep my toothbrush clean.</li>
            <li>I thought I was a healthy person, I eat healthy, exercise, but I was surprised to learn that the bacteria in my mouth attacked my heart.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve checked the outlets, made sure the port is secure into the back of the holder, ensured the top was securely fastened (it did have a tendency of unhinging if you took the brush out too</li>
            <li>I travel all the time and at first loved this product...until it COMPLETELY DIED on me after five months!</li>
            <li>Teaching them to just take better care of their things would have been the more responsible move, but just giving them two of these was certainly the easier one...</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li>and he really loves it not realizing how many germs are in our toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I took this on two trips recently and loved it.</li>
            <li>Cool product but Made in China.</li>
            <li>It works very well and I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>your company is very professional, my product arrived very quickly!</li>
            <li>This is so useful to bring with me when I go on vacation or on a trip and this cleans my toothbrush and makes sure that it is free of bacteria and germs that live on a toothbrush head.</li>
            <li>quickly)...</li>
            <li>Love the color of the case as blue is my favorite color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Regardless of gaps in the documentation, this is a well constructed unit that has nice features like a safety interlock to prevent the UV light from activating while the case is open and a practically watertight closure.</li>
            <li>As I get older I&#x27;m trying to become healthier in as many things as I can control.</li>
            <li>The seller wa quick to send a follow up email verifying satisfaction and confirming there support for the product.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrushes are covered while inside the device (upside down), so sink/toilet \\&quot;splatter\\&quot; opportunities are greatly reduced.</li>
            <li>hahatoothbrushes are covered while inside the device (upside down), so sink/toilet \\&quot;splatter\\&quot; opportunities are greatly reduced.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It stays pretty clean on its own, and it&#x27;s really simple to clean when it needs it.  </li>
            <li>I ended up throwing out the batteries for good and now wash the case and leave my brush head to air dry and &amp;#34;store&amp;#34; in the sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>If the UV light went the entire length along the brush instead of just at the bristle part, there&#x27;d be no mold problem, but it would cost a lot more, too.    </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had it near that magical \\&quot;four month mark\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Considering the benefits, it is definitely worth the cost.</li>
            <li>It cleans the toothbrush to pristine, wiping all the bacteria and things you definitely do not want on your toothbrush away in a nice fashion.</li>
            <li>it seems like I&#x27;m replacing the batteries often, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;Overall worth it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth having.</li>
            <li>I have always been very particular about keeping me and my husband&#x27;s toothbrushes clean and sanitized.</li>
            <li>just ordered this last week, and the first time I used it I felt so much better!</li>
            <li>Love it and that my toothbrush is kept clean during travel and sterilized following use.  </li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t sanitize it, I was horrified and decided I needed to invest in a sanitizer right away.</li>
            <li>this right BEFORE I brush, not after,</li>
            <li>I think using it right before brushing and air-drying it till then would solve those fishy-smell problems, as it has my mold problem.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>I use several ways to try to prevent this like dipping in mouth wash or washing my tooth brush with hydrogen peroxide but there nothing better  or effective then leaving them inside UV light to kill all the baddies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now use Oral Stericlean just as effective but takes less time and less energy for a better experience.</li>
            <li>This little beauty is amazing!</li>
            <li>I made sure to get as much moisture off the brush as possible before storing it, and the UV light did the rest.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to how effective the UV light is at killing bacteria and diminishing sickness as I have no true way of testing it.</li>
            <li>When the batteries are dying, it tends to take a bit of jiggling to get it to turn on, which is kind of a strange quirk.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Received a replacement, as the first wasn&#x27;t working right.  </li>
            <li>This brand certainly did not!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought one for my whole family!</li>
            <li>Once you feel the satisfaction of brushing your teeth with a sanitized toothbrush, you won&#x27;t be able to go back.</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>My husband travels frequently for work and has used one of those cheap drug store plastic cases for years, but it started to fall apart</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is supposed to do</li>
            <li>The item worked correctly exactly ONE time.</li>
            <li>When I told my son he could return his for a replacement, he said he wouldn&#x27;t need to, it had only done it the first time he used it and maybe 2-3 more times that week, but that it hadn&#x27;t done it since</li>
            <li>but it makes his time in the bathroom in the morning easier, and shorter since he can just flash this instead of spending 10 mins washing his brush in hot water.</li>
            <li>Worked for first day then hasn&#x27;t since.  </li>
            <li>If it didn&#x27;t break on the first day, I would be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is pretty neat that i can know it actuality works</li>
            <li>I was terrified, to think that I use a toothbrush to maintain dental hygiene and essentially I was allowing more bacteria to be spread.</li>
            <li>Thanks Guys!</li>
            <li>Most bacteria growth can be stopped or reduced with only 30 seconds of UV exposure.</li>
            <li>I since then went back and purchased the DUO (for my kids) and another  more Portables for the rest of the family for travel.  </li>
            <li>We have two portable units and a family unit and we definitely feel more of a sense of safety and cleanliness when we use our toothbrushes now.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I chose the portable travel version, and the case is sleek and stylish, light and small enough to fit in an overnight bag easily.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s doing its job, but find that replacing that two AAA batteries is more frequent, so will wait and see if it holds up as well as the Vio.</li>
            <li>I  definitely definitely recommend this toothbrush to anyone who needs a portable clean toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>Cheap Chinese made product, and non-functional right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>Knowing the risk of having your toothbrush exposed to bathroom elements on top of how dirty the human mouth is, piece of mind is priceless.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I&#x27;ve been using this product, I have felt better than I have in a long time.</li>
            <li>The first one I got only worked once, then the UV light would no longer illuminate, since the first day.</li>
            <li>This was a gift, so don&#x27;t really know how it works, but it was exactly what my daughter wanted.</li>
            <li>I travel a lot, an average of about 200,000 miles annually so this little portable toothbrush holder and cleaner is perfect!</li>
            <li>little machine works better!</li>
            <li>I took this with me on my last trip and it was easy and compact to bring along.</li>
            <li>The product is simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>You never know what kind of germs are hidden on your toothbrush so this product eases that feeling.</li>
            <li>Liked the idea of the UV sanitation, however it quit working after 2 and a half months.</li>
            <li>This item certainly does not justify its price.</li>
            <li>I am going to get a few more for the wife and kids, thank you again!</li>
            <li>I kept my toothbrush in a regular plastic sleeve holder for my first couple underways, but once I switched to this UV holder I noticed a significant difference in the lifespan of my toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried this particular brand of portable toothbrush sanitizer.</li>
            <li>This thing is a nice little device.</li>
            <li>After receiving the item and using it I was definitely wrong I have currently been using it for a few months now and put the light on at night before I go to bed, the light is still going strong and the product is of very good quality.</li>
            <li>These products are quite amazing starting at the low price of 19.95 USD.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until 2 days ago that the light will no longer turn on after putting the brush back in.</li>
            <li>It is an absolute NECESSITY for anyone out there, and I recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li>The second one I got would light up everytime</li>
            <li>This product is efficient and very well priced -</li>
            <li>Leave the toothbrush in there till ready to brush again.</li>
            <li>I am really pissed and feeling</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This item works very well.</li>
            <li>ordered for my husband and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews on this product, I decided to purchase the travel-size one because it was a reasonable price, it was portable for when I travel, and it sanitized my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The blue light comes on to let you know that it&#x27;s working, and stays on for 5-6 minutes.</li>
            <li>This is a very affordable, quality unit for the price paid.</li>
            <li>Absolute junk.  </li>
            <li>I think it really does help keep toothbrushes sanitary.</li>
            <li>It really really really works how is suppose to.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After days of using this toothbrush, I feel that the health status of my whole body has been improved one level.</li>
            <li>Great idea but poorly made.</li>
            <li>Now, if the UV light actually worked and did its job as advertized, that bacteria would never survive to produce a smell.</li>
            <li>really.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>This really helps sanitize my tooth brush.</li>
            <li>I tell everyone about Oral SteriClean, I really believe in their product line.</li>
            <li>and I would absolutely by these again</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>Works much better than my old one of a different style.</li>
            <li>At this point, I would prefer a rechargeable battery, but I&#x27;d still say it&#x27;s better than the other choices.</li>
            <li>It is such a relief to know that I have a product that can clean my toothbrush of all the disease and bacteria before I put it in my mouth and expose my body to the germs.</li>
            <li>but no one talks about the fact that toothbrushes can still be full of germs and bacteria when left in the bathroom not being protected or being sanitized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I will not use it again until time to get new toothbrushes!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful alternative to those expensive sanitizers and will help provide piece of mind next time you use your toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend anyone purchase a product that has so many customers indicating that these stopped working in such a short time frame.</li>
            <li>I have TREMENDOUS respect for this company for stepping in to let me know they&#x27;d help me, even though they could have gotten away with NOT helping me, as I thought that since my very short window-of-time for returns to the seller was over, that it could not be returned.</li>
            <li>I figured I would give it a try as it had decent reviews.</li>
            <li>So far it works amazingly, or at least I feel it&#x27;s doing a good job.  </li>
            <li>I owned a much more expensive toothbrush sanitizer that took up more room and began to fall apart</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I love this little unit.</li>
            <li>manufacturer has declared that they are taking \\&quot;legal action against me\\&quot; for posting this unfavorable review.</li>
            <li>SteriClean said if he has any more trouble out of it, they would take care of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also going to buy a normal brush holder (with splash</li>
            <li>I used it daily for my electronic toothbrush (Sonicare) and never really knew if it worked but feel good that it wasn&#x27;t in the open collecting all the germs from a bathroom.  </li>
            <li>As a result of the above review, I was directly contacted &amp; a replacement was sent quickly.</li>
            <li>Decided to buy even after reading mixed reviews and now I can say for myself that the reviews are right- all of them.</li>
            <li>The product is GREAT for the short period that it works - after about two weeks the light began to work only periodically and after about three weeks fails to work at all</li>
            <li>so it was time to buy something new.</li>
            <li>I tried new batteries, cleaned it, etc.</li>
            <li>I had to order a new one after three years of use.</li>
            <li>Received in new condition as promised, work well.</li>
            <li>The visible blue light lets me know that the sanitizer is on, about 7 minutes later it turns off.</li>
            <li>Once I reset the battery, the blue light would come on and only if I reset the battery EVERY TIME.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that they go through batteries fairly often.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say my toothbrush doesn&#x27;t seem to be breaking down as quickly as it has in the past since using this.</li>
            <li>I also tested a conventional toothbrush, which also fit.</li>
            <li>So I bought the portable family and now I have a place to clean and store my other dental tools.  </li>
            <li>You just really need to carefully follow usage instructions and you&#x27;ll find your toothbrush really sanitized!</li>
            <li>I have had four in the past, all of which shared the same manufacturer, a well-known and popular brand.</li>
            <li>So now I let it air-dry in the holder first, since it is a really long way from the toilet to my sink anyway, then I sterilize it right before I brush</li>
            <li>It was a nice small unit that I left near the sink and would pack for trips.  </li>
            <li>It worked a half dozen more times by tapping the sides or taking out the batteries and putting them back in.</li>
            <li>I suffer from health conditions involving my heart, and I have read that there are certain strains of bacteria and viruses that can further compromise the heart</li>
            <li>But, the theory behind it is sound as microbiology teaches you that UV light can be used to break down the circular DNA of most bacteria so that it is unable to copy itself and thus cannot make millions more of itself on your toothbrush</li>
            <li>Even with cheap batteries, they should hardly die so fast.  </li>
            <li>Great way to keep cold germs from living in your toothbrush from day to day.</li>
            <li>I can clearly say that this was just as they describe it.</li>
            <li>It is compact enough that it does not take up much space on the counter.  </li>
            <li>but I really wanted a unit like the Oral Stericlean UV Portable Toothbrush Sanitizer by 3B Global.</li>
            <li>I personally think it is a bit much</li>
            <li>Looking into how unsanitary my house really could be, I looked into solutions for our personal products we use.</li>
            <li>No phosphate laundry detergents, natural soaps, and trying to keep my gums from being a breeding ground of bacteria.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read several reviews and have talked to my dentist and this really does help.</li>
            <li>I emailed the manufacturer directly &amp; have heard nothing.  </li>
            <li>and no, it&#x27;s not a dead battery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll revise my review again, if they contact me or take action.</li>
            <li>This is a small and easy to use sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>I put the (dry) brush into the sanitizer first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li>therefore I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much and assumed the UV would not last long.</li>
            <li>With this tooth brush, your teeth actually feel clean unlike other portable ones.</li>
            <li>Very efficient, arrived in less than a week, and very affordable.</li>
            <li>so I could return it or at least send it back, but with such amazing reviews, I figured I didn&#x27;t have to worry.</li>
            <li>The light would come on, but wouldn&#x27;t stay on past a minute or two.</li>
            <li>I read reviews of ppl who kept mentioning putting a wet toothbrush in the sanitizer, so I blot mine with a portion of paper towel first, and have had no issues.</li>
            <li>As soon as I saw this, I knew we had to try it because he used to complain about how his tooth brush might taste funny or musty if he accidentally left it in the old plastic case too long.</li>
            <li>I tried several different toothbrushes in the sanitizer, including my electric toothbrush, which is quite large.</li>
            <li>While some of the things this prevents seemed a bit over the top, they are at least possible.</li>
            <li>They contacted me after my first update, and immediately sent me a new one, which is working like a dream, plus gave me a pre-paid shipping label to send the other back so their lab could test it to see what&#x27;s going on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s comforting to know that this UV portable will kill germs and bacteria like no other competitor.</li>
            <li>The ship&#x27;s restrooms get pretty gross, as you can imagine, and I am required to keep my toiletries in my locker rather than leaving them out to air dry.</li>
            <li>I like this device because it lets me easily clean up the toothbrush and set it back down for the next day.</li>
            <li>The holder fizzes out after barely 1 month of use.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a lot of DOA&#x27;s and early failures for this unit, perhaps it&#x27;s a recent manufacturing change, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>Two days after I wrote my last review and gave it 5 stars, this completely stopped working.  </li>
            <li>Oral SteriClean PORTABLE FAMILY UV Toothbrush Sanitizer, FDA Listed Medical Device, Clinically Tested &amp; Proven, #1 Doctor Recommended, Protects Vital Organs]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am really considering buying the &amp;#34;Portable Family&amp;#34; size one because we constantly have trade off who uses this single one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not long enough to complete the sanitizing cycle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little bit larger than I expected, but in the grand scheme of things, it still doesn&#x27;t take up that much room in a carry-on bag and the sanitary benefits far outweigh a few extra ounces and inches.</li>
            <li>it was a real eye opener to me that gum disease can lead to other sickness...</li>
            <li>I replaced the standing one that I had for years that has such bad reviews( worked great for me with one battery change  for 3 years that has just pooped  out)</li>
            <li>My other complaint is that there is no way to clean it because the little UV light and battery compartment would be damaged by water.  </li>
            <li>Looking around at other sanitizers suggests to me that these products are not yet ready for regular use.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this toothbrush sanitizer for extreme germophobics.  </li>
            <li>published my opinion with the firm belief that my review is not false.</li>

            <li> It serves as a good travel case for my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> BUT GOOD</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because it seemed to have the best reviews and had the best chance of working correctly for a long time; it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> We are very pleased with the Oral Stericlean Sanitizers.  </li>
            <li> very pleased with the product</li>

            <li> Love these and they travel great.</li>
            <li> I am pleased to report it fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love my sanitizer and thank you for your efforts to educate me!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I truly love the products!</li>
            <li> We love this product!</li>
            <li> The Stericlean Sanitizer also comes with a one-year warranty, which I love!</li>
            <li> Love this product, burn the heck out of batteries, suggest rechargeable batteries!</li>
            <li> However, after using it, I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love them!  </li>
            <li> After all, a clean brushing routine leads to good health!</li>
            <li> Amazing product&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Then again it makes a GREAT night light.</li>
            <li> received this for review purposes, all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> All you need to do is use your own toothbrush and store it in this case.</li>
            <li> this Oral Stericlean UV Portable Toothbrush Sanitizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li> great size, solid piece and perfect for when i travel.</li>
            <li> The auto timer and shutoff ensures that the UV dose is effective, and also saves batteries.</li>
            <li> I did receive my Oral Stericlean at a reduced price for an honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Aside from that it seems nice and sturdy and has a sleek, unobtrusive build that fits nicely in the drawer.</li>
            <li> Liked The Idea</li>
            <li> I am entitled to my own opinion and can publish that opinion.</li>
            <li> I believe that, since your mouth germs grow so well in damp and warm conditions, that even if you protect your toothbrushes from contamination in the bathroom, that it will still act like an incubator for whatever germs are on it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so convenient and we feel great about not using chemicals on our toothbrushes to get them &#x27;clean&#x27; after each use.  </li>
            <li> I liked the product, but what good is it if the light wont come on??</li>
            <li> bought the travel unit to try out first and loved it!</li>
            <li> My brush is a bit shorter than the bottom clip so it doesn&#x27;t do much good for it, but the brush still fits fine with a bit of adjusting.</li>
            <li> This individual kind is the best kind to have rather than any of the others in my opinion, because of many reasons, and I am so glad I bought them!</li>
            <li> We already own the Duo size and love it.  </li>
            <li> This cleaner is so handy, I love it</li>
            <li> This product has a good concept however the Oral B circular electric tooth brush is a bit of a challenge to be in alignment with the UV light.</li>
            <li> Just the right size for my dop kit - and great for traveling anywhere, since it&#x27;s run by battery.</li>
            <li> do love how sleek and slim it is</li>
            <li> Most of these products can cost hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comforting to know this product helps my family stay healthy.</li>
            <li> Ordered two and received next day in perfect condition using Amazon Prime.  </li>
            <li> I love the compact design and ease of use.</li>
            <li> about 3 weeks so make sure you have rechargables.</li>
            <li> He didnt mention if his wife&#x27;s was ok, so I guess it is.</li>
            <li> But they stepped up and took care of everything and made it all ok.</li>
            <li> and I feel so much better knowing my toothbrush head is sanitized.</li>
            <li> I was always nervous about the fact that I probably take in more germs into my mouth when using my toothbrush rather than cleaning my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I received a review sample of the travel model I wanted to be able to verify or validate specs and product description claims.</li>
            <li> So it makes him very happy that he can feel that extra bit of safety.</li>
            <li> This will keep me feeling better about having a sanitized toothbrush.</li>
            <li> We absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I have the Duo and the Portable, outstanding products and quality.</li>
            <li> I also love the portability of this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure how it broke -  perhaps during baggage claim??  </li>
            <li> Glad I found this.  </li>
            <li> The thought of having so many unseen germs growing on one&#x27;s tooth brush with no solution.  </li>
            <li> After brushing my mouth feels better then it has.</li>
            <li> love this Oral SteriClean toothbrush sanitizer.</li>
            <li> I stay in many hotels and needed a dependable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> They were very nice to replace my first one that didnt want to work, and the replacement is still going strong.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> My brush seems to fit pretty great in it.</li>
            <li> You will never have to worry about where to store your toothbrush while traveling again, it will stay safe and clean with this!</li>
            <li> protects my toothbrush, makes sure i have a clean brush every use, and I can take it every where with me!</li>
            <li> Loved these so much that I re-ordered for all of my family members!  </li>
            <li> and I love the fact that I can easily take it with me when I&#x27;m traveling.</li>
            <li> Now I have no worries and know my brush is clean by using this sanitizer!</li>
            <li> After purchasing the SteriClean sanitizer, I was pleased how much more clean my toothbrush was.</li>
            <li> The holder doesn&#x27;t light up any more.</li>
            <li> This nifty device uses UV light which is a more efficient way of killing bacteria, viruses and germs.</li>
            <li> Works great so far...</li>
            <li> Seems to work great so far after you put 2 AAA batteries in.</li>
            <li> Time will tell how durable this product is, but so far so great.</li>
            <li> so I can feel safe and comfortable taking the brush into my mouth.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use, compact and most importantly, AFFORDABLE.</li>
            <li> It’s easy to use, easy to keep clean, very well constructed and is a very effective oral hygiene tool.</li>
            <li> and I only have good things to say about it!</li>
            <li> THEY ARE SO SWEET!</li>
            <li> Instructions are easily understood and unit is easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Oral Stericlean UV Portable Toothbrush Sanitizer is so easy to use</li>
            <li> and I can easily take it with my on vacation, to a friends house for the weekend, or just keep it on my bathroom counter to keep my toothbrush head sanitized day in and day out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use &amp; gives piece of mind.</li>
            <li> If ever anyone finds an easy fix, I hope it will get posted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to find in my carry on when I need it.</li>
            <li> It feels like my normal toothbrush and is really good at cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> So keeping my toothbrush 100% clean with the power of UV light is a must to keep my body healthy.</li>
            <li> Being a clean freak and  a bit of a germaphobe, it&#x27;s great to know that my toothbrush is completely sterilized every time I use it, bacteria free.</li>
            <li> I love that this portable sanitizer is lightweight yet does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do!</li>
            <li> We all have electric toothbrushes, and they all fit in the slots with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  </li>
            <li> The ultra light stopped working about a week of receiving it.</li>
            <li> Close the lid and the light comes on.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Through the six minute cycle of the UV light, it kills 99.9 percent of germs on your toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great if you are a big germaphobe like</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is fantastic for travel, at home, for your gym bag, for anytime use.</li>
            <li> If you want that peace of mind that you&#x27;re not having a toothbrush filled with germs, this is the product for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worked well for about 6 weeks, then the light stopped working.</li>
            <li> It would keep the UV light on until the batteries died, which was about 2hrs (instead of the</li>
            <li> I brush my teeth 2 times a day (once in the morning and once at night) and after each use I put my toothbrush in the portable sanitizer and the UV light lights up and sanitizes my brush which takes about 6 minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact, easy to use and hopefully is keeping my brush sparkly clean</li>
            <li> The light turns on for</li>
            <li> Just brush your teeth, give your toothbrush a couple of shakes to get excess warer off, pop it into the sterilizer with bristles against the light, close it, the light comes on and sterilzes for 6 minutes, then turns itself off.</li>
            <li> After a week of use, the light started to not come on when I&#x27;d shut the unit, until I would thump it against the counter.</li>
            <li> The UV light cleans it and take away the germs</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it works great!</li>
            <li> But it is attractive enough to leave out.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine 2 months &amp; it no longer stays closed--it has to close for the light to activate.</li>
            <li> And the company has a number of at-home designs available.</li>
            <li> The light shuts off to let you know that the sanitizing process is finished.</li>
            <li> Closing the lid turns on the uv light again as if it is sanitizing again.  </li>
            <li> Light Stays On And Drains Batteries.</li>
            <li> so I can attest to this fact that the UV light is not killing the bacteria.</li>
            <li> LOOKS GOOD SO FAR.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> For best results, leave at least 5 hours between usage to make sure you kill everything that was on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use and it fits pretty much every toothbrush perfectly and after it is clean it feels like a brand new tooth brush.</li>
            <li> My brush and of course my teeth felt so clean and germ free like never before.</li>
            <li> It sanitizes and cleans my toothbrush with the SUV light and kills germs and bacteria and knowing that my family and I am using a clean toothbrush every time we brush</li>
            <li> Like advertised, it is very easy to use and it provides a very thorough cleaning process.</li>
            <li> ORIGINAL REVIEW:</li>
            <li> Excitedly received the oral stericlean but it never worked.</li>
            <li> I got more for my entire family and I would recommend the product for anyone who wants a great solution to keep their toothbrush clean.</li>
            <li> Very honest, ethical, and professional!    </li>
            <li> I just received my new Stericlean Sanitizer and I&#x27;m thrilled with the product.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a way to save some money on toothbrushes and ensure you have a clean toothbrush time after time?</li>
            <li> Most, if not all of us, keep our toothbrushes in the bathroom and as we flush our toilets, I can only imagine what kind of airborne bacteria or viruses circulate the air and land on it.</li>
            <li> Only good as a tooth brush holder now as the light will no longer come on.</li>
            <li> I have had a concern about my toothbrush being clean and this works find for me.</li>
            <li> I was always wondering how clean my toothbrush was just sitting in the batheroom or in a bag when I travel.</li>
            <li> Keeps my brush clean while it&#x27;s stored in my travel case for days/weeks</li>
            <li> Well with this system my teeth feel truly clean.</li>
            <li> I am a bit of a bacteria phobic personality, so I like to keep my toothbrush clean.</li>
            <li> I thought I was a healthy person, I eat healthy, exercise, but I was surprised to learn that the bacteria in my mouth attacked my heart.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve checked the outlets, made sure the port is secure into the back of the holder, ensured the top was securely fastened (it did have a tendency of unhinging if you took the brush out too</li>
            <li> I travel all the time and at first loved this product...until it COMPLETELY DIED on me after five months!</li>
            <li> Teaching them to just take better care of their things would have been the more responsible move, but just giving them two of these was certainly the easier one...</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li> and he really loves it not realizing how many germs are in our toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I took this on two trips recently and loved it.</li>
            <li> Cool product but Made in China.</li>
            <li> It works very well and I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> your company is very professional, my product arrived very quickly!</li>
            <li> This is so useful to bring with me when I go on vacation or on a trip and this cleans my toothbrush and makes sure that it is free of bacteria and germs that live on a toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> quickly)...</li>
            <li> Love the color of the case as blue is my favorite color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regardless of gaps in the documentation, this is a well constructed unit that has nice features like a safety interlock to prevent the UV light from activating while the case is open and a practically watertight closure.</li>
            <li> As I get older I&#x27;m trying to become healthier in as many things as I can control.</li>
            <li> The seller wa quick to send a follow up email verifying satisfaction and confirming there support for the product.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrushes are covered while inside the device (upside down), so sink/toilet \\&quot;splatter\\&quot; opportunities are greatly reduced.</li>
            <li> hahatoothbrushes are covered while inside the device (upside down), so sink/toilet \\&quot;splatter\\&quot; opportunities are greatly reduced.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It stays pretty clean on its own, and it&#x27;s really simple to clean when it needs it.  </li>
            <li> I ended up throwing out the batteries for good and now wash the case and leave my brush head to air dry and &amp;#34;store&amp;#34; in the sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> If the UV light went the entire length along the brush instead of just at the bristle part, there&#x27;d be no mold problem, but it would cost a lot more, too.    </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it near that magical \\&quot;four month mark\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Considering the benefits, it is definitely worth the cost.</li>
            <li> It cleans the toothbrush to pristine, wiping all the bacteria and things you definitely do not want on your toothbrush away in a nice fashion.</li>
            <li> it seems like I&#x27;m replacing the batteries often, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;Overall worth it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth having.</li>
            <li> I have always been very particular about keeping me and my husband&#x27;s toothbrushes clean and sanitized.</li>
            <li> just ordered this last week, and the first time I used it I felt so much better!</li>
            <li> Love it and that my toothbrush is kept clean during travel and sterilized following use.  </li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t sanitize it, I was horrified and decided I needed to invest in a sanitizer right away.</li>
            <li> this right BEFORE I brush, not after,</li>
            <li> I think using it right before brushing and air-drying it till then would solve those fishy-smell problems, as it has my mold problem.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> I use several ways to try to prevent this like dipping in mouth wash or washing my tooth brush with hydrogen peroxide but there nothing better  or effective then leaving them inside UV light to kill all the baddies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now use Oral Stericlean just as effective but takes less time and less energy for a better experience.</li>
            <li> This little beauty is amazing!</li>
            <li> I made sure to get as much moisture off the brush as possible before storing it, and the UV light did the rest.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to how effective the UV light is at killing bacteria and diminishing sickness as I have no true way of testing it.</li>
            <li> When the batteries are dying, it tends to take a bit of jiggling to get it to turn on, which is kind of a strange quirk.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Received a replacement, as the first wasn&#x27;t working right.  </li>
            <li> This brand certainly did not!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought one for my whole family!</li>
            <li> Once you feel the satisfaction of brushing your teeth with a sanitized toothbrush, you won&#x27;t be able to go back.</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> My husband travels frequently for work and has used one of those cheap drug store plastic cases for years, but it started to fall apart</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do</li>
            <li> The item worked correctly exactly ONE time.</li>
            <li> When I told my son he could return his for a replacement, he said he wouldn&#x27;t need to, it had only done it the first time he used it and maybe 2-3 more times that week, but that it hadn&#x27;t done it since</li>
            <li> but it makes his time in the bathroom in the morning easier, and shorter since he can just flash this instead of spending 10 mins washing his brush in hot water.</li>
            <li> Worked for first day then hasn&#x27;t since.  </li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t break on the first day, I would be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is pretty neat that i can know it actuality works</li>
            <li> I was terrified, to think that I use a toothbrush to maintain dental hygiene and essentially I was allowing more bacteria to be spread.</li>
            <li> Thanks Guys!</li>
            <li> Most bacteria growth can be stopped or reduced with only 30 seconds of UV exposure.</li>
            <li> I since then went back and purchased the DUO (for my kids) and another  more Portables for the rest of the family for travel.  </li>
            <li> We have two portable units and a family unit and we definitely feel more of a sense of safety and cleanliness when we use our toothbrushes now.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I chose the portable travel version, and the case is sleek and stylish, light and small enough to fit in an overnight bag easily.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s doing its job, but find that replacing that two AAA batteries is more frequent, so will wait and see if it holds up as well as the Vio.</li>
            <li> I  definitely definitely recommend this toothbrush to anyone who needs a portable clean toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> Cheap Chinese made product, and non-functional right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> Knowing the risk of having your toothbrush exposed to bathroom elements on top of how dirty the human mouth is, piece of mind is priceless.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve been using this product, I have felt better than I have in a long time.</li>
            <li> The first one I got only worked once, then the UV light would no longer illuminate, since the first day.</li>
            <li> This was a gift, so don&#x27;t really know how it works, but it was exactly what my daughter wanted.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot, an average of about 200,000 miles annually so this little portable toothbrush holder and cleaner is perfect!</li>
            <li> little machine works better!</li>
            <li> I took this with me on my last trip and it was easy and compact to bring along.</li>
            <li> The product is simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> You never know what kind of germs are hidden on your toothbrush so this product eases that feeling.</li>
            <li> Liked the idea of the UV sanitation, however it quit working after 2 and a half months.</li>
            <li> This item certainly does not justify its price.</li>
            <li> I am going to get a few more for the wife and kids, thank you again!</li>
            <li> I kept my toothbrush in a regular plastic sleeve holder for my first couple underways, but once I switched to this UV holder I noticed a significant difference in the lifespan of my toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried this particular brand of portable toothbrush sanitizer.</li>
            <li> This thing is a nice little device.</li>
            <li> After receiving the item and using it I was definitely wrong I have currently been using it for a few months now and put the light on at night before I go to bed, the light is still going strong and the product is of very good quality.</li>
            <li> These products are quite amazing starting at the low price of 19.95 USD.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until 2 days ago that the light will no longer turn on after putting the brush back in.</li>
            <li> It is an absolute NECESSITY for anyone out there, and I recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> The second one I got would light up everytime</li>
            <li> This product is efficient and very well priced -</li>
            <li> Leave the toothbrush in there till ready to brush again.</li>
            <li> I am really pissed and feeling</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This item works very well.</li>
            <li> ordered for my husband and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on this product, I decided to purchase the travel-size one because it was a reasonable price, it was portable for when I travel, and it sanitized my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The blue light comes on to let you know that it&#x27;s working, and stays on for 5-6 minutes.</li>
            <li> This is a very affordable, quality unit for the price paid.</li>
            <li> Absolute junk.  </li>
            <li> I think it really does help keep toothbrushes sanitary.</li>
            <li> It really really really works how is suppose to.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After days of using this toothbrush, I feel that the health status of my whole body has been improved one level.</li>
            <li> Great idea but poorly made.</li>
            <li> Now, if the UV light actually worked and did its job as advertized, that bacteria would never survive to produce a smell.</li>
            <li> really.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> This really helps sanitize my tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I tell everyone about Oral SteriClean, I really believe in their product line.</li>
            <li> and I would absolutely by these again</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> Works much better than my old one of a different style.</li>
            <li> At this point, I would prefer a rechargeable battery, but I&#x27;d still say it&#x27;s better than the other choices.</li>
            <li> It is such a relief to know that I have a product that can clean my toothbrush of all the disease and bacteria before I put it in my mouth and expose my body to the germs.</li>
            <li> but no one talks about the fact that toothbrushes can still be full of germs and bacteria when left in the bathroom not being protected or being sanitized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I will not use it again until time to get new toothbrushes!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful alternative to those expensive sanitizers and will help provide piece of mind next time you use your toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend anyone purchase a product that has so many customers indicating that these stopped working in such a short time frame.</li>
            <li> I have TREMENDOUS respect for this company for stepping in to let me know they&#x27;d help me, even though they could have gotten away with NOT helping me, as I thought that since my very short window-of-time for returns to the seller was over, that it could not be returned.</li>
            <li> I figured I would give it a try as it had decent reviews.</li>
            <li> So far it works amazingly, or at least I feel it&#x27;s doing a good job.  </li>
            <li> I owned a much more expensive toothbrush sanitizer that took up more room and began to fall apart</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I love this little unit.</li>
            <li> manufacturer has declared that they are taking \\&quot;legal action against me\\&quot; for posting this unfavorable review.</li>
            <li> SteriClean said if he has any more trouble out of it, they would take care of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also going to buy a normal brush holder (with splash</li>
            <li> I used it daily for my electronic toothbrush (Sonicare) and never really knew if it worked but feel good that it wasn&#x27;t in the open collecting all the germs from a bathroom.  </li>
            <li> As a result of the above review, I was directly contacted &amp; a replacement was sent quickly.</li>
            <li> Decided to buy even after reading mixed reviews and now I can say for myself that the reviews are right- all of them.</li>
            <li> The product is GREAT for the short period that it works - after about two weeks the light began to work only periodically and after about three weeks fails to work at all</li>
            <li> so it was time to buy something new.</li>
            <li> I tried new batteries, cleaned it, etc.</li>
            <li> I had to order a new one after three years of use.</li>
            <li> Received in new condition as promised, work well.</li>
            <li> The visible blue light lets me know that the sanitizer is on, about 7 minutes later it turns off.</li>
            <li> Once I reset the battery, the blue light would come on and only if I reset the battery EVERY TIME.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they go through batteries fairly often.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say my toothbrush doesn&#x27;t seem to be breaking down as quickly as it has in the past since using this.</li>
            <li> I also tested a conventional toothbrush, which also fit.</li>
            <li> So I bought the portable family and now I have a place to clean and store my other dental tools.  </li>
            <li> You just really need to carefully follow usage instructions and you&#x27;ll find your toothbrush really sanitized!</li>
            <li> I have had four in the past, all of which shared the same manufacturer, a well-known and popular brand.</li>
            <li> So now I let it air-dry in the holder first, since it is a really long way from the toilet to my sink anyway, then I sterilize it right before I brush</li>
            <li> It was a nice small unit that I left near the sink and would pack for trips.  </li>
            <li> It worked a half dozen more times by tapping the sides or taking out the batteries and putting them back in.</li>
            <li> I suffer from health conditions involving my heart, and I have read that there are certain strains of bacteria and viruses that can further compromise the heart</li>
            <li> But, the theory behind it is sound as microbiology teaches you that UV light can be used to break down the circular DNA of most bacteria so that it is unable to copy itself and thus cannot make millions more of itself on your toothbrush</li>
            <li> Even with cheap batteries, they should hardly die so fast.  </li>
            <li> Great way to keep cold germs from living in your toothbrush from day to day.</li>
            <li> I can clearly say that this was just as they describe it.</li>
            <li> It is compact enough that it does not take up much space on the counter.  </li>
            <li> but I really wanted a unit like the Oral Stericlean UV Portable Toothbrush Sanitizer by 3B Global.</li>
            <li> I personally think it is a bit much</li>
            <li> Looking into how unsanitary my house really could be, I looked into solutions for our personal products we use.</li>
            <li> No phosphate laundry detergents, natural soaps, and trying to keep my gums from being a breeding ground of bacteria.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read several reviews and have talked to my dentist and this really does help.</li>
            <li> I emailed the manufacturer directly &amp; have heard nothing.  </li>
            <li> and no, it&#x27;s not a dead battery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll revise my review again, if they contact me or take action.</li>
            <li> This is a small and easy to use sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> I put the (dry) brush into the sanitizer first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li> therefore I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much and assumed the UV would not last long.</li>
            <li> With this tooth brush, your teeth actually feel clean unlike other portable ones.</li>
            <li> Very efficient, arrived in less than a week, and very affordable.</li>
            <li> so I could return it or at least send it back, but with such amazing reviews, I figured I didn&#x27;t have to worry.</li>
            <li> The light would come on, but wouldn&#x27;t stay on past a minute or two.</li>
            <li> I read reviews of ppl who kept mentioning putting a wet toothbrush in the sanitizer, so I blot mine with a portion of paper towel first, and have had no issues.</li>
            <li> As soon as I saw this, I knew we had to try it because he used to complain about how his tooth brush might taste funny or musty if he accidentally left it in the old plastic case too long.</li>
            <li> I tried several different toothbrushes in the sanitizer, including my electric toothbrush, which is quite large.</li>
            <li> While some of the things this prevents seemed a bit over the top, they are at least possible.</li>
            <li> They contacted me after my first update, and immediately sent me a new one, which is working like a dream, plus gave me a pre-paid shipping label to send the other back so their lab could test it to see what&#x27;s going on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s comforting to know that this UV portable will kill germs and bacteria like no other competitor.</li>
            <li> The ship&#x27;s restrooms get pretty gross, as you can imagine, and I am required to keep my toiletries in my locker rather than leaving them out to air dry.</li>
            <li> I like this device because it lets me easily clean up the toothbrush and set it back down for the next day.</li>
            <li> The holder fizzes out after barely 1 month of use.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot of DOA&#x27;s and early failures for this unit, perhaps it&#x27;s a recent manufacturing change, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> Two days after I wrote my last review and gave it 5 stars, this completely stopped working.  </li>
            <li> Oral SteriClean PORTABLE FAMILY UV Toothbrush Sanitizer, FDA Listed Medical Device, Clinically Tested &amp; Proven, #1 Doctor Recommended, Protects Vital Organs]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am really considering buying the &amp;#34;Portable Family&amp;#34; size one because we constantly have trade off who uses this single one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not long enough to complete the sanitizing cycle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit larger than I expected, but in the grand scheme of things, it still doesn&#x27;t take up that much room in a carry-on bag and the sanitary benefits far outweigh a few extra ounces and inches.</li>
            <li> it was a real eye opener to me that gum disease can lead to other sickness...</li>
            <li> I replaced the standing one that I had for years that has such bad reviews( worked great for me with one battery change  for 3 years that has just pooped  out)</li>
            <li> My other complaint is that there is no way to clean it because the little UV light and battery compartment would be damaged by water.  </li>
            <li> Looking around at other sanitizers suggests to me that these products are not yet ready for regular use.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this toothbrush sanitizer for extreme germophobics.  </li>
            <li> published my opinion with the firm belief that my review is not false.</li>
            <li> This is a good product that sanitizes our toothbrushes, thus cutting down on potential infections that are going around.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product because it is small</li>
            <li> I am not able to test if it really works</li>
            <li> This item did not last long at all.</li>
            <li> Batteries don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Batteries last a long time, I imagine.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a week ago and put new batteries, but now this toothbrush case does not light up at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s feels almost like having a new toothbrush everyday.  </li>
            <li> I keep my toothbrush in the bathroom ,of course, where the toilet is.  </li>
            <li> I try to remember to close the toilet before I flush</li>
            <li> Essentially every single time I wanted to use this I had to replace the batteries..</li>
            <li> I was looking for a single brush UV case and this was the only one I found that&#x27;s FDA listed.  </li>
            <li> I mean, there&#x27;s no way to tell if germs are actually killed by the UV light.</li>
            <li> It is also a nice storage compartment for the toothbrushes as well as keep the bad diseases away.</li>
            <li> Cleans partial bristle area only.  </li>
            <li> that &amp;#34;toothbrush&amp;#34;, you know its laying around all day next to the sink and soap bar, and other toilet stuff.</li>
            <li> From my research, it appears all brands of this item are cheaply made and unlikely to work for very long, if at all.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it and it keeps her toothbrush clean and sanitized, especially in those filthy dorm bathrooms.</li>
            <li> I have however had the same issues as other reviewers.</li>
            <li> Other portable tooth brushes just don&#x27;t feel the same as this one does.</li>
            <li> Its done it every single time since then</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s a single case, since I can toss it in a bag and it doubles as a travel toothbrush holder.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I use our stericlean every single day.</li>
            <li> So my review goes down to one star for lack of follow through on initial offer to replace my item under warranty.</li>
            <li> After a little research, I decided to go with Oral Stericlean, and I cannot recommend it enough!</li>
            <li> My son has braces and uses an electric brush head with several interchangeable heads which are very small; this model sanitizer works really well on the small brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Have used for 1 1/2 weeks now and works as expected.</li>
            <li> I closed the lid, however it would never stop.</li>
            <li> Only lasted a few days.</li>
            <li> cant be too careful these days - germs are everywhere.</li>
            <li> Problem is, they also shared a very short shelf life of perhaps four months or so each, give or take a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using a rubberband to keep it closed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve changed the batteries 3 times, kept it closed, etc.</li>
            <li> The solution to a wet brush:  </li>
            <li> Not very sturdy, no longer works after 7 months.</li>
            <li> how and it&#x27;s not much of a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plain and simple.</li>
            <li> I planned to use this for at least a few years before replacing, but fear it is now broken because the light stays on constantly and doesn&#x27;t cycle off after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> after looking at other sanitizers and looking up all your information, this was a no brainer.</li>
            <li> extremely* generously, because IF it does work - it&#x27;s probably?</li>
            <li> It works well for regular toothbrush heads and for small electric brush heads.  </li>
            <li> One works and the other one has been a problem from the beginning.</li>
            <li> Libel is defined as, \\&quot;Which the speaker knew or should have known was false.\\&quot; - See more at: [...]</li>
            <li> all due to the bacteria in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I go to work with it and very minimal.</li>
            <li> Nice double duty as travel carriers, and eliminating some of the disgusting germies that I know surround my children&#x27;s neglected toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Thats just not right.</li>
            <li> Who wants to be ill when you don&#x27;t have to be?</li>
            <li> They really stand behind their products!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they also very rapidly drained batteries as well.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Only thing negative I can say is</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that you can not turn it off.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve already wasted 10x AAA batteries testing and trying to get these to work as expected.</li>
            <li> I just feel this is a waste since the sanitizer is on but empty.</li>
            <li> But I have to say these are well made, I use them everyday and have had absolutely no issues.  </li>
            <li> It then goes through a six minute sanitizing cycle after which it shuts down.</li>
            <li> I especially like it for travel instead of using a small plastic cover!</li>
            <li> four stars is due to the fact that it seems to drain the batteries a little faster than I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> After using this for a few days I threw away all my other toothbrush travel holders and brush covers.</li>
            <li> Iit contained mercuryI maintain a non-toxic household and avoid mercury, aluminum and other heavy metals.</li>
            <li> There are ridges in the handle of my toothbrush that gets black stuff in them that looks like mold when I use the sterilizer after brushing then leave it in there.</li>
            <li> The unit is so compact that I put one in my shallow medicine cabinet and one on the pedestal sink for the younger kids.</li>
            <li> I read reviews by a few customers that said their brushes smelled fishy using this sterilizer, but I have not noticed any fishy smell, just the black in the ridges.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every little thing you do for your body helps.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what I ever did without this little wonder.</li>
            <li> I used the little steripod clips in the pod</li>
            <li> The little clips are a rubber-like material so they adjust well depending on the width of your brush.</li>
            <li> While the handle probably poses little risk, the ends of some toothbrushes have picks, which can and do accumulate bacteria.</li>
            <li> I like this little sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> It takes two AAA batteries, which makes it a little heavier than it would be if it was rechargeable, but it also means I don&#x27;t have to worry about a charger.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think this is the reason so many people are sick!  </li>
            <li> I thought it was dead batteries, so I changed them.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> As soon as I received it in the mail, I popped a few batteries in (it takes 2 AA that are not included) and sterilized all of my family&#x27;s toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> are a few areas where this device will miss: the handle and the end of a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Save yourself the frustration and the waste of your time repackaging and returning this item.</li>
            <li> Convenient for travel or everyday use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s a few days--more like a few weeks, but it turns on for a couple of minutes twice a</li>
            <li> I have been an amazon customer for ages &amp; I have only reviewed the deficient products.</li>
            <li> Waste of 20 bucks.</li>
            <li> This product broke a few weeks after I bought it.</li>
            <li> I have had these for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Makes me feel a LOT less paranoid about the cleanliness of my toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Not worth the money, and a complete disappointment.</li>
            <li> This is so useful and helpful, you will never have  to use a dirty toothbrush ever again!</li>
            <li> How I&#x27;ve gone my entire life without knowing anything about a product like this and not having one is actually very hard to believe now that I have one!</li>
            <li> The portable is small and takes very little space in the suitcase.</li>
            <li> WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately that&#x27;s only once, for two of them I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> like I have wasted a lot of money!</li>
            <li> Waste of my money!    </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I immediately looked into a different method to store my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, a waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Past The Return Window.  </li>
            <li> No more musty smelling toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I normally dont have bad experiences with amazon.</li>
            <li> and they wereeager to see what was wrong, and so was I, betting it was  loose bulb, and they promised to email me and tell me what they found out, but I never heard from them again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always hard to see what the eyes won&#x27;t let you.  </li>
            <li> 6 minutes to sterilize something that we put in our mouths at least twice a day?</li>
            <li> Of course, it is too late now to return the products.  </li>
            <li> I can’t think of anything negative to say about this product.</li>
            <li> None of those icky growths that can happen to a damp toothbrush kept in a travel holder.</li>
            <li> That sort of icky, bacteria fishy smell.</li>
            <li> I could monitor it draining the batteries on my fluke, slowly, until they went well below 1v from 1.62v - no UV..</li>
            <li> but I usually forget!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed that this broke after only a month of having it.</li>
            <li> Very naive on my part.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> Mine was broken while I was on travel</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous getting these as some reviews said the quality was poor.  </li>
            <li> I always hate having to throw away my kids toothbrushes after they have been sick, seems like such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not good!</li>
            <li> As a mother, I swear by these products, we all feel we get sick less.</li>
            <li> If you are like me, you probably also always felt uncomfortable taking into your mouth</li>
            <li> This sanitizer lasted a mere week before ceasing to work.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t expensive at all</li>
            <li> Product delivered July 10, 2014 and failed after 15 uses on July 25.</li>
            <li> $20.00 seems rather expensive for a plastic box to keep the dust off of my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Uses lots of batteries :(</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> hate to burst their bubble, but in America, we have this thing called freedom of speech.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> No, that&#x27;s disgusting!</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst products I have ever ordered.</li>
            <li> Awful product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The oral Stericlean UV toothbrush sanitizer is something I never thought to use, now that i have one that I received for a sample for a review,  I am liking the idea of killing germs on my toothbrush after every use. I like that it plugs into the wall. I have it placed on my bathroom sink. It is compact enough that it does not take up much space on the counter.  The visible blue light lets me know that the sanitizer is on, about 7 minutes later it turns off. When my family and I are finished brushing we just put all our toothbrushes in it and press the button and go. We all have electric toothbrushes, and they all fit in the slots with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  highly recommend this toothbrush sanitizer for extreme germophobics.  Great Product!</li>
            <li> The ultra light stopped working about a week of receiving it. I thought it was dead batteries, so I changed them. The ultralight still remains unseen. What a waste.</li>
            <li> Works as described.  Close the lid and the light comes on.  I don&#x27;t know how to check if its actually killing bacteria though.</li>
            <li> This item did not last long at all. I changed batteries in product to see if that would help. Still did not work. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 1 month and really liked it! To me I felt like I was brushing my teeth with a brush that I just took out of it&#x27;s package. Knowing the risk of having your toothbrush exposed to bathroom elements on top of how dirty the human mouth is, piece of mind is priceless. It wasn&#x27;t until 2 days ago that the light will no longer turn on after putting the brush back in. I&#x27;ve checked the outlets, made sure the port is secure into the back of the holder, ensured the top was securely fastened (it did have a tendency of unhinging if you took the brush out too quickly)...everything was as it had been from day 1. The holder doesn&#x27;t light up any more. I knew I should have saved the box and everything else it came with so I could return it or at least send it back, but with such amazing reviews, I figured I didn&#x27;t have to worry. Very naive on my part. The holder fizzes out after barely 1 month of use. Not worth the money, and a complete disappointment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this portable toothbrush sanitizer for about a month now and I only have good things to say about it! As soon as I received it in the mail, I popped a few batteries in (it takes 2 AA that are not included) and sterilized all of my family&#x27;s toothbrushes. Each cycle only takes 6 minutes. 6 minutes to sterilize something that we put in our mouths at least twice a day? Yes, please!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we sterilize all of our toothbrushes after (and sometimes before) using them and we can&#x27;t imagine going without our portable sanitizer again! I am really considering buying the &amp;#34;Portable Family&amp;#34; size one because we constantly have trade off who uses this single one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love how sleek and slim it is; it is the perfect size to throw in your toiletry bag while traveling. You will never have to worry about where to store your toothbrush while traveling again, it will stay safe and clean with this!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a way to save some money on toothbrushes and ensure you have a clean toothbrush time after time? Well this is a great product! I always hate having to throw away my kids toothbrushes after they have been sick, seems like such a waste of money. But now with this product, I can just use this and the toothbrush is fully sanitized. This product is easy to use, compact and most importantly, AFFORDABLE. Most of these products can cost hundreds of dollars. This is a wonderful alternative to those expensive sanitizers and will help provide piece of mind next time you use your toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of them. Neither one worked. I returned them.</li>
            <li> Received a replacement, as the first wasn&#x27;t working right.  Love it and that my toothbrush is kept clean during travel and sterilized following use.  Nice size and wonderful way to help avoid a germ laden toothbrush.</li>
            <li> LOOKS GOOD SO FAR.  LIKE IT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought one for my whole family! After reading an article about the bacteria that can collect on your toothbrush (if you&#x27;re wondering, it includes fecal matter- gag!) if you don&#x27;t sanitize it, I was horrified and decided I needed to invest in a sanitizer right away. After a little research, I decided to go with Oral Stericlean, and I cannot recommend it enough! It is such a relief to know that I have a product that can clean my toothbrush of all the disease and bacteria before I put it in my mouth and expose my body to the germs. It is an absolute NECESSITY for anyone out there, and I recommend it to all my friends. Think about it for a minute: would you let your food sit in the bathroom for hours before you ate it? No, that&#x27;s disgusting! So, why would you let your toothbrush, which also goes in your mouth, sit out as well without cleaning it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy this product, I guarantee you won&#x27;t regret it. Once you feel the satisfaction of brushing your teeth with a sanitized toothbrush, you won&#x27;t be able to go back. And, with a price like this, it&#x27;s a steal!</li>
            <li> Worked great for two weeks.  Flickered on and off for 2 weeks.  Doesn&#x27;t work at all now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:5e1fbc5b17da2a34ed2db763b8fe75c4]] If you are looking for a great travel piece, or just something for your own peace of mind when it comes to your health, this product is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through the six minute cycle of the UV light, it kills 99.9 percent of germs on your toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve been using this product, I have felt better than I have in a long time. It&#x27;s also great if you are a big germaphobe like I am!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is fantastic for travel, at home, for your gym bag, for anytime use. If you want that peace of mind that you&#x27;re not having a toothbrush filled with germs, this is the product for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every little thing you do for your body helps. Now you can have peace of mind when brushing your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for review purposes, all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> My husband and I started using these when we purchased and they only lasted 4 months !  Both of ours went out around the same time... we thought the batteries needed changing; however, that was not they case.  They simply stopped working.  Of course, it is too late now to return the products.  I would not recommend anyone purchase a product that has so many customers indicating that these stopped working in such a short time frame.</li>
            <li> I can’t think of anything negative to say about this product. I did a lot of research on toothbrushes before buying this product, and I’m happy as heck with the choice I made. It’s easy to use, easy to keep clean, very well constructed and is a very effective oral hygiene tool.</li>
            <li> I know there are lots of bacteria that are airborne and this is another way I can protect my toothbrush.  I especially like it for travel instead of using a small plastic cover!</li>
            <li> This little beauty is amazing! We already own the Duo size and love it.  On a recent trip, this portable size worked like a charm. We are happy Oral Stericlean cares about it&#x27;s customers and provides alternatives to the Duo and Family size UV toothbrush sanitizers. The portable is small and takes very little space in the suitcase. My kids use it on sleepovers, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s comforting to know that this UV portable will kill germs and bacteria like no other competitor. It&#x27;s the only one clinically proven to do so! Who wants to be ill when you don&#x27;t have to be? It&#x27;s comforting to know this product helps my family stay healthy.</li>
            <li> So far so good! I took this with me on my last trip and it was easy and compact to bring along. I like the fact that I just simply store my toothbrush and it immediately sterilizes my toothbrush for me. All you need to do is use your own toothbrush and store it in this case. I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> This works. I reviewed another one that didn&#x27;t. I read reviews of ppl who kept mentioning putting a wet toothbrush in the sanitizer, so I blot mine with a portion of paper towel first, and have had no issues.</li>
            <li> Ordered two and received next day in perfect condition using Amazon Prime.  Instructions are easily understood and unit is easy to handle. Have used for 1 1/2 weeks now and works as expected.</li>
            <li> Good product  would buy again</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what I ever did without this little wonder.</li>
            <li> Great holder. Use it for travel. Hope I can find a replacement brush. Still works after one year.</li>
            <li> Worked well for about 6 weeks, then the light stopped working.</li>
            <li> Oral SteriClean is s great product and there is nothing else like it on the market! after looking at other sanitizers and looking up all your information, this was a no brainer. it was a real eye opener to me that gum disease can lead to other sickness... I think this is the reason so many people are sick!  I love my sanitizer and thank you for your efforts to educate me! your company is very professional, my product arrived very quickly! Thank you!</li>
            <li> It seems like a great product, when it works. Unfortunately that&#x27;s only once, for two of them I&#x27;ve had. The first one I got only worked once, then the UV light would no longer illuminate, since the first day. I could monitor it draining the batteries on my fluke, slowly, until they went well below 1v from 1.62v - no UV.. The second one I got would light up everytime I closed the lid, however it would never stop. It would keep the UV light on until the batteries died, which was about 2hrs (instead of the ~5min it should run for). Essentially every single time I wanted to use this I had to replace the batteries.. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll try for a third, I&#x27;ve already wasted 10x AAA batteries testing and trying to get these to work as expected. There&#x27;s a lot of DOA&#x27;s and early failures for this unit, perhaps it&#x27;s a recent manufacturing change, I don&#x27;t know. They need to fix their QC or engineering of this product/manufacturing process. I gave it two stars *extremely* generously, because IF it does work - it&#x27;s probably? great.</li>
            <li> I think it is working! Good product. I would give it 5 stars, but it takes AAA batteries. I was looking for a plug in solution.</li>
            <li> I have always been very particular about keeping me and my husband&#x27;s toothbrushes clean and sanitized. Most, if not all of us, keep our toothbrushes in the bathroom and as we flush our toilets, I can only imagine what kind of airborne bacteria or viruses circulate the air and land on it. I used the little steripod clips in the pod but I really wanted a unit like the Oral Stericlean UV Portable Toothbrush Sanitizer by 3B Global. This nifty device uses UV light which is a more efficient way of killing bacteria, viruses and germs. This product has been clinically tested and is backed by clinical studies verifying its performance at eradicating germs, viruses and bacteria. I suffer from health conditions involving my heart, and I have read that there are certain strains of bacteria and viruses that can further compromise the heart - so I am taking no chances. This product is efficient and very well priced - a very good purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> My husband travels frequently for work and has used one of those cheap drug store plastic cases for years, but it started to fall apart so it was time to buy something new. As soon as I saw this, I knew we had to try it because he used to complain about how his tooth brush might taste funny or musty if he accidentally left it in the old plastic case too long. This case has eliminated that problem. It&#x27;s a little bit larger than I expected, but in the grand scheme of things, it still doesn&#x27;t take up that much room in a carry-on bag and the sanitary benefits far outweigh a few extra ounces and inches.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do</li>
            <li> How I&#x27;ve gone my entire life without knowing anything about a product like this and not having one is actually very hard to believe now that I have one! Products like this Oral Stericlean UV Portable Toothbrush Sanitizer should be in everyone&#x27;s household! We all learn about germs and bacteria when we are younger and that&#x27;s why we need to brush our teeth but no one talks about the fact that toothbrushes can still be full of germs and bacteria when left in the bathroom not being protected or being sanitized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Oral Stericlean UV Portable Toothbrush Sanitizer is so easy to use and I love the fact that I can easily take it with me when I&#x27;m traveling. I brush my teeth 2 times a day (once in the morning and once at night) and after each use I put my toothbrush in the portable sanitizer and the UV light lights up and sanitizes my brush which takes about 6 minutes. I love that this portable sanitizer is lightweight yet does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do! I would highly recommend this Oral Stericlean UV Portable Toothbrush Sanitizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> After using this for a few days I threw away all my other toothbrush travel holders and brush covers. It&#x27;s compact, easy to use and hopefully is keeping my brush sparkly clean</li>
            <li> Batteries don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> What can I say? It works as promised! You just really need to carefully follow usage instructions and you&#x27;ll find your toothbrush really sanitized!</li>
            <li> The item worked correctly exactly ONE time. It worked a half dozen more times by tapping the sides or taking out the batteries and putting them back in. After a week of use, the item doesn&#x27;t work at all anymore. I purchased this item because it seemed to have the best reviews and had the best chance of working correctly for a long time; it didn&#x27;t. I would recommend finding another option. From my research, it appears all brands of this item are cheaply made and unlikely to work for very long, if at all. This brand certainly did not!</li>
            <li> I love the compact design and ease of use. It kills all of the bugs that get on the toothbrush and is great for travel.</li>
            <li> After everything we hear in the news and see happening in hospitals (as well as in the \\&quot;community), I am trying to avoid germs spreading in our house.  This is a good product that sanitizes our toothbrushes, thus cutting down on potential infections that are going around.  It is especially helpful when traveling.  A good product!</li>
            <li> Works great so far...battery life was about 3 weeks so make sure you have rechargables.</li>
            <li> Love the color of the case as blue is my favorite color. Seems to work great so far after you put 2 AAA batteries in. The light turns on for 6 min everytime you close the case, so if you don&#x27;t want it to stay on when you take your brush out to brush your teeth, I would suggest leaving the case open and then placing in the brush once you are done and closing it. My brush seems to fit pretty great in it. The little clips are a rubber-like material so they adjust well depending on the width of your brush. My brush is a bit shorter than the bottom clip so it doesn&#x27;t do much good for it, but the brush still fits fine with a bit of adjusting. I can&#x27;t speak to how effective the UV light is at killing bacteria and diminishing sickness as I have no true way of testing it. But, the theory behind it is sound as microbiology teaches you that UV light can be used to break down the circular DNA of most bacteria so that it is unable to copy itself and thus cannot make millions more of itself on your toothbrush (Yuck!)!</li>
            <li> Only lasted a few days. I kept changing the batteries to keep it working but then it just quit altogether after about three weeks.</li>
            <li> Broke within 2 months of (non-daily) usage. Only good as a tooth brush holder now as the light will no longer come on.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase! Being a clean freak and  a bit of a germaphobe, it&#x27;s great to know that my toothbrush is completely sterilized every time I use it, bacteria free. I researched several similar products, but this was the only one with the FDA symbol, so that sold me!</li>
            <li> Worked for three days and then stopped. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> protects my toothbrush, makes sure i have a clean brush every use, and I can take it every where with me!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter who was on her way to college. She loves using it. She carries it back home when she comes back from college.</li>
            <li> I love this! 5 stars! Makes me feel a LOT less paranoid about the cleanliness of my toothbrush! Got 3 total.....one for me, my son, and my daughter-in-law. It&#x27;s a good price, and can prevent tons of diseases and problems, so it&#x27;s a great investment for your health. This individual kind is the best kind to have rather than any of the others in my opinion, because of many reasons, and I am so glad I bought them! Just brush your teeth, give your toothbrush a couple of shakes to get excess warer off, pop it into the sterilizer with bristles against the light, close it, the light comes on and sterilzes for 6 minutes, then turns itself off. Leave the toothbrush in there till ready to brush again. Could not be simpler! Batteries last a long time, I imagine. I use Alkaline.    UPDATE: After a week of use, the light started to not come on when I&#x27;d shut the unit, until I would thump it against the counter. Its done it every single time since then and I know that soon, even the thumping wont work. I asked my son if his was working alright, and his is doing what mine is, but was doing it from the start. He didnt mention if his wife&#x27;s was ok, so I guess it is. I am really pissed and feeling like I have wasted a lot of money! They cant be returned to seller because I passed my (short!) deadline for returning. Thats just not right. I liked the product, but what good is it if the light wont come on?? I can no longer recommend this. I changed my star rating to 2.    2nd UPDATE: Changed my star-rating back to 5! If I could give 10, I would! Nicest company EVER! They contacted me after my first update, and immediately sent me a new one, which is working like a dream, plus gave me a pre-paid shipping label to send the other back so their lab could test it to see what&#x27;s going on. Very nice people to deal with! Teri handled my problem, and could not have been sweeter. I have TREMENDOUS respect for this company for stepping in to let me know they&#x27;d help me, even though they could have gotten away with NOT helping me, as I thought that since my very short window-of-time for returns to the seller was over, that it could not be returned. But they stepped up and took care of everything and made it all ok. They really stand behind their products! Very honest, ethical, and professional!    When I told my son he could return his for a replacement, he said he wouldn&#x27;t need to, it had only done it the first time he used it and maybe 2-3 more times that week, but that it hadn&#x27;t done it since and he is happy with it. SteriClean said if he has any more trouble out of it, they would take care of it. THEY ARE SO SWEET! GOD BLESS STERICLEAN!!!    UPDATE # 3-----I discovered that if your toothbrush has ridges in the handle, it can grow what seems to be MOLD in the ridges! Not good! So I will not use it again until time to get new toothbrushes! Without ridges!     UPDATE#4----I am now only sterilizing with this right BEFORE I brush, not after, and I dont leave it in there anymore. There are ridges in the handle of my toothbrush that gets black stuff in them that looks like mold when I use the sterilizer after brushing then leave it in there. So now I let it air-dry in the holder first, since it is a really long way from the toilet to my sink anyway, then I sterilize it right before I brush and then stick it back in the holder to air-dry. If the UV light went the entire length along the brush instead of just at the bristle part, there&#x27;d be no mold problem, but it would cost a lot more, too.    I read reviews by a few customers that said their brushes smelled fishy using this sterilizer, but I have not noticed any fishy smell, just the black in the ridges. I think using it right before brushing and air-drying it till then would solve those fishy-smell problems, as it has my mold problem. They were very nice to replace my first one that didnt want to work, and the replacement is still going strong. They had said the lab was going to check out the problem and they wereeager to see what was wrong, and so was I, betting it was  loose bulb, and they promised to email me and tell me what they found out, but I never heard from them again. Oh, well.</li>
            <li> Great way to keep cold germs from living in your toothbrush from day to day.</li>
            <li> Iit contained mercuryI maintain a non-toxic household and avoid mercury, aluminum and other heavy metals. I didn&#x27;t test the product for functionality.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because it is small and I can easily take it with my on vacation, to a friends house for the weekend, or just keep it on my bathroom counter to keep my toothbrush head sanitized day in and day out. Others I have seen are much larger and need to be plugged into a wall, since this runs on batteries I can stick it in my pocket if I wanted to and take it wherever I needed to go.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample product in order to provide this review.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered as advertised and works as advertised.  We were replacing a similar product that was damaged by the moisture.  Maybe this one will last longer.</li>
            <li> We travel a lot and they are very handy! My kids take them for sleepovers and I never have to wonder where there toothbrush may have been. Highly recommend! We also have the duo one for our home and we use it with our sonic care toothbrushes we just take the heads off and stick them in! They work great and we have never had any problems!</li>
            <li> Perfect size, easy to use and I feel so much better knowing my toothbrush head is sanitized. Time will tell how durable this product is, but so far so great.</li>
            <li> This item works very well. I have had a concern about my toothbrush being clean and this works find for me.</li>
            <li> If you are like me, you probably also always felt uncomfortable taking into your mouth that &amp;#34;toothbrush&amp;#34;, you know its laying around all day next to the sink and soap bar, and other toilet stuff. I was always nervous about the fact that I probably take in more germs into my mouth when using my toothbrush rather than cleaning my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered this last week, and the first time I used it I felt so much better! My brush and of course my teeth felt so clean and germ free like never before. The UV light cleans it and take away the germs so I can feel safe and comfortable taking the brush into my mouth.</li>
            <li> great size, solid piece and perfect for when i travel. cant be too careful these days - germs are everywhere.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.  Arrived before promised date.</li>
            <li> I love it! I use it everyday and it works great! Before I started using it I was always wondering how clean my toothbrush was just sitting in the batheroom or in a bag when I travel. Now I have no worries and know my brush is clean by using this sanitizer! Only one I found that has actual research and studies to show the bacteria it kills! I recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> When I received a review sample of the travel model I wanted to be able to verify or validate specs and product description claims. While some of the things this prevents seemed a bit over the top, they are at least possible. It&#x27;s the probability that is in question. But testing those claims are outside of my skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit itself requires two AAA batteries and automatically activates as soon as you close the cover. It then goes through a six minute sanitizing cycle after which it shuts down. I tested mine with the head of an electric toothbrush, which fit the snap in holder perfectly. I also tested a conventional toothbrush, which also fit. The unit went through the sanitizing cycle per specs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are a few areas where this device will miss: the handle and the end of a toothbrush. While the handle probably poses little risk, the ends of some toothbrushes have picks, which can and do accumulate bacteria. If you are using that type of toothbrush this sanitizer will not work on that end. Of course, if you are using an electric toothbrush this is an excellent solution to keeping the head sanitary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of gaps in the documentation, this is a well constructed unit that has nice features like a safety interlock to prevent the UV light from activating while the case is open and a practically watertight closure. The auto timer and shutoff ensures that the UV dose is effective, and also saves batteries.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my husband as a present and likes it. It works well, sometimes. I am planning to get one for myself. Batteries need to be changed about every 3-4 weeks, but otherwise it works well.</li>
            <li> Just been using it a short while but seems like it will be a winner. I replaced the standing one that I had for years that has such bad reviews( worked great for me with one battery change  for 3 years that has just pooped  out)</li>
            <li> This sanitizer lasted a mere week before ceasing to work.  Looking around at other sanitizers suggests to me that these products are not yet ready for regular use.</li>
            <li> Tested and Did not work upon arrival. Will be returning.</li>
            <li> Great, Great, Great,  I did say Great product. Great great seller</li>
            <li> This thing is a nice little device. I got it for my friend who is big on gems and all of that. So it makes him very happy that he can feel that extra bit of safety. I personally think it is a bit much but it makes his time in the bathroom in the morning easier, and shorter since he can just flash this instead of spending 10 mins washing his brush in hot water.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted one of these!  I keep my toothbrush in the bathroom ,of course, where the toilet is.  I try to remember to close the toilet before I flush but I usually forget!  This will keep me feeling better about having a sanitized toothbrush. It is battery operated so you can put it under the cabinet  But it is attractive enough to leave out. It&#x27;s easy to use &amp; gives piece of mind. I take it when I travel, which it is perfect for! I did receive my Oral Stericlean at a reduced price for an honest opinion. Thank You!</li>
            <li> ordered for my husband and he absolutely loves it. likes the idea of his tooth brush being cleaned before putting away.</li>
            <li> After reading all reviews by the hall of fame reviewers I can clearly say that this was just as they describe it. We absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Works much better than my old one of a different style.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried this particular brand of portable toothbrush sanitizer. I have had four in the past, all of which shared the same manufacturer, a well-known and popular brand. Problem is, they also shared a very short shelf life of perhaps four months or so each, give or take a few weeks. Unfortunately they also very rapidly drained batteries as well.&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this brand I figured I would give it a try as it had decent reviews. So far so good. I haven&#x27;t had it near that magical \\&quot;four month mark\\&quot; yet but rest assured, I will update my review if it meets the same fate as the others!  Aside from that it seems nice and sturdy and has a sleek, unobtrusive build that fits nicely in the drawer.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a week ago and put new batteries, but now this toothbrush case does not light up at all.</li>
            <li> Looking into how unsanitary my house really could be, I looked into solutions for our personal products we use. After purchasing the SteriClean sanitizer, I was pleased how much more clean my toothbrush was. I got more for my entire family and I would recommend the product for anyone who wants a great solution to keep their toothbrush clean.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say my toothbrush doesn&#x27;t seem to be breaking down as quickly as it has in the past since using this. As I get older I&#x27;m trying to become healthier in as many things as I can control. No phosphate laundry detergents, natural soaps, and trying to keep my gums from being a breeding ground of bacteria. I&#x27;ve read several reviews and have talked to my dentist and this really does help.</li>
            <li> This unit is great.  I travel, and it stores and sanitizes my toothbrush.  My dentist sells these in his office, and I swear my by them.  I have the Duo and the Portable, outstanding products and quality. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: Two days after I wrote my last review and gave it 5 stars, this completely stopped working.  I tried new batteries, cleaned it, etc. and it will not work anymore.  I&#x27;m extremely disappointed that this broke after only a month of having it. Waste of my money!    ORIGINAL REVIEW: This is such a great product.  Before I got this, I was using one of those plastic toothbrush covers.  Then I heard about how those basically act like petri dishes and grow bacteria and viruses inside them.  GROSS!  Needless to say, I immediately looked into a different method to store my toothbrush.  After reading the reviews on this product, I decided to purchase the travel-size one because it was a reasonable price, it was portable for when I travel, and it sanitized my toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve had this for about a month and I have no complaints!  It fits my toothbrush well and the cleaning lasts for 6 minutes, then shuts off.  I recommend buying rechargeable AAA batteries for it (Energizer ones are $8 on Amazon).</li>
            <li> I am in the navy and I purchased the portable SteriClean holder for use while at sea. The ship&#x27;s restrooms get pretty gross, as you can imagine, and I am required to keep my toiletries in my locker rather than leaving them out to air dry. I kept my toothbrush in a regular plastic sleeve holder for my first couple underways, but once I switched to this UV holder I noticed a significant difference in the lifespan of my toothbrushes. I made sure to get as much moisture off the brush as possible before storing it, and the UV light did the rest. None of those icky growths that can happen to a damp toothbrush kept in a travel holder. I only give it four stars because you can&#x27;t change the bulb; mine broke after almost two years. Considering the benefits, it is definitely worth the cost. I&#x27;ll be buying another before I go back to sea.</li>
            <li> Works great but it&#x27;s somewhat bulkier than I wish.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as stated.</li>
            <li> Just the right size for my dop kit - and great for traveling anywhere, since it&#x27;s run by battery.</li>
            <li> I like this little sanitizer.  It works well for regular toothbrush heads and for small electric brush heads.  It&#x27;s battery powered and portable.  My son has braces and uses an electric brush head with several interchangeable heads which are very small; this model sanitizer works really well on the small brush heads.  For our Sonicare heads, we purchased a Duo model (from Oral Stericlean).  It is battery or corded and works perfectly on 2 Sonicare brushes at a time.  We are very pleased with the Oral Stericlean Sanitizers.  I see the price listed as $44.00 now, and I assure you I did not pay that for one of these!</li>
            <li> These products are quite amazing starting at the low price of 19.95 USD. It cleans the toothbrush to pristine, wiping all the bacteria and things you definitely do not want on your toothbrush away in a nice fashion. It is also a nice storage compartment for the toothbrushes as well as keep the bad diseases away. So if you want your fears about mouth hygiene to disappear then this is definitely the product for you.</li>
            <li> Loved these so much that I re-ordered for all of my family members!  Only thing negative I can say is it seems like I&#x27;m replacing the batteries often, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a couple of weeks with satisfaction. But I don&#x27;t know about the sanitizing effect myself for now.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow I would like to give it to my friend as a gift.</li>
            <li> Our entire family uses the DUO and the Portable units for travel. As a mother, I swear by these products, we all feel we get sick less. I truly love the products!</li>
            <li> Great idea for a gift.</li>
            <li> Uses lots of batteries :( I&#x27;ve had mine 2 months &amp; it no longer stays closed--it has to close for the light to activate. I&#x27;m using a rubberband to keep it closed. The customer service email contained with the instructions/warranty info is not a valid email. I emailed the manufacturer directly &amp; have heard nothing.  **UDATED** As a result of the above review, I was directly contacted &amp; a replacement was sent quickly. I&#x27;ve had the replacement for about a month &amp; it&#x27;s worked perfectly. I was informed it is actually designed for travel, not day-in, day-out home use; that is why the battery drain is as noticable. And the company has a number of at-home designs available.</li>
            <li> I was so looking forward to a sanitary place to keep the head from my electric toothbrush.  For a while, this worked great.  Then shortly the batteries expired and had to be replaced.  And replaced, and replaced...it seemed to just burn through the batteries.  My other complaint is that there is no way to clean it because the little UV light and battery compartment would be damaged by water.  I ended up throwing out the batteries for good and now wash the case and leave my brush head to air dry and &amp;#34;store&amp;#34; in the sanitizer.  In my opinion, a waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> Do not buy this item. I purchased the travel sanitizer and would have returned it, but didn&#x27;t use it until after the return period. 1. It would not turn on unless I turned it over, took the battery off, and removed a battery. Once I reset the battery, the blue light would come on and only if I reset the battery EVERY TIME. 2. The light would come on, but wouldn&#x27;t stay on past a minute or two. Not long enough to complete the sanitizing cycle. Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush sanitizer.  I replaced our violight sanitizers with this and am very happy.</li>
            <li> We love this product! We travel alot and they are very handy! My kids take them for sleepovers and I never have to wonder where there toothbrush may have been. Highly recommend! We also have the duo one for our home and we use it with our sonic care toothbrushes we just take the heads off and stick them in! They work great and we have never had any problems!</li>
            <li> Excitedly received the oral stericlean but it never worked. I normally dont have bad experiences with amazon. I endorse the idea of the product thats if you can get yours to work</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 60 days. Outside Amazon return policy. Not happy.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have used these for years and neither of us have had colds, flu, etc, since we started using them. I had to order a new one after three years of use. My only complaint is that they go through batteries fairly often.</li>
            <li> I just received my new Stericlean Sanitizer and I&#x27;m thrilled with the product. I chose the portable travel version, and the case is sleek and stylish, light and small enough to fit in an overnight bag easily. I tried several different toothbrushes in the sanitizer, including my electric toothbrush, which is quite large. I am pleased to report it fit perfectly. The product is simple and easy to use. Just pop in two AAA batteries, place your toothbrush in the case, and close the lid. The blue light comes on to let you know that it&#x27;s working, and stays on for 5-6 minutes. The light shuts off to let you know that the sanitizing process is finished. This is a very affordable, quality unit for the price paid. I feel good knowing that the unit eliminates up to 99.9 percent of molds, yeast, and bacteria, which can cause heart disease, infection, cavities, and gum disease. The Stericlean Sanitizer also comes with a one-year warranty, which I love!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and he really loves it not realizing how many germs are in our toothbrushes.  He sterilized all his travel brushes along with his brush heads for his electric tooth brush.  Very efficient, arrived in less than a week, and very affordable.</li>
            <li> very pleased with the product.....works great. you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It does not turn on when its supposed to i have to take out and put back in the battery every time i want it to turn on</li>
            <li> Hopefully it does what product claims. the idea is awesome</li>
            <li> Keeps my brush clean while it&#x27;s stored in my travel case for days/weeks</li>
            <li> This cleaner is so handy, I love it and I love how great it works. This is so useful to bring with me when I go on vacation or on a trip and this cleans my toothbrush and makes sure that it is free of bacteria and germs that live on a toothbrush head. It is so easy to use and it fits pretty much every toothbrush perfectly and after it is clean it feels like a brand new tooth brush. This is so useful and helpful, you will never have  to use a dirty toothbrush ever again!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this toothbrush cleaner. Like advertised, it is very easy to use and it provides a very thorough cleaning process. You never know what kind of germs are hidden on your toothbrush so this product eases that feeling.</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst products I have ever ordered. The device should turn on when you close the lid but the catch mechanism is not lined up so.........it doesn&#x27;t work unless you take one of the batteries out of the case.......Awful product. Stay away.</li>
            <li> I took this on two trips recently and loved it. I have however had the same issues as other reviewers. It does seem to quit working and no, it&#x27;s not a dead battery. If ever anyone finds an easy fix, I hope it will get posted. I like the case! It&#x27;s easy to find in my carry on when I need it.</li>
            <li> I love this little unit. It has clinical studies,  so I know it works. I plan on ordering a family unit. I am very impressed!</li>
            <li> Worked for first day then hasn&#x27;t since.  Absolute junk.  Stay Away!!</li>
            <li> It stopped working after two months.</li>
            <li> Cool product but Made in China.</li>
            <li> Cheap Chinese made product, and non-functional right out of the box.  Requested return instructions within 15 minutes after opening the package.  Save yourself the frustration and the waste of your time repackaging and returning this item.</li>
            <li> Decided to buy even after reading mixed reviews and now I can say for myself that the reviews are right- all of them. The product is GREAT for the short period that it works - after about two weeks the light began to work only periodically and after about three weeks fails to work at all</li>
            <li> Love this product, burn the heck out of batteries, suggest rechargeable batteries!</li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t break on the first day, I would be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It still holds a toothbrush, but not so great with the sterilizing, cleaning, and sanitizing.</li>
            <li> Replaces a similar model that lasted over 5 years. I think it really does help keep toothbrushes sanitary. Use it whenever I travel.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who just went away to college.  She absolutely loves it and it keeps her toothbrush clean and sanitized, especially in those filthy dorm bathrooms. A must have for every college student or traveller.</li>
            <li> This was a gift, so don&#x27;t really know how it works, but it was exactly what my daughter wanted. Convenient for travel or everyday use.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a single brush UV case and this was the only one I found that&#x27;s FDA listed.  It&#x27;s a plus that it&#x27;s a single case, since I can toss it in a bag and it doubles as a travel toothbrush holder.  It takes two AAA batteries, which makes it a little heavier than it would be if it was rechargeable, but it also means I don&#x27;t have to worry about a charger.&lt;br /&gt;It stays pretty clean on its own, and it&#x27;s really simple to clean when it needs it.  When the batteries are dying, it tends to take a bit of jiggling to get it to turn on, which is kind of a strange quirk.&lt;br /&gt;The four stars is due to the fact that it seems to drain the batteries a little faster than I thought it would.  Even with cheap batteries, they should hardly die so fast.  It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s a few days--more like a few weeks, but it turns on for a couple of minutes twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;Overall worth it.  At this point, I would prefer a rechargeable battery, but I&#x27;d still say it&#x27;s better than the other choices.</li>
            <li> It really really really works how is suppose to. I used to get sore throats when using a non sterilized toothbrush. Used to re infect myself with colds and bacterial infections. For longest time, had multiple throat infections from reinfecting myself from the contaminated toothbrush. I use several ways to try to prevent this like dipping in mouth wash or washing my tooth brush with hydrogen peroxide but there nothing better  or effective then leaving them inside UV light to kill all the baddies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now use Oral Stericlean just as effective but takes less time and less energy for a better experience. For best results, leave at least 5 hours between usage to make sure you kill everything that was on the toothbrush. Thats no problem for me i only brush 3 times a day thats plenty of time between no hassle. I also love the portability of this i can take it with me any place since it not bulky at all. It serves as a good travel case for my toothbrush. I go to work with it and very minimal. I also like the fact that it protects the heart i hear that bacteria can enter your blood via gums and such since toothbrush can make micro cuts in your gums the bacteria will travel unto your heart or arteries. So keeping my toothbrush 100% clean with the power of UV light is a must to keep my body healthy. I also like that is FDA approved is pretty neat that i can know it actuality works but the fact is that i test it myself and it works wonders for me. I give this my 100% backing as affordable and works like a charm. I recommend its a must have for all those that care about health like me.</li>
            <li> This is a small and easy to use sanitizer.  I am not able to test if it really works but I feel lime it is. My only complaint is that you can not turn it off. When you are done using it and take the toothbrush out you close the lid to put it away. Closing the lid turns on the uv light again as if it is sanitizing again.  I also tried taking out the battery but it turns on as soon as you put the battery back in.  I just feel this is a waste since the sanitizer is on but empty.</li>
            <li> I was recommended by a friend and now I am going to recommend it to all of you.&lt;br /&gt;After days of using this toothbrush, I feel that the health status of my whole body has been improved one level.</li>
            <li> I have been an amazon customer for ages &amp; I have only reviewed the deficient products. This is probably my 3rd review. I bought two of these on January 19, 2014. One works and the other one has been a problem from the beginning. I&#x27;ve changed the batteries 3 times, kept it closed, etc. It doesn&#x27;t work! I want my money back.</li>
            <li> This is the the best and most amazing product I have ordered. It sanitizes and cleans my toothbrush with the SUV light and kills germs and bacteria and knowing that my family and I am using a clean toothbrush every time we brush is a very healthy feeling. I would recommend this product to all my friends and family. U r not waisting ur money. It&#x27;s a proven product and u will b happy with it</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 3 months and used up ba&lt;br /&gt;batteries like they we&#x27;re going out of style.</li>
            <li> Amazing product&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for my entire family for Christmas&lt;br /&gt;And it is the best gift as it keeps us healthy and well.. I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> When I found out about the bacteria that a toothbrush could harbour I was terrified, to think that I use a toothbrush to maintain dental hygiene and essentially I was allowing more bacteria to be spread. After searching online for solutions to killing this bacteria, I found this product. It wasn&#x27;t expensive at all therefore I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much and assumed the UV would not last long. After receiving the item and using it I was definitely wrong I have currently been using it for a few months now and put the light on at night before I go to bed, the light is still going strong and the product is of very good quality. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and love that I no longer have to worry about bacteria growing in my toothbrush!!</li>
            <li> This broke mid way through my trip to Peru.  I&#x27;m not quite sure how it broke -  perhaps during baggage claim??  Anyway, I only got to use it like 5 days.</li>
            <li> I bought the travel unit to use on my counter as well as in my travel kit.  So far, so good. Have not had issues with battery life yet.  The solution to a wet brush:  I put the (dry) brush into the sanitizer first thing in the morning.  After 6 minutes, the brush is sanitized for the day.  Glad I found this.  I plan to order another one.</li>
            <li> This product has a good concept however the Oral B circular electric tooth brush is a bit of a challenge to be in alignment with the UV light.</li>
            <li> The thought of having so many unseen germs growing on one&#x27;s tooth brush with no solution.  Well with this system my teeth feel truly clean. After brushing my mouth feels better then it has. To know microorganisms are being zaped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed. I travel all the time and at first loved this product...until it COMPLETELY DIED on me after five months! The bulb won&#x27;t turn on at all even after I replaced the batteries. Waste of 20 bucks. Great idea but poorly made.</li>
            <li> This product does not work.</li>
            <li> Received in new condition as promised, work well.</li>
            <li> There was only one out of the four I ordered that just doesn&#x27;t work at all. The others are great, so I would just like a replacement.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00N11O0JW Oral SteriClean PORTABLE FAMILY UV Toothbrush Sanitizer, FDA Listed Medical Device, Clinically Tested &amp; Proven, #1 Doctor Recommended, Protects Vital Organs]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the travel unit to try out first and loved it! So I bought the portable family and now I have a place to clean and store my other dental tools.  It&#x27;s feels almost like having a new toothbrush everyday.  Thanks Guys!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s FDA Listed. It works very well and I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Not very sturdy, no longer works after 7 months.</li>
            <li> Product Is Defective.  Unfortunately Past The Return Window.  Light Stays On And Drains Batteries. Liked The Idea Before It Quit Working</li>
            <li> My Vio Lite toothbrush sanitizer finally gave out after years and years of service, so decided to try this brand as a  replacement. So far it&#x27;s doing its job, but find that replacing that two AAA batteries is more frequent, so will wait and see if it holds up as well as the Vio.</li>
            <li> This product broke a few weeks after I bought it.</li>
            <li> Great while it worked. Broke within a month.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo19QR6XHVDH5QR]]UPDATE #2 (5/29/14)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer has declared that they are taking \\&quot;legal action against me\\&quot; for posting this unfavorable review.

I don&#x27;t represent a competitor of this UV toothbrush holder company, nor am I affiliated in any industry associated with production. I am simply a private citizen who bought your product and don&#x27;t believe it works.

See the last comment.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Several weeks later I am wholly dissatisfied... The toothbrush holder acts as a shield to block \\&quot;sink splash\\&quot;, but it also encapsulates and limits drying of the toothbrush. This causes the toothbrushes -- almost overnight -- to smell like a frog. That sort of icky, bacteria fishy smell. Now, if the UV light actually worked and did its job as advertized, that bacteria would never survive to produce a smell. I&#x27;ve cleaned the holder several times, but the results are the same. It&#x27;s not me. I&#x27;m also a scientist so I can attest to this fact that the UV light is not killing the bacteria. I think it&#x27;s *incubating* it... really. So, I want my money back. Plain and simple. I&#x27;m also going to buy a normal brush holder (with splash guard.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;Who knows if it works... I mean, there&#x27;s no way to tell if germs are actually killed by the UV light. Seems like gray science to me... Then again it makes a GREAT night light. The toothbrushes are covered while inside the device (upside down), so sink/toilet \\&quot;splatter\\&quot; opportunities are greatly reduced. That alone probably is its best germ defense. If the UV park actually works, BONUS. Side benefit, get a tan while you brush. hahatoothbrushes are covered while inside the device (upside down), so sink/toilet \\&quot;splatter\\&quot; opportunities are greatly reduced. That alone probably is its best germ defense. If the UV park actually works, BONUS. Side benefit, get a tan while you brush. haha</li>
            <li> This thing is a lifesaver. It feels like my normal toothbrush and is really good at cleaning my teeth. Other portable tooth brushes just don&#x27;t feel the same as this one does. With this tooth brush, your teeth actually feel clean unlike other portable ones.</li>
            <li> Traveling to Ecuador I needed a toothbrush sterilizer as the tap water there is not potable. Product delivered July 10, 2014 and failed after 15 uses on July 25. I would not recommend this device.</li>
            <li> I planned to use this for at least a few years before replacing, but fear it is now broken because the light stays on constantly and doesn&#x27;t cycle off after a few minutes.  It was a nice small unit that I left near the sink and would pack for trips.  I used it daily for my electronic toothbrush (Sonicare) and never really knew if it worked but feel good that it wasn&#x27;t in the open collecting all the germs from a bathroom.  I&#x27;m torn about purchasing this same unit and may try to seek a warranty replacement if I can find out how and it&#x27;s not much of a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Update *&lt;br /&gt;Customer service seems to be non-existent for email, as I&#x27;ve contacted them twice and have not heard back (yet). So my review goes down to one star for lack of follow through on initial offer to replace my item under warranty. I&#x27;ll revise my review again, if they contact me or take action. In the meantime, I&#x27;d recommend the Steripod which gets great reviews here on Amazon, no battery, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about lack of integrity.</li>
            <li> My husband and I use our stericlean every single day. It&#x27;s so convenient and we feel great about not using chemicals on our toothbrushes to get them &#x27;clean&#x27; after each use.  Amazing product!!!! We recommend it to everyone we know!!!</li>
            <li> I travel a lot, an average of about 200,000 miles annually so this little portable toothbrush holder and cleaner is perfect! So far it works amazingly, or at least I feel it&#x27;s doing a good job.  It&#x27;s always hard to see what the eyes won&#x27;t let you.  I am going to get a few more for the wife and kids, thank you again!</li>
            <li> This really helps sanitize my tooth brush. I am a bit of a bacteria phobic personality, so I like to keep my toothbrush clean. I like this device because it lets me easily clean up the toothbrush and set it back down for the next day. Simple usage!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use it yet, but I thought I was getting the one with the metal bottom like I have now.  Mine was broken while I was on travel and I do like this product so I wanted to replace it before traveling again.  It&#x27;s worth having.</li>
            <li> This thing either eat up batteries or just don&#x27;t work as it should. I&#x27;ve already went thru 6 AAA batteries in two weeks. Now I just use this a toothbrush case...</li>
            <li> Most bacteria growth can be stopped or reduced with only 30 seconds of UV exposure. This thing blasts it for 6 minutes. Anyone who has taken a microbiology course will recommend this in a heartbeat. The batteries last quite a while as well. Loofas or Bath toys can also be set outside on a sunny day to inhibit bacterial growth. I recommend once every two weeks or so.</li>
            <li> Love these and they travel great.</li>
            <li> I have all 3 models and use them every day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last year I ended up in the emergency room and emergency surgery all due to the bacteria in my mouth.  I thought I was a healthy person, I eat healthy, exercise, but I was surprised to learn that the bacteria in my mouth attacked my heart.  When I told my dentist, he recommended me to a gum specialist.  The specialist recommended treatment and gave me a list of things to do to minimize my exposure to bacteria, things to do to kill germs, he recommended I purchase this product of which he sold in his office.  I initially purchased the family unit and 1 Portable (as we are a family of 5).  However, after using it, I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love them!  I since then went back and purchased the DUO (for my kids) and another  more Portables for the rest of the family for travel.  I do recommend that you use the plug in for the home and Portables for travel (so you don&#x27;t need to change the batteries that often).  I think the price is a bargain and I am impressed with the product.  I tell everyone about Oral SteriClean, I really believe in their product line.</li>
            <li> I owned a much more expensive toothbrush sanitizer that took up more room and began to fall apart right away.&lt;br /&gt;This little machine works better! I believe that, since your mouth germs grow so well in damp and warm conditions, that even if you protect your toothbrushes from contamination in the bathroom, that it will still act like an incubator for whatever germs are on it. It gives me peace of mind and the brushes actually look cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this Oral SteriClean toothbrush sanitizer. No more musty smelling toothbrushes. The unit is so compact that I put one in my shallow medicine cabinet and one on the pedestal sink for the younger kids. I did use a marker and put an initial below each hole so everyone in the family always puts their toothbrush back in the same place.</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous getting these as some reviews said the quality was poor.  But I have to say these are well made, I use them everyday and have had absolutely no issues.  The seller wa quick to send a follow up email verifying satisfaction and confirming there support for the product.  I have had these for a few weeks now and I would absolutely by these again</li>
            <li> Liked the idea of the UV sanitation, however it quit working after 2 and a half months. I tried numerous battery changes to no avail. $20.00 seems rather expensive for a plastic box to keep the dust off of my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Bought two of these to send off to camp with the kids. Nice double duty as travel carriers, and eliminating some of the disgusting germies that I know surround my children&#x27;s neglected toothbrushes. Teaching them to just take better care of their things would have been the more responsible move, but just giving them two of these was certainly the easier one...</li>
            <li> Great Product! We have two portable units and a family unit and we definitely feel more of a sense of safety and cleanliness when we use our toothbrushes now.</li>
            <li> Not enough sanitizing space.  Cleans partial bristle area only.  This item certainly does not justify its price.</li>
            <li> It seems to zap out my battery life.  I only get a couple weeks of use before I have to replace the batteries.</li>
            <li> THESE WORK NICELY, GAVE A BUNCH OUT FOR CHRISTMAS, VERY HAPPY WITH THE PURCHASE</li>
            <li> Excellent, Excellent toothbrush!  I stay in many hotels and needed a dependable toothbrush.  I found the Oral Stericlean toothbrush that allows me to travel and not worry about maintaining numerous toothbrushes and this allows me to have sterile toothbrush.  I  definitely definitely recommend this toothbrush to anyone who needs a portable clean toothbrush!  After all, a clean brushing routine leads to good health! Thanks!</li>
