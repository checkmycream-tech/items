            <li> Don&#x27;t get it, I promise you it will feel cheap and useless tbh</li>
            <li> constantly falls down also</li>
            <li> My biggest fear was the chain snapping it or falling down off my arm, but it fits snug on my arm and doesn&#x27;t slip or fall.</li>
            <li> The band will not stay on your bicep though and will slide down and eventually fall off :(</li>
            <li> extremely difficult to put on-</li>
            <li> but it is very difficult to maneuver and put on.</li>

            <li> Hard to put on but really great!</li>
            <li> Looks good in the picture. And it does LOOK like the picture when you hold it up... but it is very difficult to maneuver and put on. The chains are always getting tangled and it&#x27;s really just a pain.</li>
            <li> Pretty, but it doesn&#x27;t stay up unless you secure &amp;#34;tightly&amp;#34; &amp; the chain is too weak to hold.</li>
            <li> I love. It was well worth the money.</li>

            <li> Way too large.  Might fit an upper thigh?&lt;br /&gt;I am good with jewelry altering, but still can&#x27;t make this work for me.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve listened to the reviews...it has no grip and slips right off.</li>
            <li> So cheap!! Don&#x27;t get it, I promise you it will feel cheap and useless tbh</li>
            <li> My friend I got it for loves it!</li>
            <li> Was perfect until I broke it, which was completely my fault I was traveling and in a rush. I used it all the time and loved it</li>
            <li> Very cute and unique. The band will not stay on your bicep though and will slide down and eventually fall off :(</li>
            <li> How the hell do I wear this</li>
            <li> WAY TOO BIG  FOR AN ARM!! Although it makes a very cute gothic lolita choker for those who already bought it and are disapointed.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely beautiful and good quality. I&#x27;ve worn it to 3 parties already. My biggest fear was the chain snapping it or falling down off my arm, but it fits snug on my arm and doesn&#x27;t slip or fall. The chain is also good quality and if it breaks, you can easily twist the chain back into place with some pliers. Awesome deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Cute! A pain in the bupkin to get on. But cute.</li>
            <li> It looks just like the pic, even though i need someone to help me put it on. I like it.</li>
            <li> I love it! Its so beautiful. I highly recommend , the quality  it great. Looks jut like the picture.  You are able to size it to your arm. I can&#x27;t wait for summer to wear this!  Just remember it takes a month to receive  it.</li>
            <li> Very cute. ...but I still haven&#x27;t been able to figure out how to put on,  you definitely need some assistance</li>
