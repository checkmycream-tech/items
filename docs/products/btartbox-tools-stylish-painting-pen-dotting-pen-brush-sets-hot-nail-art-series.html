            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the variety of brushes</li>
            <li>I bought these to be able to put designs on my nails when I polish them.</li>
            <li>, i tested it out and these brushes are better than i</li>
            <li>I did actually try using a couple of brushes with nail polish, and these are wonderful for their intended purpose.</li>
            <li>Still, I will probably get a couple more sets, one just for nails.</li>
            <li>so I hope I will be able to find them again if I need to any time soon</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a use for the majority of the ones in the set (there are quite a bit) but the ones that I have used have been ok.</li>
            <li>again, for the price - they are ok.</li>
            <li>Such a wonderful variety of brushes that encourages her creativity.</li>
            <li>Love that I got so many for the price.</li>
            <li>so I can use them better.</li>
            <li>These brushes may as well be feathers - although feathers may even have better control.</li>
            <li>I love the brushes and they get the job done.</li>
            <li>I like this but make sure the stick doesnt hit acetone or else</li>
            <li>love using them</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure that is out of the seller&#x27;s control.</li>
            <li>The brushes are good quality and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>The brushes look kind of cheap</li>
            <li>but they do work OK.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for nail art brushes when I came across this set and am so glad that I did.</li>

            <li>I love nail art.  </li>
            <li>The metal part and up came off,but i was able to put it together again</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I gave them a try.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>There are so many choices.</li>
            <li>my customers love the fact i have many brushes to select from to service their needs.</li>
            <li>The metal part came off from most of them.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made!</li>
            <li>I love this item.</li>
            <li>Love this item</li>
            <li>back to work on my nails :D</li>
            <li>The top of the pocket case was scrunched up when I received it out of the envelope package.</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>YET THOUGH :-)</li>
            <li>Could not have gotten a greater deal for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>Pleased customer.</li>
            <li>The brushes were spectacular and fit my purpose well.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Should have ordered more at this price.  </li>
            <li>I bought these for myself, but I found that they work much better for acrylic painting more than nail art.</li>
            <li>I like them but the top pieces keep detaching from the stick.</li>
            <li>Lots of fabulous options!</li>
            <li>I thought there was more than one tool that made dots.</li>
            <li>I bought this nail art painting pack because I wanted to learn how do do my nails so that they would look stunning.</li>
            <li>I love it because i am able to create works of art with them.</li>
            <li>I thought they were more sturdy but dor the price I guess I cant complain.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure once I learn how to fully use them, I could have more of an opinion of them.</li>
            <li>I use them every day :)</li>
            <li>I love these brushes. .</li>
            <li>These are okay</li>
            <li>though i love them though i  reccomend them</li>
            <li>They are great except that they aren&#x27;t put together very well..  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps it will work better with acrylic paint.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed.</li>
            <li>Love these brushes.</li>
            <li>Better than the Sephora 2 pack I bought for $10.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to get whatever detail work that I want done.</li>
            <li>the heads fall off better buy a glue gun while your at it for these products</li>
            <li>Coud be used for many more applications than nail painting.</li>
            <li>Excellent brushes especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>My husband, 2 girls and myself really love this.</li>
            <li>This set it&#x27;s better than I thought and meet all my expectation.</li>
            <li>You can do so many designs with them.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love thes brushes.</li>
            <li>You can do so many designs with these brushes.</li>
            <li>i cant believe how many brushes you get for the price</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>The product is just okay for me.</li>
            <li>The packaging is not that grand</li>
            <li>The metal part fell off some of my brushes but the rest were okay.</li>
            <li>But whatever why am I complaining it comes with so many brushes that I don&#x27;t even know how to use.</li>
            <li>My daughter love her nail art painting.</li>
            <li>These turned out to be my favorite</li>
            <li>But once again thanks for the great deal</li>

            <li>i love them.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t expect more then</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok given the price.</li>
            <li>I would have been better off going to a craft store and picking the brushes I needed.</li>
            <li>my grand daughters into doing her nails</li>
            <li>These just came in the mail today much earlier than estimated which was a wonderful surprise!</li>
            <li>Most of the ends have fallen off of the stick portion.</li>

            <li>If you love painting nails</li>
            <li>Don’t people like using products more than once?</li>
            <li>Should pack with more hardy material to prevent this happen.</li>
            <li>Will probably use them for more crafting than nail art.</li>
            <li>Had to use pliers to make sure it didn&#x27;t fall off.</li>

            <li>I love the brushes and the quality.</li>
            <li>I love my 15 pcs nail art painting pen brush.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>My daughter ordered these and has been enjoying them.</li>
            <li>love them i find my self using my brushes a lot</li>
            <li>their i should have known better</li>
            <li>I love to do on my paintings.</li>
            <li>The smallest brush is about 5 1/4 &amp;#34; with a wider handle for  better control,the brush is about 1/4&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for the price a lot the end came off</li>
            <li>then that they are ok</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get many designs because the they wont hold the paint.</li>
            <li>I wish it came with more dotting tools</li>
            <li>More like acrylic paint, which in my opinion is easier to do details with</li>
            <li>the 3 stars is mostly because I am still trying to figure out what all I can do with these.  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I love to do our nails with more nail art then many people.</li>
            <li>I love working with these brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning to order four sets more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i would recommend it to people. :)</li>
            <li>I placed the order on July 1st and it was suppose to be here August 8th at the latest.</li>
            <li>I am in love with these brushes.</li>
            <li>I now wish I bought the ones that cost more.</li>
            <li>They seem like they would be better for for makeup or something....</li>
            <li>and I love the brushes</li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s a plus, but a most every brush fell apart as soon as I touched it.</li>
            <li>I am defiantly going to order some more for myself and for gifts.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t regret it, but also wouldn&#x27;t get any more of these.</li>
            <li>Mostly I use it for my eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I love the dotting tool it comes with.</li>
            <li>For this price, just add it to your cart and you&#x27;ll be pleased with yourself.</li>
            <li>I love it . . . .</li>
            <li>i love them  </li>
            <li>there ok.</li>
            <li>Cheap, varied, and nice detail brushes.</li>
            <li>in love</li>
            <li>i wasnt sure</li>
            <li>so i can use more</li>
            <li>i probably need another set :)</li>
            <li>There are so many of them.  </li>
            <li>I am in love</li>
            <li>but they work OK.</li>
            <li>I just love these brushes.</li>
            <li>I love the brushes..</li>
            <li>I havent gotten my things yet but they are doing everything they can to help me as soon as they fix my issue i will buy more</li>
            <li>I even got a tiny dotting tool which is awesome.</li>
            <li>So I figured if I got these nail paint brushes for her she could design them even more.</li>
            <li>These are wonderful for teen girls.</li>
            <li>Perfect for the tiny painting I am doing on my miniatures!</li>
            <li>I just received my set yesterday, it took only 2 weeks to get to my house and the package and brushes were in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>so I was looking for something inexpensive to do some creative nail art for my mom, my daughter and me.</li>
            <li>some i find i am using more than others.</li>
            <li>Rather spend more to get a better result</li>
            <li>I feel that even a mildly better pouch would have made me a lot happier with the product.</li>
            <li>i love the brushes...</li>
            <li>I was able to do all kinds of designs on nails.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re okay.</li>
            <li>I enjoy doing my own nails</li>
            <li>I love these brushes and i still use them now.</li>
            <li>I would recommend them :)</li>
            <li>I love how they have a plastic around the brushes so they don&#x27;t get squished in the mail.</li>
            <li>better to pay more for something better</li>
            <li>absolutely love these nail brushes</li>

            <li>really interesting set.</li>
            <li>but i love the quality.</li>
            <li>I think that the product itself is okay, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>i love them</li>
            <li>I draw and paint using mostly water colors.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I need to find a better set and spend the money for quality.</li>
            <li>I really did!!!!They work great</li>
            <li>I gave them as birthday gifts to my God Daughter and Grand Daughter.</li>
            <li>They arrived safely.</li>
            <li>I also love the variety of brushes to choose from</li>
            <li>and I received many compliments.</li>
            <li>like how im able to manage with the stiffness of the brush</li>
            <li>and I can do so many more designs</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li>There are so many things I love about these brushes.</li>
            <li>I am vvery glad for the variety of these brushes and I also love the fact they are not weak brushes great price</li>
            <li>I love making everyone&#x27;s nails look beautiful with my new kit.</li>
            <li>Really just fantastic price, and good for detail!</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t the most professional ones out there, but they are really good quality!</li>
            <li>but if you do nails as much as I do, you have some superglue very handy to fix this</li>
            <li>Order a second set, because this is a great quality brush at an exceptional price</li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive this item</li>
            <li>My friend was very excited</li>
            <li>I was very excited to find these on amazon.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I get to use any kind of brush for all my beautiful different designs on my nails.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive these brushes.</li>
            <li>very useful!</li>
            <li>They make painting my nails so much more fun!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a professional nail person, but I love these brushes, the effects you can make with them are Great!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s so many brushes, and they&#x27;re pretty good quality.</li>
            <li>remember to clean item and then rinse with warm soapy water after use.</li>
            <li>Brushes are sturdy and clean up nicely.</li>
            <li>These are some pretty good brushes considering how cheap they were!</li>
            <li>The quality of these brushes are very good, they are very soft and precise on the lines used while painting</li>
            <li>but they were a very good price in general</li>
            <li>Loved this product I am very much into nail art</li>
            <li>They are good for a cheap set, but they are quick to be ruined and thy don&#x27;t wash out at all.</li>
            <li>I love it, so cute, easy to grab...</li>
            <li>:) makes doing designs a lot more easy.</li>
            <li>They fit nicely in my collection, and store easily.</li>
            <li>But if you want better more sturdy tools or clean easy to use brushes DON’T GET THESE !</li>
            <li>The fan brushes are perfect for &#x27;ombre&#x27; nails, the bristles are soft and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>My designs look great, they&#x27;re fun to use and experiment with, and at this price I&#x27;ll be happy to replace them if I need you in time, though I don&#x27;t expect that to be necessary any time soon.</li>
            <li>Brushes are great , them seem like great quality , overall worth the price</li>
            <li>these are pretty good</li>
            <li>first time trying brushes on my nails, good beginner set.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good brushes.</li>
            <li>I have become a pretty good nail artist as a result.</li>
            <li>The product arrived early, and I&#x27;ve already started using them to make beautiful nail designs.</li>
            <li>This product is pretty good considering the price.</li>
            <li>First, I want to say these brushes are good for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>This is my first set and the quality is good, but the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>these are pretty good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;nevertheless, the brushes work well, and they look beautiful and professional.</li>
            <li>Pretty good brushes.</li>
            <li>First, the delivery time was good, I suppose, so it got one star.</li>
            <li>She loved them, they are a variety of sizes and because they are not expensive, she doesn&#x27;t have to worry about ruining them.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for the good item and the fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Comes with all the tools you need and they are pretty good for the price</li>
            <li>These are very inexpensive brushes but are really nice!</li>
            <li>For the price, there are pretty good brushes.  </li>
            <li>they work pretty good</li>
            <li>They work great and the price was awesome, but I had to glue the brushes to their handles, they fall right off if you pull on them even a little.</li>
            <li>These are wonderful for different effects and fine detailing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good value for the price with many different types of brushes.</li>
            <li>im enjoying them very much!! :)</li>
            <li>Excited to try them!</li>
            <li>I use them to do sweet nail designs! :)</li>
            <li>Great for experimenting and new design ideas.</li>
            <li>I do so much nail art free style and this set is great for anything I have in mind.  </li>
            <li>I love the variety of precision brushes that help make my nail art easy to do.</li>
            <li>I love these Nail Art Painting Pen Brust they are easy to use compared on the toothpick</li>
            <li>I always have super glue handy in an accident prone household.</li>
            <li>I can still use them just make sure that when you clean them with acetone you don&#x27;t leave me there for more than 4 seconds :)</li>
            <li>One of my favorites has a metal ball on the tip of it, so you can easily apply polka dots on your nails, which I think is really cute.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brushes are more defined and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The only word that I can use to say what best describes this product it cheap.</li>
            <li>The variety is nice but the quality is obviously not that great.</li>
            <li>but they are not as easy to clean as i would have liked</li>
            <li>The pricing was ideal for 15 brushes overall, as going to the store costs more just for 3-5 brushes.</li>
            <li>I liked these brushes because they are easy to clean and the price makes them disposable if need be.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to work with and clean</li>
            <li>Every single one of them seems to be in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Great product, also came 4 weeks early!</li>
            <li>The bristles are very fine and ideal from detailed work such as nail art.  </li>
            <li>I love these for fine detail.</li>
            <li>The brushes are fine, however you&#x27;d think something that will probably come into contact with nail polish remover would be more durable against acetone.</li>
            <li>The brushes are made of a fine brush all the way to a thicker brush with many variations in between.</li>
            <li>Use non Acetone nail polishes to clean!</li>
            <li>You will find a brush to do just about everything from details, lines, clean up, and there is even a dotting tool!</li>
            <li>Love designing my nails and they work perfectly and come just as expected!</li>
            <li>I actually brought them cause I needed to clean my laptop around the keys and these are perfect!</li>
            <li>good product i just need to practice more because it takes a steady hand, and know how.  </li>
            <li>Very professional and very nice for the price.  </li>
            <li>These are very good quality, wooden brushes not flimsy plastic.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very good , but the heads of them seem to constantly fall off at the slightest touch .</li>
            <li>There is a very good assortment and even two of the same brush</li>
            <li>The brushes aren&#x27;t very good quality but mine have held up well under moderate use (2-3 times per week) and no bristles are falling out.</li>
            <li>they are very easy to use and easy to clean</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re versatile and clean easy!</li>
            <li>Makes nail art easy and fun!!</li>
            <li>I like all the brushes so far none have started falling apart and the designs I have been doing work great with these brushes</li>
            <li>The price is great for these and so far they have worked well for me.</li>
            <li>love how they are comfortable, in your fingers, while working.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>im happy with them so far</li>
            <li>I know I am not the first to \\&quot;go there\\&quot; on my eye makeup with nail brushes, but I just wanted mention that these are quite useful for the idea and a great price.</li>
            <li>These are pretty darn good considering how cheap they are.</li>
            <li>Wow, what an array of brushes -- you&#x27;re bound to find a size and shape for every need, not to mention that they vary in stiffness which is great for detail work.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t beleive i got so many for so cheap.</li>
            <li>Love all the different sizes and shapes, can do some beautiful art work with these</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a great kit for someone starting out in nail art (such as I was) to play around and see what types of brushes you like best.</li>
            <li>So many to use, and they don&#x27;t feel flimsy or cheap.</li>
            <li>I was happy though that the set arrived early, but again, the crappy quality kinda overlooks the arrival speed.</li>
            <li>These give me so many options, which is important</li>
            <li>I also love that it was so cheap</li>
            <li>That can be important to most nail art fanatics.</li>
            <li>I run a beauty parlor and clients these days look for more detailed nail painting.</li>
            <li>and I hope you enjoy this product like I did:)</li>
            <li>If you are really into doing nails for yourself or others and want them to look good, don&#x27;t buy these.....</li>
            <li>I purchased this set for my 15-yr old grand-daughter who has an obsession with nail polish and art.&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived soon after her birthday, but I am sure that she will be delighted to receive one more</li>
            <li>I loved this item it works really well.</li>

            <li>it comes in a sealed plastic type of Bag/ package kinda like u would find special brushes in at like Michels!</li>
            <li>but they turned out to be just right !!</li>

            <li>took 2 weeks to arrive, the brushes are really nice but one of my brushes wasnt glued right so</li>
            <li>Very nicely made and the bristles are soft and keep to shape.</li>

            <li>I ordered the 28 th of November and they came in the 16th of December, but other than that the brushes are awesome and can&#x27;t beat it for the price, will def buy again if I lose or break the brushes..</li>
            <li>They work perfectly and I love the little pouch to keep them organized.</li>
            <li>great little product arrived in good time</li>
            <li>Brushes come off sometimes, but overall a good buy!</li>
            <li>Other then that, they are great for beginners!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t break after the first use, there are so many different type of brushes, and it&#x27;s a great price!</li>
            <li>I bought a set of 4 brushes for 15$ at a local beauty supply store and they are as good as these brushes!</li>
            <li>Fun would recommend and buy again! :)</li>
            <li>These brushes and other specialty detail tools  are wonderful.  </li>
            <li>doing my daughters nails is so much more exciting with these designs i can create!</li>
            <li>The brushes are so cool!</li>
            <li>These brushes are cool!</li>
            <li>I  cannot wait to start making cool designs with the brushes!</li>
            <li>I bought it for a friend, who actually uses it more for acrylic painting than nail painting, but she says they&#x27;re pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>Nice quality amazing for the modest price.</li>
            <li>These are good quality brushes and work amazing, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would easily recommend to anyone - bakers, nail artists, painters, crafters and so on.</li>
            <li>They, although did break easily.  </li>
            <li>and also it&#x27;s notvery easy to work with;</li>
            <li>they get the nail art jobs done and they wash easily.</li>
            <li>Really easy to use.</li>
            <li>Came very quickly</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- easy to use</li>
            <li>They are well made and easy to use.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re easy to wash and none of my brushes have fallen apart yet.</li>
            <li>Easy to work with and draws to my expectation.</li>
            <li>I was able to do more than I could ever imagine with this set, and its worth it just to use for manicure clean-up.</li>
            <li>For the price (worth much more) you won&#x27;t do better.  </li>
            <li>Came apart too easily.</li>
            <li>brushes easily fall off stick</li>
            <li>They fall apart really easily</li>
            <li>but I can see how making dots and swirls would be easy with these brushes.</li>
            <li>VARIETY OF STYLES MAKE IT EASY TO USE FOR ANY PROJECT,</li>
            <li>Great for many different styles of nails!</li>
            <li>They have allowed me to easily expand my nail-art creations.</li>
            <li>Great so many different size and shape brushes</li>
            <li>but that was a easy fix ..</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to use and easy to experiment with.</li>
            <li>Easy to use study</li>
            <li>but I used acrylic paint and it easily took off with water if you use nail polish use nail polish remover to remove it also  </li>
            <li>The heads come off so easily and the hairs of the brushes fall out continuously.</li>
            <li>For me, the paint doesn&#x27;t wash off easily either.</li>
            <li>This nail brush set makes it easy to do your nails at home.</li>
            <li>-up is just as easy.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to use non acetone polish remover for clean up.</li>
            <li>Have used similar items, but these are better quality and a great price for the product.</li>
            <li>The bristles fall out easily.</li>
            <li>Shipping &amp; arrival very quick.</li>
            <li>Be sure to clean and maintain</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much because these were cheap, but they get the job done surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold, bristles seem sturdy</li>
            <li>It is get in my hand n easy to hold.</li>
            <li>They where paintbrushes but the metal part came off of the wood part way to easily.</li>
            <li>They all come in a plastic cover and most of them have covers on them to keep them clean and to keep their shape intact.</li>
            <li>Makes doing designs on her nails easy and neat.</li>
            <li>Quite a variety of brush sizes for nails, not as easy to design with, but I am getting there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only brush that I find not to great is the fan brush - I have not been able to use it</li>
            <li>I bought the brushes so i could be more creative &amp; make lots of designs and the brushes are really useful andI</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use them as nail brushes, either, they could easily be used as make-up brushes.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great product and came in about 2-3 weeks. :)</li>
            <li>and they are still going strong.</li>
            <li>Good selection and the main reason I set away for this item.</li>
            <li>The brushes had a strong odor when I opened them, like the smell of varnish.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect them to be as good since they were so cheap</li>
            <li>Brush hairs didn&#x27;t hold their shap/ form very well so they wouldn&#x27;t be good for detailed art on nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My DIL Loved the set as she is just starting to do her Own nails instead of going to a Salon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brushes are smooth and fine, clean easy and are well built!</li>
            <li>I wanted nail art brushes to design my own manicures, and, sure enough, I was able to create some master pieces with these brushes!</li>
            <li>Took awhile to come here but it was within the long shipping time but it&#x27;s very good.</li>
            <li>they are really good, and brushes of all different thicknesses, i am excited to try them out!!</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a very good product and I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Wow amazing!</li>
            <li>They came fast and I am very glad with these brushes.</li>
            <li>Using the nail brushes for the first time is Amazing</li>
            <li>the quality for the price is pretty amazing, i don&#x27;t think you can get it anywhere else....</li>
            <li>and these were a gift for that, they where amazing and exactly what I needed for class.</li>
            <li>Pretty nice brushes but the paint may come off the handles if exposed to acetone.</li>
            <li>This kind of ruined the brushes they aren&#x27;t exactly the way I got them now</li>
            <li>Its pretty nice considering the price.</li>
            <li>but it would be good to add some glue to the metal part because it does fall off other than that its good.</li>
            <li>I have use some of those for applying a normal coat of enamel, it works good.</li>
            <li>but I am looking forward to trying them out, they feel pretty nice.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m assuming they must be pretty nice.</li>

            <li>My favorite pen is the dotting pen, because it does very pretty dots.</li>
            <li>They work, they are wonderful, they don&#x27;t release the hairs as most cheap brushes usually do.  </li>

            <li>Having fun with this product and will recommend it to all my friends with nails to do!</li>
            <li>the price is great and delivery didn&#x27;t take as long as I thought it would have.  </li>
            <li>Totes worth the wait!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be much more upset if I had paid more, I kind of expected that to happen.</li>
            <li>Each brush was excellent quality exactly why I expected!</li>
            <li>I was really excited about these brushes until the tops started falling off.</li>
            <li>These arrived about 2-3 weeks sooner than the estimated delivery date which made me so excited.  </li>
            <li>I bought these for my daughter as a stocking stuffer, The brushes for the most part are good enough quality, one of the brushes was damaged but not unusable, they were great for the price, I certainly couldn&#x27;t have found anything like this anywhere else for so cheap, I did shop it prior to finding these.</li>
            <li>Maybe it just takes practice, I&#x27;m kind of new to designing nails</li>
            <li>I read a review that said not to use acetone to clean, but I did &amp; nothing happened.</li>
            <li>They clean well.</li>
            <li>super cheap.</li>
            <li>They do not give clean lines and i wouldn&#x27;t recommend you buy this product.</li>
            <li>The work well, clean well.  </li>
            <li>The brushes clean up well too, and the bristles seem to be attached well and don&#x27;t seem to come off on my nails.</li>
            <li>I HAVEN&#x27;T TRIED TO USE ANY POLISH REMOVER TO CLEAN THEM</li>
            <li>You get so many nice quality brushes for a low price.</li>
            <li>When you hold any brush you can tell it&#x27;s super cheap stuff</li>
            <li>The tips of the brushes fall off the sticks so make sure you have some glue handy to slip them back on.</li>
            <li>They Paint well and clean up well.</li>
            <li>Clean them off with polish remover when done.</li>
            <li>Beware though that the paint on the brush handles strips when inserted into acetone to clean the brushes.</li>
            <li>You cannot clean these with acetone.  </li>
            <li>Clean up well without loosing all the hairs.</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t the best but worth the few dollars.  </li>
            <li>I like using these brushes for clean up on my nails and using the stripers.</li>
            <li>just wanted to know how to clean them without ruining them.......</li>
            <li>but these make painting nails fun and easy to create designs.</li>
            <li>it was really cheap and had 15 different  pieces it worked really good</li>
            <li>/&gt;Essentially, get these brushes only if you&#x27;re a first-timer and can&#x27;t find good cheap paintbrushes at the store.</li>
            <li>just clean where you applied nail polish.</li>
            <li>but they just wont get clean.</li>
            <li>clean mine up with a no-lint pad and acetone without any problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Essentially, get these brushes only if you&#x27;re a first-timer and can&#x27;t find good cheap paintbrushes at the store.</li>
            <li>Super cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Overall, I can see why this is so popular among nail artists :)</li>
            <li>To clean it&#x27;d be easier if you had 100% acetone nail polish.</li>
            <li>show u what to do with all the brushes but how to clean the brushes.</li>
            <li>so just clean the tips dont dip them all in</li>
            <li>They clean up well.</li>
            <li>Super cheap looking</li>
            <li>the store easi;y and clean well too</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching everywhere on how to clean the brushes after using them</li>
            <li>Finding good brushes that produce incredible nail art is incredibly difficult these days.</li>
            <li>We will never be professional nail artists, but for this family, they are the perfect tools for teen experimentation.</li>
            <li>Super cheap, in quality and $$, but they still do the job.</li>
            <li>but as soon as you use nail polish remover to clean the nail polish the finish of the brush starts to come off...</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s not needed if you clean the brush</li>
            <li>Arrived in good time, this set is better made than I had expected for the price.</li>
            <li>I really like then there great for doing lots of good designs there are many to choose from, and there cheap what else can u ask for...... only one thing they take to long to arrive.</li>
            <li>Very cheap but of decent quality!</li>
            <li>Not even sure as the global quality was pretty good.</li>
            <li>The bristles are pretty skinny and easy to do detailed work.</li>
            <li>they are very sturdy and the price is very cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very precise and these tools work very well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of strong not really cheap but nice</li>
            <li>do recommend this product, and specially the seller!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Or what types of nail polish to use it with or is their special paint for them??</li>
            <li>Order these right away!</li>
            <li>They are not too fun to clean but they work fantastic.</li>
            <li>The rest of the brushes have decent quality but not really the best.</li>
            <li>these are more like temporary brushes unless you really keep them clean</li>
            <li>I bought these brushes so I could do detailed manicures, though my hands are not the most steady.</li>
            <li>When the package arrived at my house, the little bag containing the brushes was pretty damaged, but the brushes themselves were in perfect condition</li>
            <li>I have tried so hard to find really fine brushes and haven&#x27;t been successful, until now!  </li>
            <li>If you are like me, that like to create new designs and have some fun doing your nails you will love it!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for high end ones please feel free to keep looking and pay the appropriate price.  </li>
            <li>This may sound bizarre, but these little bitty brushes are great for eyelining!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These brushes were great at first, I was excited to use them once they came in, but I&#x27;ve had them for more than half a year</li>
            <li>I got the brushes sooner than expected but for what I paid, they are great.</li>
            <li>Great price and came a lot quicker than expected.</li>
            <li>It was working great for about two tries.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the service I am satisfied with the item.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve created cool designs with them on my nails.</li>
            <li>The brushes are nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>Not only are these practical, but they&#x27;re also good at what they do</li>
            <li>Good enough for my use anyway.</li>
            <li>The brushes are all really nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I have always wanted to get into learning how to do cool designs on my nails like how they do in nail salons, and with the price of these</li>
            <li>cheap too, so its worth it.</li>
            <li>Not only are they inexpensive but they are of really good quality.</li>
            <li>Probably would be better for the real nail artists who use paint.</li>
            <li>Nice set of brushes for adult paint by numbers.</li>
            <li>plus it&#x27;s like another full time job.</li>
            <li>I use these mostly for detail work on my paintings, they do the job very well.</li>
            <li>But since it was free shipping and came from China it was still worth the wait.</li>
            <li>so cool</li>
            <li>For the price, Its a good beginner set if you&#x27;re using acrylic paints only and water.</li>
            <li>These are ok brushes and work very well</li>
            <li>Overall, good product</li>
            <li>these are useful but are cheaply made hence the price.</li>
            <li>Came fast in the mail I love it</li>
            <li>This was such a good price for a nail art set.</li>
            <li>I recommend keeping an old dish towel handy when designing to wipe off excess polish before cleaning.</li>
            <li>Love it highly recommend!</li>
            <li>would say it&#x27;s worth the price since they are fairly cheap.</li>
            <li>overall, good quality</li>
            <li>most of them work really well.</li>
            <li>A few of them have had issues with the bristles falling out, which certainly isn&#x27;t ideal for a nail brush.</li>
            <li>This was a really good quality product, especially for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>I have only good things to say about my brush collection.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know nail art from a mail cart, but my daughter thought they were cool and pointed this one and that one out and explained how neat they were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i love it and would really recommend it for anybody who has time and patience for nail art</li>
            <li>the wait shipping cost or money go to a art store and pay full price for these</li>
            <li>but overall good</li>
            <li>Nice set,  although a couple of the brush tops pulled off with the clear protective ends.  </li>
            <li>thank you very much,i love it,so amazing.now i can get my design</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them to do a full one-stroke flower design, including leaves and vines.</li>
            <li>Good luck to you in future sales.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>Really cool to paint miniatures on a budget.</li>
            <li>But overall good.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made but worth the price</li>
            <li>and I wanted to do some cool designs</li>
            <li>Good range on different types of brushes.</li>
            <li>Loved the different brushes that you received.  </li>
            <li>It gets the job done, good for starting out and practicing nail art designs.</li>
            <li>fast delivery love it</li>
            <li>but overall it is a good product for the price.</li>
            <li>good for your money, but definitely not pro.</li>
            <li>good for starters such as myself</li>
            <li>Not bad.  </li>
            <li>But I was pleasantly surprised to find that these are pretty good quality.</li>
            <li>Not a bad set of brushes</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price, but some of the paintbrushes did start to fall apart.</li>
            <li>Not a bad deal for the price.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft, and seem to be of pretty good quality.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price i paid</li>
            <li>Not bad product.  </li>
            <li>It took a couple weeks to arrive but that is not bad since it was coming from out of the country.</li>
            <li>The packaging was not bad.</li>
            <li>Not a bad price point given the usage.</li>
            <li>Shipping does take a bit but not bad considering its coming from another country.</li>
            <li>not bad for the price though.</li>
            <li>I did receive my purchase on time and paid a decent price that was the only good thing!</li>
            <li>These are pretty good nail tools, the only downfall is they fall apart easy..</li>
            <li>These brushes work  good however, when they arrived, I had to super glue the ends back on.</li>
            <li>I was worried about the quality but having used them at least a dozen times since I bought them, I am super happy!</li>
            <li>thanks so much !!!!</li>
            <li>the could of have made it more stronger and not weak</li>
            <li>I was excited to use the brushes and the first time I used one, the pieces fell apart!  </li>
            <li>The size is right for close, precise work.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re just the right size for nail art though, as you need small/tiny brushes for detailed designs.</li>
            <li>they are strong and durable and exactly what i needed.</li>
            <li>These work beautifully, but there are slight issues with them.</li>
            <li>From now, if I really like one model in particular, maybe I would spend more for better quality????</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t shed, and were vey easy for me to se my first time.</li>
            <li>I was expecting them to be cheap and fall apart when I tried to use or clean them, But they  have held up pretty well.</li>
            <li>One brush broke, but other than that, they still work great.</li>
            <li>Great for nails and other art work.  </li>
            <li>other than that.. great products</li>
            <li>Great price &amp; I got it even quicker than expected!</li>
            <li>Great buy and can a lot sooner then expected!</li>
            <li>A great variety of brushes and tools for creating endless designs on nails.</li>
            <li>My brushes arrived in great shape, other than one brush being bent during the mailing process.</li>
            <li>Great Brushes and arrived as expected!</li>
            <li>but two of the nail brushes were bent and messed up when i got them but the other brushes work great.</li>
            <li>Spend a little more money and get good brushes</li>
            <li>Otherwise, really enjoying trying new designs I couldn&#x27;t do before!</li>
            <li>One more thing to add, is I clean all my new brushes before storing them or using them,</li>
            <li>but super glue took care of that.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and as described.</li>
            <li>these brushes have met my hopes tremendously...</li>
            <li>super for just graffic design painting.</li>
            <li>great for the ladies young and old.</li>
            <li>These brushes come in so many sizes that you have many different options for your nails.</li>
            <li>For the first time I was able to apply polish and not get ANY on my cuticles and even managed a pretty durn good smile line on French tips.</li>
            <li>I have used these numerous time and have been very impressed with them and the quality, especially considering the price.</li>
            <li>not even worthy of amount paid.</li>
            <li>but I will fix that with super glue.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly</li>
            <li>But super glue can fix that</li>
            <li>The product arrived promptly but some items fell apart just as quickly.</li>
            <li>We are able to do so much with them when having fun designing her nails and mine.  </li>
            <li>Items arrived quickly and were well packaged to prevent any damage.</li>
            <li>We were able to craft our pictures such as minions, cupcakes, shamrocks, valentine, and more.</li>
            <li>This 15 pc brush (1 dot dabber) set of nail art brushes will allow me to add artistic embellishment to my otherwise decorated cards...</li>
            <li>I love this product and I will repurchase more in the future</li>
            <li>but I just use super glue.</li>
            <li>In short, I&#x27;ve paid more for latest quality.</li>
            <li>Such a great price and came in within a reasonable time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and as advertised.  </li>
            <li>You probably dont need all of them unless you&#x27;re doing some super ornate work.</li>
            <li>If you need it quick, look somewhere else.</li>
            <li>They also arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>The paint chips off quickly also.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also easy to clean and work very well</li>
            <li>The tops have popped off a lot and the nail polish paint gets stuck quickly.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>You are getting more for your money with this product and I will most definitely be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li>but i think i may hv to super glue all the pieces together</li>
            <li>So many brushed for so many designs.</li>
            <li>some ruined quickly but thats okayy</li>
            <li>trust me these brushes are better to have than buying nail polishes with the skinny brushes which cost more than a regular size bottle.</li>
            <li>received quickly.  </li>
            <li>They got to me rather quickly and have lasted over a year.</li>
            <li>CALIDAD Y SUPER ACORDE CON EL TAMAÑO  </li>
            <li>These are a super deal for the brushes.  </li>
            <li>some heads fall off, just stick some super glue</li>
            <li>Very nice large set with several size and style options.</li>
            <li>It has a broad range to choose from and nice bristles.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this set if you are looking to expand your creative side on your nails.</li>
            <li>highly recommend these :)</li>
            <li>LOVe this vendor they ship super fast price is right &amp; brushes  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased to say my item came 10days early!!</li>
            <li>It is not a bad product but the bristles came apart easily and straight away</li>
            <li>But buy two if you don&#x27;t clean them right away</li>
            <li>These are just ok for kids who may want to do nail art, I would say after getting these and using them a few times, spend some more money on better ones.</li>
            <li>(These are also my very first nail art brushes if that helps)</li>
            <li>The brushes ends came off during the very first use.</li>
            <li>Cheap and really fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>But overall very satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li>Because they were pretty cheap</li>
            <li>This is a good selection of brushes for nail art or other detailed work.</li>
            <li>I use them for personal use and I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I suspect after a lot of use and cleaning they will start to lose bristles, but these were a pretty cheap purchase</li>
            <li>These paint brushes are great for a first time use and first time use only.</li>
            <li>These brushes were such a great price, and I love all the different shapes.</li>
            <li>These are very pretty as well as functional.</li>
            <li>I work with miniatures and the brushes were ideal and the price was unbelievable</li>
            <li>Overall I am very satisfied</li>
            <li>Poduct took a long time to get to me but otherwise good quality.</li>
            <li>With so many options she&#x27;s found new ways to design nails and be as artistic as her heart desires.</li>
            <li>I used an acrylic brush cleaner solution to clean the brushes and the bristles shaped back nicely.</li>
            <li>for those of you who are new to the whole diy nail thing, there are some pretty good tutorials on youtube on how to use these brushes.</li>
            <li>make sure you wash them right after you use them, or you will only be able to use each brush once.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are soft and easy to use!</li>
            <li>It was well worth the wait as the brushes are an extreme value and are very nice quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve become quite creative with my designs using the new brushes.</li>
            <li>I just love my new brushes.</li>
            <li>I LOVE NAIL ART, so i am always looking for new nail art accessories to purchase.</li>
            <li>they were shipped very fast and have been extremely useful!</li>
            <li>All you need to do to clean these brushes is pure acetone!</li>
            <li>Works great for my small, detailed woodworking projects...</li>
            <li>I got fifteen nail art pens and for less than $3 it is a great deal.</li>
            <li>really good and lay them out to dry</li>
            <li>Good to try out if you&#x27;re just starting to get interested in nail art.</li>
            <li>She really found these easy to use, she has done her nails over &amp; over using these tools.</li>
            <li>They easily come apart, so don&#x27;t water the whole brush (brush plus stick)</li>
            <li>All my expectations were full filled and thanks to them now</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and strong brush handles.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to invest too much until I could see if it was something I was interested in learing more.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t cost much, but they shouldn&#x27;t -- they fall apart really easily.</li>

            <li>Overall EXTREMELY PLEASED!</li>
            <li>If your willing to wait for 1month for them to come then this product is for you!</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>I got them in exactly two weeks when they were supposed to take almost 4 weeks!</li>
            <li>The fan brushes are good for loose glitter placement.</li>
            <li>but I was able to put it back together easily.</li>
            <li>Let your mind go wild and be super creative.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are very light weight and also come in a clear plastic flap closing pouch.</li>
            <li>Having all sorts of different shapes really makes it easy to create your own nail designs.</li>
            <li>Added a little glue &amp; now the are great.</li>
            <li>These are also great for dipping in nail polish remover to clean small spots you&#x27;ve messed up.</li>
            <li>Good product, cheap, and it takes a little while to receive the item in the mail</li>
            <li>They still work great and are nice brushes, only problem was that little handle to brush separation.</li>
            <li>I like that they&#x27;re user friendly even for someone such as myself who is really just winging it, and also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>All the pieces are there, I can finally make amazing nail art with these, I would recommend this to you if you do nails.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much from the brushes because they were so cheap.  </li>
            <li>Although I did purchase these brushes for nail designs, I find that most of them are particularly useful for detailed eyelining, such as waterlining and tightlining.</li>
            <li>I think that the quantity of the product for the price was great but a few of the heads came off after one use.</li>
            <li>Yes, they are cheap and some came a bit too frayed to use very well, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t really complain since they are so cheap.</li>
            <li>I used some for a huge project that turned out really well.  </li>
            <li>These are amazing although made for nails i used them for regular painting.</li>
            <li>These are amazing nail detail brushes, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a few times for my nails and it works great.</li>
            <li>Such an amazing set of brushes and for the price you cant beat it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Item as described, worth for the wait at this price and quality.</li>
            <li>Well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price 😃</li>
            <li>Yes they were a great price, but they are poorly made and the top of my brushes would fall off and fray.</li>
            <li>This pack comes with all kinds of different shapes to put any kind of design on your nails.</li>
            <li>I use these brushes frequently and it&#x27;s not a lie to say that this set is everything you need and more.</li>
            <li>Totally worth $2.</li>
            <li>Worth</li>
            <li>But definitely worth the price</li>
            <li>Worth the buy.</li>
            <li>but when I received it, it was worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>The brush still worked, but it is something worth noting.</li>
            <li>Worth the wait.</li>
            <li>They are so useful and neat.</li>
            <li>But its ok, I kinda fixed it......</li>
            <li>Have not used them, but they are as they look, and for the cost it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the wait.</li>
            <li>its useful for what i do</li>
            <li>STILL WORTH THE PRICE</li>
            <li>I thought the really tiny flatter brushes would be more precise when I tried to draw skinny lines on my nails</li>
            <li>It took a while for me to receive my brushes in the mail, but they were worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of using the brushes they are a lot of fun.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it was worth the money I paid for it</li>
            <li>always makes me smile.  </li>
            <li>i ordered these for my artist child ok 24 year old.</li>
            <li>So much fun.  </li>
            <li>Fun for me and my daughter to play with.</li>
            <li>I also had a few problems with others but as far as the seller... GREAT!!</li>
            <li>These are fun if you like painting designs on your nails.</li>
            <li>my daughter loved it and it shipped sooner than we expected</li>
            <li>I like to take scissors to my paint brushes to tailor the tips for my own quirky way of painting.  </li>
            <li>fun for the  for price</li>
            <li>This is a fun nail art kit.</li>
            <li>My Nail Art Painting Pen Brush arrived as promised and so far I have enjoyed using it</li>
            <li>The quality was poor but price was awesome!</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>It was well worth the wait for the price and quality.</li>
            <li>Grandaughter having so much fun</li>
            <li>When I was done, I had to throw them away, but they were well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, for the price I payed, that was no big deal.</li>
            <li>but well worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re fun for nail art.</li>
            <li>Not awkward at all.</li>
            <li>They came in early, and I love painting with them.</li>
            <li>Good guality for the price,just have to be careful of the painted handles when using polish remover</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand the purpose of some, but the price made it worth it.</li>
            <li>IT WAS WELL WORTH</li>
            <li>Love the brushes, so far.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re having some doubts about this product, no worries because it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>she liked all the different designs she can do</li>
            <li>Now I have some tools to use to create a lot of fun manicure designs.</li>
            <li>These are so much fun to make designs on your nails.</li>
            <li>This took a LONG time to receive, but the quality is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the quality and variety of brushes for such a great price ($2.75).</li>
            <li>DEFINITLEY worth the price.</li>
            <li>I love these they are better quality then expected.</li>
            <li>and these are fun to use</li>
            <li>They are still useable, but for how long?&lt;br /&gt;The price for this product was a good deal, I just expected them&lt;</li>
            <li>Since they come from overseas, it takes awhile to get them but worth the wait</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re of fairly good quality, as they&#x27;re not too rough.</li>
            <li>fun to use.</li>
            <li>I got them in about two weeks (1 week before the estimated delivery date) and this was definitely worth the wait.</li>
            <li>They are what they are worth...</li>
            <li>They have withstood many uses so far, and do not shed at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, WELL worth the money I paid</li>
            <li>the are useful helpful</li>
            <li>These are fun to play with and figure out what they can do.</li>
            <li>Every time I removed the clear caps of the brushes the top of the brush would come off.</li>
            <li>EXTREMELY useful &amp; quite well constructed.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>and this just makes it easier and fun to continue</li>
            <li>They are worth what I paid for them $2.00</li>
            <li>Really worth the money.</li>
            <li>The brushes seem to be OK for a young girl to try embellishing her fingernails.  </li>
            <li>We will come up with ideas of our own or find tutorials on youtube showing different designs we can do.</li>
            <li>Worth it for the price and works well.</li>
            <li>These brushes are nice and go for a low price.</li>
            <li>but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>But I have had lots of success with nial art.....</li>
            <li>Every bush is well made and really useful.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of having all the different choices, but they&#x27;ve all fallen apart.</li>
            <li>Worth the couple bucks</li>
            <li>These were so exciting to receive in the mail.</li>
            <li>But they have done well so far with the things I have done, and I love that there is a variety</li>
            <li>They are having fun with it and the price is just right.</li>
            <li>They work fine for me, and are decent products.</li>
            <li>The Quality was okay because they had to be broken in to and one wasn&#x27;t in tacked in with the wood part over all good for clean up and details</li>
            <li>Also, the bristles harden quickly after your first use.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping and a killer brush set!</li>
            <li>This set arrived quickly and was exactly as shown.</li>
            <li>I received these brushes SUPER fast 13 days before it said they should be here!</li>
            <li>They can eaiser be repaired with super glue or hot glue</li>
            <li>Got these for art work - nice set of small brushes for fine work!</li>
            <li>The brushes break really easily and the tips come off of the wooden stick too easily.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s affordable and cute and comes with a white mini package that keeps the brush clean.</li>
            <li>Only thing is you have to make sure you clean then</li>
            <li>You will want to be sure to clean them thoroughly and properly after each use though, or the bristles will stick together and the brush will not work well in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean with alcohol and letting them air dry.  </li>
            <li>Other then that good product for its price.</li>
            <li>They look good but the just came in a bag and not case like my other ones.</li>
            <li>The shipment came fast and it was worth the money!</li>
            <li>Lots of good brushes for doing nail art or for other cosmetic uses.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, these are good brushes.</li>
            <li>, I use them for other things also not just good for nails but detail painting also.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really helpful in making fun designs!</li>
            <li>So I recieved the set way before time and i am excited about that i used a brush and the whole head came off</li>
            <li>I have only used 2 of them for nail art (because I&#x27;m new to this) but have found them to be very good so far.</li>
            <li>the only thing i dont know is how to keep them clean!!</li>
            <li>They were shipped to me very fast and is exactly what it says!</li>
            <li>The paint comes right out.</li>
            <li>well right out of the package</li>
            <li>Some came apart right after opening.</li>
            <li>The price was right, delivered to my door</li>
            <li>However, after continued use the heads of the brushes start to pop right off.</li>
            <li>My order got messed up and I caught it right away that when I changed payment type it accidentally ordered two.  </li>
            <li>I went to work right away on some nail designs to try them out</li>
            <li>Was sent right out.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t Amazon Prime, so it doesn&#x27;t come right away</li>
            <li>another brush, the metal part fell off, and this was right when I opened them</li>
            <li>and she used it right away</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really go wrong here because of how cheap they are, the brushes themselves are not the greatest quality, but overall good enough for the cheap price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just the right tools</li>
            <li>I decided to use them right away as I was going to paint my nails tonight anyways.</li>
            <li>I got the brushes and right when I took them out the bristles weren&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li>and hopefully they&#x27;ll be right eventually.</li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>The brushes broke right after a week</li>
            <li>I received my package yesterday and got right to work with them.</li>
            <li>These look well made and the price was certainly right.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s right as rain.</li>
            <li>Slipped right off.</li>
            <li>I ordered them right away.</li>
            <li>Even for amateurs or new in the nail business is easy to use.</li>
            <li>but you can still work with them for sure the detailing brushes are nice and small.</li>
            <li>contained exactly what I needed to complete many of the step by step instructions I found online.  </li>
            <li>cheep price cheep product don&#x27;t dip in acetone the white paint on brush comes off ,the fan brushes work good for stripes and flat brushes for clean up!</li>
            <li>these are great /just as good as the very expensive ones</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, and got here in decent time....</li>
            <li>cant be used with real nail polish as there is not a way to clean them with out using nail polish remover or acetone.</li>
            <li>and they clean up very well.</li>
            <li>Cheap brushes but decent.</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t clean very well but for the price I cant complain</li>
            <li>The brushes were delivered fairly quickly, and were in good shape with little plastic tubes to protect the bristles.</li>
            <li>White pairing comes of handles very easily</li>
            <li>i really recommend these to anyone who loves to do nail art and needs some new tools. :)</li>
            <li>I spend a lot of time doing my nails and creating new designs for my blog, so a good set of brushes is crucial to have in my arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before making the purchase, I shopped around quite a bit and took the time to read the Amazon reviews.</li>
            <li>This is a very large quantity of brushes.  </li>
            <li>a very smart purchase</li>
            <li>I really love this set and for less than the cost of most nail polish I got it shipped and can start experimenting with my nails.</li>
            <li>Also make sure you clean the brushes right after using them because the dried paint isn&#x27;t too easy to get off.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for the ultimate in professional high quality, these may not be it, but if they just have to work well, hold up nicely, and clean up easily</li>
            <li>Great brushes for small jobs, can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>No, they are not top quality but for scale model builders they are a great choice</li>
            <li>This kit is really efficient and cool.</li>
            <li>While these are great brushes,I was under the impression they were for painting on canvas as I found them IN crafts and paint supplies, I will see if they can work for the small areas I need to paint</li>
            <li>The most specific reason why I bought these brushes was because they look so nice in white!</li>
            <li>great set of brushes for an unbelievable price.  </li>
            <li>So they were good at first but after a while they get bad; I rather pay more for better quality than this cheap quality.</li>
            <li>These are SUPER STINKY - like pure chemicals.  </li>
            <li>They are decent and do what they are supposed to, overall I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
            <li>but this large set was quite a bargain!</li>
            <li>but I needed good stripping brushes, they arrived 2 weeks sooner than expected well packed, and not a broken or bent brush.</li>
            <li>Overall a great buy, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d gladly pay a few more bucks for something that keeps breaking.  </li>
            <li>but so far they are holding up with good points after several uses.</li>
            <li>but they are GREAT for home use and even if you feel the need to buy an extra set to have as back up</li>
            <li>Great got them early then expected.</li>
            <li>What a great deal they have similar smaller set at Sally for $20!!!</li>
            <li>They come starched though, so make sure you rinse them gently to get the bristles soft again.</li>
            <li>Makes applying nail art much easier and look more professional.</li>
            <li>So much fun with so many different brushes -</li>
            <li>The item arrived quickly, and my sister absolutely adores it.</li>
            <li>Good value to have a collection of brushes, but I can&#x27;t think of what I&#x27;d use half of them</li>
            <li>a nice variety for a few bucks plus free shipping you cant pass up this deal.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, the glue holding the brushes together is sturdy, and I will purchase them again in the future.</li>
            <li>However, I found that I only use several of the brushes, but it&#x27;s a great deal anyway.  </li>
            <li>I know that I will use these very often to create my artistic nail designs.  </li>
            <li>you are looking for something cheap for minimal use than they are ok.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the option of the different brushes available &amp; designs you can make.</li>
            <li>I really like the different kind of brushes</li>
            <li>These were nice but metal handles were a bit loose.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping and is exactly what that pictures shows.</li>
            <li>Great for intricate nail art, clean up &amp; for various nail art designs, the possibilities are endless.</li>
            <li>These are decent quality brushes!!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the brushes very much but they seem to work well.</li>
            <li>This product was shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>These very tiny brushes work for when I have to be very detailed in the portraits I make.</li>
            <li>Please keep in mind these a priced very reasonable.</li>
            <li>But when one of my good brush for miniature cost 5+x the cost of this entire set, these brush are great for work that are damaging to brushes (e.g. dry brushing, painting over large area of rough surface)</li>
            <li>They feel very cheap and didn&#x27;t last after the first use.</li>
            <li>Good little throw away</li>
            <li>Loved these brushes and they even came with a little stylist.</li>
            <li>I need to learn how to use these more but theyre not super easy to start using.</li>
            <li>high quality &amp; professional looking. :)</li>
            <li>They are all very soft and well worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>I will be buying a new set that hopefully is easier to clean, but overall it is an ok set for the price</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>Many different brush sizes for every design you can imagine.</li>
            <li>Luckily the brushes I actually needed were fine.</li>
            <li>I received exactly what appears in the photo.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The set has so many different sizes</li>
            <li>I love how affordable they are and quality is solid</li>
            <li>They are exactly how they were described to me.</li>
            <li>but I was able to bend them back and still use them.</li>
            <li>First time using nail art brushes.</li>
            <li>Have used them for several types of paint and been satisfied with all of them.</li>
            <li>You can see the hot glue that they used in some of the brushes.</li>
            <li>Overall, they are OK for the price</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of a pearl white.</li>
            <li>exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>I love the different types of brushes.</li>
            <li>so they work pretty well for that.</li>
            <li>Love the variety of different types of brushes this kit comes with!</li>
            <li>I like this set of brushes, there are so many different types.</li>
            <li>So many different size brushes</li>
            <li>I would never have been able to make smaller dolls</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I will buy more from this seller in the future.</li>
            <li>I save so much money at the nail salon since i purchased these fun brushes.</li>
            <li>They seem put together pretty well and for the price</li>
            <li>These brushes arrived exactly two weeks before the estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li>Love all the different shapes and sizes of the tools too!</li>
            <li>The product came EXACTLY how it&#x27;s shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>they actually work better than the brushes i bought at MIchaels..</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>They are exactly as described.</li>
            <li>this pack of several brushes can be used in many ways.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be interested in purchasing from you again.</li>
            <li>I like the brushes and there are many different sizes to chose from.</li>
            <li>These are okay - definitely get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>It arrived in a package post marked from China as a Free gift cell phone case.  </li>
            <li>I got this as a gift and the recipient absolutely LOVES it!</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to fret when you ruin one as they are not expensive.</li>
            <li>Overall, I was pleased.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I hoped for as a newbie to nailart.</li>
            <li>I used them the first day i got them.</li>
            <li>Really!</li>
            <li>The pencils come in a pretty envelope.</li>
            <li>and I think that they will last me for a while :)</li>
            <li>I love the different brushes.</li>
            <li>thank you so much!  </li>
            <li>Went to use them for the first time and they fell apart ....</li>
            <li>Some of the brushes came off stick during first use.</li>
            <li>I have used many of the brushes several times and haven&#x27;t had any issues with shedding brushes.</li>
            <li>I have purchased more brushes from a local store.</li>
            <li>I dont see them lasting in an actual salon, but for personal use they work perfectly.</li>
            <li>Cant wait to use them they look like look pretty good...for a beginer.</li>
            <li>but if you had money for a better set then I suggest getting a different set.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what I was looking for to add designs to my nails.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered several more sets.</li>
            <li>I ended up not really using them more than once, but if you dont mind cleaning these pretty roughly after each use, its a good deal.</li>
            <li>have further sparked my creativity :-)</li>
            <li>They are exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>When I have had enough practice, I will buy a better set.</li>
            <li>One of the heads fell off the first time I opened the package</li>
            <li>i was able to bend it back</li>
            <li>I really thought that they had been worth every penny and they are.</li>
            <li>I love it, it is everything as advertised, I only wish they had larger dotting tools, but for the most part it serves me well</li>
            <li>I love doing different designs on my nails.</li>
            <li>Works really well for the price I paid!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used all the tools yet but the ones I have used work really well!</li>
            <li>I love them, use them daily when I do my nails!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>Save your money to get something pretty.</li>
            <li>It came with so many different kinds that I can do just about anything</li>
            <li>:) I would definitely recommend these brushes and also the seller (UnitedMail).</li>
            <li>The end of the brush came off on the first use.</li>
            <li>Some of the brushes I probably will never use (like most of the larger ones, besides the fan brushes),</li>
            <li>Two of the brushes fell apart on the first use.</li>
            <li>Love you he brushes you can do all different kinds of design&#x27;s..</li>
            <li>I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>At first, I was searching for just a fan brush when I stumbled upon this set for cheaper.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes, I just wished they had smaller tips</li>
            <li>high quality brushes!!</li>
            <li>These brushes arrived promptly and were really reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>It looks like these just hot glue it in there.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s no big deal though I can still use the ones I need most</li>
            <li>I like these brushes they work pretty well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve aways saw pretty nail designs,but they always required nail art brushes.</li>
            <li>also they were more fragile than i expected but still nice.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Brushes are mostly all the same size.</li>
            <li>Paint on handles came off after first use.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>And you really can&#x27;t beat the bang for your buck!  </li>
            <li>Love them, but they are fragile.</li>
            <li>They last forever, and there&#x27;s so many of them.</li>
            <li>Brushes took forever to arrive, then the hairs fell out first time used.  </li>
            <li>Looking forward to using real tools to paint with!</li>
            <li>Within 5 minutes of using the first brush it broke.</li>
            <li>I received exactly what is pictured.  </li>
            <li>not too big of a fan but for the money they were ok.</li>
            <li>There is so many different designs you can do at home with this set.</li>
            <li>Item exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy them again if she needs more.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I didnt realize that there were so many different brushes to use!!  </li>
            <li>They seem to hold up pretty well.</li>
            <li>at first glance they seemed to be nice.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>this set is exactly what is advertised.  </li>
            <li>I have been able to finally do some designs I&#x27;ve been wanting to try!</li>
            <li>It comes exactly what you see.</li>
            <li>I ordered two sets and am sure they will last me for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>my first nail tool set, can&#x27;t wait to ues it.</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>Love them and considering ordering a second set!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>They actually remind me more of artist&#x27;s brushes.  </li>
            <li>The head of some of the brushes came off on first use.</li>
            <li>They arrived were exactly as described.</li>
            <li>so if you try to remove any accidental polish application with a remover, it will more than likely come off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this seller sent me two orders i had to double check to make sure i didnt purchase two</li>
            <li>I love my 15pc nail art brush pen set it finally arrived</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d splurge for a more pro set next time.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li>That being said, I do think the quality of the bristles on some of them should be able to produce a nicer paint flow, therefore only four stars.</li>
            <li>For the price, you absolutely can not beat this!</li>
            <li>The brushes are exactly like the picture shown.</li>
            <li>I got my product on the exact estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li>Save your money buy some higher quality stuff ;)</li>
            <li>i love it and have ordered my second set, gave my 1st set to my sister and she loves them too...</li>
            <li>off)&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love these brushes and can&#x27;t wait to use them for further nail designs.</li>
            <li>but I wanted to see the quality first.</li>
            <li>They range from itty bitty to small (compared to regular brushes), and there&#x27;s also a metal dotter, which is GREAT!</li>
            <li>They shipped fast too!</li>
            <li>It arrived exactly as shown.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I thought it was gonna be.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how fast I  got this!</li>
            <li>They are my first set of nail art brushes</li>
            <li>I first got it and already the brush heads falling of.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like it wasn&#x27;t stuck on In the first place.</li>
            <li>The different sizes make creating designs a breeze, even a beginner can use them :)</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy this product again. :)</li>
            <li>...works well...and its simple and cute.</li>
            <li>The product provided was exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So many styles, shapes and versions of brushes and at a terrific price.</li>
            <li>but they seem pretty sturdy to me.</li>
            <li>Cheap, arrived early, Practical.</li>
            <li>I am actually thinking about ordering a couple more as gifts because of the quality.</li>
            <li>Delivered on time love all the different brushes.</li>
            <li>The ferrules seem to be pretty well made and I have not lost any fibers from the brushes since using them.  </li>
            <li>I think it is great present for person who loves to have strange nail art.</li>
            <li>First of all you can&#x27;t bet this price for all these brushes.</li>
            <li>I will probably buy these again in the future. :))</li>
            <li>At first I thought that the acetone</li>
            <li>Brushes are EXACTLY as pictured.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The few that I did use were good.  </li>
            <li>, I haven&#x27;t used them yet but will and hoping they will be good, since when I received them and they were damaged and dried up as if someone&#x27;s already used them...</li>
            <li>So far I used them twice , they were able to help me do new designs .</li>
            <li>They can be glued back together, but it&#x27;d be nice to not have to almost immediately repair new items.</li>
            <li>/&gt;they are great for tiny details or very long details.</li>
            <li>So far they are proving very useful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a newbie at this, but so far these brushes are easy to handle and allow me to really detail my nails.</li>
            <li>My younger was very excited to receive these brushes.</li>
            <li>I am a crafter and these brushes work great for small projects!  </li>
            <li>And the whole brush head comes right off...</li>
            <li>For 3 bucks these are probably good for less precise designs and smaller jobs, so if you&#x27;re not too serious about your designs and looking for cheap brushes, this is good for you.</li>
            <li>i have used them several times and so far I love them!</li>
            <li>They make a very fine line with the tiny points, each point is individually covered with a plastic protector to preserve the bristles, and they worked just fine.</li>
            <li>i use them every other day it is amazing to me</li>
            <li>so I just wanted a cheap set of brushes intended for nails that I could do cute little designs with.</li>
            <li>Luckily, you can slide them back on, provided they aren&#x27;t caked in nail polish, in which case you should probably clean it first.</li>
            <li>The product arrived early, I was so excited to start using them.</li>
            <li>I love to use the flat chisled brush to remove excess paint and mistakes from my fingers and cuticles.  </li>
            <li>Great quality for the price and arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>Never leave polish in the brush, and clean it with NON ACETONE SOLUTIONS to keep bristles soft.</li>
            <li>every conceivable size cleanly applies polish and there is a variety of styles to execute</li>
            <li>A good variety of brushes for several different styles/designs.</li>
            <li>I have only used about 5 of these brushes, considering some of them can&#x27;t even really be used for nail art unless you get really creative, I guess.</li>
            <li>good product, the brush are soft as I expected and as I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you really cant go wrong with these, awesome!</li>
            <li>I use acrylic paint on my nails over a top coat and they work very well for different techniques and detail.</li>
            <li>I bought some cheap ones on Amazon before that were OK, but lost bristles after a few uses.  </li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a really good brush set to get and especially for the price!</li>
            <li>I have some really nice brushes that I didn&#x27;t want to destroy by using nail polish and acetone just to have some fun painting my nails.</li>
            <li>other than the quality, its a pretty good set of brushes for the price amazon offers you.</li>
            <li>Brushes began to fall apart 2nd time I used them to clean the nail polish out!</li>
            <li>Its not the best quality, I mean it was only like $2</li>
            <li>I especially liked how it arrived in a thin plastic case, all in one piece and not a mess.</li>
            <li>Great for any artist really (for small jobs) !</li>
            <li>but the bristles are a little cheap,they aren&#x27;t very flexible or soft, but they work great for nail art.</li>
            <li>I think these brushes seem a little cheap, but overall, I thought they worked really good for the price that they go for.</li>
            <li>They come apart easily withing the first or second use.</li>
            <li>They pretty much are a one time brush.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I try to make myself pretty , but it cost soooooo much.</li>
            <li>pretty fast.</li>
            <li>While I knew I wasn&#x27;t getting an extremely high-quality brush set at this price, I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using these for a couple months now to create fun art with my home Gel Polish kit.</li>
            <li>Works great for eye makeup, the other brushed that I did not use</li>
            <li>The dotting tool fell off pretty much as soon as I got it.</li>
            <li>, shipping was pretty fast also considering they are coming from another country.</li>
            <li>They were a great price and are exactly the same as some of the other brushes my co-workes had and paid twice as much for</li>
            <li>I use this for pretty much everything to do with nail art.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for, pretty much.</li>
            <li>They are great, even for other such art medias, not just nail.</li>
            <li>Shipping was also pretty fast.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re only good if you want them for beginners the brushes are not thin enough to do some designs</li>
            <li>They are good for small detail work when doing nail art designs at paintthatnaildotcom</li>
            <li>Not worth going threw an exchange/refund but still would be nice to have an undamaged product arrive.</li>
            <li>But other than that, so far so good.</li>
            <li>I actually received two of the same brushes, and end up not getting a dotting tool which I was looking forward to, but the price is so good that it does not bother me much.</li>
            <li>Even my 4 year old daughter loves how i can get done more quickly with these brushes than doing it alone and it also dont take as long as well.</li>
            <li>You definitely get what you pay.. Wasn&#x27;t expecting anything professional or even for them to last more then a month but as soon as I took them out of the package the metal part with the brush fell off of most of them.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t compare with any other brushes though, since this is my first purchase, so I&#x27;m not sure if they are the best ever.</li>
            <li>Make sure after you use it... clean it property or it will get stiff.</li>
            <li>exactly what i expected and more</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected... love them.</li>
            <li>Very well made and arrived a bit late but came with a nice plastic pouch!</li>
            <li>The brushed have since come out of their holders and fray easily.</li>
            <li>Super soft &amp;</li>
            <li>Also super soft on the face</li>
            <li>Easy to fix back on.</li>
            <li>One came broken but that is nothing that a lil hot glue can not fix, the pens work great and they  do not curve when painting.</li>
            <li>but it was easy to stick back together.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase and would definitely purchase again if needed.</li>
            <li>I have had them for several months now and they are still going strong.  </li>
            <li>and they are still going strong a year later.</li>
            <li>The only problem I had was the strong smell as I opened the package.</li>
            <li>Pretty cheap, cheap plastic,  little brush hairs come off.</li>
            <li>I ordered this set specifically for the large brush pictured and it didn&#x27;t come with it.</li>
            <li>No ones nails are that large anyway.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t order this if you need it exactly by a certain date.  </li>
            <li>Overall a great selection and totally worth the few bucks!</li>
            <li>alone with a brushes you receive a dotting tool to make dots, striper brushes which are very difficult to find and brushes that I love you to make flower designs leave the signs and many more.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll probably buy two more sets just in case i ever loose them.</li>
            <li>(a fine tip brush with a few bristles that splay every which way, screwing up any attempts at fine detailing)</li>
            <li>Perfect.. exactly what I wanted it.. even tho there was one broken!!</li>
            <li>But I was disapointed to see that I got 2 of the same brush and not the fine striping brush I wanted.</li>
            <li>They are a set of fine brushes that can only be used for nail art.</li>
            <li>Decent quality at an unbeatable price!</li>
            <li>Are pretty decent quality and work</li>
            <li>I bet they would be pretty decent.</li>
            <li>But they do have pretty decent quality.</li>
            <li>super cheep.some of the medal tips with the brushes fell off, right after I opened the package; had to glue them back on</li>
            <li>Came nicely packaged and with a little case to keep all of the brushes in.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve held up nicely and I haven&#x27;t had any of them break, although one of the tips is a little jiggly.</li>
            <li>I mostly use the small synthetic brushes to clean the sides of my nails with polish remover</li>
            <li>This is a great little set of brushes for an amazingly low price.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>easy to clean with a little bit of nail polish remover</li>
            <li>/&gt;- make sure you know how to clean nail polish off the white brushes, they can get stuck for a long time</li>
            <li>Good but hard to wash</li>
            <li>I dipped the new clean soft brush in the polish pulled it out and tried painting.</li>
            <li>I love how stiff the brush is so I can make a clear fine line, but not for blending lines.&lt;br /&gt;Each</li>
            <li>and I needed different tools than just the dotting tool, these brushes do it all from straight lines and precise designs..</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is a beginner when it comes to nail decorating (and isn&#x27;t in a huge hurry to get them)</li>
            <li>Letting them soak, not soak, washing immediately, washing after the paint dried - nothing made it easy to clean the stripers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thank you so much sending it on time.</li>
            <li>it really should have a notice with the product.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t like them as much.</li>
            <li>They work very well.</li>
            <li>For such a cheap price, it was a steal.</li>
            <li>and i just wish the packagers would be more careful.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really recommend this product because I think that it is a RIP OFF</li>
            <li>/&gt;She is really into doing her nails up</li>
            <li>Al the tops came off the sticks, so just be ready to re-glue.</li>
            <li>Do not order from this seller unless you are ready to wait over a month for your stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another thing was that the brushes that have a brown looking tip are really a orange.</li>
            <li>But that doesn&#x27;t matter much i guess.</li>
            <li>They work very well, haven&#x27;t lost any hairs.</li>
            <li>I guess you really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>they work really well</li>
            <li>I really like the brushes..</li>
            <li>I needed something different to get precise lines</li>
            <li>so expect the delivery time to be very lengthy..</li>
            <li>Very flimsy.</li>
            <li>but like the product variety and how fast I received them.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really purchase then for nail art though.</li>
            <li>even if they don&#x27;t they were cheap enough</li>
            <li>I have been wanting to start doing nail art for a while now, but I dont want to buy  a very expencive pack of brushes.</li>
            <li>Thede arrived as expected the packing could have had more padding  </li>
            <li>My daughter (17 yo) loves doing her nails, and these brushes just made things a whole lot easier for her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but they work and are very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Highly highly recommended!</li>
            <li>it was very convenient</li>
            <li>They also have relatively fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thin and great for nails.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it too much the one time</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t work well as nail tools, or painting really</li>
            <li>so can&#x27;t really complain about that.</li>
            <li>I bought this set for quite a while and it still hold up really well.  </li>
            <li>All ready wrote this one.</li>
            <li>For a kid, who made be going through a fad, I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much $.  </li>
            <li>Will be shopping again very soon.</li>
            <li>The broke really fast</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonable price</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>had went to the store and spent more than 5 bucks on some nail art brushes and I like these way better&lt;</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li>she was very please about the quality and</li>
            <li>/&gt;- quality is decent.&lt;br /&gt;- light weight, stick is wooden</li>
            <li>Hairs falling out and I was screwed out of extra $25 for what was sold as \\&quot;free shipping\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Got it within a reasonable amount of time even with it being around the holidays.</li>
            <li>They were a gift, and the recipient really likes them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They took a whole to get here</li>
            <li>Work really well.</li>
            <li>My daughter didn&#x27;t care too much about returning them</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t really work that well.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t cost much</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>For the price of these I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much.  </li>
            <li>The brushes worked well enough, and I was happy with what I got since I paid such a low price for these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these&lt;br /&gt;brushes for anyone!</li>

            <li>thanks</li>

            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much...</li>
            <li>they are still much cheaper than buying them in a shop or salon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent a lot more on brushes that shed strands.  </li>
            <li>Very articulate brushes</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>Relatively fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier to do it.</li>
            <li>These were very inexpensive brushes</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used them much on my nails.</li>
            <li>They work very well for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>Definitely got what I paid for..super cheap, trinkets.</li>
            <li>The tools were on my porch ready to be used.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I expected better than this.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really beat them for the price.</li>
            <li>So much easier than using those nail art design polishes that come wit</li>
            <li>she had broken one of hers the day before, so it worked out great.</li>
            <li>and I really like them.  </li>
            <li>I have not gotten much use of them for myself</li>
            <li>Ready to use whn</li>
            <li>Very recived item.</li>
            <li>I expected it to be better</li>
            <li>My brushes arrived a whole TWO WEEKS before the estimated arrival date.</li>
            <li>I received the brushes in a reasonable amount of time.  </li>
            <li>I dont really know what else to say about them...</li>
            <li>I really like all the brushes but some of them started coming apart</li>
            <li>The shipping was really fast and the brushes look just like the ones in the pic.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced...</li>
            <li>I have used 4 brushes already and they have made it so much easier to do nail art.</li>
            <li>I really do like the ones I have been using though.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes</li>
            <li>it was fast shipping</li>
            <li>this product is working very well</li>
            <li>I got out the polish and brushes and got straight to work.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>very usseful for nails desings come on time and in great&lt;br /&gt;shape</li>
            <li>A lot of them do have the same function but for the number of brushes, there&#x27;s no complaints given the price and free shipping.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>He really likes the detail they allow him to achieve.</li>
            <li>My daughter is really into doing nails</li>
            <li>The handles are made of wood, and are very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Price was reasonable and quality of brushes matches price.</li>
            <li>but once u go to wipe them off the whole brush comes off</li>
            <li>then you pay for really.</li>
            <li>The white is just cheap paint that gets suuuuuper sticky &amp; smudged.</li>
            <li>They all work really well</li>
            <li>if your a beginner on nail art for fun or professionally this is the kit for you</li>
            <li>I would say it was  quite fast delivery.</li>
            <li>She is really into nail design.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>do not use acetone with these as it will take the cheap white paint off of the brushes and makes them sticky and it gets everywhere.</li>
            <li>i really like it.</li>
            <li>No matter how much you tug at the bristles of the brush, the don&#x27;t come off.</li>
            <li>I really like how there are fifteen brushes in this set.</li>
            <li>I am very up-sad.</li>
            <li>However, for the price you can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>5 weeks waiting, Really?  </li>
            <li>im very upset that is has been over a month without any feedback</li>
            <li>They looked just as pictured, except that they arrived in a cheap, disposable plastic bag instead of the reusable package they are pictured in my seller in last picture posted.</li>
            <li>thanks will be buying again</li>
            <li>Was cheap enough for $2 bucks so why not?</li>
            <li>Thanks to these brushes</li>
            <li>I really could use.</li>
            <li>and it arrived safely and carefully packaged</li>
            <li>They make doing nail art a whole lot easier.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for all you have done for me.</li>
            <li>Thanks, kay</li>
            <li>/&gt;To make the color really  pop</li>
            <li>THANKS.</li>
            <li>and they make the world of designing your nails so much easier .</li>
            <li>Product is as described and came fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Very slender.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, the bristles would come out when I was washing them even if I was gentle which made me nervous thinking</li>
            <li>Makes doing art on my nails much easier.</li>
            <li>makes nail designs so so much easier and so much neater</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how much I trust them.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, we received it in 10 days.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t beat the price and they shipped fast</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect much from these as art brushes but for nail art</li>
            <li>These nail brushes don&#x27;t really work......</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for though, so I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>but once they get wet the glue seems to loosen to where the top falls off</li>
            <li>Very helpful.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Kinda made cheap the brush parts keep falling off the white stick</li>
            <li>I can not get them to do much designing</li>
            <li>making designs is so much eaiser now thati have them.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it works very well with my paint set.</li>
            <li>she will do her nails 10 times in a day if they don&#x27;t turn out how she wants them too.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Those brushes are looking very worn already</li>
            <li>Was a fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping though!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The pouch the came in was very flimsy.</li>
            <li>They are really durable and hold the polish well.</li>
            <li>This product makes doing my nails much easer.</li>
            <li>The nail polish itself doesn&#x27;t really work with the material of the brush.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>The handles are white and feel comfortable.  </li>
            <li>VERY  </li>
            <li>THANKS PLEASE SEND ME INFO FOR MORE&lt;</li>
            <li>i really could design,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>i really consentrate on the design</li>
            <li>, she really wanted a variety of brushes.  </li>
            <li>The brushes were more than I expected.  </li>
            <li>REALLY RECOMMEND FOR THOSE WHO ARE INTO NAIL ART.</li>
            <li>I really like that brush because its easier to hold while painting.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li>arrived earlier than expected, in good condition.  </li>
            <li>I like the set its a nice variety but one of my brushes is missing the whole silver part with the bristles on</li>
            <li>There are a few doubles as shown in the picture which is nice as a &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a few of these and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;A very inexpensive way to put a smile on a young girls face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been able to use one brush so far and it does the job well.</li>
            <li>mostly use the brushes for cleanup, and the thin brushes for my attempts at more intricate designs.</li>
            <li>No one ever thinks I do them myself:) I have only used three so far</li>
            <li>wow such a bargain so many to work with now</li>
            <li>I also liked how they included a small dotting tool into the mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The area where the wood and metal of the brushes connect aren&#x27;t glued together very tightly, but this can be fixed very easily with some extra glue or tape on your own hand.</li>
            <li>Brushes came in early!!!</li>
            <li>So far, just by touching, I don&#x27;t think they will shed any except for one brush that look more fragile than other.</li>
            <li>They are ok so far - average quality - ok for a beginner, but a professional might like something a little better</li>
            <li>I had to try to super glue seven of the brushes back together after they fell apart BEFORE the first use.</li>
            <li>Received it yesterday and was very happy because I used it the same day brushes do look cheap but does a expensive job!</li>
            <li>The set is very nice, quite a few different brushes and it comes with the dotter which I didnt see in the description</li>
            <li>besides that they are not very expensive</li>
            <li>I love these very much, the only thing I would say I dont like about this product is thst the white on the sticks of the brushes, if you dip it in nail polish remover</li>
            <li>Not only can you tell they are durable, the bristles don&#x27;t fall out after much use and they clean up well, too.</li>
            <li>I love the wide variety for effects that I have with this particular brush set.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I finally received these.</li>
            <li>Other than that there ok.</li>
            <li>I use them for nail art and many other craft type projects.</li>
            <li>But other then that they are ok.</li>
            <li>She has had such success with them!  </li>
            <li>If I&#x27;d paid anything substantial for these I probably would have returned or even given less stars, however in the grand scheme of things even with the lengthy shipping and a couple of brushes arriving broken they are ok :)</li>
            <li>Recomend this for anyone that wants to try new designs on their nails!</li>
            <li>very cheap product not worth your money</li>
            <li>Other than the white fan brush they seem pretty good so far, but I will update this once I get a chance to use some of them.</li>
            <li>but when you use nail polish remover to clean the brushes it takes the white paint off the brushes.</li>
            <li>But other than that the other brushes were great and worked like they should have.</li>
            <li>Even though the brushes get all crunchy, the tools don&#x27;t clean and they are made out of cheap materials, The brushes can be really helpful at making small designs and you want to use real tools and not homemade tools.</li>
            <li>I actually did clean the brushes I used with nail polish remover and</li>
            <li>, I was using one of the larger brushes to \\&quot;clean up\\&quot; my edges.</li>
            <li>Impossible to get the polish off of, good if you don&#x27;t want a good nail design, and are only hoping for one time use though.</li>
            <li>Other than that she was very excited with them.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to not be dumb like me and dip the white parts in acetone nail polish removed, it kind of makes the paint wipe off.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that my practice is not enough in terms that I cant make very fine lines, which is the number one thing I am looking for.</li>
            <li>lots of nice brushes - only 4 stars because they took to long to come!</li>
            <li>will probably use them on my feet first since my nails are short right now..</li>
            <li>but I glued the back on for the price it is right!</li>
            <li>Not super happy, but otherwise everything came as expected.</li>
            <li>They are really good quality for such a cheap price, but for me the shipping was a tad bit slow, but I&#x27;d rather get a slightly slow shipping speed and a low price than anything else (unless that anything is a good buy and a fast shipping</li>
            <li>Such good quality brushes I expected flimsy old brushes.</li>
            <li>Nice small brushes.</li>
            <li>I guess China is pretty far.</li>
            <li>It can be easily fixed with some hot glue.  </li>
            <li>They have nice tips that hold up well to small design.</li>
            <li>and they actually are not a bad quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used about 4 out of these 15 brushes, mostly for cuticle clean up and those 4 brushes aren&#x27;t even brushes anymore because there&#x27;s just 2 strings left of the entire brush that fell off.</li>
            <li>You really have to soak them in remover for a long time after to clean them.</li>
            <li>I bought these primarily for the small, blunt brush to clean up around the cuticles like the pros do.  </li>
            <li>The striper brush gives me a little difficulty but overall the product is good.</li>
            <li>Ordered on Christmas Eve and received it by New Year&#x27;s Eve!</li>
            <li>so I can try new designs out!</li>
            <li>Other than that it is great for such a low price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used a couple of them so far -- because, to be honest, I&#x27;m still learning about what they all do -- but the two flat brushes have changed my life.</li>
            <li>These are really going to help with my new found intrested in nail art.</li>
            <li>Well they work great except for the fact that its impossible to have them clean.</li>
            <li>They will get the job done but be careful they&#x27;re easy to break.</li>
            <li>They work well and the fibers on the brushes don&#x27;t fall off easily like I expected them to.</li>
            <li>I love the different options of the different brushes.</li>
            <li>Decent quality</li>
            <li>They are decent brushes.</li>
            <li>One of the brushes did lose it&#x27;s head but with super glue, it went back up.</li>
            <li>Mainly the set contains of brushes and one dotting pen.</li>
            <li>so I put a drop of super glue gel on the wood and pressed it back together!</li>
            <li>These are decent brushes but when I opened them 2 of my brushes were falling off of the handle part.</li>
            <li>Decent product for the price.  </li>
            <li>They look to be of a decent quality</li>
            <li>&amp; of course it&#x27;d be the main ones I wanted..</li>
            <li>and they all have a particular function.</li>
            <li>Decent quality for starter brushes</li>
            <li>Decent quality for the price.</li>
            <li>Item arrived a week earlier then estimated and seller included a cute butterfly magnet in the package that I definitely appreciate.</li>
            <li>So I decided to get these mainly becouse</li>
            <li>Decent set for the price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still learning how to use the brushes at this point, but they seem adequate enough to do the job!</li>
            <li>My experience focuses mainly on the seller and their prompt response...</li>
            <li>Gives you plenty of different styles to create many different looks on your nails.</li>
            <li>using these brushes with some simple nail polishes, it did not seem to be able to hold on to the nail polish well enough for me to apply it easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are 15 pieces, however many are repeats or way too similar to be used differently.</li>
            <li>Lots of different tips for many different designs.</li>
            <li>They seem decent for the money.</li>
            <li>Most of the brushes look very similar but the creator of these brushes tried making them look different by using an assortment of colors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used mine mainly for cleaning up around the cuticles with acetone.</li>
            <li>but there decent for what I&#x27;m using them for.</li>
            <li>I like the product and it comes as pictured, however, if you want to soak the nail polish out of the brush after use, make sure you don&#x27;t dunk the white handle of the brush in the nail polish remover, or the white handle</li>
            <li>(my hands have ended up WHITE, and the paint will melt on to EVERYTHING it touches), and the entire brush+metal part broke off of many of the sticks and needs to be super glued back</li>
            <li>The paint rubs off a little with acetone and one of mine came apart at the metal part, but a little super glue and its good as new!</li>
            <li>These just arrived in my mailbox and I was very surprised by how fast they showed up.</li>
            <li>I have been on the hunt for the tiniest brush I could find for tightlining, as I have never been satisfied with traditional eyeliner brushes on the market, high end or low end.</li>
            <li>By fell apart, I mean that brush hairs came out in clumps on top of freshly painted nails art.</li>
            <li>at least you&#x27;ll be able to use them!</li>
            <li>Love them very pe and cool but one was broken when I got then</li>
            <li>This brush set is good but not strong enough to used with arcylic powder with.</li>
            <li>cause some brushes are hard to clean but not this it so fast to clean</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended seller.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this product..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for nails but also any art project</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s high quality.</li>
            <li>They were high quality</li>
            <li>And I didnt think that they would be this high of quality.</li>
            <li>AS LONG AS YOU ALWAYS CLEAN THEM</li>
            <li>: I have lost even more brushes because they do not clean well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice having such a wide variety of brushes to pick from while I&#x27;m designing !</li>
            <li>Easy to clean as well as to use, the only problem is that on a two brushes is that they stick out, and those do get a bit sloppy, but otherwise they have been fantastic.</li>
            <li>But these were a little more than that.</li>
            <li>I used the metal ball-tipped \\&quot;brush\\&quot; to apply little diamonds on my nails, which was better than using toothpicks.</li>
            <li>I really love all of these little brushes.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for... or a little more with these.</li>
            <li>They come in a flimsy little plastic pouch, but I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
            <li>so I plan to make them look a little more fancy than they are.</li>
            <li>The shipping time was a little bit of a wait, but the price more than made up for it.  </li>
            <li>Just with they were a little more durable.</li>
            <li>I love the little brushes.</li>
            <li>Only $2 and fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>The brush piece on one, fell off the other day but it was an easy fix.</li>
            <li>They are a little flimsy, but are more than worth the price paid for them which was REALLY low.</li>
            <li>For the most art these nail art brushes are really nice, a few of them are really hard, and it takes a while to break them in.</li>
            <li>Have cleaned them very very carefully - but for the price, it is easy to replace.</li>
            <li>Despite some bad reviews, I think these nail art brushes are awesome.</li>
            <li>These brushes are pretty sturdy for brushes in general.</li>
            <li>These brushes are much too soft to work with nail art.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any issues thus far with the brushes I received, they&#x27;re easy to clean, although they do stain (which is common with any type of brush).</li>
            <li>They were shipped surprisingly fast considering they came from the Far East.</li>
            <li>They shipped fast and has everything I&#x27;ve needed so far to do nail art.</li>
            <li>These were a great price, so I thought I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li>There was only one brush that was even remotely useful.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it was worth the 2 dollars and</li>
            <li>So many different styles and tips, I can finally do a lot of the designs by myself that I&#x27;ve gotten done professionally.</li>
            <li>I loved the fan brushes for adding glitter and the smaller brush for small designs.</li>
            <li>Ok, but I can&#x27;t imagine they will last long</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve actually used art brushes instead of toothpicks or whatnot, and it&#x27;s much easier to draw with in my opinion.</li>
            <li>They look pretty much the same</li>
            <li>Find better brushes elsewhere, its a waste of money.</li>
            <li>Starting with a nice crunchy brush is not fun</li>
            <li>I was pleased with my order, except, a few of the brushes were frayed</li>
            <li>15 pcs is really more than I needed, though, so I gave a few to my daughter to use for her nails.  </li>
            <li>So if you don&#x27;t mind waiting a solid month to receive these brushes there well worth it for a buck.</li>
            <li>a few of them came undone but was still able to use.</li>
            <li>I wouldve liked different sized dotting and a minus a brush or two but so far</li>
            <li>I will say provided you use non acetone cleaner the brushes return to normal.</li>
            <li>You have 2 fans, two normal brushes and then a lot of detail and striping brushes.</li>
            <li>From the metal to the wooden part not al the brushes were glued together, but a little super glue fixed it al :)</li>
            <li>Some of them fell apart but a little hot glue fixed it easily.</li>
            <li>the brushes are nice, but 3 of my striping brushes were bent in the middle (the packaging was folded down creating a crease)..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with how the brushes have worked making small nail designs, but if you clean the brushes with nail polish remover (even non acetone) the paint will come off and make a mess.  </li>
            <li>:)  Sorry it was a bad batch of brushes but lets make them better too have all the nice sells you can have!!</li>
            <li>Other than that, they are fine.</li>
            <li>required for all crafting and cake paintinggreat for christmas and other holiday art that require fine touches.  </li>
            <li>Other than that everything else was fine.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very nice and are good for a few uses and just can&#x27;t find a brush that the ends don&#x27;t go bad on them...</li>
            <li>The only thing is that the metal part, holding the brush, comes off from the wooden stick fairly easy</li>
            <li>Some of the brush tips have fallen off, but it is easy enough to glue them back on.</li>
            <li>The tips came off of the brushes easily, but I simply glued them back on.</li>
            <li>The white paint on the brushes comes off with acetone, so be sure to keep it dry.</li>
            <li>metal brush heads are not well attached to the wooden handles, but you can just as easily pop them back on with a bit of glue.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Also, the metal barrel part completely fell off on 2 of the brushes– the first time I was using them– and it made a huge mess.  </li>
            <li>There are so many different sizes, and I can&#x27;t wait to use every single one of them.</li>
            <li>Also keep the white painted handles away from polish remover as it eats it right off.</li>
            <li>Super package!&lt;br /&gt;There are lot of strange brushes</li>
            <li>Very nice looking quality and for the price can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li>I actually use them for the fine details in my regular canvas painting.</li>
            <li>but they do have a few brushes that fit the needs I have when I&#x27;m doing certain designs</li>
            <li>It makes my nails look very professional and is not hard to do.</li>
            <li>The fan brushes are a little delicate but other wise a fairly nice set.</li>
            <li>I liked the little note that came with &amp; the extra butterfly magnet..</li>
            <li>the only thing these brushes are good for is experimenting, the results they give are not worth wearing out in public.</li>
            <li>I live in California, US., and these brushes came from Hong Kong.</li>
            <li>The tool were new and came In a bag.</li>
            <li>Ive never had any problems with anything ... if it was damaged they send new..</li>
            <li>Every couple of weeks, she comes up with a new design.</li>
            <li>It all brand new when arrived.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my granddaughter along with some rhinestones and tape, she is just new to experimenting with nail polish.  </li>
            <li>This came with all pieces and just in time for new nail art.</li>
            <li>many of the brush heads were off when they arrived, I easily glued them, but obviously I would have preferred a product that wasn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li>Nicely packaged in heavy plastic case, brushes well protected and in proper shape on arrival.</li>
            <li>The only thing I really don&#x27;t like is the brushes seem very brittle.</li>
            <li>Pencils are simple and like the white material, they do not look cheap.</li>
            <li>but the first option had way too many brushes for me and the second had some fairly poor reviews -- much like many of the other brush sets.</li>
            <li>There are two fan brushes, several with very tiny points and some squared-off ones all of which should be very useful.</li>
            <li>I am very surprised at how well these brushes have held up, and how well they are designed for articulate nail art.</li>
            <li>The longer brush took some extra TLC due to barely fitting within the confined plastic carrying case.</li>
            <li>they took forever for me to get them when i did 1 of the metal tips was bent in half but the ones i have wanted to use worked just fine</li>
            <li>I love doing my nails and usually use toothpicks</li>
            <li>The paint on the actual handle came off after I cleaned it, but I&#x27;m not too concerned because I don&#x27;t need them to be pretty.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The wait was long, since it&#x27;s shipped from China, but it was well worth it</li>
            <li>My favorite is the small detail brush.</li>
            <li>but sometimes the metal piece will detach from the wooden handle but nothing some wood glue or hot glue won&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>Love all the brushes and sizes ONLY a tiny issue when u put them in nail polish remover the white paint comes off and the glue that attached to the brush loosens the brush.</li>
            <li>I have been painting collie pictures on small shells for a project this summer - LOVE these brushes I use acrylic, sometimes water color (on paper).&lt;br</li>
            <li>i know they&#x27;re cheap, but not worth it.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine bought the exact same identical set at a beauty supply shop nearby for over 5 times what I paid for these.</li>
            <li>this set of nail brushes was exactly what I needed to do the designs I&#x27;m trying to learn next.</li>
            <li>And they aware comparable with nail polish removed to take away polish for French tips!</li>
            <li>Received them early!</li>
            <li>Thank you for your professional work!</li>
            <li>I use them nearly every time I paint my nails!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried nail poish remover and hot water on multiple occasions to take it out and nothing ever works.</li>
            <li>And, as another user suggested - DO NOT LET THESE BRUSHES GO NEAR ACETONE!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just starting out, and I love it, especially at the low price!  </li>
            <li>I do nail art for fun, not a professional</li>
            <li>So, I had to hot glue them back on.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, the tip came unglued from the wooden stick.  </li>
            <li>Used for painting small details on canvas, sculpture and more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only that, they are exactly as pictured</li>
            <li>I bought these brushes when I was first starting to get into nail art</li>
            <li>Well worth the long wait from China mail.</li>
            <li>I got them about a week ago and just started using them, the first time I did anything with them the metal part fell off, so I had to wood glue them back</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li>They can be used for many other uses, not only nail art.</li>
            <li>I would say skip and buy professional ones!</li>
            <li>Although they were shipped from China, which wasntba problem, they still arrived a full week before the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t super high quality, but what would you expect for such a low price?</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t super high quality, but what would you expect for such a low price?</li>
            <li>I just wasted couple of brushes so I can easily afford myself to buy  a new one.</li>
            <li>and they all came in a little pouch too for easy storage.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to clean between uses if you want to use the same brush for a different color,</li>
            <li>also..i use nail polish remover to clean the tips, i dipped too low once and the white on the handle of the brush immediately came off!</li>
            <li>The white paint seems to chip off the brushes very easily which is messy.</li>
            <li>The handles are much longer than I was expecting and it takes a LONG time to get these, but there are many of them, designed to do different things, so just handy to have -- can certainly use them for other delicate painting also!</li>
            <li>(ESPECIALLY since her nail beds are so tiny right now!)</li>
            <li>A few of the brushes were stuck together, but they were easy to separate.</li>
            <li>Wow, these usually cost a lot more sold seperately.</li>
            <li>The shipping was like any other shipping from china, nothing special.</li>
            <li>Nothing a little super glue couldn&#x27;t fix!</li>
            <li>These are great as really small paintbrushes especially for watercolors, nail polish also works though nailpolish remover takes the paint on the handles off so be careful with that.</li>
            <li>The only problem I had with this set was I had to super glue some of the heads back on.</li>
            <li>Ill make sure to not buy any else from you guys after today 3/11/2013 seller lucky electronics</li>
            <li>and you might need some super glue especially for the part where the metal meets the wood, and I wish there had been some type of description for the different brushes</li>
            <li>This nail art painting pen brush allows me to paint accurately even in tight areas.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the fine brushes a few times now for some nail art</li>
            <li>They pop right back on and were not loose or anything like that.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t seem cheap and you probably wouldn&#x27;t even know that I got them for so little.</li>
            <li>As long as you clean them they should last, they haven&#x27;t shedded and for under $3.00 usd</li>
            <li>and as long as i wipe them off on a cotton ball soaked in nail polish remover they come completely clean, even the white brushes!!</li>
            <li>I used the brushes for nail art very easy to handle and small enough to make</li>
            <li>Spend a little extra and get art/paint brushes from a store like Michaels and you&#x27;ll get better quality.</li>
            <li>the white bristles fan out a little more then 1&amp;#34</li>
            <li>The packaging caused the bristles to point in every direction and was hard to fix for most of them I had to cut the bristles or throw away.</li>
            <li>The clear plastic pouch they vome in was split and two of the brushes came detached from the handle</li>
            <li>My product came in a clear pouch that was damaged upon arrival.</li>
            <li>And they aren&#x27;t clear coated so the paint is coming off them already..  </li>
            <li>I coated the end that I messed up in clear coat</li>
            <li>They were cheap, and came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product and the wide assortment of small brushes in the set.</li>
            <li>Delivery:&lt;br /&gt;The brushes were delivered in a clear vinyl pouch.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Although the one time I did use acetone it did mess up the ends of one of the flat top brushes.</li>
            <li>Upon inspection, they came in a clear pouch with each brush covered with a clear tube except the two fan brushes.  </li>
            <li>This received four instead of five stars because one of the fan brushes, the bristles are a bit frayed, but it&#x27;s nothing that can&#x27;t be fixed at home.</li>
            <li>I am a professional artist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried a couple of them and they work really well,</li>
            <li>these were a complete wast of money</li>
            <li>Just now really using them only recommend if your just want a one time use or practice tool.</li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T GO ANYWHERE NEAR ACETONE WITH THESE THINGS.</li>
            <li>Although they took forever to arrive, I was really surprised by the quality of the brushes.</li>
            <li>This goes with the nail art set of 24 polish colors that I purchased for my adult granddaughter.</li>
            <li>So, far, I like this.  </li>
            <li>When the brushes get near nail polish remover the paint starts to come off.</li>
            <li>The brushes took awhile to arrive, but they were very affordable, so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
            <li>The metal sleeve that holds the brush to the handle slipped off two brushes the day I received them, but really that&#x27;s my only qualm with them.  </li>
            <li>they are made sturdy and have worked for everything I used them for so far</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bought these for my 12 year old niece who is into nail art.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t let these get near to acetone, or brushes are ruined.</li>
            <li>give me pleasure low price and fast survice</li>
            <li>but I just fixed them</li>
            <li>I can get the professional look at home.</li>
            <li>brushes are quite soft</li>
            <li>and it is much much easier to control brush stroke compared to using my regular nail polish</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t think of anything else you would need to complete the job.</li>
            <li>Some of the brushes are soft but it works well.</li>
            <li>but I fixed them so thank you</li>
            <li>The items met my expectations completely</li>
            <li>Arrived early and just as described online.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, this was one of the times when I was surprised.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has used them frequently without problems</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>they such so much</li>
            <li>So far these have not.  </li>
            <li>I used the brushes today, to mix a few colors together, and they blended smoothly.</li>
            <li>but so far there</li>
            <li>Tried them out for the first time, i am no professional</li>
            <li>so this is why I will frequently purchase them.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>Easily fixed.</li>
            <li>Received this product early and packaged neatly.</li>
            <li>I like it, but I would rather for the handles to be all metal than soft wood.</li>
            <li>Arrived early, however not all the brushes were there.</li>
            <li>The metal pieces and wooden pieces are not put together very well at all.</li>
            <li>Package was 2 weeks early.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve held up well so far and have used them a number of times with craft acrylics.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t had any issues with them.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised as I wasn&#x27;t expecting them for a while.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t weigh in on how they&#x27;d hold up for a professional.</li>
            <li>and it said complete order</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really like the fact that I over payed 17cent for each in total 34 cents....</li>
            <li>I actually use these brushes for hand painting cakes and they work very well.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t work very well and they constantly broke.</li>
            <li>so does my 4 year old.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast considering it was international, the package was sent registered mail to protect sender and recipient, and it was packaged well.</li>
            <li>They came either in time or early, I can&#x27;t remember.</li>
            <li>I had one of the handles come apart from the bristles, but it was easily fixed with nail glue.</li>
            <li>But that eas easily fixed.</li>
            <li>B005BG02BU MASH Professional 15 piece Nail Art Brush Kit Set]], [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>B000VDEQJW Debra Lynn Professional 6 piece Nail Art Set]]</li>
            <li>They arrived padded between protective styrofoam and each of the brushes came covered in a protective cap (with the exception of the two fan brushes) in a soft plastic pocket w/ flap lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it looks like a professional</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time.</li>
            <li>Fairly soft,</li>
            <li>Therefore, they don&#x27;t have to be professional quality.</li>
            <li>I would buy them again for a young girl.</li>
            <li>but so far from what I saw I think they&#x27;ll help me achieve th manicure of my dreams.</li>
            <li>When they came in, I was surprised at the quality</li>
            <li>I bought this set and was surprised with the quality of the brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes came covered in a protective cap, except of the two fan brushes in a soft plastic pocket.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional artist that has become intrigued with nail art.</li>
            <li>So far they work well and acrylic comes off the brushes with 100 acetone .  </li>
            <li>i have no complaints so far.</li>
            <li>I have purchased a set from Sally&#x27;s and this one by far exceeds those.</li>
            <li>Cleaning the brush is simple, all I have to do is to wash it clean and dry them and the brushes are ready for next use.</li>
            <li>I got these as a stocking stuffer for my 11 year old daughter</li>
            <li>The bristles feel very durable and solid.  </li>
            <li>these get old</li>
            <li>I saw this one and was surprised looking at price.</li>
            <li>Looks professional too.</li>
            <li>Arrived early.</li>
            <li>Ive used 3 of the 15 and WOW...</li>
            <li>The tips are falling off the wooden handles but there are so many brushes that you won&#x27;t miss the few that broke.</li>
            <li>Recommend spending a few extra dollars to get a better product.  </li>
            <li>Love all the different brushes, and dotting tool, did have to glue the tops on a few, but they still arrived in a timely manner.  </li>
            <li>Only downside to these is impatiently waiting the two weeks for them to get here, but for the price I paid, I&#x27;m not complaining :)</li>
            <li>I just use them for fun, and only occasionally, so I don&#x27;t know how durable they are.</li>
            <li>One was broken, but overall it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>The glue that holds the brush to the stick was loose on 2 of the brushes, other than that I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li>for acrylic, soap and water washes wet paint right off.</li>
            <li>I spent a small price for these quality brushes and I love them!</li>
            <li>I think next time I&#x27;ll just sucker it up and pay more for a decent set of brushes.</li>
            <li>They are a bit difficult to clean if you use regular nail polish, but if you insist with nail polish remover they will be ok.</li>
            <li>they are small and easy to use, i share some of them with my mom and even though we dont have lots of experiences with brushes we can still used them.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used them all, but they are all cool none the less.</li>
            <li>I bought these mainly for the thin tipped brushes, but after using them about 5 times, they no longer produced the perfect thin lines that they did when i got them.</li>
            <li>I loved the nail dotting tool and the thin flat brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seriously allover the whole concept of cheap nail stuff from China.</li>
            <li>To clean nail polish off the bristles use acetone, but be careful because the white paint might come off.</li>
            <li>The only serious problem I have had was my own fault.</li>
            <li>Doing my nails, painting small buttons and bow decorations, mod podging tiny gems onto a 100 day bow, these tiny brushes have been so very useful!.</li>
            <li>useful for other art work.  </li>
            <li>Even though some of the brushes, like the smaller striping brushes came with some of the bristles sticking out, I fixed this by sticking them in hot soapy water then squeezing them back to there</li>
            <li>I even use a few of them as clean up brushes for around my cuticles.</li>
            <li>The brushes are pretty standard and basic.  </li>
            <li>I was not being particularly rough with them or doing anything out of the ordinary, they had been passed between me and someone else, and were kind of rolled on a bed, but no mistreatment and the bristles just fell out.</li>
            <li>The main reason I ordered this set was for the white fan brush to do art work on my nails.  </li>
            <li>The long thin brush is good for lines and stripes.  </li>
            <li>I only wish i wouldn&#x27;t have brought them to work as the other ladies didn&#x27;t clean them</li>
            <li>I love the variety too, and they are the same price as you&#x27;d normally get only a few brushes!  </li>
            <li>These brushes are high quality for a low price.</li>
            <li>I have used 5 different brushes so far and live them.</li>
            <li>they are easy to use,and now I can make different designs on my nails everyday.</li>
            <li>Cheap small brushes.</li>
            <li>Exactly what we expected.</li>
            <li>I love this they last haven&#x27;t broken and there is so much variety of sizes</li>
            <li>These brushes are exactly what I expected them to be.</li>
            <li>It took over a month to get them, and when I did the orange brush tip was messed up and wouldn&#x27;t go back to normal.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Holy crap, by far the best deal for tiny brushes ever...</li>
            <li>Nothing a little super glue won&#x27;t fix, though.</li>
            <li>Nothing a little bit of super glue cant fix.</li>
            <li>But nothing that a little super glue doesn&#x27;t fix it.</li>
            <li>I used my hot glue gun and attached the wooden stick and metal back together; very small, easy to solve problem</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t completely horrible, but they certainly weren&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li>Bought these for face painting purposes and the little ones work fantastic for smaller details!</li>
            <li>These are decent, especially for the price, but I was hoping at least one of them would do really fine lines well, and none of them do.  </li>
            <li>It is VERY useful for those small touchups.</li>
            <li>The level and quality of detail possible with this varied array of brushes has brought my work to a new level.  </li>
            <li>Was shipped very fast then what was expected thank you!</li>
            <li>And at such a low price thanks.</li>
            <li>I took a little while to ship, because it came from china, but I got exactly what the picture and description said I would get!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m kind of frustrated with it right now</li>
            <li>They are not long term high quality, but they will definitely do the job and for the price I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>Very cheap material, some came already broken in the package.</li>
            <li>i use these brushes on my nails close to every other day, simply because they are so much fun to use.</li>
            <li>My angled brush that I usually use for clean up now has the problem where the bristles push back inside the metal, luckily they are just long enough that I can pull them back out again, but it&#x27;s quite frustrating.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the other brushes seem to be fine, although I am treating them carefully!</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t find a decent set of brushes for such a low price.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully I only paid $1.97 for my item and I purchased other items as a Christmas gift for this family member, so no major loss although I was excited for it.</li>
            <li>The material is cheap and the brushes&#x27; hairs are hard.</li>
            <li>All but  the fan brushes come with clear rubber open ended sleeves covering the bristles.</li>
            <li>I guess I should not have expected much for $7,</li>
            <li>plus they arrived so much faster then expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Too early to tell how they&#x27;ll last...</li>
            <li>Unsure of what it was, I opened it outside my home, nearly threw it out.  </li>
            <li>Arrived much sooner than expected</li>
            <li>I must warn you, the fan brushes are not wide.</li>
            <li>So far I have only used two of my brushes.</li>
            <li>If you get acetone near the actually stick part(white part), the paint starts coming off and the paint will get everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Second off, my stick part(white part)</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for ... Barely...</li>
            <li>If you get them, be extremely careful and gentle when cleaning.</li>
            <li>The bristles are too soft to even get a proper design on the nail, and once I pulled out the bristles from one brush just from cleaning it.</li>
            <li>The white paint completely falls apart.</li>
            <li>Actually it came directly from China so it might be explained.</li>
            <li>My 15 year old daughter loves these brushed.</li>
            <li>If you get them, be extremely careful and gentle when cleaning.</li>
            <li>These work so well, came in so much faster than expected even though it came from Hong Kong.</li>
            <li>She has used it multiple times so far</li>
            <li>and i will definately be ordering from you again in the near future.</li>
            <li>They are to be a gift along with nail polish for a young teenage friend.  </li>
            <li>Beats the $15 brushes I was having to shell out for and really take careful care of.</li>
            <li>So far I only had one instance where the tips of the brush were coming out</li>
            <li>Brushes were purchased for 10 year old starting nail design.</li>
            <li>, I totally forgot about them and was surprised when the came.</li>
            <li>it also dries fast on the brushes and makes a rough look on your nail.</li>
            <li>However, you get what you pay for apparently.</li>
            <li>, the white paint comes off it seems if acetone gas even gets near it</li>
            <li>The brushes came 5 days before the expected delivery and were exactly the same as the ones shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>They are as long as normal paint brushes.</li>
            <li>r soft and bend able each brush was individually package and nothing was broken the pouch that came with</li>
            <li>most of them wwere broken</li>
            <li>I love the thin brush</li>
            <li>but I crazy glue them back &amp; so far so good been using these for a year now.</li>
            <li>I was worried that for the price I paid, I would receive flimsy broken brushes... however these are fantastic!</li>
            <li>These are nice brushes for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li>If you  are using acrylic it would be kind of difficult to figure out which brush is used for what.</li>
            <li>im kind of obsessed with nails</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not great at nail art but love to try.</li>
            <li>the tops to all the burshes ( you know, the brush part of it) fell off right out of the little bag they came in with.</li>
            <li>and they were NOT too Hard nor super soft</li>
            <li>BUT on first use and even upon delivery, some of the barrels had already broken off the handles and had to be super glued back on.</li>
            <li>Expect a long wait if you live in USA.</li>
            <li>A few of the brushes were bent right out of the package</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to try snipping uneven edges to make them right</li>
            <li>When I first got the brushes, I was amazed at the quality considering I paid less than 3 dollars.</li>
            <li>when doing this I immediately noticed there were no loose bristles,none on my fingertips or sink.</li>
            <li>Also,the brushes are really hard to get perfectly clean.</li>
            <li>I used my acetone nail polish remover to get it clean but all it did was get hard.</li>
            <li>A bit hard to clean, but what brushes aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>There kinda hard to clean too.</li>
            <li>but they are hard to clean they work</li>
            <li>They work very well with no loss of bristles like other brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>They start to somewhat fall apart and the bristles are hard to clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, It&#x27;s slightly hard to clean these brushes.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I really don&#x27;t need 15 brushes.</li>
            <li>They are a little cheap, which was expected, but none of the hairs fall out.</li>
            <li>It is hard to clean too.</li>
            <li>They are so much longer than I expected them to be!</li>
            <li>I was excited about these, but when they arrived I discovered that the bristles of all the brushes are wonky</li>
            <li>First of all,the bristles are soft yet firm enough for any nail art task.</li>
            <li>When they came in the mail, several of the brushes still attached to the metal ends came off the white stick portion of the tool, but a little super glue</li>
            <li>paint soaks right off, and it MAKES A MESS!</li>
            <li>Kinda confusing as to how to use them, but it&#x27;s fun.&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to clean the nail polish out of the brushes.</li>
            <li>I wish the thin ones were even thinner to allow for more smaller detailed designs, but that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li>but there are still some useful brushes so this isn&#x27;t a total waste..</li>
            <li>I like the brushes, I just don&#x27;t like the fact that the main brushes I use are partially put together.</li>
            <li>The some of the brushes could be a little more stiff.</li>
            <li>(It took a little long coming from China, but I didn&#x27;t expect as quick as coming from U.S.).</li>
            <li>I soak them in hot water and soap after using them, NOT acetone nailpolish remover because it ruins the brissles of the brush!</li>
            <li>Fingernails are already a small area and having these longer brushes helps make the process of applying nail art smoother without so many tiny utensils in your other hand.</li>
            <li>Although, they do feel a little flimsy when you first touch them</li>
            <li>The nail tools that I have bought are not  good because, the first time you use them the brushes get all crunchy, the tools do not clean, and they are cheap materials.   </li>
            <li>and they are great if you want to paint really thin and small lines!</li>
            <li>I was a bit leary of this set, given the inexpensive price tag,but figured I really couldn&#x27;t go wrong with 15 different brushes for $2.00 and free</li>
            <li>I will admit, I was very skeptical about buying them at first because of their cheap price, and the pictures made them look soo small and fragile, but, since they were so cheap, and I needed a set of brushes to do my nails for prom this year</li>
            <li>but I did notice that the seller shipped from Hong Kong and was worried it would take far too long for it to reach me, or even get lost.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the dotter a few times after the first use it already fell apart.  </li>
            <li>Had to taper a few to make them exactly how I wanted</li>
            <li>It did come from China, so be aware that it will take a few weeks to get to you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot of brushes for a low price but the caps of the brushed easily fall off and they are not good quality.</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd review for one order that these brushes were included in and the same as the previous one for the first set of brushes.  </li>
            <li>(Omg no way I never would have guessed *sarcasm*), so now I use them for painting designs little wooden boxes with acrylic paints.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bristles are a bit stiff at first</li>
            <li>I ordered an extra set for my younger cousin who is barely getting into nail art.</li>
            <li>I did  have 2 brushes that had some minor imperfections (the fan brushes only) but they were easily fixed by trimming the stray bristles.</li>
            <li>I do a lot of nail art, both gel polish and regular, and they&#x27;ve held up to a decent amount of cleaning in acetone and other sterilizing chemicals.</li>
            <li>The most disappointing thing about these brushes is that after you use them and clean them with remover they give stiff.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t use them very harshly at all and the heads just fall right off.</li>
            <li>The brushes did shed a little and I was worried at first that I wasted my money, but they actually worked really well.</li>
            <li>in a clear, plastic case instead of just loose like i was expecting.</li>
            <li>What I didn&#x27;t like was that I found more than half the brushes too thick to even work with.</li>
            <li>Not great quality..still pretty decent and a steal for the price</li>
            <li>they were a little hard at first but after cleaning them they are softer and much easier to design with.great price as well!</li>
            <li>Brush quality itself is OK, but a little delicate.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy other new items too.</li>
            <li>My 15 year old daughter has become a professional nail artist ever since she starting using these little nail brushes.</li>
            <li>The only down fall is they are kinda hard to clean out!</li>

            <li> I am completely satisfied with my product.</li>

            <li> and I love how all of them has a brush guard</li>
            <li> I also love that I don&#x27;t need to buy these at Sally&#x27;s beauty for a fraction of the cost, I can just order them and I have plenty of uses for each of these brushes.</li>

            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love the variety of brushes</li>
            <li> I bought these to be able to put designs on my nails when I polish them.</li>
            <li> , i tested it out and these brushes are better than i</li>
            <li> I did actually try using a couple of brushes with nail polish, and these are wonderful for their intended purpose.</li>
            <li> Still, I will probably get a couple more sets, one just for nails.</li>
            <li> so I hope I will be able to find them again if I need to any time soon</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a use for the majority of the ones in the set (there are quite a bit) but the ones that I have used have been ok.</li>
            <li> again, for the price - they are ok.</li>
            <li> Such a wonderful variety of brushes that encourages her creativity.</li>
            <li> Love that I got so many for the price.</li>
            <li> so I can use them better.</li>
            <li> These brushes may as well be feathers - although feathers may even have better control.</li>
            <li> I love the brushes and they get the job done.</li>
            <li> I like this but make sure the stick doesnt hit acetone or else</li>
            <li> love using them</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure that is out of the seller&#x27;s control.</li>
            <li> The brushes are good quality and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> The brushes look kind of cheap</li>
            <li> but they do work OK.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for nail art brushes when I came across this set and am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I love that they come with a case</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to worry about losing any of them or having to take up more space than needed.</li>

            <li> The top of the fan brush fell off as soon as I took it out of the bag.</li>
            <li> The quality of the brush is just ok.</li>
            <li> I love that there are 15 brushes, all different sizes for anything you need to make wonderful art on just about anything.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Perhaps it will work better with acrylic paint.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes.</li>
            <li> Better than the Sephora 2 pack I bought for $10.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to get whatever detail work that I want done.</li>
            <li> the heads fall off better buy a glue gun while your at it for these products</li>
            <li> Coud be used for many more applications than nail painting.</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> My husband, 2 girls and myself really love this.</li>
            <li> This set it&#x27;s better than I thought and meet all my expectation.</li>
            <li> You can do so many designs with them.</li>

            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> The product is just okay for me.</li>
            <li> The packaging is not that grand</li>
            <li> The metal part fell off some of my brushes but the rest were okay.</li>
            <li> But whatever why am I complaining it comes with so many brushes that I don&#x27;t even know how to use.</li>
            <li> My daughter love her nail art painting.</li>
            <li> These turned out to be my favorite</li>

            <li> you can&#x27;t expect more then</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s ok given the price.</li>
            <li> I would have been better off going to a craft store and picking the brushes I needed.</li>
            <li> my grand daughters into doing her nails</li>
            <li> These just came in the mail today much earlier than estimated which was a wonderful surprise!</li>
            <li> Most of the ends have fallen off of the stick portion.</li>
            <li> all brushes came and love the quality</li>
            <li> These seem more like makeup brushes.</li>

            <li> Don’t people like using products more than once?</li>
            <li> Should pack with more hardy material to prevent this happen.</li>
            <li> Will probably use them for more crafting than nail art.</li>
            <li> Had to use pliers to make sure it didn&#x27;t fall off.</li>

            <li> I love the brushes and the quality.</li>
            <li> I love my 15 pcs nail art painting pen brush.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> My daughter ordered these and has been enjoying them.</li>
            <li> love them i find my self using my brushes a lot</li>
            <li> their i should have known better</li>
            <li> I love to do on my paintings.</li>
            <li> The smallest brush is about 5 1/4 &amp;#34; with a wider handle for  better control,the brush is about 1/4&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for the price a lot the end came off</li>
            <li> then that they are ok</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get many designs because the they wont hold the paint.</li>
            <li> I wish it came with more dotting tools</li>
            <li> More like acrylic paint, which in my opinion is easier to do details with</li>
            <li> the 3 stars is mostly because I am still trying to figure out what all I can do with these.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I love to do our nails with more nail art then many people.</li>
            <li> I love working with these brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning to order four sets more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i would recommend it to people. :)</li>
            <li> I placed the order on July 1st and it was suppose to be here August 8th at the latest.</li>
            <li> I am in love with these brushes.</li>
            <li> I now wish I bought the ones that cost more.</li>
            <li> They seem like they would be better for for makeup or something....</li>
            <li> and I love the brushes</li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s a plus, but a most every brush fell apart as soon as I touched it.</li>
            <li> I am defiantly going to order some more for myself and for gifts.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t regret it, but also wouldn&#x27;t get any more of these.</li>
            <li> Mostly I use it for my eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I love the dotting tool it comes with.</li>
            <li> For this price, just add it to your cart and you&#x27;ll be pleased with yourself.</li>
            <li> I love it . . . .</li>
            <li> i love them  </li>

            <li> Cheap, varied, and nice detail brushes.</li>
            <li> in love</li>
            <li> i wasnt sure</li>
            <li> so i can use more</li>
            <li> i probably need another set :)</li>
            <li> There are so many of them.  </li>
            <li> I am in love</li>
            <li> but they work OK.</li>
            <li> I just love these brushes.</li>
            <li> I love the brushes..</li>
            <li> I havent gotten my things yet but they are doing everything they can to help me as soon as they fix my issue i will buy more</li>
            <li> I even got a tiny dotting tool which is awesome.</li>
            <li> So I figured if I got these nail paint brushes for her she could design them even more.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful for teen girls.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the tiny painting I am doing on my miniatures!</li>
            <li> I just received my set yesterday, it took only 2 weeks to get to my house and the package and brushes were in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> so I was looking for something inexpensive to do some creative nail art for my mom, my daughter and me.</li>
            <li> some i find i am using more than others.</li>
            <li> Rather spend more to get a better result</li>
            <li> I feel that even a mildly better pouch would have made me a lot happier with the product.</li>
            <li> i love the brushes...</li>
            <li> I was able to do all kinds of designs on nails.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re okay.</li>
            <li> I enjoy doing my own nails</li>
            <li> I love these brushes and i still use them now.</li>
            <li> I would recommend them :)</li>
            <li> I love how they have a plastic around the brushes so they don&#x27;t get squished in the mail.</li>
            <li> better to pay more for something better</li>
            <li> absolutely love these nail brushes</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure she will use them.</li>
            <li> they were really cheap so for that price its absoloutely amazing quality.</li>
            <li> really interesting set.</li>
            <li> but i love the quality.</li>
            <li> I think that the product itself is okay, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> i love them</li>
            <li> I draw and paint using mostly water colors.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I need to find a better set and spend the money for quality.</li>
            <li> I really did!!!!They work great</li>
            <li> I gave them as birthday gifts to my God Daughter and Grand Daughter.</li>
            <li> They arrived safely.</li>
            <li> I also love the variety of brushes to choose from</li>
            <li> and I received many compliments.</li>
            <li> like how im able to manage with the stiffness of the brush</li>
            <li> and I can do so many more designs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li> There are so many things I love about these brushes.</li>
            <li> I am vvery glad for the variety of these brushes and I also love the fact they are not weak brushes great price</li>
            <li> I love making everyone&#x27;s nails look beautiful with my new kit.</li>
            <li> Really just fantastic price, and good for detail!</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t the most professional ones out there, but they are really good quality!</li>
            <li> but if you do nails as much as I do, you have some superglue very handy to fix this</li>

            <li> These are some pretty good brushes considering how cheap they were!</li>
            <li> The quality of these brushes are very good, they are very soft and precise on the lines used while painting</li>
            <li> but they were a very good price in general</li>
            <li> Loved this product I am very much into nail art</li>
            <li> They are good for a cheap set, but they are quick to be ruined and thy don&#x27;t wash out at all.</li>
            <li> I love it, so cute, easy to grab...</li>
            <li> :) makes doing designs a lot more easy.</li>

            <li> Brushes are great , them seem like great quality , overall worth the price</li>
            <li> these are pretty good</li>
            <li> first time trying brushes on my nails, good beginner set.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good brushes.</li>
            <li> I have become a pretty good nail artist as a result.</li>
            <li> The product arrived early, and I&#x27;ve already started using them to make beautiful nail designs.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good considering the price.</li>
            <li> First, I want to say these brushes are good for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> This is my first set and the quality is good, but the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> these are pretty good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;nevertheless, the brushes work well, and they look beautiful and professional.</li>
            <li> Pretty good brushes.</li>
            <li> First, the delivery time was good, I suppose, so it got one star.</li>
            <li> She loved them, they are a variety of sizes and because they are not expensive, she doesn&#x27;t have to worry about ruining them.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for the good item and the fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Comes with all the tools you need and they are pretty good for the price</li>
            <li> These are very inexpensive brushes but are really nice!</li>
            <li> For the price, there are pretty good brushes.  </li>
            <li> they work pretty good</li>
            <li> They work great and the price was awesome, but I had to glue the brushes to their handles, they fall right off if you pull on them even a little.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful for different effects and fine detailing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good value for the price with many different types of brushes.</li>
            <li> im enjoying them very much!! :)</li>
            <li> Excited to try them!</li>
            <li> I use them to do sweet nail designs! :)</li>
            <li> Great for experimenting and new design ideas.</li>
            <li> I do so much nail art free style and this set is great for anything I have in mind.  </li>
            <li> I love the variety of precision brushes that help make my nail art easy to do.</li>
            <li> I love these Nail Art Painting Pen Brust they are easy to use compared on the toothpick</li>
            <li> I always have super glue handy in an accident prone household.</li>
            <li> I can still use them just make sure that when you clean them with acetone you don&#x27;t leave me there for more than 4 seconds :)</li>
            <li> One of my favorites has a metal ball on the tip of it, so you can easily apply polka dots on your nails, which I think is really cute.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes are more defined and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The only word that I can use to say what best describes this product it cheap.</li>
            <li> The variety is nice but the quality is obviously not that great.</li>
            <li> but they are not as easy to clean as i would have liked</li>
            <li> The pricing was ideal for 15 brushes overall, as going to the store costs more just for 3-5 brushes.</li>
            <li> I liked these brushes because they are easy to clean and the price makes them disposable if need be.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to work with and clean</li>
            <li> Every single one of them seems to be in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Great product, also came 4 weeks early!</li>
            <li> The bristles are very fine and ideal from detailed work such as nail art.  </li>
            <li> I love these for fine detail.</li>
            <li> The brushes are fine, however you&#x27;d think something that will probably come into contact with nail polish remover would be more durable against acetone.</li>
            <li> The brushes are made of a fine brush all the way to a thicker brush with many variations in between.</li>
            <li> Use non Acetone nail polishes to clean!</li>
            <li> You will find a brush to do just about everything from details, lines, clean up, and there is even a dotting tool!</li>
            <li> Love designing my nails and they work perfectly and come just as expected!</li>
            <li> I actually brought them cause I needed to clean my laptop around the keys and these are perfect!</li>
            <li> good product i just need to practice more because it takes a steady hand, and know how.  </li>
            <li> Very professional and very nice for the price.  </li>
            <li> These are very good quality, wooden brushes not flimsy plastic.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very good , but the heads of them seem to constantly fall off at the slightest touch .</li>
            <li> There is a very good assortment and even two of the same brush</li>
            <li> The brushes aren&#x27;t very good quality but mine have held up well under moderate use (2-3 times per week) and no bristles are falling out.</li>
            <li> they are very easy to use and easy to clean</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re versatile and clean easy!</li>
            <li> Makes nail art easy and fun!!</li>
            <li> I like all the brushes so far none have started falling apart and the designs I have been doing work great with these brushes</li>
            <li> The price is great for these and so far they have worked well for me.</li>
            <li> love how they are comfortable, in your fingers, while working.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> im happy with them so far</li>
            <li> I know I am not the first to \\&quot;go there\\&quot; on my eye makeup with nail brushes, but I just wanted mention that these are quite useful for the idea and a great price.</li>
            <li> These are pretty darn good considering how cheap they are.</li>
            <li> Wow, what an array of brushes -- you&#x27;re bound to find a size and shape for every need, not to mention that they vary in stiffness which is great for detail work.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t beleive i got so many for so cheap.</li>
            <li> Love all the different sizes and shapes, can do some beautiful art work with these</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a great kit for someone starting out in nail art (such as I was) to play around and see what types of brushes you like best.</li>
            <li> So many to use, and they don&#x27;t feel flimsy or cheap.</li>
            <li> I was happy though that the set arrived early, but again, the crappy quality kinda overlooks the arrival speed.</li>
            <li> These give me so many options, which is important</li>
            <li> I also love that it was so cheap</li>
            <li> That can be important to most nail art fanatics.</li>
            <li> I run a beauty parlor and clients these days look for more detailed nail painting.</li>
            <li> and I hope you enjoy this product like I did:)</li>
            <li> If you are really into doing nails for yourself or others and want them to look good, don&#x27;t buy these.....</li>
            <li> I purchased this set for my 15-yr old grand-daughter who has an obsession with nail polish and art.&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived soon after her birthday, but I am sure that she will be delighted to receive one more</li>
            <li> I loved this item it works really well.</li>

            <li> They don&#x27;t break after the first use, there are so many different type of brushes, and it&#x27;s a great price!</li>

            <li> I  cannot wait to start making cool designs with the brushes!</li>
            <li> I bought it for a friend, who actually uses it more for acrylic painting than nail painting, but she says they&#x27;re pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> Nice quality amazing for the modest price.</li>
            <li> These are good quality brushes and work amazing, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would easily recommend to anyone - bakers, nail artists, painters, crafters and so on.</li>
            <li> They, although did break easily.  </li>
            <li> and also it&#x27;s notvery easy to work with;</li>
            <li> they get the nail art jobs done and they wash easily.</li>
            <li> Really easy to use.</li>
            <li> Came very quickly</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- easy to use</li>
            <li> They are well made and easy to use.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re easy to wash and none of my brushes have fallen apart yet.</li>
            <li> Easy to work with and draws to my expectation.</li>
            <li> I was able to do more than I could ever imagine with this set, and its worth it just to use for manicure clean-up.</li>
            <li> For the price (worth much more) you won&#x27;t do better.  </li>
            <li> Came apart too easily.</li>
            <li> brushes easily fall off stick</li>
            <li> They fall apart really easily</li>
            <li> but I can see how making dots and swirls would be easy with these brushes.</li>
            <li> VARIETY OF STYLES MAKE IT EASY TO USE FOR ANY PROJECT,</li>
            <li> Great for many different styles of nails!</li>
            <li> They have allowed me to easily expand my nail-art creations.</li>
            <li> Great so many different size and shape brushes</li>
            <li> but that was a easy fix ..</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to use and easy to experiment with.</li>
            <li> Easy to use study</li>
            <li> but I used acrylic paint and it easily took off with water if you use nail polish use nail polish remover to remove it also  </li>
            <li> The heads come off so easily and the hairs of the brushes fall out continuously.</li>
            <li> For me, the paint doesn&#x27;t wash off easily either.</li>
            <li> This nail brush set makes it easy to do your nails at home.</li>
            <li> -up is just as easy.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to use non acetone polish remover for clean up.</li>
            <li> Have used similar items, but these are better quality and a great price for the product.</li>
            <li> The bristles fall out easily.</li>
            <li> Shipping &amp; arrival very quick.</li>
            <li> Be sure to clean and maintain</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much because these were cheap, but they get the job done surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold, bristles seem sturdy</li>
            <li> It is get in my hand n easy to hold.</li>
            <li> They where paintbrushes but the metal part came off of the wood part way to easily.</li>
            <li> They all come in a plastic cover and most of them have covers on them to keep them clean and to keep their shape intact.</li>
            <li> Makes doing designs on her nails easy and neat.</li>
            <li> Quite a variety of brush sizes for nails, not as easy to design with, but I am getting there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only brush that I find not to great is the fan brush - I have not been able to use it</li>
            <li> I bought the brushes so i could be more creative &amp; make lots of designs and the brushes are really useful andI</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use them as nail brushes, either, they could easily be used as make-up brushes.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great product and came in about 2-3 weeks. :)</li>
            <li> and they are still going strong.</li>
            <li> Good selection and the main reason I set away for this item.</li>
            <li> The brushes had a strong odor when I opened them, like the smell of varnish.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect them to be as good since they were so cheap</li>
            <li> Brush hairs didn&#x27;t hold their shap/ form very well so they wouldn&#x27;t be good for detailed art on nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My DIL Loved the set as she is just starting to do her Own nails instead of going to a Salon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes are smooth and fine, clean easy and are well built!</li>
            <li> I wanted nail art brushes to design my own manicures, and, sure enough, I was able to create some master pieces with these brushes!</li>
            <li> Took awhile to come here but it was within the long shipping time but it&#x27;s very good.</li>
            <li> they are really good, and brushes of all different thicknesses, i am excited to try them out!!</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a very good product and I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Wow amazing!</li>
            <li> They came fast and I am very glad with these brushes.</li>
            <li> Using the nail brushes for the first time is Amazing</li>
            <li> the quality for the price is pretty amazing, i don&#x27;t think you can get it anywhere else....</li>
            <li> and these were a gift for that, they where amazing and exactly what I needed for class.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice brushes but the paint may come off the handles if exposed to acetone.</li>
            <li> This kind of ruined the brushes they aren&#x27;t exactly the way I got them now</li>
            <li> Its pretty nice considering the price.</li>
            <li> but it would be good to add some glue to the metal part because it does fall off other than that its good.</li>
            <li> I have use some of those for applying a normal coat of enamel, it works good.</li>
            <li> but I am looking forward to trying them out, they feel pretty nice.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m assuming they must be pretty nice.</li>
            <li> I did a French mani with them and it came out beautiful.</li>
            <li> This is a nice set to have and worth the price if you&#x27;re really into doing your nails up nicely.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s are hands down the best value for money detail brushes I&#x27;ve ever found.  </li>
            <li> so I got them super quick which is amazing.</li>
            <li> It came early and the brushes are nice but the tops come off very easily.</li>
            <li> and they are still good as new.  </li>
            <li> and it is good as new.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re good as new.</li>
            <li> Love the large selection there is!!</li>
            <li> There are some striper brushes, two fans, and assorted fine detail brushes, angled brushes, and one metal tipped tool I will use for dotting.</li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re fine; you get what you pay for here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m useing these for fine liner to make ur eyeliner define</li>
            <li> and they worked fine.</li>
            <li> We use them in our pottery shop for fine detail work.</li>
            <li> They are ok, but most of them fell apart the first day i got them.  </li>
            <li> and now it is fine.</li>
            <li> Use these for fine detail on face painting.</li>
            <li> All in all the product was fine besides these problems.</li>
            <li> Although these were advertised  for nail art use, I purchased these to do fine detail work in my paintings.  </li>
            <li> The brushes seem fine for the price.</li>
            <li> Brush painting is just fine</li>
            <li> I bought these to use for fine lines, etc.</li>
            <li> Definitely not professional quality but for fun nail art they are GREAT!!</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described and was a wonderful set given how low the price was.</li>
            <li> I think they will be fine for my needs</li>
            <li> they work fine.</li>
            <li> The product has been fine.  </li>
            <li> I had a problem with the previous order, but their prompt response made them wonderful to work with...</li>
            <li> I am not using them for nails, will use for fine work on greeting cards.</li>
            <li> They all work jus fine</li>
            <li> They work just fine</li>
            <li> if You don&#x27;t mind Trimming the bristles then this will work fine.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to see that all the brushes were in the package but there was a slight problem.</li>
            <li> I could not have found brushes this fine in a craft shop for anything close to the price here.</li>
            <li> The rest seem fine, there is also a metal dotting tool included which is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> they look fine.  </li>
            <li> But the brushes aren&#x27;t as fine as they look in the picture</li>
            <li> I got these for fine touches in paintin oils or acrylics....</li>
            <li> I got these for nail art and for the fine details on my dolls.</li>
            <li> came as described, its a fine product.</li>
            <li> my girls are having fun learning to use these and making some really cool designs of their own</li>
            <li> love it received it quick</li>
            <li> Just make sure to have some super glue on hand.</li>
            <li> the brushes are sturdy and the tips are strong and paint smoothly.</li>
            <li> super cute.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nothing super glue can&#x27;t fix!</li>
            <li> I was super please to receive them the week before prom!</li>
            <li> I ordered the 15pcs nail art painting pen brush kit and it arrived early, and the brushes are good quality, so don&#x27;t wait just go ahead and order, the price is right!!</li>
            <li> My favorite pen is the dotting pen, because it does very pretty dots.</li>
            <li> They work, they are wonderful, they don&#x27;t release the hairs as most cheap brushes usually do.  </li>
            <li> and this makes it so much easier to get creative!</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and easy to clean.</li>

            <li> They weren&#x27;t as cheap as I thought they would be and they worked fine</li>

            <li> I Love These So Much.!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy these for my nails, I use them on the little boxes and clay charms I make and they are the perfect sizes.</li>
            <li> takes a while to get here, but when you do you can do anything with this wonderful little brushes</li>
            <li> These Brushes are great when you need them for fine lines, dusting off extra flocking powder, ETC.  </li>
            <li> Still, they are very cute and high quality paintbrushes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know a lot of nail art designs, and I really don&#x27;t have very good skills, but these brushes have definitely helped me learn a lot more about the beauty of nail art.</li>
            <li> I also have a huge lack of talent.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;One huge note for people using these for nail art ...</li>
            <li> really happy for making decision to buy this  despite some feedback, really no regret at all :)</li>

            <li> i thought that for them being so cheap in price that they would also be cheap in the quality, but to my surprise they werent.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made and metal piece keeps falling off the brushes.</li>
            <li> They came in fast and are all nice</li>
            <li> The price was great for such a variety of brushes.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy them</li>
            <li> i bought a few of these for stocking stuffers and they were perfect.</li>
            <li> They really come in handy.</li>
            <li> She honestly hasn&#x27;t used it all that much</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m going to enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy these,&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li> And if you wish to use the point protectors some of the brushes won&#x27;t even fit into the pouch.</li>
            <li> The brushes are comfortable to hold and have given life to my designs.</li>
            <li> These are great quality brushes I still can&#x27;t believe I got them for such a steal!</li>
            <li> Overall, I just wasn&#x27;t happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have fun creating so many designes on my nails.</li>
            <li> The whole set had great variety to use and any professional would love to order a set like this.</li>
            <li> They are a bit on the cheap side.&lt;br</li>
            <li> however since  these brushes are really cheap, their quality is cheap as well.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just far superior to the applicator in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price there are different sizes of brushes and I love them all I even used two of them to apply eyeliner</li>
            <li> I believe this is a product worth looking into and worth buying if you are into trying to do your own nail designs and art.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shipping took a while, but it was free and it was more than worth the wait.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> This kit contains pretty much any kind of brush I could need!</li>
            <li> i love these brushes, makes my nail art work so much easier and better.</li>
            <li> so far so good on these brushes.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are good quality as far as the bristles go, but the farrels are coming off of the handles</li>
            <li> The wait was worth it; now I&#x27;m having fun doing my own nail art and save time and money doing them myself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes are good for beginners as well as professional nail designers.</li>
            <li> These are for sure cheaply made, I haven&#x27;t even had them a week and one brushes head just popped right off and one metal part is bent...  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the quality and design of my new brushes.  </li>
            <li> Also, one of the ends of the brushes fell off right away, but I was able to fix that as well with some glue.</li>
            <li> They made sure they contacted me and made it right.</li>
            <li> Very good product for the low price, works great, and is exactly as described, the only problem is the seller don´t give a tracking number.</li>
            <li> Unaffected by even pure acetone, perfect for detailed nail art designs</li>

            <li> but I imagine they would be very useful for use on someone else.  </li>
            <li> these are very nice brushes especially for the price!</li>
            <li> When I do a french tip it makes the job look very nice and neat</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sturdy and very useful.</li>

            <li> Love the dotting tool so much !</li>
            <li> Shipping took quite awhile as they were coming from overseas but for the price it was well worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I was really excited about these arriving.</li>
            <li> I just love these so much!</li>
            <li> Shipping was long - but great brush set.</li>
            <li> They are perfect for painting those small areas.</li>
            <li> nonetheless i&#x27;m excited..</li>
            <li> I just received the brushes and was excited to use them for my nails.  </li>
            <li> Add this economical set to your tool box for spa night!  </li>
            <li> but I did get what I originally wanted so</li>
            <li> i love it so much easier to do designs with!</li>
            <li> These are great tools for nails, the long handles make it easier to use.</li>
            <li> and I love painting our nails and these REALLY help me achieve more fun patterns.</li>
            <li> My original intention was to use them when painting.</li>
            <li> So I was excited when they arived 1.5 weeks before the soonest estimated time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter was excited to get theses</li>
            <li> Not sure how the quality and durability would be if used in a salon setting, but for home use, this was perfect!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these</li>
            <li> i have bouth more expensive ones but this ones are better than the one i allredy have as a nail artist this are kne of the best</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Having fun with this product and will recommend it to all my friends with nails to do!</li>
            <li> the price is great and delivery didn&#x27;t take as long as I thought it would have.  </li>
            <li> Totes worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be much more upset if I had paid more, I kind of expected that to happen.</li>
            <li> Each brush was excellent quality exactly why I expected!</li>
            <li> I was really excited about these brushes until the tops started falling off.</li>
            <li> These arrived about 2-3 weeks sooner than the estimated delivery date which made me so excited.  </li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter as a stocking stuffer, The brushes for the most part are good enough quality, one of the brushes was damaged but not unusable, they were great for the price, I certainly couldn&#x27;t have found anything like this anywhere else for so cheap, I did shop it prior to finding these.</li>
            <li> Maybe it just takes practice, I&#x27;m kind of new to designing nails</li>
            <li> I read a review that said not to use acetone to clean, but I did &amp; nothing happened.</li>
            <li> They clean well.</li>
            <li> super cheap.</li>
            <li> They do not give clean lines and i wouldn&#x27;t recommend you buy this product.</li>
            <li> The work well, clean well.  </li>
            <li> The brushes clean up well too, and the bristles seem to be attached well and don&#x27;t seem to come off on my nails.</li>
            <li> I HAVEN&#x27;T TRIED TO USE ANY POLISH REMOVER TO CLEAN THEM</li>
            <li> You get so many nice quality brushes for a low price.</li>
            <li> When you hold any brush you can tell it&#x27;s super cheap stuff</li>
            <li> The tips of the brushes fall off the sticks so make sure you have some glue handy to slip them back on.</li>
            <li> They Paint well and clean up well.</li>
            <li> Clean them off with polish remover when done.</li>
            <li> Beware though that the paint on the brush handles strips when inserted into acetone to clean the brushes.</li>
            <li> You cannot clean these with acetone.  </li>
            <li> Clean up well without loosing all the hairs.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t the best but worth the few dollars.  </li>
            <li> I like using these brushes for clean up on my nails and using the stripers.</li>
            <li> just wanted to know how to clean them without ruining them.......</li>
            <li> but these make painting nails fun and easy to create designs.</li>
            <li> it was really cheap and had 15 different  pieces it worked really good</li>
            <li> /&gt;Essentially, get these brushes only if you&#x27;re a first-timer and can&#x27;t find good cheap paintbrushes at the store.</li>
            <li> just clean where you applied nail polish.</li>
            <li> but they just wont get clean.</li>
            <li> clean mine up with a no-lint pad and acetone without any problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Essentially, get these brushes only if you&#x27;re a first-timer and can&#x27;t find good cheap paintbrushes at the store.</li>
            <li> Super cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Overall, I can see why this is so popular among nail artists :)</li>
            <li> To clean it&#x27;d be easier if you had 100% acetone nail polish.</li>
            <li> show u what to do with all the brushes but how to clean the brushes.</li>
            <li> so just clean the tips dont dip them all in</li>
            <li> They clean up well.</li>
            <li> Super cheap looking</li>
            <li> the store easi;y and clean well too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching everywhere on how to clean the brushes after using them</li>
            <li> Finding good brushes that produce incredible nail art is incredibly difficult these days.</li>
            <li> We will never be professional nail artists, but for this family, they are the perfect tools for teen experimentation.</li>
            <li> Super cheap, in quality and $$, but they still do the job.</li>
            <li> but as soon as you use nail polish remover to clean the nail polish the finish of the brush starts to come off...</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s not needed if you clean the brush</li>
            <li> Arrived in good time, this set is better made than I had expected for the price.</li>
            <li> I really like then there great for doing lots of good designs there are many to choose from, and there cheap what else can u ask for...... only one thing they take to long to arrive.</li>
            <li> Very cheap but of decent quality!</li>
            <li> Not even sure as the global quality was pretty good.</li>
            <li> The bristles are pretty skinny and easy to do detailed work.</li>
            <li> they are very sturdy and the price is very cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very precise and these tools work very well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind of strong not really cheap but nice</li>
            <li> do recommend this product, and specially the seller!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Or what types of nail polish to use it with or is their special paint for them??</li>
            <li> Order these right away!</li>
            <li> They are not too fun to clean but they work fantastic.</li>
            <li> The rest of the brushes have decent quality but not really the best.</li>
            <li> these are more like temporary brushes unless you really keep them clean</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes so I could do detailed manicures, though my hands are not the most steady.</li>
            <li> When the package arrived at my house, the little bag containing the brushes was pretty damaged, but the brushes themselves were in perfect condition</li>
            <li> I have tried so hard to find really fine brushes and haven&#x27;t been successful, until now!  </li>
            <li> If you are like me, that like to create new designs and have some fun doing your nails you will love it!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for high end ones please feel free to keep looking and pay the appropriate price.  </li>
            <li> This may sound bizarre, but these little bitty brushes are great for eyelining!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These brushes were great at first, I was excited to use them once they came in, but I&#x27;ve had them for more than half a year</li>
            <li> I got the brushes sooner than expected but for what I paid, they are great.</li>
            <li> Great price and came a lot quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> It was working great for about two tries.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the service I am satisfied with the item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve created cool designs with them on my nails.</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> Not only are these practical, but they&#x27;re also good at what they do</li>
            <li> Good enough for my use anyway.</li>
            <li> The brushes are all really nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to get into learning how to do cool designs on my nails like how they do in nail salons, and with the price of these</li>
            <li> cheap too, so its worth it.</li>
            <li> Not only are they inexpensive but they are of really good quality.</li>
            <li> Probably would be better for the real nail artists who use paint.</li>
            <li> Nice set of brushes for adult paint by numbers.</li>
            <li> plus it&#x27;s like another full time job.</li>
            <li> I use these mostly for detail work on my paintings, they do the job very well.</li>
            <li> But since it was free shipping and came from China it was still worth the wait.</li>
            <li> so cool</li>
            <li> For the price, Its a good beginner set if you&#x27;re using acrylic paints only and water.</li>
            <li> These are ok brushes and work very well</li>
            <li> Overall, good product</li>
            <li> these are useful but are cheaply made hence the price.</li>
            <li> Came fast in the mail I love it</li>
            <li> This was such a good price for a nail art set.</li>
            <li> I recommend keeping an old dish towel handy when designing to wipe off excess polish before cleaning.</li>
            <li> Love it highly recommend!</li>
            <li> would say it&#x27;s worth the price since they are fairly cheap.</li>
            <li> overall, good quality</li>
            <li> most of them work really well.</li>
            <li> A few of them have had issues with the bristles falling out, which certainly isn&#x27;t ideal for a nail brush.</li>
            <li> This was a really good quality product, especially for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> I have only good things to say about my brush collection.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know nail art from a mail cart, but my daughter thought they were cool and pointed this one and that one out and explained how neat they were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i love it and would really recommend it for anybody who has time and patience for nail art</li>
            <li> the wait shipping cost or money go to a art store and pay full price for these</li>
            <li> but overall good</li>
            <li> Nice set,  although a couple of the brush tops pulled off with the clear protective ends.  </li>
            <li> thank you very much,i love it,so amazing.now i can get my design</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them to do a full one-stroke flower design, including leaves and vines.</li>
            <li> Good luck to you in future sales.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> Really cool to paint miniatures on a budget.</li>
            <li> But overall good.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made but worth the price</li>
            <li> and I wanted to do some cool designs</li>
            <li> Good range on different types of brushes.</li>
            <li> Loved the different brushes that you received.  </li>
            <li> It gets the job done, good for starting out and practicing nail art designs.</li>
            <li> fast delivery love it</li>
            <li> but overall it is a good product for the price.</li>
            <li> good for your money, but definitely not pro.</li>
            <li> good for starters such as myself</li>
            <li> Not bad.  </li>
            <li> But I was pleasantly surprised to find that these are pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> Not a bad set of brushes</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price, but some of the paintbrushes did start to fall apart.</li>
            <li> Not a bad deal for the price.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft, and seem to be of pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price i paid</li>
            <li> Not bad product.  </li>
            <li> It took a couple weeks to arrive but that is not bad since it was coming from out of the country.</li>
            <li> The packaging was not bad.</li>
            <li> Not a bad price point given the usage.</li>
            <li> Shipping does take a bit but not bad considering its coming from another country.</li>
            <li> not bad for the price though.</li>
            <li> I did receive my purchase on time and paid a decent price that was the only good thing!</li>
            <li> These are pretty good nail tools, the only downfall is they fall apart easy..</li>
            <li> These brushes work  good however, when they arrived, I had to super glue the ends back on.</li>
            <li> I was worried about the quality but having used them at least a dozen times since I bought them, I am super happy!</li>
            <li> thanks so much !!!!</li>
            <li> the could of have made it more stronger and not weak</li>
            <li> I was excited to use the brushes and the first time I used one, the pieces fell apart!  </li>
            <li> The size is right for close, precise work.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re just the right size for nail art though, as you need small/tiny brushes for detailed designs.</li>
            <li> they are strong and durable and exactly what i needed.</li>
            <li> These work beautifully, but there are slight issues with them.</li>
            <li> From now, if I really like one model in particular, maybe I would spend more for better quality????</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t shed, and were vey easy for me to se my first time.</li>
            <li> I was expecting them to be cheap and fall apart when I tried to use or clean them, But they  have held up pretty well.</li>
            <li> One brush broke, but other than that, they still work great.</li>
            <li> Great for nails and other art work.  </li>
            <li> other than that.. great products</li>
            <li> Great price &amp; I got it even quicker than expected!</li>
            <li> Great buy and can a lot sooner then expected!</li>
            <li> A great variety of brushes and tools for creating endless designs on nails.</li>
            <li> My brushes arrived in great shape, other than one brush being bent during the mailing process.</li>
            <li> Great Brushes and arrived as expected!</li>
            <li> but two of the nail brushes were bent and messed up when i got them but the other brushes work great.</li>
            <li> Spend a little more money and get good brushes</li>
            <li> Otherwise, really enjoying trying new designs I couldn&#x27;t do before!</li>
            <li> One more thing to add, is I clean all my new brushes before storing them or using them,</li>
            <li> but super glue took care of that.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and as described.</li>
            <li> these brushes have met my hopes tremendously...</li>
            <li> super for just graffic design painting.</li>
            <li> great for the ladies young and old.</li>
            <li> These brushes come in so many sizes that you have many different options for your nails.</li>
            <li> For the first time I was able to apply polish and not get ANY on my cuticles and even managed a pretty durn good smile line on French tips.</li>
            <li> I have used these numerous time and have been very impressed with them and the quality, especially considering the price.</li>
            <li> not even worthy of amount paid.</li>
            <li> but I will fix that with super glue.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly</li>
            <li> But super glue can fix that</li>
            <li> The product arrived promptly but some items fell apart just as quickly.</li>
            <li> We are able to do so much with them when having fun designing her nails and mine.  </li>
            <li> Items arrived quickly and were well packaged to prevent any damage.</li>
            <li> We were able to craft our pictures such as minions, cupcakes, shamrocks, valentine, and more.</li>
            <li> This 15 pc brush (1 dot dabber) set of nail art brushes will allow me to add artistic embellishment to my otherwise decorated cards...</li>
            <li> I love this product and I will repurchase more in the future</li>
            <li> but I just use super glue.</li>
            <li> In short, I&#x27;ve paid more for latest quality.</li>
            <li> Such a great price and came in within a reasonable time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and as advertised.  </li>
            <li> You probably dont need all of them unless you&#x27;re doing some super ornate work.</li>
            <li> If you need it quick, look somewhere else.</li>
            <li> They also arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> The paint chips off quickly also.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also easy to clean and work very well</li>
            <li> The tops have popped off a lot and the nail polish paint gets stuck quickly.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> You are getting more for your money with this product and I will most definitely be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> but i think i may hv to super glue all the pieces together</li>
            <li> So many brushed for so many designs.</li>
            <li> some ruined quickly but thats okayy</li>
            <li> trust me these brushes are better to have than buying nail polishes with the skinny brushes which cost more than a regular size bottle.</li>
            <li> received quickly.  </li>
            <li> They got to me rather quickly and have lasted over a year.</li>
            <li> CALIDAD Y SUPER ACORDE CON EL TAMAÑO  </li>
            <li> These are a super deal for the brushes.  </li>
            <li> some heads fall off, just stick some super glue</li>
            <li> Very nice large set with several size and style options.</li>
            <li> It has a broad range to choose from and nice bristles.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this set if you are looking to expand your creative side on your nails.</li>
            <li> highly recommend these :)</li>
            <li> LOVe this vendor they ship super fast price is right &amp; brushes  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased to say my item came 10days early!!</li>
            <li> It is not a bad product but the bristles came apart easily and straight away</li>
            <li> But buy two if you don&#x27;t clean them right away</li>
            <li> These are just ok for kids who may want to do nail art, I would say after getting these and using them a few times, spend some more money on better ones.</li>
            <li> (These are also my very first nail art brushes if that helps)</li>
            <li> The brushes ends came off during the very first use.</li>
            <li> Cheap and really fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> But overall very satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> Because they were pretty cheap</li>
            <li> This is a good selection of brushes for nail art or other detailed work.</li>
            <li> I use them for personal use and I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I suspect after a lot of use and cleaning they will start to lose bristles, but these were a pretty cheap purchase</li>
            <li> These paint brushes are great for a first time use and first time use only.</li>
            <li> These brushes were such a great price, and I love all the different shapes.</li>
            <li> These are very pretty as well as functional.</li>
            <li> I work with miniatures and the brushes were ideal and the price was unbelievable</li>
            <li> Overall I am very satisfied</li>
            <li> Poduct took a long time to get to me but otherwise good quality.</li>
            <li> With so many options she&#x27;s found new ways to design nails and be as artistic as her heart desires.</li>
            <li> I used an acrylic brush cleaner solution to clean the brushes and the bristles shaped back nicely.</li>
            <li> for those of you who are new to the whole diy nail thing, there are some pretty good tutorials on youtube on how to use these brushes.</li>
            <li> make sure you wash them right after you use them, or you will only be able to use each brush once.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are soft and easy to use!</li>
            <li> It was well worth the wait as the brushes are an extreme value and are very nice quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become quite creative with my designs using the new brushes.</li>
            <li> I just love my new brushes.</li>
            <li> I LOVE NAIL ART, so i am always looking for new nail art accessories to purchase.</li>
            <li> they were shipped very fast and have been extremely useful!</li>
            <li> All you need to do to clean these brushes is pure acetone!</li>
            <li> Works great for my small, detailed woodworking projects...</li>
            <li> I got fifteen nail art pens and for less than $3 it is a great deal.</li>
            <li> really good and lay them out to dry</li>
            <li> Good to try out if you&#x27;re just starting to get interested in nail art.</li>
            <li> She really found these easy to use, she has done her nails over &amp; over using these tools.</li>
            <li> They easily come apart, so don&#x27;t water the whole brush (brush plus stick)</li>
            <li> All my expectations were full filled and thanks to them now</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and strong brush handles.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to invest too much until I could see if it was something I was interested in learing more.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t cost much, but they shouldn&#x27;t -- they fall apart really easily.</li>
            <li> lot of brushes for good price.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing special but worth what i spent on it.</li>

            <li> Overall EXTREMELY PLEASED!</li>
            <li> If your willing to wait for 1month for them to come then this product is for you!</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> I got them in exactly two weeks when they were supposed to take almost 4 weeks!</li>
            <li> The fan brushes are good for loose glitter placement.</li>
            <li> but I was able to put it back together easily.</li>
            <li> Let your mind go wild and be super creative.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are very light weight and also come in a clear plastic flap closing pouch.</li>
            <li> Having all sorts of different shapes really makes it easy to create your own nail designs.</li>
            <li> Added a little glue &amp; now the are great.</li>
            <li> These are also great for dipping in nail polish remover to clean small spots you&#x27;ve messed up.</li>
            <li> Good product, cheap, and it takes a little while to receive the item in the mail</li>
            <li> They still work great and are nice brushes, only problem was that little handle to brush separation.</li>
            <li> I like that they&#x27;re user friendly even for someone such as myself who is really just winging it, and also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> All the pieces are there, I can finally make amazing nail art with these, I would recommend this to you if you do nails.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from the brushes because they were so cheap.  </li>
            <li> Although I did purchase these brushes for nail designs, I find that most of them are particularly useful for detailed eyelining, such as waterlining and tightlining.</li>
            <li> I think that the quantity of the product for the price was great but a few of the heads came off after one use.</li>
            <li> Yes, they are cheap and some came a bit too frayed to use very well, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t really complain since they are so cheap.</li>
            <li> I used some for a huge project that turned out really well.  </li>
            <li> These are amazing although made for nails i used them for regular painting.</li>
            <li> These are amazing nail detail brushes, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times for my nails and it works great.</li>
            <li> Such an amazing set of brushes and for the price you cant beat it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Item as described, worth for the wait at this price and quality.</li>
            <li> Well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price 😃</li>
            <li> Yes they were a great price, but they are poorly made and the top of my brushes would fall off and fray.</li>
            <li> This pack comes with all kinds of different shapes to put any kind of design on your nails.</li>
            <li> I use these brushes frequently and it&#x27;s not a lie to say that this set is everything you need and more.</li>
            <li> Totally worth $2.</li>
            <li> Worth</li>
            <li> But definitely worth the price</li>
            <li> Worth the buy.</li>
            <li> but when I received it, it was worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> The brush still worked, but it is something worth noting.</li>
            <li> Worth the wait.</li>
            <li> They are so useful and neat.</li>
            <li> But its ok, I kinda fixed it......</li>
            <li> Have not used them, but they are as they look, and for the cost it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth the wait.</li>
            <li> its useful for what i do</li>
            <li> STILL WORTH THE PRICE</li>
            <li> I thought the really tiny flatter brushes would be more precise when I tried to draw skinny lines on my nails</li>
            <li> It took a while for me to receive my brushes in the mail, but they were worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of using the brushes they are a lot of fun.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it was worth the money I paid for it</li>
            <li> always makes me smile.  </li>
            <li> i ordered these for my artist child ok 24 year old.</li>
            <li> So much fun.  </li>
            <li> Fun for me and my daughter to play with.</li>
            <li> I also had a few problems with others but as far as the seller... GREAT!!</li>
            <li> These are fun if you like painting designs on your nails.</li>
            <li> my daughter loved it and it shipped sooner than we expected</li>
            <li> I like to take scissors to my paint brushes to tailor the tips for my own quirky way of painting.  </li>
            <li> fun for the  for price</li>
            <li> This is a fun nail art kit.</li>
            <li> My Nail Art Painting Pen Brush arrived as promised and so far I have enjoyed using it</li>
            <li> The quality was poor but price was awesome!</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> It was well worth the wait for the price and quality.</li>
            <li> Grandaughter having so much fun</li>
            <li> When I was done, I had to throw them away, but they were well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, for the price I payed, that was no big deal.</li>
            <li> but well worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re fun for nail art.</li>
            <li> Not awkward at all.</li>
            <li> They came in early, and I love painting with them.</li>
            <li> Good guality for the price,just have to be careful of the painted handles when using polish remover</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the purpose of some, but the price made it worth it.</li>
            <li> IT WAS WELL WORTH</li>
            <li> Love the brushes, so far.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re having some doubts about this product, no worries because it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> she liked all the different designs she can do</li>
            <li> Now I have some tools to use to create a lot of fun manicure designs.</li>
            <li> These are so much fun to make designs on your nails.</li>
            <li> This took a LONG time to receive, but the quality is pretty good.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the quality and variety of brushes for such a great price ($2.75).</li>
            <li> DEFINITLEY worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love these they are better quality then expected.</li>
            <li> and these are fun to use</li>
            <li> They are still useable, but for how long?&lt;br /&gt;The price for this product was a good deal, I just expected them&lt;</li>
            <li> Since they come from overseas, it takes awhile to get them but worth the wait</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re of fairly good quality, as they&#x27;re not too rough.</li>
            <li> fun to use.</li>
            <li> I got them in about two weeks (1 week before the estimated delivery date) and this was definitely worth the wait.</li>
            <li> They are what they are worth...</li>
            <li> They have withstood many uses so far, and do not shed at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, WELL worth the money I paid</li>
            <li> the are useful helpful</li>
            <li> These are fun to play with and figure out what they can do.</li>
            <li> Every time I removed the clear caps of the brushes the top of the brush would come off.</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY useful &amp; quite well constructed.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> and this just makes it easier and fun to continue</li>
            <li> They are worth what I paid for them $2.00</li>
            <li> Really worth the money.</li>
            <li> The brushes seem to be OK for a young girl to try embellishing her fingernails.  </li>
            <li> We will come up with ideas of our own or find tutorials on youtube showing different designs we can do.</li>
            <li> Worth it for the price and works well.</li>
            <li> These brushes are nice and go for a low price.</li>
            <li> but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> But I have had lots of success with nial art.....</li>
            <li> Every bush is well made and really useful.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of having all the different choices, but they&#x27;ve all fallen apart.</li>
            <li> Worth the couple bucks</li>
            <li> These were so exciting to receive in the mail.</li>
            <li> But they have done well so far with the things I have done, and I love that there is a variety</li>
            <li> They are having fun with it and the price is just right.</li>
            <li> They work fine for me, and are decent products.</li>
            <li> The Quality was okay because they had to be broken in to and one wasn&#x27;t in tacked in with the wood part over all good for clean up and details</li>
            <li> Also, the bristles harden quickly after your first use.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and a killer brush set!</li>
            <li> This set arrived quickly and was exactly as shown.</li>
            <li> I received these brushes SUPER fast 13 days before it said they should be here!</li>
            <li> They can eaiser be repaired with super glue or hot glue</li>
            <li> Got these for art work - nice set of small brushes for fine work!</li>
            <li> The brushes break really easily and the tips come off of the wooden stick too easily.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s affordable and cute and comes with a white mini package that keeps the brush clean.</li>
            <li> Only thing is you have to make sure you clean then</li>
            <li> You will want to be sure to clean them thoroughly and properly after each use though, or the bristles will stick together and the brush will not work well in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean with alcohol and letting them air dry.  </li>
            <li> Other then that good product for its price.</li>
            <li> They look good but the just came in a bag and not case like my other ones.</li>
            <li> The shipment came fast and it was worth the money!</li>
            <li> Lots of good brushes for doing nail art or for other cosmetic uses.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, these are good brushes.</li>
            <li> , I use them for other things also not just good for nails but detail painting also.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really helpful in making fun designs!</li>
            <li> So I recieved the set way before time and i am excited about that i used a brush and the whole head came off</li>
            <li> I have only used 2 of them for nail art (because I&#x27;m new to this) but have found them to be very good so far.</li>
            <li> the only thing i dont know is how to keep them clean!!</li>
            <li> They were shipped to me very fast and is exactly what it says!</li>
            <li> The paint comes right out.</li>
            <li> well right out of the package</li>
            <li> Some came apart right after opening.</li>
            <li> The price was right, delivered to my door</li>
            <li> However, after continued use the heads of the brushes start to pop right off.</li>
            <li> My order got messed up and I caught it right away that when I changed payment type it accidentally ordered two.  </li>
            <li> I went to work right away on some nail designs to try them out</li>
            <li> Was sent right out.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t Amazon Prime, so it doesn&#x27;t come right away</li>
            <li> another brush, the metal part fell off, and this was right when I opened them</li>
            <li> and she used it right away</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really go wrong here because of how cheap they are, the brushes themselves are not the greatest quality, but overall good enough for the cheap price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just the right tools</li>
            <li> I decided to use them right away as I was going to paint my nails tonight anyways.</li>
            <li> I got the brushes and right when I took them out the bristles weren&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li> and hopefully they&#x27;ll be right eventually.</li>
            <li> The price is right.</li>
            <li> The brushes broke right after a week</li>
            <li> I received my package yesterday and got right to work with them.</li>
            <li> These look well made and the price was certainly right.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s right as rain.</li>
            <li> Slipped right off.</li>
            <li> I ordered them right away.</li>
            <li> Even for amateurs or new in the nail business is easy to use.</li>
            <li> but you can still work with them for sure the detailing brushes are nice and small.</li>
            <li> contained exactly what I needed to complete many of the step by step instructions I found online.  </li>
            <li> cheep price cheep product don&#x27;t dip in acetone the white paint on brush comes off ,the fan brushes work good for stripes and flat brushes for clean up!</li>
            <li> these are great /just as good as the very expensive ones</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, and got here in decent time....</li>
            <li> cant be used with real nail polish as there is not a way to clean them with out using nail polish remover or acetone.</li>
            <li> and they clean up very well.</li>
            <li> Cheap brushes but decent.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t clean very well but for the price I cant complain</li>
            <li> The brushes were delivered fairly quickly, and were in good shape with little plastic tubes to protect the bristles.</li>
            <li> White pairing comes of handles very easily</li>
            <li> i really recommend these to anyone who loves to do nail art and needs some new tools. :)</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time doing my nails and creating new designs for my blog, so a good set of brushes is crucial to have in my arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before making the purchase, I shopped around quite a bit and took the time to read the Amazon reviews.</li>
            <li> This is a very large quantity of brushes.  </li>
            <li> a very smart purchase</li>
            <li> I really love this set and for less than the cost of most nail polish I got it shipped and can start experimenting with my nails.</li>
            <li> Also make sure you clean the brushes right after using them because the dried paint isn&#x27;t too easy to get off.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the ultimate in professional high quality, these may not be it, but if they just have to work well, hold up nicely, and clean up easily</li>
            <li> Great brushes for small jobs, can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> No, they are not top quality but for scale model builders they are a great choice</li>
            <li> This kit is really efficient and cool.</li>
            <li> While these are great brushes,I was under the impression they were for painting on canvas as I found them IN crafts and paint supplies, I will see if they can work for the small areas I need to paint</li>
            <li> The most specific reason why I bought these brushes was because they look so nice in white!</li>
            <li> great set of brushes for an unbelievable price.  </li>
            <li> So they were good at first but after a while they get bad; I rather pay more for better quality than this cheap quality.</li>
            <li> These are SUPER STINKY - like pure chemicals.  </li>
            <li> They are decent and do what they are supposed to, overall I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
            <li> but this large set was quite a bargain!</li>
            <li> but I needed good stripping brushes, they arrived 2 weeks sooner than expected well packed, and not a broken or bent brush.</li>
            <li> Overall a great buy, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d gladly pay a few more bucks for something that keeps breaking.  </li>
            <li> but so far they are holding up with good points after several uses.</li>
            <li> but they are GREAT for home use and even if you feel the need to buy an extra set to have as back up</li>
            <li> Great got them early then expected.</li>
            <li> What a great deal they have similar smaller set at Sally for $20!!!</li>
            <li> They come starched though, so make sure you rinse them gently to get the bristles soft again.</li>
            <li> Makes applying nail art much easier and look more professional.</li>
            <li> So much fun with so many different brushes -</li>
            <li> The item arrived quickly, and my sister absolutely adores it.</li>
            <li> Good value to have a collection of brushes, but I can&#x27;t think of what I&#x27;d use half of them</li>
            <li> a nice variety for a few bucks plus free shipping you cant pass up this deal.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, the glue holding the brushes together is sturdy, and I will purchase them again in the future.</li>
            <li> However, I found that I only use several of the brushes, but it&#x27;s a great deal anyway.  </li>
            <li> I know that I will use these very often to create my artistic nail designs.  </li>
            <li> you are looking for something cheap for minimal use than they are ok.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the option of the different brushes available &amp; designs you can make.</li>
            <li> I really like the different kind of brushes</li>
            <li> These were nice but metal handles were a bit loose.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and is exactly what that pictures shows.</li>
            <li> Great for intricate nail art, clean up &amp; for various nail art designs, the possibilities are endless.</li>
            <li> These are decent quality brushes!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the brushes very much but they seem to work well.</li>
            <li> This product was shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> These very tiny brushes work for when I have to be very detailed in the portraits I make.</li>
            <li> Please keep in mind these a priced very reasonable.</li>
            <li> But when one of my good brush for miniature cost 5+x the cost of this entire set, these brush are great for work that are damaging to brushes (e.g. dry brushing, painting over large area of rough surface)</li>
            <li> They feel very cheap and didn&#x27;t last after the first use.</li>
            <li> Good little throw away</li>
            <li> Loved these brushes and they even came with a little stylist.</li>
            <li> I need to learn how to use these more but theyre not super easy to start using.</li>
            <li> high quality &amp; professional looking. :)</li>
            <li> They are all very soft and well worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> I will be buying a new set that hopefully is easier to clean, but overall it is an ok set for the price</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> Many different brush sizes for every design you can imagine.</li>
            <li> Luckily the brushes I actually needed were fine.</li>
            <li> I received exactly what appears in the photo.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The set has so many different sizes</li>
            <li> I love how affordable they are and quality is solid</li>
            <li> They are exactly how they were described to me.</li>
            <li> but I was able to bend them back and still use them.</li>
            <li> First time using nail art brushes.</li>
            <li> Have used them for several types of paint and been satisfied with all of them.</li>
            <li> You can see the hot glue that they used in some of the brushes.</li>
            <li> Overall, they are OK for the price</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more of a pearl white.</li>
            <li> exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I love the different types of brushes.</li>
            <li> so they work pretty well for that.</li>
            <li> Love the variety of different types of brushes this kit comes with!</li>
            <li> I like this set of brushes, there are so many different types.</li>
            <li> So many different size brushes</li>
            <li> I would never have been able to make smaller dolls</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I will buy more from this seller in the future.</li>
            <li> I save so much money at the nail salon since i purchased these fun brushes.</li>
            <li> They seem put together pretty well and for the price</li>
            <li> These brushes arrived exactly two weeks before the estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li> Love all the different shapes and sizes of the tools too!</li>
            <li> The product came EXACTLY how it&#x27;s shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> they actually work better than the brushes i bought at MIchaels..</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> They are exactly as described.</li>
            <li> this pack of several brushes can be used in many ways.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be interested in purchasing from you again.</li>
            <li> I like the brushes and there are many different sizes to chose from.</li>
            <li> These are okay - definitely get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a package post marked from China as a Free gift cell phone case.  </li>
            <li> I got this as a gift and the recipient absolutely LOVES it!</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to fret when you ruin one as they are not expensive.</li>
            <li> Overall, I was pleased.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I hoped for as a newbie to nailart.</li>
            <li> I used them the first day i got them.</li>
            <li> Really!</li>
            <li> The pencils come in a pretty envelope.</li>
            <li> and I think that they will last me for a while :)</li>
            <li> I love the different brushes.</li>
            <li> thank you so much!  </li>
            <li> Went to use them for the first time and they fell apart ....</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes came off stick during first use.</li>
            <li> I have used many of the brushes several times and haven&#x27;t had any issues with shedding brushes.</li>
            <li> I have purchased more brushes from a local store.</li>
            <li> I dont see them lasting in an actual salon, but for personal use they work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Cant wait to use them they look like look pretty good...for a beginer.</li>
            <li> but if you had money for a better set then I suggest getting a different set.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what I was looking for to add designs to my nails.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered several more sets.</li>
            <li> I ended up not really using them more than once, but if you dont mind cleaning these pretty roughly after each use, its a good deal.</li>
            <li> have further sparked my creativity :-)</li>
            <li> They are exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> When I have had enough practice, I will buy a better set.</li>
            <li> One of the heads fell off the first time I opened the package</li>
            <li> i was able to bend it back</li>
            <li> I really thought that they had been worth every penny and they are.</li>
            <li> I love it, it is everything as advertised, I only wish they had larger dotting tools, but for the most part it serves me well</li>
            <li> I love doing different designs on my nails.</li>
            <li> Works really well for the price I paid!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used all the tools yet but the ones I have used work really well!</li>
            <li> I love them, use them daily when I do my nails!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> Save your money to get something pretty.</li>
            <li> It came with so many different kinds that I can do just about anything</li>
            <li> :) I would definitely recommend these brushes and also the seller (UnitedMail).</li>
            <li> The end of the brush came off on the first use.</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes I probably will never use (like most of the larger ones, besides the fan brushes),</li>
            <li> Two of the brushes fell apart on the first use.</li>
            <li> Love you he brushes you can do all different kinds of design&#x27;s..</li>
            <li> I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> At first, I was searching for just a fan brush when I stumbled upon this set for cheaper.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes, I just wished they had smaller tips</li>
            <li> high quality brushes!!</li>
            <li> These brushes arrived promptly and were really reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> It looks like these just hot glue it in there.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s no big deal though I can still use the ones I need most</li>
            <li> I like these brushes they work pretty well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve aways saw pretty nail designs,but they always required nail art brushes.</li>
            <li> also they were more fragile than i expected but still nice.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Brushes are mostly all the same size.</li>
            <li> Paint on handles came off after first use.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> And you really can&#x27;t beat the bang for your buck!  </li>
            <li> Love them, but they are fragile.</li>
            <li> They last forever, and there&#x27;s so many of them.</li>
            <li> Brushes took forever to arrive, then the hairs fell out first time used.  </li>
            <li> Looking forward to using real tools to paint with!</li>
            <li> Within 5 minutes of using the first brush it broke.</li>
            <li> I received exactly what is pictured.  </li>
            <li> not too big of a fan but for the money they were ok.</li>
            <li> There is so many different designs you can do at home with this set.</li>
            <li> Item exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy them again if she needs more.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I didnt realize that there were so many different brushes to use!!  </li>
            <li> They seem to hold up pretty well.</li>
            <li> at first glance they seemed to be nice.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> this set is exactly what is advertised.  </li>
            <li> I have been able to finally do some designs I&#x27;ve been wanting to try!</li>
            <li> It comes exactly what you see.</li>
            <li> I ordered two sets and am sure they will last me for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> my first nail tool set, can&#x27;t wait to ues it.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> Love them and considering ordering a second set!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> They actually remind me more of artist&#x27;s brushes.  </li>
            <li> The head of some of the brushes came off on first use.</li>
            <li> They arrived were exactly as described.</li>
            <li> so if you try to remove any accidental polish application with a remover, it will more than likely come off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this seller sent me two orders i had to double check to make sure i didnt purchase two</li>
            <li> I love my 15pc nail art brush pen set it finally arrived</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d splurge for a more pro set next time.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> That being said, I do think the quality of the bristles on some of them should be able to produce a nicer paint flow, therefore only four stars.</li>
            <li> For the price, you absolutely can not beat this!</li>
            <li> The brushes are exactly like the picture shown.</li>
            <li> I got my product on the exact estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li> Save your money buy some higher quality stuff ;)</li>
            <li> i love it and have ordered my second set, gave my 1st set to my sister and she loves them too...</li>
            <li> off)&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love these brushes and can&#x27;t wait to use them for further nail designs.</li>
            <li> but I wanted to see the quality first.</li>
            <li> They range from itty bitty to small (compared to regular brushes), and there&#x27;s also a metal dotter, which is GREAT!</li>
            <li> They shipped fast too!</li>
            <li> It arrived exactly as shown.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what I thought it was gonna be.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how fast I  got this!</li>
            <li> They are my first set of nail art brushes</li>
            <li> I first got it and already the brush heads falling of.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like it wasn&#x27;t stuck on In the first place.</li>
            <li> The different sizes make creating designs a breeze, even a beginner can use them :)</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy this product again. :)</li>
            <li> ...works well...and its simple and cute.</li>
            <li> The product provided was exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So many styles, shapes and versions of brushes and at a terrific price.</li>
            <li> but they seem pretty sturdy to me.</li>
            <li> Cheap, arrived early, Practical.</li>
            <li> I am actually thinking about ordering a couple more as gifts because of the quality.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time love all the different brushes.</li>
            <li> The ferrules seem to be pretty well made and I have not lost any fibers from the brushes since using them.  </li>
            <li> I think it is great present for person who loves to have strange nail art.</li>
            <li> First of all you can&#x27;t bet this price for all these brushes.</li>
            <li> I will probably buy these again in the future. :))</li>
            <li> At first I thought that the acetone</li>
            <li> Brushes are EXACTLY as pictured.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The few that I did use were good.  </li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t used them yet but will and hoping they will be good, since when I received them and they were damaged and dried up as if someone&#x27;s already used them...</li>
            <li> So far I used them twice , they were able to help me do new designs .</li>
            <li> They can be glued back together, but it&#x27;d be nice to not have to almost immediately repair new items.</li>
            <li> /&gt;they are great for tiny details or very long details.</li>
            <li> So far they are proving very useful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a newbie at this, but so far these brushes are easy to handle and allow me to really detail my nails.</li>
            <li> My younger was very excited to receive these brushes.</li>
            <li> I am a crafter and these brushes work great for small projects!  </li>
            <li> And the whole brush head comes right off...</li>
            <li> For 3 bucks these are probably good for less precise designs and smaller jobs, so if you&#x27;re not too serious about your designs and looking for cheap brushes, this is good for you.</li>
            <li> i have used them several times and so far I love them!</li>
            <li> They make a very fine line with the tiny points, each point is individually covered with a plastic protector to preserve the bristles, and they worked just fine.</li>
            <li> i use them every other day it is amazing to me</li>
            <li> so I just wanted a cheap set of brushes intended for nails that I could do cute little designs with.</li>
            <li> Luckily, you can slide them back on, provided they aren&#x27;t caked in nail polish, in which case you should probably clean it first.</li>
            <li> The product arrived early, I was so excited to start using them.</li>
            <li> I love to use the flat chisled brush to remove excess paint and mistakes from my fingers and cuticles.  </li>
            <li> Great quality for the price and arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Never leave polish in the brush, and clean it with NON ACETONE SOLUTIONS to keep bristles soft.</li>
            <li> every conceivable size cleanly applies polish and there is a variety of styles to execute</li>
            <li> A good variety of brushes for several different styles/designs.</li>
            <li> I have only used about 5 of these brushes, considering some of them can&#x27;t even really be used for nail art unless you get really creative, I guess.</li>
            <li> good product, the brush are soft as I expected and as I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you really cant go wrong with these, awesome!</li>
            <li> I use acrylic paint on my nails over a top coat and they work very well for different techniques and detail.</li>
            <li> I bought some cheap ones on Amazon before that were OK, but lost bristles after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a really good brush set to get and especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I have some really nice brushes that I didn&#x27;t want to destroy by using nail polish and acetone just to have some fun painting my nails.</li>
            <li> other than the quality, its a pretty good set of brushes for the price amazon offers you.</li>
            <li> Brushes began to fall apart 2nd time I used them to clean the nail polish out!</li>
            <li> Its not the best quality, I mean it was only like $2</li>
            <li> I especially liked how it arrived in a thin plastic case, all in one piece and not a mess.</li>
            <li> Great for any artist really (for small jobs) !</li>
            <li> but the bristles are a little cheap,they aren&#x27;t very flexible or soft, but they work great for nail art.</li>
            <li> I think these brushes seem a little cheap, but overall, I thought they worked really good for the price that they go for.</li>
            <li> They come apart easily withing the first or second use.</li>
            <li> They pretty much are a one time brush.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I try to make myself pretty , but it cost soooooo much.</li>
            <li> pretty fast.</li>
            <li> While I knew I wasn&#x27;t getting an extremely high-quality brush set at this price, I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using these for a couple months now to create fun art with my home Gel Polish kit.</li>
            <li> Works great for eye makeup, the other brushed that I did not use</li>
            <li> The dotting tool fell off pretty much as soon as I got it.</li>
            <li> , shipping was pretty fast also considering they are coming from another country.</li>
            <li> They were a great price and are exactly the same as some of the other brushes my co-workes had and paid twice as much for</li>
            <li> I use this for pretty much everything to do with nail art.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, pretty much.</li>
            <li> They are great, even for other such art medias, not just nail.</li>
            <li> Shipping was also pretty fast.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re only good if you want them for beginners the brushes are not thin enough to do some designs</li>
            <li> They are good for small detail work when doing nail art designs at paintthatnaildotcom</li>
            <li> Not worth going threw an exchange/refund but still would be nice to have an undamaged product arrive.</li>
            <li> But other than that, so far so good.</li>
            <li> I actually received two of the same brushes, and end up not getting a dotting tool which I was looking forward to, but the price is so good that it does not bother me much.</li>
            <li> Even my 4 year old daughter loves how i can get done more quickly with these brushes than doing it alone and it also dont take as long as well.</li>
            <li> You definitely get what you pay.. Wasn&#x27;t expecting anything professional or even for them to last more then a month but as soon as I took them out of the package the metal part with the brush fell off of most of them.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t compare with any other brushes though, since this is my first purchase, so I&#x27;m not sure if they are the best ever.</li>
            <li> Make sure after you use it... clean it property or it will get stiff.</li>
            <li> exactly what i expected and more</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected... love them.</li>
            <li> Very well made and arrived a bit late but came with a nice plastic pouch!</li>
            <li> The brushed have since come out of their holders and fray easily.</li>
            <li> Super soft &amp;</li>
            <li> Also super soft on the face</li>
            <li> Easy to fix back on.</li>
            <li> One came broken but that is nothing that a lil hot glue can not fix, the pens work great and they  do not curve when painting.</li>
            <li> but it was easy to stick back together.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase and would definitely purchase again if needed.</li>
            <li> I have had them for several months now and they are still going strong.  </li>
            <li> and they are still going strong a year later.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was the strong smell as I opened the package.</li>
            <li> Pretty cheap, cheap plastic,  little brush hairs come off.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set specifically for the large brush pictured and it didn&#x27;t come with it.</li>
            <li> No ones nails are that large anyway.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t order this if you need it exactly by a certain date.  </li>
            <li> Overall a great selection and totally worth the few bucks!</li>
            <li> alone with a brushes you receive a dotting tool to make dots, striper brushes which are very difficult to find and brushes that I love you to make flower designs leave the signs and many more.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll probably buy two more sets just in case i ever loose them.</li>
            <li> (a fine tip brush with a few bristles that splay every which way, screwing up any attempts at fine detailing)</li>
            <li> Perfect.. exactly what I wanted it.. even tho there was one broken!!</li>
            <li> But I was disapointed to see that I got 2 of the same brush and not the fine striping brush I wanted.</li>
            <li> They are a set of fine brushes that can only be used for nail art.</li>
            <li> Decent quality at an unbeatable price!</li>
            <li> Are pretty decent quality and work</li>
            <li> I bet they would be pretty decent.</li>
            <li> But they do have pretty decent quality.</li>
            <li> super cheep.some of the medal tips with the brushes fell off, right after I opened the package; had to glue them back on</li>
            <li> Came nicely packaged and with a little case to keep all of the brushes in.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve held up nicely and I haven&#x27;t had any of them break, although one of the tips is a little jiggly.</li>
            <li> I mostly use the small synthetic brushes to clean the sides of my nails with polish remover</li>
            <li> This is a great little set of brushes for an amazingly low price.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li> easy to clean with a little bit of nail polish remover</li>
            <li> /&gt;- make sure you know how to clean nail polish off the white brushes, they can get stuck for a long time</li>
            <li> Good but hard to wash</li>
            <li> I dipped the new clean soft brush in the polish pulled it out and tried painting.</li>
            <li> I love how stiff the brush is so I can make a clear fine line, but not for blending lines.&lt;br /&gt;Each</li>
            <li> and I needed different tools than just the dotting tool, these brushes do it all from straight lines and precise designs..</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is a beginner when it comes to nail decorating (and isn&#x27;t in a huge hurry to get them)</li>
            <li> Letting them soak, not soak, washing immediately, washing after the paint dried - nothing made it easy to clean the stripers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thank you so much sending it on time.</li>
            <li> it really should have a notice with the product.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like them as much.</li>
            <li> They work very well.</li>
            <li> For such a cheap price, it was a steal.</li>
            <li> and i just wish the packagers would be more careful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really recommend this product because I think that it is a RIP OFF</li>
            <li> /&gt;She is really into doing her nails up</li>
            <li> Al the tops came off the sticks, so just be ready to re-glue.</li>
            <li> Do not order from this seller unless you are ready to wait over a month for your stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another thing was that the brushes that have a brown looking tip are really a orange.</li>
            <li> But that doesn&#x27;t matter much i guess.</li>
            <li> They work very well, haven&#x27;t lost any hairs.</li>
            <li> I guess you really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> they work really well</li>
            <li> I really like the brushes..</li>
            <li> I needed something different to get precise lines</li>
            <li> so expect the delivery time to be very lengthy..</li>
            <li> Very flimsy.</li>
            <li> but like the product variety and how fast I received them.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really purchase then for nail art though.</li>
            <li> even if they don&#x27;t they were cheap enough</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to start doing nail art for a while now, but I dont want to buy  a very expencive pack of brushes.</li>
            <li> Thede arrived as expected the packing could have had more padding  </li>
            <li> My daughter (17 yo) loves doing her nails, and these brushes just made things a whole lot easier for her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but they work and are very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Highly highly recommended!</li>
            <li> it was very convenient</li>
            <li> They also have relatively fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Thin and great for nails.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it too much the one time</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t work well as nail tools, or painting really</li>
            <li> so can&#x27;t really complain about that.</li>
            <li> I bought this set for quite a while and it still hold up really well.  </li>
            <li> All ready wrote this one.</li>
            <li> For a kid, who made be going through a fad, I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much $.  </li>

            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> had went to the store and spent more than 5 bucks on some nail art brushes and I like these way better&lt;</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> she was very please about the quality and</li>
            <li> /&gt;- quality is decent.&lt;br /&gt;- light weight, stick is wooden</li>
            <li> Hairs falling out and I was screwed out of extra $25 for what was sold as \\&quot;free shipping\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Got it within a reasonable amount of time even with it being around the holidays.</li>
            <li> They were a gift, and the recipient really likes them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They took a whole to get here</li>
            <li> Work really well.</li>
            <li> My daughter didn&#x27;t care too much about returning them</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t really work that well.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t cost much</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> For the price of these I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much.  </li>
            <li> The brushes worked well enough, and I was happy with what I got since I paid such a low price for these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these&lt;br /&gt;brushes for anyone!</li>

            <li> They work very well for that purpose.  </li>
            <li> Definitely got what I paid for..super cheap, trinkets.</li>
            <li> The tools were on my porch ready to be used.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I expected better than this.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really beat them for the price.</li>
            <li> So much easier than using those nail art design polishes that come wit</li>
            <li> she had broken one of hers the day before, so it worked out great.</li>
            <li> and I really like them.  </li>
            <li> I have not gotten much use of them for myself</li>
            <li> Ready to use whn</li>
            <li> Very recived item.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be better</li>
            <li> My brushes arrived a whole TWO WEEKS before the estimated arrival date.</li>
            <li> I received the brushes in a reasonable amount of time.  </li>
            <li> I dont really know what else to say about them...</li>
            <li> I really like all the brushes but some of them started coming apart</li>
            <li> The shipping was really fast and the brushes look just like the ones in the pic.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced...</li>
            <li> I have used 4 brushes already and they have made it so much easier to do nail art.</li>
            <li> I really do like the ones I have been using though.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes</li>
            <li> it was fast shipping</li>
            <li> this product is working very well</li>
            <li> I got out the polish and brushes and got straight to work.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> very usseful for nails desings come on time and in great&lt;br /&gt;shape</li>
            <li> A lot of them do have the same function but for the number of brushes, there&#x27;s no complaints given the price and free shipping.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> He really likes the detail they allow him to achieve.</li>
            <li> My daughter is really into doing nails</li>
            <li> The handles are made of wood, and are very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Price was reasonable and quality of brushes matches price.</li>
            <li> but once u go to wipe them off the whole brush comes off</li>
            <li> then you pay for really.</li>
            <li> The white is just cheap paint that gets suuuuuper sticky &amp; smudged.</li>
            <li> They all work really well</li>
            <li> if your a beginner on nail art for fun or professionally this is the kit for you</li>
            <li> I would say it was  quite fast delivery.</li>
            <li> She is really into nail design.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> do not use acetone with these as it will take the cheap white paint off of the brushes and makes them sticky and it gets everywhere.</li>
            <li> i really like it.</li>
            <li> No matter how much you tug at the bristles of the brush, the don&#x27;t come off.</li>
            <li> I really like how there are fifteen brushes in this set.</li>
            <li> I am very up-sad.</li>
            <li> However, for the price you can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> 5 weeks waiting, Really?  </li>
            <li> im very upset that is has been over a month without any feedback</li>
            <li> They looked just as pictured, except that they arrived in a cheap, disposable plastic bag instead of the reusable package they are pictured in my seller in last picture posted.</li>
            <li> thanks will be buying again</li>
            <li> Was cheap enough for $2 bucks so why not?</li>
            <li> Thanks to these brushes</li>
            <li> I really could use.</li>
            <li> and it arrived safely and carefully packaged</li>
            <li> They make doing nail art a whole lot easier.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for all you have done for me.</li>
            <li> Thanks, kay</li>
            <li> /&gt;To make the color really  pop</li>
            <li> THANKS.</li>
            <li> and they make the world of designing your nails so much easier .</li>
            <li> Product is as described and came fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Very slender.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, the bristles would come out when I was washing them even if I was gentle which made me nervous thinking</li>
            <li> Makes doing art on my nails much easier.</li>
            <li> makes nail designs so so much easier and so much neater</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how much I trust them.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, we received it in 10 days.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t beat the price and they shipped fast</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect much from these as art brushes but for nail art</li>
            <li> These nail brushes don&#x27;t really work......</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for though, so I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> but once they get wet the glue seems to loosen to where the top falls off</li>
            <li> Very helpful.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Kinda made cheap the brush parts keep falling off the white stick</li>
            <li> I can not get them to do much designing</li>
            <li> making designs is so much eaiser now thati have them.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it works very well with my paint set.</li>
            <li> she will do her nails 10 times in a day if they don&#x27;t turn out how she wants them too.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Those brushes are looking very worn already</li>
            <li> Was a fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping though!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The pouch the came in was very flimsy.</li>
            <li> They are really durable and hold the polish well.</li>
            <li> This product makes doing my nails much easer.</li>
            <li> The nail polish itself doesn&#x27;t really work with the material of the brush.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> The handles are white and feel comfortable.  </li>
            <li> VERY  </li>
            <li> THANKS PLEASE SEND ME INFO FOR MORE&lt;</li>
            <li> i really could design,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> i really consentrate on the design</li>
            <li> , she really wanted a variety of brushes.  </li>
            <li> The brushes were more than I expected.  </li>
            <li> REALLY RECOMMEND FOR THOSE WHO ARE INTO NAIL ART.</li>
            <li> I really like that brush because its easier to hold while painting.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li> arrived earlier than expected, in good condition.  </li>
            <li> I like the set its a nice variety but one of my brushes is missing the whole silver part with the bristles on</li>
            <li> There are a few doubles as shown in the picture which is nice as a &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a few of these and so far so good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;A very inexpensive way to put a smile on a young girls face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been able to use one brush so far and it does the job well.</li>
            <li> mostly use the brushes for cleanup, and the thin brushes for my attempts at more intricate designs.</li>
            <li> No one ever thinks I do them myself:) I have only used three so far</li>
            <li> wow such a bargain so many to work with now</li>
            <li> I also liked how they included a small dotting tool into the mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The area where the wood and metal of the brushes connect aren&#x27;t glued together very tightly, but this can be fixed very easily with some extra glue or tape on your own hand.</li>
            <li> Brushes came in early!!!</li>
            <li> So far, just by touching, I don&#x27;t think they will shed any except for one brush that look more fragile than other.</li>
            <li> They are ok so far - average quality - ok for a beginner, but a professional might like something a little better</li>
            <li> I had to try to super glue seven of the brushes back together after they fell apart BEFORE the first use.</li>
            <li> Received it yesterday and was very happy because I used it the same day brushes do look cheap but does a expensive job!</li>
            <li> The set is very nice, quite a few different brushes and it comes with the dotter which I didnt see in the description</li>
            <li> besides that they are not very expensive</li>
            <li> I love these very much, the only thing I would say I dont like about this product is thst the white on the sticks of the brushes, if you dip it in nail polish remover</li>
            <li> Not only can you tell they are durable, the bristles don&#x27;t fall out after much use and they clean up well, too.</li>
            <li> I love the wide variety for effects that I have with this particular brush set.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I finally received these.</li>
            <li> Other than that there ok.</li>
            <li> I use them for nail art and many other craft type projects.</li>
            <li> But other then that they are ok.</li>
            <li> She has had such success with them!  </li>
            <li> If I&#x27;d paid anything substantial for these I probably would have returned or even given less stars, however in the grand scheme of things even with the lengthy shipping and a couple of brushes arriving broken they are ok :)</li>
            <li> Recomend this for anyone that wants to try new designs on their nails!</li>
            <li> very cheap product not worth your money</li>
            <li> Other than the white fan brush they seem pretty good so far, but I will update this once I get a chance to use some of them.</li>
            <li> but when you use nail polish remover to clean the brushes it takes the white paint off the brushes.</li>
            <li> But other than that the other brushes were great and worked like they should have.</li>
            <li> Even though the brushes get all crunchy, the tools don&#x27;t clean and they are made out of cheap materials, The brushes can be really helpful at making small designs and you want to use real tools and not homemade tools.</li>
            <li> I actually did clean the brushes I used with nail polish remover and</li>
            <li> , I was using one of the larger brushes to \\&quot;clean up\\&quot; my edges.</li>
            <li> Impossible to get the polish off of, good if you don&#x27;t want a good nail design, and are only hoping for one time use though.</li>
            <li> Other than that she was very excited with them.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to not be dumb like me and dip the white parts in acetone nail polish removed, it kind of makes the paint wipe off.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that my practice is not enough in terms that I cant make very fine lines, which is the number one thing I am looking for.</li>
            <li> lots of nice brushes - only 4 stars because they took to long to come!</li>
            <li> will probably use them on my feet first since my nails are short right now..</li>
            <li> but I glued the back on for the price it is right!</li>
            <li> Not super happy, but otherwise everything came as expected.</li>
            <li> They are really good quality for such a cheap price, but for me the shipping was a tad bit slow, but I&#x27;d rather get a slightly slow shipping speed and a low price than anything else (unless that anything is a good buy and a fast shipping</li>
            <li> Such good quality brushes I expected flimsy old brushes.</li>
            <li> Nice small brushes.</li>
            <li> I guess China is pretty far.</li>
            <li> It can be easily fixed with some hot glue.  </li>
            <li> They have nice tips that hold up well to small design.</li>
            <li> and they actually are not a bad quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used about 4 out of these 15 brushes, mostly for cuticle clean up and those 4 brushes aren&#x27;t even brushes anymore because there&#x27;s just 2 strings left of the entire brush that fell off.</li>
            <li> You really have to soak them in remover for a long time after to clean them.</li>
            <li> I bought these primarily for the small, blunt brush to clean up around the cuticles like the pros do.  </li>
            <li> The striper brush gives me a little difficulty but overall the product is good.</li>
            <li> Ordered on Christmas Eve and received it by New Year&#x27;s Eve!</li>
            <li> so I can try new designs out!</li>
            <li> Other than that it is great for such a low price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used a couple of them so far -- because, to be honest, I&#x27;m still learning about what they all do -- but the two flat brushes have changed my life.</li>
            <li> These are really going to help with my new found intrested in nail art.</li>
            <li> Well they work great except for the fact that its impossible to have them clean.</li>
            <li> They will get the job done but be careful they&#x27;re easy to break.</li>
            <li> They work well and the fibers on the brushes don&#x27;t fall off easily like I expected them to.</li>
            <li> I love the different options of the different brushes.</li>
            <li> Decent quality</li>
            <li> They are decent brushes.</li>
            <li> One of the brushes did lose it&#x27;s head but with super glue, it went back up.</li>
            <li> Mainly the set contains of brushes and one dotting pen.</li>
            <li> so I put a drop of super glue gel on the wood and pressed it back together!</li>
            <li> These are decent brushes but when I opened them 2 of my brushes were falling off of the handle part.</li>
            <li> Decent product for the price.  </li>
            <li> They look to be of a decent quality</li>
            <li> &amp; of course it&#x27;d be the main ones I wanted..</li>
            <li> and they all have a particular function.</li>
            <li> Decent quality for starter brushes</li>
            <li> Decent quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Item arrived a week earlier then estimated and seller included a cute butterfly magnet in the package that I definitely appreciate.</li>
            <li> So I decided to get these mainly becouse</li>
            <li> Decent set for the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still learning how to use the brushes at this point, but they seem adequate enough to do the job!</li>
            <li> My experience focuses mainly on the seller and their prompt response...</li>
            <li> Gives you plenty of different styles to create many different looks on your nails.</li>
            <li> using these brushes with some simple nail polishes, it did not seem to be able to hold on to the nail polish well enough for me to apply it easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are 15 pieces, however many are repeats or way too similar to be used differently.</li>
            <li> Lots of different tips for many different designs.</li>
            <li> They seem decent for the money.</li>
            <li> Most of the brushes look very similar but the creator of these brushes tried making them look different by using an assortment of colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used mine mainly for cleaning up around the cuticles with acetone.</li>
            <li> but there decent for what I&#x27;m using them for.</li>
            <li> I like the product and it comes as pictured, however, if you want to soak the nail polish out of the brush after use, make sure you don&#x27;t dunk the white handle of the brush in the nail polish remover, or the white handle</li>
            <li> (my hands have ended up WHITE, and the paint will melt on to EVERYTHING it touches), and the entire brush+metal part broke off of many of the sticks and needs to be super glued back</li>
            <li> The paint rubs off a little with acetone and one of mine came apart at the metal part, but a little super glue and its good as new!</li>
            <li> These just arrived in my mailbox and I was very surprised by how fast they showed up.</li>
            <li> I have been on the hunt for the tiniest brush I could find for tightlining, as I have never been satisfied with traditional eyeliner brushes on the market, high end or low end.</li>
            <li> By fell apart, I mean that brush hairs came out in clumps on top of freshly painted nails art.</li>
            <li> at least you&#x27;ll be able to use them!</li>
            <li> Love them very pe and cool but one was broken when I got then</li>
            <li> This brush set is good but not strong enough to used with arcylic powder with.</li>
            <li> cause some brushes are hard to clean but not this it so fast to clean</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended seller.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend for nails but also any art project</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s high quality.</li>
            <li> They were high quality</li>
            <li> And I didnt think that they would be this high of quality.</li>
            <li> AS LONG AS YOU ALWAYS CLEAN THEM</li>
            <li> : I have lost even more brushes because they do not clean well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice having such a wide variety of brushes to pick from while I&#x27;m designing !</li>
            <li> Easy to clean as well as to use, the only problem is that on a two brushes is that they stick out, and those do get a bit sloppy, but otherwise they have been fantastic.</li>
            <li> But these were a little more than that.</li>
            <li> I used the metal ball-tipped \\&quot;brush\\&quot; to apply little diamonds on my nails, which was better than using toothpicks.</li>
            <li> I really love all of these little brushes.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for... or a little more with these.</li>
            <li> They come in a flimsy little plastic pouch, but I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
            <li> so I plan to make them look a little more fancy than they are.</li>
            <li> The shipping time was a little bit of a wait, but the price more than made up for it.  </li>
            <li> Just with they were a little more durable.</li>
            <li> I love the little brushes.</li>
            <li> Only $2 and fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> The brush piece on one, fell off the other day but it was an easy fix.</li>
            <li> They are a little flimsy, but are more than worth the price paid for them which was REALLY low.</li>
            <li> For the most art these nail art brushes are really nice, a few of them are really hard, and it takes a while to break them in.</li>
            <li> Have cleaned them very very carefully - but for the price, it is easy to replace.</li>
            <li> Despite some bad reviews, I think these nail art brushes are awesome.</li>
            <li> These brushes are pretty sturdy for brushes in general.</li>
            <li> These brushes are much too soft to work with nail art.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues thus far with the brushes I received, they&#x27;re easy to clean, although they do stain (which is common with any type of brush).</li>
            <li> They were shipped surprisingly fast considering they came from the Far East.</li>
            <li> They shipped fast and has everything I&#x27;ve needed so far to do nail art.</li>
            <li> These were a great price, so I thought I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> There was only one brush that was even remotely useful.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it was worth the 2 dollars and</li>
            <li> So many different styles and tips, I can finally do a lot of the designs by myself that I&#x27;ve gotten done professionally.</li>
            <li> I loved the fan brushes for adding glitter and the smaller brush for small designs.</li>
            <li> Ok, but I can&#x27;t imagine they will last long</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve actually used art brushes instead of toothpicks or whatnot, and it&#x27;s much easier to draw with in my opinion.</li>
            <li> They look pretty much the same</li>
            <li> Find better brushes elsewhere, its a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Starting with a nice crunchy brush is not fun</li>
            <li> I was pleased with my order, except, a few of the brushes were frayed</li>
            <li> 15 pcs is really more than I needed, though, so I gave a few to my daughter to use for her nails.  </li>
            <li> So if you don&#x27;t mind waiting a solid month to receive these brushes there well worth it for a buck.</li>
            <li> a few of them came undone but was still able to use.</li>
            <li> I wouldve liked different sized dotting and a minus a brush or two but so far</li>
            <li> I will say provided you use non acetone cleaner the brushes return to normal.</li>
            <li> You have 2 fans, two normal brushes and then a lot of detail and striping brushes.</li>
            <li> From the metal to the wooden part not al the brushes were glued together, but a little super glue fixed it al :)</li>
            <li> Some of them fell apart but a little hot glue fixed it easily.</li>
            <li> the brushes are nice, but 3 of my striping brushes were bent in the middle (the packaging was folded down creating a crease)..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with how the brushes have worked making small nail designs, but if you clean the brushes with nail polish remover (even non acetone) the paint will come off and make a mess.  </li>
            <li> :)  Sorry it was a bad batch of brushes but lets make them better too have all the nice sells you can have!!</li>
            <li> Other than that, they are fine.</li>
            <li> required for all crafting and cake paintinggreat for christmas and other holiday art that require fine touches.  </li>
            <li> Other than that everything else was fine.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very nice and are good for a few uses and just can&#x27;t find a brush that the ends don&#x27;t go bad on them...</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the metal part, holding the brush, comes off from the wooden stick fairly easy</li>
            <li> Some of the brush tips have fallen off, but it is easy enough to glue them back on.</li>
            <li> The tips came off of the brushes easily, but I simply glued them back on.</li>
            <li> The white paint on the brushes comes off with acetone, so be sure to keep it dry.</li>
            <li> metal brush heads are not well attached to the wooden handles, but you can just as easily pop them back on with a bit of glue.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Also, the metal barrel part completely fell off on 2 of the brushes– the first time I was using them– and it made a huge mess.  </li>
            <li> There are so many different sizes, and I can&#x27;t wait to use every single one of them.</li>
            <li> Also keep the white painted handles away from polish remover as it eats it right off.</li>
            <li> Super package!&lt;br /&gt;There are lot of strange brushes</li>
            <li> Very nice looking quality and for the price can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I actually use them for the fine details in my regular canvas painting.</li>
            <li> but they do have a few brushes that fit the needs I have when I&#x27;m doing certain designs</li>
            <li> It makes my nails look very professional and is not hard to do.</li>
            <li> The fan brushes are a little delicate but other wise a fairly nice set.</li>
            <li> I liked the little note that came with &amp; the extra butterfly magnet..</li>
            <li> the only thing these brushes are good for is experimenting, the results they give are not worth wearing out in public.</li>
            <li> I live in California, US., and these brushes came from Hong Kong.</li>
            <li> The tool were new and came In a bag.</li>
            <li> Ive never had any problems with anything ... if it was damaged they send new..</li>
            <li> Every couple of weeks, she comes up with a new design.</li>
            <li> It all brand new when arrived.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my granddaughter along with some rhinestones and tape, she is just new to experimenting with nail polish.  </li>
            <li> This came with all pieces and just in time for new nail art.</li>
            <li> many of the brush heads were off when they arrived, I easily glued them, but obviously I would have preferred a product that wasn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> Nicely packaged in heavy plastic case, brushes well protected and in proper shape on arrival.</li>
            <li> The only thing I really don&#x27;t like is the brushes seem very brittle.</li>
            <li> Pencils are simple and like the white material, they do not look cheap.</li>
            <li> but the first option had way too many brushes for me and the second had some fairly poor reviews -- much like many of the other brush sets.</li>
            <li> There are two fan brushes, several with very tiny points and some squared-off ones all of which should be very useful.</li>
            <li> I am very surprised at how well these brushes have held up, and how well they are designed for articulate nail art.</li>
            <li> The longer brush took some extra TLC due to barely fitting within the confined plastic carrying case.</li>
            <li> they took forever for me to get them when i did 1 of the metal tips was bent in half but the ones i have wanted to use worked just fine</li>
            <li> I love doing my nails and usually use toothpicks</li>
            <li> The paint on the actual handle came off after I cleaned it, but I&#x27;m not too concerned because I don&#x27;t need them to be pretty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The wait was long, since it&#x27;s shipped from China, but it was well worth it</li>
            <li> My favorite is the small detail brush.</li>
            <li> but sometimes the metal piece will detach from the wooden handle but nothing some wood glue or hot glue won&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> Love all the brushes and sizes ONLY a tiny issue when u put them in nail polish remover the white paint comes off and the glue that attached to the brush loosens the brush.</li>
            <li> I have been painting collie pictures on small shells for a project this summer - LOVE these brushes I use acrylic, sometimes water color (on paper).&lt;br</li>
            <li> i know they&#x27;re cheap, but not worth it.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine bought the exact same identical set at a beauty supply shop nearby for over 5 times what I paid for these.</li>
            <li> this set of nail brushes was exactly what I needed to do the designs I&#x27;m trying to learn next.</li>
            <li> And they aware comparable with nail polish removed to take away polish for French tips!</li>
            <li> Received them early!</li>
            <li> Thank you for your professional work!</li>
            <li> I use them nearly every time I paint my nails!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried nail poish remover and hot water on multiple occasions to take it out and nothing ever works.</li>
            <li> And, as another user suggested - DO NOT LET THESE BRUSHES GO NEAR ACETONE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just starting out, and I love it, especially at the low price!  </li>
            <li> I do nail art for fun, not a professional</li>
            <li> So, I had to hot glue them back on.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, the tip came unglued from the wooden stick.  </li>
            <li> Used for painting small details on canvas, sculpture and more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only that, they are exactly as pictured</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes when I was first starting to get into nail art</li>
            <li> Well worth the long wait from China mail.</li>
            <li> I got them about a week ago and just started using them, the first time I did anything with them the metal part fell off, so I had to wood glue them back</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> They can be used for many other uses, not only nail art.</li>
            <li> I would say skip and buy professional ones!</li>
            <li> Although they were shipped from China, which wasntba problem, they still arrived a full week before the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t super high quality, but what would you expect for such a low price?</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t super high quality, but what would you expect for such a low price?</li>
            <li> I just wasted couple of brushes so I can easily afford myself to buy  a new one.</li>
            <li> and they all came in a little pouch too for easy storage.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to clean between uses if you want to use the same brush for a different color,</li>
            <li> also..i use nail polish remover to clean the tips, i dipped too low once and the white on the handle of the brush immediately came off!</li>
            <li> The white paint seems to chip off the brushes very easily which is messy.</li>
            <li> The handles are much longer than I was expecting and it takes a LONG time to get these, but there are many of them, designed to do different things, so just handy to have -- can certainly use them for other delicate painting also!</li>
            <li> (ESPECIALLY since her nail beds are so tiny right now!)</li>
            <li> A few of the brushes were stuck together, but they were easy to separate.</li>
            <li> Wow, these usually cost a lot more sold seperately.</li>
            <li> The shipping was like any other shipping from china, nothing special.</li>
            <li> Nothing a little super glue couldn&#x27;t fix!</li>
            <li> These are great as really small paintbrushes especially for watercolors, nail polish also works though nailpolish remover takes the paint on the handles off so be careful with that.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had with this set was I had to super glue some of the heads back on.</li>
            <li> Ill make sure to not buy any else from you guys after today 3/11/2013 seller lucky electronics</li>
            <li> and you might need some super glue especially for the part where the metal meets the wood, and I wish there had been some type of description for the different brushes</li>
            <li> This nail art painting pen brush allows me to paint accurately even in tight areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the fine brushes a few times now for some nail art</li>
            <li> They pop right back on and were not loose or anything like that.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t seem cheap and you probably wouldn&#x27;t even know that I got them for so little.</li>
            <li> As long as you clean them they should last, they haven&#x27;t shedded and for under $3.00 usd</li>
            <li> and as long as i wipe them off on a cotton ball soaked in nail polish remover they come completely clean, even the white brushes!!</li>
            <li> I used the brushes for nail art very easy to handle and small enough to make</li>
            <li> Spend a little extra and get art/paint brushes from a store like Michaels and you&#x27;ll get better quality.</li>
            <li> the white bristles fan out a little more then 1&amp;#34</li>
            <li> The packaging caused the bristles to point in every direction and was hard to fix for most of them I had to cut the bristles or throw away.</li>
            <li> The clear plastic pouch they vome in was split and two of the brushes came detached from the handle</li>
            <li> My product came in a clear pouch that was damaged upon arrival.</li>
            <li> And they aren&#x27;t clear coated so the paint is coming off them already..  </li>
            <li> I coated the end that I messed up in clear coat</li>
            <li> They were cheap, and came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product and the wide assortment of small brushes in the set.</li>
            <li> Delivery:&lt;br /&gt;The brushes were delivered in a clear vinyl pouch.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Although the one time I did use acetone it did mess up the ends of one of the flat top brushes.</li>
            <li> Upon inspection, they came in a clear pouch with each brush covered with a clear tube except the two fan brushes.  </li>
            <li> This received four instead of five stars because one of the fan brushes, the bristles are a bit frayed, but it&#x27;s nothing that can&#x27;t be fixed at home.</li>
            <li> I am a professional artist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried a couple of them and they work really well,</li>
            <li> these were a complete wast of money</li>
            <li> Just now really using them only recommend if your just want a one time use or practice tool.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T GO ANYWHERE NEAR ACETONE WITH THESE THINGS.</li>
            <li> Although they took forever to arrive, I was really surprised by the quality of the brushes.</li>
            <li> This goes with the nail art set of 24 polish colors that I purchased for my adult granddaughter.</li>
            <li> So, far, I like this.  </li>
            <li> When the brushes get near nail polish remover the paint starts to come off.</li>
            <li> The brushes took awhile to arrive, but they were very affordable, so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
            <li> The metal sleeve that holds the brush to the handle slipped off two brushes the day I received them, but really that&#x27;s my only qualm with them.  </li>
            <li> they are made sturdy and have worked for everything I used them for so far</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bought these for my 12 year old niece who is into nail art.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t let these get near to acetone, or brushes are ruined.</li>
            <li> give me pleasure low price and fast survice</li>
            <li> but I just fixed them</li>
            <li> I can get the professional look at home.</li>
            <li> brushes are quite soft</li>
            <li> and it is much much easier to control brush stroke compared to using my regular nail polish</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t think of anything else you would need to complete the job.</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes are soft but it works well.</li>
            <li> but I fixed them so thank you</li>
            <li> The items met my expectations completely</li>
            <li> Arrived early and just as described online.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, this was one of the times when I was surprised.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has used them frequently without problems</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> they such so much</li>
            <li> So far these have not.  </li>
            <li> I used the brushes today, to mix a few colors together, and they blended smoothly.</li>
            <li> but so far there</li>
            <li> Tried them out for the first time, i am no professional</li>
            <li> so this is why I will frequently purchase them.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li> Easily fixed.</li>
            <li> Received this product early and packaged neatly.</li>
            <li> I like it, but I would rather for the handles to be all metal than soft wood.</li>
            <li> Arrived early, however not all the brushes were there.</li>
            <li> The metal pieces and wooden pieces are not put together very well at all.</li>
            <li> Package was 2 weeks early.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve held up well so far and have used them a number of times with craft acrylics.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t had any issues with them.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised as I wasn&#x27;t expecting them for a while.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t weigh in on how they&#x27;d hold up for a professional.</li>
            <li> and it said complete order</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like the fact that I over payed 17cent for each in total 34 cents....</li>
            <li> I actually use these brushes for hand painting cakes and they work very well.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t work very well and they constantly broke.</li>
            <li> so does my 4 year old.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast considering it was international, the package was sent registered mail to protect sender and recipient, and it was packaged well.</li>
            <li> They came either in time or early, I can&#x27;t remember.</li>
            <li> I had one of the handles come apart from the bristles, but it was easily fixed with nail glue.</li>
            <li> But that eas easily fixed.</li>

            <li> I have purchased a set from Sally&#x27;s and this one by far exceeds those.</li>
            <li> Cleaning the brush is simple, all I have to do is to wash it clean and dry them and the brushes are ready for next use.</li>
            <li> I got these as a stocking stuffer for my 11 year old daughter</li>
            <li> The bristles feel very durable and solid.  </li>
            <li> these get old</li>
            <li> I saw this one and was surprised looking at price.</li>
            <li> Looks professional too.</li>
            <li> Arrived early.</li>
            <li> Ive used 3 of the 15 and WOW...</li>
            <li> The tips are falling off the wooden handles but there are so many brushes that you won&#x27;t miss the few that broke.</li>
            <li> Recommend spending a few extra dollars to get a better product.  </li>
            <li> Love all the different brushes, and dotting tool, did have to glue the tops on a few, but they still arrived in a timely manner.  </li>
            <li> Only downside to these is impatiently waiting the two weeks for them to get here, but for the price I paid, I&#x27;m not complaining :)</li>
            <li> I just use them for fun, and only occasionally, so I don&#x27;t know how durable they are.</li>
            <li> One was broken, but overall it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> The glue that holds the brush to the stick was loose on 2 of the brushes, other than that I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> for acrylic, soap and water washes wet paint right off.</li>
            <li> I spent a small price for these quality brushes and I love them!</li>
            <li> I think next time I&#x27;ll just sucker it up and pay more for a decent set of brushes.</li>
            <li> They are a bit difficult to clean if you use regular nail polish, but if you insist with nail polish remover they will be ok.</li>
            <li> they are small and easy to use, i share some of them with my mom and even though we dont have lots of experiences with brushes we can still used them.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used them all, but they are all cool none the less.</li>
            <li> I bought these mainly for the thin tipped brushes, but after using them about 5 times, they no longer produced the perfect thin lines that they did when i got them.</li>
            <li> I loved the nail dotting tool and the thin flat brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously allover the whole concept of cheap nail stuff from China.</li>
            <li> To clean nail polish off the bristles use acetone, but be careful because the white paint might come off.</li>
            <li> The only serious problem I have had was my own fault.</li>
            <li> Doing my nails, painting small buttons and bow decorations, mod podging tiny gems onto a 100 day bow, these tiny brushes have been so very useful!.</li>
            <li> useful for other art work.  </li>
            <li> Even though some of the brushes, like the smaller striping brushes came with some of the bristles sticking out, I fixed this by sticking them in hot soapy water then squeezing them back to there</li>
            <li> I even use a few of them as clean up brushes for around my cuticles.</li>
            <li> The brushes are pretty standard and basic.  </li>
            <li> I was not being particularly rough with them or doing anything out of the ordinary, they had been passed between me and someone else, and were kind of rolled on a bed, but no mistreatment and the bristles just fell out.</li>
            <li> The main reason I ordered this set was for the white fan brush to do art work on my nails.  </li>
            <li> The long thin brush is good for lines and stripes.  </li>
            <li> I only wish i wouldn&#x27;t have brought them to work as the other ladies didn&#x27;t clean them</li>
            <li> I love the variety too, and they are the same price as you&#x27;d normally get only a few brushes!  </li>
            <li> These brushes are high quality for a low price.</li>
            <li> I have used 5 different brushes so far and live them.</li>
            <li> they are easy to use,and now I can make different designs on my nails everyday.</li>
            <li> Cheap small brushes.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we expected.</li>
            <li> I love this they last haven&#x27;t broken and there is so much variety of sizes</li>
            <li> These brushes are exactly what I expected them to be.</li>
            <li> It took over a month to get them, and when I did the orange brush tip was messed up and wouldn&#x27;t go back to normal.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Holy crap, by far the best deal for tiny brushes ever...</li>
            <li> Nothing a little super glue won&#x27;t fix, though.</li>
            <li> Nothing a little bit of super glue cant fix.</li>
            <li> But nothing that a little super glue doesn&#x27;t fix it.</li>
            <li> I used my hot glue gun and attached the wooden stick and metal back together; very small, easy to solve problem</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t completely horrible, but they certainly weren&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li> Bought these for face painting purposes and the little ones work fantastic for smaller details!</li>
            <li> These are decent, especially for the price, but I was hoping at least one of them would do really fine lines well, and none of them do.  </li>
            <li> It is VERY useful for those small touchups.</li>
            <li> The level and quality of detail possible with this varied array of brushes has brought my work to a new level.  </li>
            <li> Was shipped very fast then what was expected thank you!</li>
            <li> And at such a low price thanks.</li>
            <li> I took a little while to ship, because it came from china, but I got exactly what the picture and description said I would get!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m kind of frustrated with it right now</li>
            <li> They are not long term high quality, but they will definitely do the job and for the price I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Very cheap material, some came already broken in the package.</li>
            <li> i use these brushes on my nails close to every other day, simply because they are so much fun to use.</li>
            <li> My angled brush that I usually use for clean up now has the problem where the bristles push back inside the metal, luckily they are just long enough that I can pull them back out again, but it&#x27;s quite frustrating.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the other brushes seem to be fine, although I am treating them carefully!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t find a decent set of brushes for such a low price.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully I only paid $1.97 for my item and I purchased other items as a Christmas gift for this family member, so no major loss although I was excited for it.</li>
            <li> The material is cheap and the brushes&#x27; hairs are hard.</li>
            <li> All but  the fan brushes come with clear rubber open ended sleeves covering the bristles.</li>
            <li> I guess I should not have expected much for $7,</li>
            <li> plus they arrived so much faster then expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Too early to tell how they&#x27;ll last...</li>
            <li> Unsure of what it was, I opened it outside my home, nearly threw it out.  </li>
            <li> Arrived much sooner than expected</li>
            <li> I must warn you, the fan brushes are not wide.</li>
            <li> So far I have only used two of my brushes.</li>
            <li> If you get acetone near the actually stick part(white part), the paint starts coming off and the paint will get everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Second off, my stick part(white part)</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for ... Barely...</li>
            <li> If you get them, be extremely careful and gentle when cleaning.</li>
            <li> The bristles are too soft to even get a proper design on the nail, and once I pulled out the bristles from one brush just from cleaning it.</li>
            <li> The white paint completely falls apart.</li>
            <li> Actually it came directly from China so it might be explained.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter loves these brushed.</li>
            <li> If you get them, be extremely careful and gentle when cleaning.</li>
            <li> These work so well, came in so much faster than expected even though it came from Hong Kong.</li>
            <li> She has used it multiple times so far</li>
            <li> and i will definately be ordering from you again in the near future.</li>
            <li> They are to be a gift along with nail polish for a young teenage friend.  </li>
            <li> Beats the $15 brushes I was having to shell out for and really take careful care of.</li>
            <li> So far I only had one instance where the tips of the brush were coming out</li>
            <li> Brushes were purchased for 10 year old starting nail design.</li>
            <li> , I totally forgot about them and was surprised when the came.</li>
            <li> it also dries fast on the brushes and makes a rough look on your nail.</li>
            <li> However, you get what you pay for apparently.</li>
            <li> , the white paint comes off it seems if acetone gas even gets near it</li>
            <li> The brushes came 5 days before the expected delivery and were exactly the same as the ones shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> They are as long as normal paint brushes.</li>
            <li> r soft and bend able each brush was individually package and nothing was broken the pouch that came with</li>
            <li> most of them wwere broken</li>
            <li> I love the thin brush</li>
            <li> but I crazy glue them back &amp; so far so good been using these for a year now.</li>
            <li> I was worried that for the price I paid, I would receive flimsy broken brushes... however these are fantastic!</li>
            <li> These are nice brushes for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> If you  are using acrylic it would be kind of difficult to figure out which brush is used for what.</li>
            <li> im kind of obsessed with nails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not great at nail art but love to try.</li>
            <li> the tops to all the burshes ( you know, the brush part of it) fell off right out of the little bag they came in with.</li>
            <li> and they were NOT too Hard nor super soft</li>
            <li> BUT on first use and even upon delivery, some of the barrels had already broken off the handles and had to be super glued back on.</li>
            <li> Expect a long wait if you live in USA.</li>
            <li> A few of the brushes were bent right out of the package</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to try snipping uneven edges to make them right</li>
            <li> When I first got the brushes, I was amazed at the quality considering I paid less than 3 dollars.</li>
            <li> when doing this I immediately noticed there were no loose bristles,none on my fingertips or sink.</li>
            <li> Also,the brushes are really hard to get perfectly clean.</li>
            <li> I used my acetone nail polish remover to get it clean but all it did was get hard.</li>
            <li> A bit hard to clean, but what brushes aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> There kinda hard to clean too.</li>
            <li> but they are hard to clean they work</li>
            <li> They work very well with no loss of bristles like other brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> They start to somewhat fall apart and the bristles are hard to clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, It&#x27;s slightly hard to clean these brushes.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I really don&#x27;t need 15 brushes.</li>
            <li> They are a little cheap, which was expected, but none of the hairs fall out.</li>
            <li> It is hard to clean too.</li>
            <li> They are so much longer than I expected them to be!</li>
            <li> I was excited about these, but when they arrived I discovered that the bristles of all the brushes are wonky</li>
            <li> First of all,the bristles are soft yet firm enough for any nail art task.</li>
            <li> When they came in the mail, several of the brushes still attached to the metal ends came off the white stick portion of the tool, but a little super glue</li>
            <li> paint soaks right off, and it MAKES A MESS!</li>
            <li> Kinda confusing as to how to use them, but it&#x27;s fun.&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to clean the nail polish out of the brushes.</li>
            <li> I wish the thin ones were even thinner to allow for more smaller detailed designs, but that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> but there are still some useful brushes so this isn&#x27;t a total waste..</li>
            <li> I like the brushes, I just don&#x27;t like the fact that the main brushes I use are partially put together.</li>
            <li> The some of the brushes could be a little more stiff.</li>
            <li> (It took a little long coming from China, but I didn&#x27;t expect as quick as coming from U.S.).</li>
            <li> I soak them in hot water and soap after using them, NOT acetone nailpolish remover because it ruins the brissles of the brush!</li>
            <li> Fingernails are already a small area and having these longer brushes helps make the process of applying nail art smoother without so many tiny utensils in your other hand.</li>
            <li> Although, they do feel a little flimsy when you first touch them</li>
            <li> The nail tools that I have bought are not  good because, the first time you use them the brushes get all crunchy, the tools do not clean, and they are cheap materials.   </li>
            <li> and they are great if you want to paint really thin and small lines!</li>
            <li> I was a bit leary of this set, given the inexpensive price tag,but figured I really couldn&#x27;t go wrong with 15 different brushes for $2.00 and free</li>
            <li> I will admit, I was very skeptical about buying them at first because of their cheap price, and the pictures made them look soo small and fragile, but, since they were so cheap, and I needed a set of brushes to do my nails for prom this year</li>
            <li> but I did notice that the seller shipped from Hong Kong and was worried it would take far too long for it to reach me, or even get lost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the dotter a few times after the first use it already fell apart.  </li>
            <li> Had to taper a few to make them exactly how I wanted</li>
            <li> It did come from China, so be aware that it will take a few weeks to get to you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot of brushes for a low price but the caps of the brushed easily fall off and they are not good quality.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd review for one order that these brushes were included in and the same as the previous one for the first set of brushes.  </li>
            <li> (Omg no way I never would have guessed *sarcasm*), so now I use them for painting designs little wooden boxes with acrylic paints.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles are a bit stiff at first</li>
            <li> I ordered an extra set for my younger cousin who is barely getting into nail art.</li>
            <li> I did  have 2 brushes that had some minor imperfections (the fan brushes only) but they were easily fixed by trimming the stray bristles.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of nail art, both gel polish and regular, and they&#x27;ve held up to a decent amount of cleaning in acetone and other sterilizing chemicals.</li>
            <li> The most disappointing thing about these brushes is that after you use them and clean them with remover they give stiff.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t use them very harshly at all and the heads just fall right off.</li>
            <li> The brushes did shed a little and I was worried at first that I wasted my money, but they actually worked really well.</li>
            <li> in a clear, plastic case instead of just loose like i was expecting.</li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t like was that I found more than half the brushes too thick to even work with.</li>
            <li> Not great quality..still pretty decent and a steal for the price</li>
            <li> they were a little hard at first but after cleaning them they are softer and much easier to design with.great price as well!</li>
            <li> Brush quality itself is OK, but a little delicate.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy other new items too.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter has become a professional nail artist ever since she starting using these little nail brushes.</li>
            <li> The only down fall is they are kinda hard to clean out!</li>
            <li> Shipping is slow but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Only one down fall is that the brush tip came off on a couple, nothing as little super glue didn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> The brushes are long, lightweight and way more professional than the measly two brushes I can buy from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Store.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it a long time, so I can&#x27;t yet attest to the long term quality of the brushes, but I&#x27;m an artist who paints very small details and these fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that they ARE made of wood, and they are painted white so if youre going to use any nail polish remover to clean them off, you have to be careful or you will end up with a stripped brush and paint all over your hands.</li>
            <li> It’s not fun when you are trying something new.</li>
            <li> after one use i tried cleaning them with nail polish remover and it made the brush to stiff and really couldn&#x27;t use it any.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;if you only need one set, you can send the other set to your friend who need it,&amp;#34;  clearly they are not in the US and don&#x27;t care.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not high quality but worth a few uses!</li>
            <li> These are decent little nail art brushes.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;) have nothing bad to say they are decent quality used them already havn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;had</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare to other art brushes -- but as far as this set goes, I would recommend them in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> My 16yr old daughter changes her nail polish every other day...</li>
            <li> The bristles themselves arrive very stiff but, run them under hot water for a bit</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really reuse, due to the fact that it&#x27;s difficult to clean them.</li>
            <li> and I just really started getting into nail art, and I usually use brushed from walmart</li>
            <li> They are long lasting and can be cleaned off with regular nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> The only con that I found was that they are a bit long for my hands, but that&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> the brush fell off the handle of a few of them, nothing a little super clue couldn&#x27;t do, but still.</li>
            <li> I was dipping the brush in was eating away at the bristles because the brush seemed to be getting shorter, but I discovered that the bristles were actually being pushed up into the metal part and any attempt at pulling them down again just completely destroyed the brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I dipped a brush too far into my cleaner the first time and managed to destroy the glue and essentially melt the paint off of the handle even though the remover had been in contact with the brush for no more than a couple of seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I dipped a brush too far into my cleaner the first time and managed to destroy the glue and essentially melt the paint off of the handle  even though the remover had been in contact with the brush for no more than a couple of seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the metal and wood came apart.. but easy fixed with crazy glue.</li>
            <li> one small drop of glue to hold these together makes so much sense.</li>
            <li> They really are just mini make up brushes or paint brushes that at this rate, I would just use as eye brushes or small designs.</li>
            <li> The brushes were so helpful the only thing that I didn&#x27;t like was it took so long to get them.</li>
            <li> no matter how long they&#x27;ll last.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last that long</li>
            <li> The only thing is they take a long time to arrive</li>
            <li> but no need because it is lasting me a long time</li>
            <li> I would recommend for someone that was not a professional and just practicing, and not tidying on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> The basics it has a fan brush, a dotting brush, as well as the flat brushes.</li>
            <li> The only thing i suggest you beware of, is how long it takes to get here, but after all it was shipped from hong cong, all the way to FL.</li>
            <li> and they are still like new with a little TLC.</li>
            <li> Some of the hairs on the brushes were a bit split when I received them, but can easily be fixed by trimming them down with scissors.</li>
            <li> The bristels appear to be high quality and should last about as long as any small headed brush would last.</li>
            <li> If you are using it for nail polish, keep in mind that it is hard to clean the brushed with water and soap, so I use a little bit of rubbing alcohol and</li>
            <li> Low in cost, unbelievable...  and high in quality.  </li>
            <li> Other than that one defect, no other complaints...</li>
            <li> She has only used them a few times but so far they have held up well.</li>
            <li> *instantly* removes every trace of the white paint of the handles, but the wood underneath isn&#x27;t too rough and doesn&#x27;t splinter</li>
            <li> They are a little hard to clean, but I would order them again if needed.</li>
            <li> I have found only one brush tip to be loose</li>
            <li> some of them were loose from the wooden handle, and I had to put a drop of superglue in them to make them usable.</li>
            <li> I actually barely use these, but only because I&#x27;m not artistic.</li>
            <li> :) Only one brush had a few funky hairs out of place (a very common prob - a little snip with my sharp cuticle nippers - and fixed!)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use all of them and customized some of the small brushes by cutting them down even more, but they&#x27;re quite useful in doing intricate designs on my nails.</li>
            <li> I bought these and a few other items as gifts for my manicurist, who does not have much time for ordering things like this.</li>
            <li> other than that brushes sturdy no loose hairs when using them.  </li>
            <li> A little bit of krazy flue fixed the problem.</li>
            <li> They look just like the image displays, shed way too much and stick together when being used, hard to remove paint from the even after a solution is applied.</li>
            <li> The package was missing a brush, other than that the brushes were packaged properly and were all new like listed</li>
            <li> This is not even a complaint really.</li>
            <li> More just a stupidity on my part.</li>
            <li> Got it earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected and cant wait to start using them.</li>
            <li> so i dont know how well or long</li>
            <li> Shipping was as to be expected coming from China but ordered 3pc set at the same time and they shipped a day apart which came out to be a 2 week difference making it to me</li>
            <li> All of the brushes are way smaller than I expected, but then again they are nail art brushes.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected, haven&#x27;t used them yet</li>
            <li> Strange that they would paint the handles of these brushes with paint that dissolves and gets gummy when it touches acetone.</li>
            <li> They arrived eariler than I expected and I used them 3 days later!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this July 30, and received this item on August 11, which is earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> but this is far from a waste.</li>
            <li> only received 1 fan brush, which isn&#x27;t as wide as pictured, &amp; a dot pen...?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although i did have one minor problem which is when i took of the cap that protects the bristles.</li>
            <li> these are not professional brushes.</li>
            <li> This took a long time receive.</li>
            <li> (and the ridiculously long wait...)</li>
            <li> My brushes just arrived, earlier than expected so that was a plus</li>
            <li> They are not necessarily professional quality</li>
            <li> Took too long to ship.</li>
            <li> Took a really long time to get to me.</li>
            <li> I did have a couple bristle fall out, but that is to be expected since they did only cost $2.50.  </li>
            <li> and it came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I like the brush styles because I have been searching for a long time to find these type of nail brushes.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to get in the mail</li>
            <li> Bigger than expected, closer to paintbrush length.</li>
            <li> It has two long stripping brushes..which I haven&#x27;t seen in the brush sets at the beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> They arrived much earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I have onto used a few of the brushes so far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not surprised.</li>
            <li> It came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> The brushes were also much smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Some are also really long, so I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do with those either.</li>
            <li> You are probably ordering this for a kid, they cant wait that long.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the big ones however being my nails arent that wide.</li>
            <li> It just took a a long long time to get here.</li>
            <li> be careful when dipping them on acetone they will damage the paint that was use to make them white.</li>
            <li> long.</li>
            <li> Been wanting some brushes for soo long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no professional</li>
            <li> shipping didnt take too long either.</li>
            <li> I like the long handles, makes it easier for nail art.</li>
            <li> Be prepared to wait a long time for your order though.</li>
            <li> But they did and even earlier than i expected..</li>
            <li> how long I been waiting and looking for these</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional or anything</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took so long to get here</li>
            <li> This is a minor problem given what you get for the money.</li>
            <li> if you handle these brushes the way brushes is supposed to be handled you will get a long life out of them.</li>
            <li> These came about a month earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> poor quality brushes that just arent worth it.</li>
            <li> I mean, REALLY?  </li>
            <li> I wish they had a non-flimsy smaller brush, their are not a lot of brushes that you can make really small strokes with, so if you want small lines that are cool and crisp (weird choice of words) than choose different brushes.</li>
            <li> I am not a happy camper right now.</li>
            <li> I needed to pinch the metal ends a little tighter onto the handles when they arrived and trimmed a stray hair from just one brush, but I&#x27;ve heavily used these, cleaned them each time with running alcohol or pure acetone, dabbed and even tugged at the bristles when cleaning, and have had no problems at all.</li>
            <li> The long brushes in particular lack control and is hard to work with.</li>
            <li> Only minor problem is the heads are not always well attached to the shaft and just dip it in a little paint and stick it back on ends this immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has done it again.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that some of the brushes are very similar to each other, and don&#x27;t make a difference on your nails.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t take as long as I thought it was!</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal since there&#x27;s like 4 other brushes that size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these with actual oil and watercolor paints, simply because i cannot find affordable and small enough ones in craft stores.</li>
            <li> Such a wide variety of brushes!</li>
            <li> be carefull when cleaning them though because the white part of the brush comes off with only a little bit of polish remover.</li>
            <li> it came way earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> Shipping was quite fast, the quality of the brushes are above average but not &#x27;amazing&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Again, for $2.70 you can&#x27;t go wrong! :)</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected too!</li>
            <li> I marked it down a star because a few of the brushes in the middle were bent.</li>
            <li> It did take a very long time to get because they were shipped from China.</li>
            <li> Just had to wait a very long time to get it.</li>
            <li> This product had a very long shipping time.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t let the paint dry on them ...</li>
            <li> but don&#x27;t let the paint dry out on the brushes before cleaning&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you fail to clean one, you&#x27;re going to ruin it-</li>
            <li> I painted stripes on only one hand and it already dried the brush solid.</li>
            <li> Seriously, one tiny drop of acetone got on the white part while I was cleaning them and suddenly my hands were covered in gooey white paint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used a few of the brushes, but they are definitely nifty items for polish lovers.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately with my busy schedule these days I haven&#x27;t had much time to play around with these.  </li>
            <li> I only use a few of them, so not a big problem.</li>
            <li> A few of them have had the brush and reinforcement slip off leaving me only with a wooden stick.  </li>
            <li> Its workable brushes some one of them is to thick for lines but they are all decent brushes I like them</li>
            <li> There are so many brushes from thick bristles and extremely thin bristles this allows me to work on any design from my catalogue.</li>
            <li> The only down side is it takes so long to get to you</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used every single brush yet.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to worry about them messing up your really expensive, special brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d much rather snip away at a paint brush that cost a mere 20 cents each than cut away at a more expensive brush any day.  </li>
            <li> The white paint comes off and ruins everything.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see that there was also a small dot tool included in the set.  </li>
            <li> these brushed frayed after one use not worth</li>
            <li> you can’t do what you originally want to do it will be all sloppy and not clean designs.</li>
            <li> Poor quality some brushes fell apart after the first use.</li>
            <li> The first set of brushes were bent or broken.</li>
            <li> For the money not a bad set of brushes, unfortunately I had to still buy stripping brushes from another nail supply store.</li>
            <li> I had no problems with bristles falling out or metal clasps loose</li>
            <li> and i had to trim off loose strands but all in all I still use them often.</li>
            <li> Has all the required pieces, although the ends are a bit loose and tend to fall off.  </li>
            <li> the metal that is supposed to hold the brushes together is loose.</li>
            <li> just pour a little acetone into the bottle top and dip the brush into that acetone and it will clear off the nail polish without having to touch the wooden base.</li>
            <li> When putting the brushes down to do something and you come back</li>
            <li> Also if you use acetone or get it near, it takes off the paint and gets very messy.</li>
            <li> i&amp;#34;ve had mine for over 2 months now, and i have yet to loose a single fiber!</li>
            <li> We split the pack into three stockings easily with plenty of brushes for each girl to go crazy with.</li>
            <li> I receive the package about a week and a half earlier than I was told.  </li>
            <li> Only one brush was slightly bent but still usable.</li>
            <li> I only use about half of the items in the set, but thats probably because I&#x27;m a noob with nail design.</li>
            <li> Purchased them to paint small wooden dolls am actually using on canvas now.</li>
            <li> ;, and  is slightly  fluffier then the yellow one.</li>
            <li> I super recommend this item if your obsessed on doing nail art.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically these things are complete crap and fall apart very quickly.</li>
            <li> But I at least expected them to last long enough to use just once!</li>
            <li> they do however take a bit long to arrive but that was expected other than that they do what their supposed to.</li>
            <li> The price is good and I like the brushes but very disappointed that I only got one set and paid for 2 sets!</li>
            <li> When the brushes wear out (usually after a few sessions of use) just dispose of them and move on to a new brush!</li>
            <li> A little staining but no running of different colors.</li>
            <li> a little bit of them look kinda frayed but totally fixable.</li>
            <li> but they seem a little fragile.</li>
            <li> The plastic covers seem a little low quality</li>
            <li> I only wish the fibers were a little bit stiffer because I used them dipped in polish remover to remove excess polish.</li>
            <li> Just one of item was banded a little bit.</li>
            <li> last a little longer.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to clean !</li>
            <li> Only a few were useful, making this a waste of your money!!!!</li>
            <li> Shipping was a quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> Be careful cleaning them, one of the tips fell off because I pulled it.</li>
            <li> Only a few did it however</li>
            <li> But it takes nothing, just to be wet, like when you&#x27;re rinsing them off, the paint comes off - on your hands, in the sink, off of the wood.  </li>
            <li> You do have to be careful around the acetone, however, as the paint will wash off.</li>
            <li> , I figured I&#x27;m not really losing anything if they suck.</li>
            <li> The fan brush did not work a s I expected.</li>
            <li> These came WAYYYY before the expected date also</li>
            <li> and is as expected without flaws.</li>
            <li> At neck of the brush you should be careful to not bend it.</li>
            <li> Received this product sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> These arrived quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> The only thing that has happened was that some of the tips were not securely fastened.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I expected.</li>
            <li> The brushes were rough though</li>
            <li> wide selection of brushes</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was a bit rough on them....</li>
            <li> Delivery and condition of product as expected.</li>
            <li> Not really what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> get bristles wet they stick out and dont stay together.</li>
            <li> This is not what i expected it did not work the way i wanted it to</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> The only thing is on the fan brushes there was a few longer hairs</li>
            <li> My money was well spent.</li>
            <li> but they got here sooner than expected</li>
            <li> Bought these for birthday gifts, they thought I spent a fortune</li>
            <li> I only paid a few dollars for these, with the intention of using them for nail art.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> but I should have expected that for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought these a few months ago because I wanted all the nail art tools that the pros have in the cheapest way possible.</li>
            <li> A few of the same brushes.</li>
            <li> Shipping was a lot faster than expected, so that is also a plus.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected.</li>
            <li> A few of the brushes when I was starting to use them all the bristles fell out.</li>
            <li> No real complaints for the price paid.  </li>
            <li> expected...</li>
            <li> Low Quality Deplete itself within a few days of use</li>
            <li> it came faster than i expected.</li>
            <li> Product came within expected delivery period.</li>
            <li> The only thing that i disliked was thet in my package one of the fan brushes bristles were coming out, and the dotting tool&#x27;s head came out.</li>
            <li> and it was what i expected</li>
            <li> Received it as expected.</li>
            <li> The order was recived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> They all average about 7-7 1/2&amp;#34; long from end of brush to end of handles.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> These definatly do not hold the pain like they were expected to.</li>
            <li> Also, please be careful with getting nail polish remover on the handles.</li>
            <li> just what i expected now</li>
            <li> A few of them broke but overall ive gotten a lot of use out of them</li>
            <li> The fan brush wasnt as sturdy as I expected</li>
            <li> it took a while to arrive but that is not unusual from items shipped from overseas.</li>
            <li> Got here before expected date.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s expected.  </li>
            <li> Item as expected.  </li>
            <li> Lots of brushes with a wide variety of applications.</li>
            <li> I spent on them though.</li>
            <li> I did not really want lots of nail polish brushes</li>
            <li> I like that there are a few types of brushes with different sizes of each.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- arrived a few days earlier than expected date</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I only spent a few bucks.</li>
            <li> I find they are a little difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> i like the fact thet they are plain white</li>
            <li> I only wish the brushes stayed stiff, helps for an unsteady hand.</li>
            <li> I wpuld recommend it to anyone who wants to get serious with their nails!</li>
            <li> The brushes stand up well to washing with soap and cold water and dry fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> but No these are not long term brushes Or Makeup brushes (too small)</li>
            <li> Not very useful.</li>
            <li> Well after the brushes get used once then you try to clean them off then but the polish does not come off, how disappointing.</li>
            <li> but I am not sure what to do with such a wide variety.</li>
            <li> If you are a serious professional for nails, do not buy these, invest your money into quality brushes.</li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t complain too much though because they were very inexpesnive.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> took a little long to get here though.</li>
            <li> Took a little long to get the it</li>
            <li> Shipping took a little long but nothing to complain about</li>
            <li> I like this set &amp; look forward to learning ways to use other brushes in he set.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> These came in a lot faster than expected!</li>
            <li> but I just received them the other day .</li>
            <li> Also, one of the brushes have a dent in the silver aluminum part and 2 of the small brushed didn&#x27;t come with a protected cover on them like the others did.</li>
            <li> The possibilities are endless with these.</li>
            <li> These brushes are extremely affordable tho</li>
            <li> Three of the other brushes came apart at the silver connecting piece</li>
            <li> I use them for nails and all other small detail painting jobs which I daily do.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it was due to the nail polish remover ...</li>
            <li> All the ends of the brushes were capped except the fan brushes and 1 other brush..</li>
            <li> The bristles are sturdy and don&#x27;t shed like the brushes I&#x27;ve purchased from other stores.</li>
            <li> I bought these for purposes other than decorating fingernails, so I don&#x27;t know how they would work for nail art.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that I&#x27;m not sure what I would need all of the brushes for.</li>
            <li> I assume if I let it sit in acetone it may ruin the brushes as other reviewers have said.</li>
            <li> On some of the other brushes the hairs (or bristles) were falling off or sticking out</li>
            <li> And some of the other brushes had nail polish on them.</li>
            <li> but other</li>
            <li> The metal part that was holding the bristles seeming to be lopsided compared to all the other brushes</li>
            <li> i made christmas trees and tons of other designs already.</li>
            <li> But other than those issues the brushes have done the job for what I purchased them to do.</li>
            <li> Other than that they look like they will do what I need them to do.</li>
            <li> I only bought this kit to fill up my makeup kit for small brushes.</li>
            <li> so  haven&#x27;t experiences the paint coming off like some of the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> I spent what seemed forever for these to be delivered, but when they came, what a bargain!  </li>
            <li> and I use it when I paint wine glasses and other glass objects.</li>
            <li> I received my brush set the other day and upon inspecting the brushes one by one I came across four of them which the brushes fell off the handles.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any shedding either, like other brushes I&#x27;ve bought at Walmart.</li>
            <li> As you can see in the picture, some are very wide, I don&#x27;t know what I will ever do with them.</li>
            <li> I was initially worried that the quality of the product would be poor due to the low price</li>
            <li> though none broken they are new, as advertised</li>
            <li> I mean seriously I know that they didn&#x27;t cost me that much, but can I get what I paid for!</li>
            <li> I had one that was a little loose</li>
            <li> I understand they were only a few dollars, but honestly don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Acetone will dissolve the glue holding the strands to the brush and destroy it, while also making it dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> Certainly not me!</li>
            <li> All of them were thrown out first use because the brush fell apart, paint on the handle peeled, very poor quality...</li>
            <li> these are really good quality brushes and for the price you cant go wrong!!!</li>
            <li> A few of the brushes have loose metal clasps-</li>
            <li> Not fantastic, not high quality but</li>
            <li> a little flimsy but what I expected for the price</li>
            <li> Took a little while to arrive but that was expected.  </li>
            <li> The medium size bristles worked well for some designs, but the very thin ones was hard to work with since I couldn&#x27;t make clean strokes with my nail polish to make intricate designs.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the metal has slid off the handle on almost all of them.</li>
            <li> but this is not worth it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I received 12 brushes, not 15.</li>
            <li> I received the order 3 days later, so it wasn&#x27;t lost just late.</li>
            <li> Not worth it</li>
            <li> This product took weeks to come, and was definitely not worth the wait.</li>
            <li> This was not worth all the wait.</li>
            <li> but not worth the effort.</li>
            <li> but, when the brushes get all crunchy it’s not fun.  </li>
            <li> Not worth buying.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the coating on the handles comes off after some useage.</li>
            <li> only complaint: they don&#x27;t handle being in acetone well.</li>
            <li> negative is the white paint comes off when cleaning in nail polish remover and the tips came off of some</li>
            <li> the only problem that I have with them is that they took at least two months to get here</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unable to make details because it&#x27;s very flimsy.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the plastic end caps that were put on them were bent thus causing the bristles of the liner brushes to be bent.</li>
            <li> but it was still not worth it.</li>
            <li> Heck a lot cheaper and better quality than the crap at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I Like the brushes and they are a good value but the customer service was HORRIBLE.  </li>
            <li> cant put my brushes down</li>
            <li> I had to cut the wood part down.</li>
            <li> and they were what I expected except I was shorted 2 brushes!!</li>
            <li> The possibilities are endless!</li>
            <li> I change my nails every other day if not every day!</li>
            <li> Today I received the June 25 article which buy previously.</li>
            <li> Received my brushes in less time than I had anticipated they would come.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to last forever, but at least for a few uses.</li>
            <li> I have bought about half a dozen sets of these brushes for artist friends.  </li>
            <li> when i got them they all where bent out of shape and some broke in half.</li>
            <li> The slightly stiffer bristles means that I can control the polish.</li>
            <li> For less than $3, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Coming from Asia, they took about a week and a half to arrive.</li>
            <li> The case they came in was folded oddly and stuck in that position</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t chose a half star</li>
            <li> However I had the brushes less than I week and one of the fan brushes lost all of its bristles.</li>
            <li> it makes all the difference plus you use less polish.</li>
            <li> well what can you say about something that cost less than a dollar?</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s still slightly disatisfying.</li>
            <li> Half of the brushes, I kid you not, we&#x27;re literally just the sticks and no brush.</li>
            <li> so thats about half way around the globe.</li>
            <li> but something did strike me as odd...</li>
            <li> The only thing I have against these is that some of the brushes are really stiff so its hard to create nail art with some of the brushes.</li>
            <li> The brush pieces are coming off so when I&#x27;m doing nail art, it ruins it because the little strings of the brush are all over the place.</li>
            <li> Way to long and hard to use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your two bucks with this bundle - not worth it.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that gift wrapping wasn&#x27;t available.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re a beginner with a tight budget</li>
            <li> If I use it again, which I had planned on doing a lot, I&#x27;ll have to super glue it bad and hope it</li>
            <li> A few brushes were slightly bent in the shipping I assume, but they did come all the way from China.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a single issue with any of these brushes and am known for being a little hard on my tools.</li>
            <li> so she can detail anything on her little fingernails.</li>
            <li> it past the due date that I expect it to come, they say they will send to again</li>
            <li> but nothing a little glue wont fix.</li>
            <li> A little glue could even reinforce it.</li>
            <li> I usually use some of them once every other week.  </li>
            <li> One of them was a little bent when I received it, but it was nothing that was too problematic.</li>
            <li> Not all of them had the little plastic caps, but that&#x27;s no biggie.</li>
            <li> rate is little high.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little glue fixes it up, but watch what glues you use</li>
            <li> GAVE THEM AWAY TO MY LITTLE SISTER TO PAINT WITH</li>
            <li> And I was just helplessly trying to copy stuff off pinterest a little bit ago.</li>
            <li> Comes in a little plastic holder.</li>
            <li> When it came, though, the brushes were all scrunched up, and a lot of the little plastic caps were coming off.</li>
            <li> I use these little brushes for painting details on miniatures.  </li>
            <li> My little daughter</li>
            <li> I waited for them to get here a little longer</li>
            <li> The nail brushes are a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> I use them for face painting and detailing my little cars as well&lt;br /&gt;Many</li>
            <li> It took a little longer for delivery....but for the amount of money your paying for the product.</li>
            <li> I had to end up soaking some of them in water for a little bit to help fix that.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s little variety.</li>
            <li> neither so give a little time to use.</li>
            <li> Each brush head is protected by little plastic tubes.</li>
            <li> Half of them can even be used as makeup brushes, such as eyeliner, because they&#x27;re so thin.</li>
            <li> Half of them were already broken, the rest broke in the middle of use.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s very hard to do you would need to soak the entire brush in acetone</li>
            <li> Very disapointed not sure what I saw when I ordered but did not mee my expectation very poor quality merchandise</li>
            <li> 3 of them were bent when I recieved them and you could see the little ding in one of them where it looked as though something heavy was laying on it.</li>
            <li> so I just stuck it in a heavy book for a little while</li>
            <li> The hairs splay out a lot, even with minimal pressure, and are straggly on the ends on some of the brushes, so it makes it hard to get neat lines.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t go for all the brushes, however, just a few of them.</li>
            <li> Waste of money if you ask me.</li>
            <li> I do quite a few nail designs with all sizes of brushes.  </li>
            <li> when they finally arrived one of the tools was broken.</li>
            <li> (I bought it to paint cookie and stuff and to act as food-safe brushes since they are made of synthethic hair, and a few brushes for my polymer clay creations).</li>
            <li> I have used these a few times since I purchased them.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who needs a few brushes for on the go, beauty school, or just for practicing.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what to do with a few of the brushes yet</li>
            <li> My dotting tool bent and then snapped within a few days.</li>
            <li> A few of the brush tips were off of the sticks.</li>
            <li> but what can u ask for for a few bucks.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to waste money for brushes that would fall apart,</li>
            <li> br /&gt;-Nothing was missing, looked neat</li>
            <li> They are inexpensive and they are not cheaply made.</li>
            <li> They fall apart after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Giving a few for gifts also.  </li>
            <li> I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money</li>
            <li> /&gt;luckily, the ones that came broken were the ones that i wasn&#x27;t going to use anyway, but either though, they should definitely take care of their products way better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I saw that in the picture there were 2 fan brushes, the brush that&#x27;s missing in my set</li>
            <li> My only problem is that two of them arrived broken.</li>
            <li> But I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money again on this.</li>
            <li> Definately worth the money, especially when these brushes are crazy expensive in some stores.</li>
            <li> you have to remove them from the plastic and let them air out for a few days to get rid of the smell.</li>
            <li> I PAIRED THIS WITH A FEW NAIL POLISHES AND GAVE IT TO A FRIEND.  </li>
            <li> My highschool daughter as recently become addicted to painting fingernails and designing them.  </li>
            <li> For me, this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an everyday make-up lady.</li>
            <li> if it is missing they replace it.</li>
            <li> Even after using a few and cleaning them they seem to be holding up well, it was just the brown fan brush that seemed messed up.</li>
            <li> a few sets&lt;br /&gt;some</li>
            <li> Not fantastic, but i got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> And others are bent &amp; the hairs are uneven</li>
            <li> Some of the hairs came out after a few times.</li>
            <li> They dried without losing their shape at all.</li>
            <li> I gave this 4 out of 5 stars as a few of the bristles have fallen out of the fan brush.</li>
            <li> , One of the brushes were bent before I opened the package, some of the protector tops were missing off the brush tips.</li>
            <li> Waste of my four dollars.</li>
            <li> She uses them everyday to do her nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having trouble with cleaning them though.</li>
            <li> I use these everyday on me my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Products came within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> 3 of the sets of brushes were missing.</li>
            <li> Got the 3 that were missing yesterday</li>
            <li> It looks as though they would actually do what nail shop brushes do, but they are in fact really thin and don&#x27;t do what they are supposed to.</li>
            <li> The second set had one or two brushes that were bent or broken off.</li>
            <li> They were in a plastic baggie like container and a simple envelope, which may have contributed to their poor condition.</li>
            <li> When I got the brushes I started making Cup cakes and fluffy bunny&#x27;s on my nails.</li>
            <li> Works well, although a few of the brushes were unnecessary (the really big ones, how am I supposed to paint my nails with something twice the size?).</li>
            <li> Love nail art but hate struggling with the toothpicks that I usually use to draw with!</li>
            <li> I used them for nail art in black polish and it stained them pretty bad</li>
            <li> and they cost a lot less!</li>
            <li> Really stiff.</li>
            <li> They are stiff and have bushy edges, The metal around the hair bends and the pain on the wood comes off as I use acetone, or nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> when used the brushes were stiff and pieces of brush&lt;br /&gt;Started to fall off.</li>
            <li> However, they are a bit stiff and take a while to get used to.</li>
            <li> the bristles seem too stiff to me.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves that I can do patterns n designs on our nails instead of having plain polish.</li>
            <li> The creative possibilities are ENDLESS!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I would suggest a little trimming before use so you wont have small lines where you dont want them.</li>
            <li> it does smell a little, but i usually wash everything i receive.</li>
            <li> and it has the PERECT small brushes just for those little details i put in..</li>
            <li> (maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have been since I paid very little for them), but the paint was uneven on some of the brushes and one of the brushes seemed to be falling apart.</li>
            <li> After using them once or twice they went into my box of nail stuff and sat for a few months because I was too lazy to paint designs on my nails for a while.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that a few of the brushes were broken as well as the plastics pouch they come in.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately one the smaller brushes was broken when I received them in the mail (one of the metal/brush tips had separated from the wooden handle)</li>
            <li> the brushes are so long and thin</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but when I got it some of the brushes&#x27; bristles were a little stiff and hard.</li>
            <li> It is possible I got a bad lot, but when that happened to 4 different ones, I suspected that it was a product</li>
            <li> These brushes are not soft enough for &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; lines and it&#x27;s very difficult to get the polish off them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item for at least a month now and nothing is wrong with it so far.</li>
            <li> They do not clean well and are hard to use.</li>
            <li> of little burshes for little detaling...Love it!!</li>
            <li> Perhaps I am doing something wrong in the actual use, but I felt that if I wanted the brushes to apply nail polish as desired, I would have to glob a bunch of nail polish on the tips of my brushes, which is not very nice in both affect or conservation of polish...</li>
            <li> the strippers are a little thick for my nails</li>
            <li> but the shipping was a little slow.  </li>
            <li> After a few uses they come off from the wood stick and its hard to use them.</li>
            <li> I have used the small ones for eyes.</li>
            <li> I like how the brushes are small</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> The dotting tool is small for detail dots.  </li>
            <li> I was Not able to use them.</li>
            <li> obvously I can&#x27;t use a brush with no bristles attached and  it came in the mail that way :/</li>
            <li> Not pleased about that.</li>
            <li> I have a small craft business</li>
            <li> Unbelievable that I could purchase these for the price they are.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> BUT ANY SMALL PAINTING YOU HAVE IN MIND,</li>
            <li> Unbelievable price in my contry</li>
            <li> I ordered these for the small details on my paintings.  </li>
            <li> Breaking already :/</li>
            <li> Not sure how I will use all 15</li>
            <li> But had I known they were so small</li>
            <li> I gave them four stars because of the weird smell you get when you open the packaging.</li>
            <li> So I was pretty disappointed at that.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if there is anything wring with this product.</li>
            <li> i paint small models and cards</li>
            <li> so i got this set to get a variety of small brushes.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that for some reason, on some brushes some hairs got longer and that made difficult to do the decorations.</li>
            <li> Not sure about quality because I don&#x27;t know if she started using them yet.</li>
            <li> The fan brushes were so small and there bristles weren&#x27;t fan out like in the picture</li>
            <li> was that there small</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t get past</li>
            <li> They came packaged in a plastic case with small bristle protectors.</li>
            <li> Included in this set is a small pointed dotting tool.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten these yet so not sure what to say about them.</li>
            <li> Just hand them a few brushes and let them go at it!</li>
            <li> but some of the brushes shed and the &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; peeled off some of the brushes when I accidentally spilled polish remover on them :/</li>
            <li> I was hoping the brushes wouldn&#x27;t be so stiff which makes it hard to do designs.</li>
            <li> A couple of them are probably worthless, but the price is right.  </li>
            <li> Very cheap useless and annoying.</li>
            <li> not to mention that you cant beat the price...just try to go to sallys and walk out with  nail brush for $5 or less!!</li>
            <li> They ate poor quality but will due until I find nicer ones.</li>
            <li> Admittedly I am not very good at it, but these brushes to help me to expand my abilities.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to make small designs.</li>
            <li> This is pretty annoying.  </li>
            <li> I at least one of them every week if not more.</li>
            <li> Thanks Crazy Cart!</li>
            <li> they get a little hard to work with!</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves are very small and well-made so you can paint tiny areas without being afraid of the hairs on the brush splitting anytime soon and making things messy.</li>
            <li> The brushes are all hard</li>
            <li> You would be hard pressed to beat this deal even at triple the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get the polish off the brushes though.  </li>
            <li> The bristles were already hard and clumped together and the metal part that connects to the bristles to the handle often came off.</li>
            <li> But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using these with polish, it&#x27;s hard to take off.</li>
            <li> And an angled brush for hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> they should at least give you instructions on how to use them.</li>
            <li> NOT NICE</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not pro brushes, but they&#x27;ll do the job, at least for a while.</li>
            <li> It came a week late.</li>
            <li> (at least my package said it was from HK).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product came in extremly late</li>
            <li> At least 7 of the heads/brushes fell off.</li>
            <li> the angled dotting tool is a bit awkward but still totally usuable.</li>
            <li> The brushes are really horrible to work with, really cheap products used to make the brush.</li>
            <li> they all came in a thick plastic reusable bag.</li>
            <li> For those complaining about slow shipping it comes from China, it always take at least 3 weeks to get items from there.</li>
            <li> Using acetone on ANY brush is a lot to ask and any brush will slowly get destroyed.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the packaging had a very harsh, unpleasant smell of plastic</li>
            <li> So I am not very happy at all with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very happy with these.</li>
            <li> small detail brushes I&#x27;ve come across!</li>
            <li> if not better than my paintbrushes that were made to do that!</li>
            <li> (I mean all of them)</li>
            <li> (Art brushes this tiny are hella expensive!)</li>
            <li> My husband uses these brushes to paint small game figures.  </li>
            <li> One of the 15 brushes is actually a very small dotting tool.</li>
            <li> Cleanup is near impossible, howver, as the glue holding the bristles is extremely weak and the aluminum brace is weak as well.</li>

            <li> Just some crazy glue and dry time gets its functional again.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going serious maybe another set.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not that serious</li>
            <li> Less expensive also.</li>
            <li> Go to a craft store and buy paint brushes there and use those because if you purchase this product, you&#x27;re seriously getting what you&#x27;re paying for.</li>
            <li> For less than $3 you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Serious</li>
            <li> for an international package the delivery time was not too bad.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m apparently not good at doing nail designs.</li>
            <li> The worst thing it took about a month to get them but worth it after I got them</li>
            <li> but the delivery is completely not good it takes about 8 weeks to get it</li>
            <li> I received these earlier than expected, but when they arrived a few of them were bent fairly bad. :(</li>
            <li> I have tried but maybe I am just not good with them yet</li>
            <li> this product is not good.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to waste expensive nail brushes or money</li>
            <li> Not good quality.</li>
            <li> but the glue that holds the two pieces together is not good at all.</li>
            <li> Half of the brushes were broken, very poor quality but for the price</li>
            <li> Some of the other reviews say that one of the brushes was bent and they were unhappy, but one of them is supposed to be bent.</li>
            <li> they are dry and crunchy and impossible to use to use again.</li>
            <li> my nail remover was cleaning the white paint off the handles of the brushes :(</li>
            <li> everyone feel apart first time i used terrible</li>
            <li> They were bubbled wrapped the only  problem I had is One of my brushes were bent. :(  </li>
            <li> but when they finally came I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very stiff and difficult to paint [anything] with.</li>
            <li> shipping is very slow.</li>
            <li> Nothing a little glue can&#x27;t fix, but it was still a little annoying.</li>
            <li> Two of the brushes were broken.  </li>
            <li> these are absolute crap!</li>
            <li> They got here on time, but one of them was broken when I got it.</li>
            <li> recive order and we was not happy about it.  </li>
            <li> for it it was broken so beware</li>
            <li> Broken as in a hole in the bottom</li>
            <li> Wish it had an acrylic brush and a thin nail art brush</li>
            <li> one of them came broken but nothing gorilla glue couldn&#x27;t fix</li>
            <li> Poor quality paint on handle.  </li>
            <li> nothing was broken.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with them at all</li>
            <li> Some brushes arrived broken.  </li>
            <li> so I would not be upset if one got messed up, lost, or broken.</li>
            <li> Poor business.</li>
            <li> Poor quality.  </li>
            <li> When they did, three of my brushes were already broken.</li>
            <li> I would no suggest getting this 2 of the brushes were damaged and 4 arrived broken.</li>
            <li> The brushes are thin and not all even  </li>
            <li> However, they are not great quality.</li>
            <li> when i recieved one of them was already broken and one of the tips were broken off</li>
            <li> I ordered these but some of them where broken.</li>
            <li> None came damaged or broken</li>
            <li> but you get what you pay for because the brushes are really poorly made.</li>
            <li> When I got then they all where broken</li>
            <li> For the price, you get a lot of brushes, but the white paint on the handle has a tendency to bleed off onto your hands as you work, and sometimes onto your nail, which can be especially frustrating.</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> they arrived broken and the ines that did survive dint work for s</li>
            <li> Not happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Feathers thin</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> but I had to cut all the striping brushes thin to my liking.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> two brushes were broken when arrived</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes are bent and/or broken.</li>
            <li> Also the dotting tool came broken, but i do have a pack of 5 already.</li>
            <li> One of them came broken.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given this review 5 stars but one of the brushes was broken.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product hopefully yours doesn&#x27;t come broken</li>
            <li> I thought that they were gonna come broken or not come at all..</li>
            <li> Poor material.</li>
            <li> poor quality bristles and flimsy brushes.</li>
            <li> This is a total piece of crap and it comes from China.</li>
            <li> When I got it, one of the brushes was bent at the metal part and was about to crack, the package was torn, and the package also smelled strange. :(</li>
            <li> Poor quality paint brushes.</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t let the nail polish remover touch the base of the brush which is white</li>
            <li> Cleaning them is a nightmare, it&#x27;s impossible for some odd reason to get nail polish out of the bristles.</li>
            <li> One of my brushes came slightly dented in at the metal handle part, but it&#x27;s not too bad that it hinders the usability.</li>
            <li> OMG, I&#x27;VE BOUGHT OTHER BRUSHES AND WAS DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m just frustrated and mad at the same time</li>
            <li> SUCKS!!</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied, a product of bad quality.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t expensive brushes, which means they aren&#x27;t the strongest brushes, so use them gently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> well, one of my products came broken!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be sorry.</li>
            <li> I failed, but these tools don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Im obsessed with this item.</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> But some of the handles were cracked and broken, so I had to tape them in order to use them without the pieces of wood cutting me.  </li>
            <li> I am unable to use one of the brushes because it arrived with glue attached to the bristles.</li>
            <li> When you look at the hair store they are so expensive.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they will get the job done.....</li>
            <li> The fan brushes both came a bit bent/ weird.</li>
            <li> Could just be me, but I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to use these brushes.</li>
            <li> but i was wrong.</li>
            <li> Not surprised, but very disappointed.</li>
            <li> very poor quality wood and the tips dont stay on .</li>
            <li> Very poor quality</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disappointed to say the least.  :(</li>
            <li> When I tried to use one to draw a design, it came out very sloppy looking.</li>
            <li> but I was very disappointed because even after soaking the brushes, the bristles are hard therefore, very hard to work with.</li>
            <li> For the price these are not that bad, two of the brushes were broken.</li>
            <li> So it wasn&#x27;t so bad getting two pieces broken because i wasn&#x27;t going t use them anyway.</li>
            <li> But some crazy glue can fix that problem.</li>
            <li> , it was kinda disappointing.</li>
            <li> They were fixable but still disappointing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;OK, I am CRAZY into makeup and makeup artistry.</li>
            <li> Horrible quality dont waste your money they are workless</li>
            <li> Then I got the 15pcs Nail Art Painting Pens by Crazy Cart.</li>
            <li> I bought these products, and for the price I paid I was afraid they were going to fall apart.</li>
            <li> I got these because they were recommended, but they were disappointing.</li>
            <li> I got them within two days after ordering from Crazy Cart.</li>
            <li> If you would like something to try and do your nails and others but are afraid to spend lots of money on it</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m an artist I will figure out a way to incorporate them into my painting, but I&#x27;m very disappointed that they are not suitable for nail art.</li>
            <li> Since buying this kit - It hasn&#x27;t fail me to disappointed.</li>
            <li> Variety of brushes, you can&#x27;t go wrong for the price!</li>
            <li> So sad about this!</li>
            <li> Everywhere these tools are very expensive.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was quite shocked and very unhappy.</li>
            <li> Some I the brushes works and some are Soooo bent up its impossible to use them, a set for under $3</li>
            <li> I have created things on my nails that I thought were impossible to do.</li>
            <li> For the money, this isn&#x27;t a bad set.</li>
            <li> I do not like leaving bad reviews</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t that bad.</li>

            <li> For the price, this isn&#x27;t a bad set of brushes.</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about these brushes.</li>
            <li> The shipping was quicker than anticipated which isn&#x27;t a bad thing either.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t that bad</li>
            <li> and the price wasnt bad either.</li>
            <li> Really bad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are good quality brushes and work amazing, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this item. All the pieces are there, I can finally make amazing nail art with these, I would recommend this to you if you do nails.</li>
            <li> best way to waste your money</li>
            <li> Low price. Good quality.</li>
            <li> It falls apart after just 1 ise</li>
            <li> Love this product, use it every weekend.  Need to clean brushes really good with remover to reuse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and love doing nail art! These were perfect!</li>
            <li> Very good product use them for painting on cakes</li>
            <li> i  would  buy  again,very good</li>
            <li> Hate these. They pretty much are a one time brush. I painted stripes on only one hand and it already dried the brush solid.</li>
            <li> These nail brushes work great for nail gels and glitters. You can do a lot of art with these brushes. Will order again. I give them 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Although one brush arrived separated, great set for the price.</li>
            <li> I am sure  they aren&#x27;t the best made, but for the price, I LOVE THEM</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting use to using the brushes. I don&#x27;t know how each one works yet. But I&#x27;m looking forward to it.</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes. I would recommend them to a friend.</li>
            <li> For the price, its a great buy. However the quality doesn&#x27;t seem up to my standards. Shipping was a quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> Just received them today. Item as described, worth for the wait at this price and quality. They are really solid pens.</li>
            <li> Not what I thought it was</li>
            <li> I love the variety in the brushes. I bought this as a gift. I&#x27;m doing a gift basket with all nail art stuff and this was the perfect addition.</li>
            <li> They are ok. You get what you pay for. I am an expert on nail art but I also not a novice. I use the dotting tool regularly but thats about it. I believe I have used the white fanning brush once.</li>
            <li> Not high quality but worth a few uses!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait for my daughter to use these brushes. The price was just what I wanted to pay. Thanks</li>
            <li> These are just ok for kids who may want to do nail art, I would say after getting these and using them a few times, spend some more money on better ones. These brushes are not soft enough for &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; lines and it&#x27;s very difficult to get the polish off them. If you are really into doing nails for yourself or others and want them to look good, don&#x27;t buy these.....I plan on giving mine to my teen nieces!</li>
            <li> Despite some bad reviews, I think these nail art brushes are awesome. They came packaged neatly and undamaged. Half of them can even be used as makeup brushes, such as eyeliner, because they&#x27;re so thin. It&#x27;s a great product and I would recommend it to anyone. This received four instead of five stars because one of the fan brushes, the bristles are a bit frayed, but it&#x27;s nothing that can&#x27;t be fixed at home.</li>
            <li> Very nice set of brushes for the price.  I had one that was a little loose but super glue took care of that.  other than that brushes sturdy no loose hairs when using them.  Perfect for the DYI person!</li>
            <li> I loved it, it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I really liked cuz have so many brush and those are made with a nice material.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured. A nice variety of brush sizes. They work fab, super excellent for the price. I read a review that said not to use acetone to clean, but I did &amp; nothing happened. Diff recommend for every nail guru &lt;3</li>
            <li> I received the package a day ago. All the brushes were in good condition. I have not started using them but overall very nice item for the price. Will definitely recommend. Thank you so much sending it on time.</li>
            <li> these brushes are really nice, a lot come in it and make a great gift or gift for ur self lol. but this is great, get itt</li>
            <li> Pretty nice brushes but the paint may come off the handles if exposed to acetone.</li>
            <li> These brushes are the best I have ever tried love them will be pursuing more....... Great for all uses and great for beginners</li>
            <li> I bought these because I like doing my own nails at home and this is a really great product!!! Great price as well!</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes because of the amount you got for the price. They arrived on time, and they are very nice and helpful.&lt;br /&gt;I did notice 2 things, however:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Upon opening the package, before using the brushes, one of the fan brushes broke, and couldn&#x27;t be repaired.  These aren&#x27;t expensive brushes, which means they aren&#x27;t the strongest brushes, so use them gently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I also noticed that some of the brushes are very similar to each other, and don&#x27;t make a difference on your nails. This doesn&#x27;t go for all the brushes, however, just a few of them. There&#x27;s still a variety of brushes in the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with these brushes, and I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone. I think I&#x27;ll be using these brushes often!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from the brushes because they were so cheap.  I also have a huge lack of talent.  I am learning a lot about nail art and this pack of brushes contained exactly what I needed to complete many of the step by step instructions I found online.  Some of the bristles came out but a attribute that to user error.  It was not a lot of bristles though.</li>
            <li> they should at least give you instructions on how to use them. Or pictures anything should&#x27;t  have  ordered it anyway.</li>
            <li> Today I received the June 25 article which buy previously. The brushes arrived in good condition. Thanks for the service I am satisfied with the item. I would not hesitate to re-buy, I know it takes a while for the distance but no matter.</li>
            <li> metal detaches at times, but serves its purpose</li>
            <li> I like all the brushes so far none have started falling apart and the designs I have been doing work great with these brushes</li>
            <li> There was only one brush that was even remotely useful.  Don&#x27;t waste your two bucks with this bundle - not worth it.</li>
            <li> The price is great for these and so far they have worked well for me.I would recommend them to others.</li>
            <li> Great quality! I&#x27;m a newbie at this, but so far these brushes are easy to handle and allow me to really detail my nails. Yeah!!!</li>
            <li> Had no issues with bent bristles or anything, they&#x27;re great! These brushes are awesome for doing your own nail art.</li>
            <li> These brushes make doing nail art easy! For the cheap price I will be buying more to give as gifts!</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and as described. The most disappointing thing about these brushes is that after you use them and clean them with remover they give stiff. Really stiff. If you are supposed to use a specific method or cleanser it really should have a notice with the product. Also,the brushes are really hard to get perfectly clean. If you are a nail hobbyists like me then for the price and number of brushes you get this may be ok to start with. But just know what you are getting in advance. Know that these won&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely love these but some of them have fallen apart so I had to take pliers  and squeeze it together to hold the hairs in them. This kind of ruined the brushes they aren&#x27;t exactly the way I got them now and I don&#x27;t like them as much. Otherwise I would love them.</li>
            <li> cheep price cheep product don&#x27;t dip in acetone the white paint on brush comes off ,the fan brushes work good for stripes and flat brushes for clean up! you get what you pay for..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get to use my brushes yet but the quality of them are amazing. Many different brush sizes for every design you can imagine. I would purchase again!</li>
            <li> Received my brushes in less time than I had anticipated they would come. I&#x27;ve become quite creative with my designs using the new brushes. They are sturdy and have not shed, which I thought they might. Will order these again and have recommended them to my friends.</li>
            <li> awesome . just what I needed</li>
            <li> Good brushes for the price. If you are like me, that like to create new designs and have some fun doing your nails you will love it!</li>
            <li> Nice assortment of sizes and shapes. Have not had any issues yet but for the price they are very useful. Took 3 weeks to receive.</li>
            <li> best brushes i found. great value, lots of brushes, great lengths and varirtey, a must have for doing nails, get em</li>
            <li> These brushes are pretty sturdy for brushes in general. I&#x27;ve created cool designs with them on my nails. I would recommend them at the price they&#x27;re sold for!</li>
            <li> it arrived in the time estimate and its the same that is shown in the picture. Im glad i bought them, besides they are so cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Cant wait to use them.</li>
            <li> 3 of them were bent when I recieved them and you could see the little ding in one of them where it looked as though something heavy was laying on it. Another brush started shedding. Luckily the brushes I actually needed were fine.</li>
            <li> I am a professional artist. I love these for fine detail. I use oil paint. They work very well. The liner brushes are really good. I have used the small ones for eyes. They clean well. Re-ordered 12 sets for my students.</li>
            <li> Waste of money if you ask me. I used my acetone nail polish remover to get it clean but all it did was get hard.</li>
            <li> Well worth the wait. For such a cheap price, it was a steal. This was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t take as long as I thought it was! These brushes are soft and easy to use! I like them a lot!</li>
            <li> I bought the set basically for the stripers. I have used several others. I like this set &amp; look forward to learning ways to use other brushes in he set.</li>
            <li> They look just like the image displays, shed way too much and stick together when being used, hard to remove paint from the even after a solution is applied. You get what you paid for, the cheapest isn&#x27;t always the best purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just getting into nail design. Admittedly I am not very good at it, but these brushes to help me to expand my abilities. They are easy to use and easy to clean. Great for all abilities and is encouraging me to push my abilities and get better.</li>
            <li> I receive the package about a week and a half earlier than I was told.  This is the 2nd review for one order that these brushes were included in and the same as the previous one for the first set of brushes.  The brushes were shipped in a bubble wrap packet and the seller took the time to wrap the individual packets (2) of brushes in extra bubble wrap to doubly protect the brushes from damage in shipping.  I especially appreciate the extra effort the seller went to, protecting my brushes since I&#x27;m an artist and the condition of my brushes is critical in using them for my paintings.  I had the idea of nail art brushes in order to paint tiny details in faces and such in my paintings....these brushes have met my hopes tremendously...I am so thrilled with what I am able to do with these brushes in my paintings! In addition, the seller added a personal touch in including a card thanking me for my purchase and my patience in waiting for the arrival of my order.  I thought this gesture was wonderful and I will always, in the future, order from this seller when items I am looking for are offered by this seller!  Thank you very much to the seller!!!  All of this sellers efforts were greatly appreciated by me!!</li>
            <li> I do so much nail art free style and this set is great for anything I have in mind.  would order again</li>
            <li> crazy! but i love it! totally sastified!!!! i would recommend this to my family members and friends because they love nail arts!</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for with these. They do not clean well and are hard to use.</li>
            <li> A great set. Good value.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift.  It was loved</li>
            <li> Very cheap the hairs in the brushes falls out and sheds</li>
            <li> im using these brushes for make up and they work great. super cheap. the ones that have a flare did fall apart.</li>
            <li> Wish it came with a list to go along with it to explain which brush is meant for which usage</li>
            <li> Good for price but it did fall apart</li>
            <li> Good little throw away oil brushed  -  bought 15 packs for oil painting. The heads pop off the sticks  lol  but used gently they are wonderful for painting detail. Bought more.</li>
            <li> I like these brushes. They are great. I haven&#x27;d had any problems.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, of course.  Not bad.  Two of the brushes were broken.  But, I will get some use of them.</li>
            <li> Perfect for girls who polish and decorate their nails constantly</li>
            <li> Awesome! I got these for my daughter for Christmas. When i opened the package i was very pleased. I like how the brushes are small so she can detail anything on her little fingernails.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, and they fo the job.</li>
            <li> These are some of the best brushes I&#x27;ve worked with. There is a brush for every task. My only complaint is that the metal has slid off the handle on almost all of them. Nothing a little super glue won&#x27;t fix, though.</li>
            <li> I love the different options of the different brushes. One of them feel apart but I haven&#x27;t had issues with the others so it must have just been a fluke.</li>
            <li> Awesome item great service and fast shipping. I love this.</li>
            <li> they weren&#x27;t very good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried a couple of them and they work really well, but when you use nail polish remover to clean the brushes it takes the white paint off the brushes.</li>
            <li> SUCKS!! bristles fall out!</li>
            <li> Wonderful set for a wonderful price!  Very happy</li>
            <li> They come apart easily withing the first or second use. I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to last forever, but at least for a few uses. The material is cheap and the brushes&#x27; hairs are hard.</li>
            <li> love it! exactly what i expected and more</li>
            <li> great price and quality</li>
            <li> I cleaned the brushes with nail polish and the paint on the handle dissolved and the paint was like nail polish.</li>
            <li> Got it earlier than expected. Was great except for one brush being intirely covered in glue! But other than that the other brushes were great and worked like they should have.</li>
            <li> I liked them.The Quality was okay because they had to be broken in to and one wasn&#x27;t in tacked in with the wood part over all good for clean up and details</li>
            <li> Decent quality at an unbeatable price! Just about every shape you can think of, I love it</li>
            <li> super for just graffic design painting.</li>
            <li> Get what you pay for. The tips are falling off the wooden handles but there are so many brushes that you won&#x27;t miss the few that broke. Great for experimenting and practicing with because they are so inexepensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased to say my item came 10days early!! and I just loved it!!</li>
            <li> excellent product. I received exactly what appears in the photo.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for eye makeup</li>
            <li> they are strong and durable and exactly what i needed. I actually got these for crafts/painting instead of nails. I love all the diff sizes</li>
            <li> They are great brushes and used very often! The only thing is that the metal part, holding the brush, comes off from the wooden stick fairly easy</li>
            <li> well, one of my products came broken! one of my brushes broke when I was trying to make a design so I&#x27;m kind of frustrated with it right now and i just wish the packagers would be more careful. Also the dotting tool doesn&#x27;t work! i&#x27;m just frustrated and mad at the same time I don&#x27;t really recommend this product because I think that it is a RIP OFF</li>
            <li> Love tools to paint my own designs on my nails! Just as described!</li>
            <li> I do quite a few nail designs with all sizes of brushes.  The one thing I wished this came with were smaller stripper brushes.  The fan brushes are perfect for &#x27;ombre&#x27; nails, the bristles are soft and easy to clean.  For the money not a bad set of brushes, unfortunately I had to still buy stripping brushes from another nail supply store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these nail art brushes for about two weeks now and I&#x27;m very happy with them. Very easy to clean and the pouch they come in are very convenient(: Definitely recommend these brushes! (These are also my very first nail art brushes if that helps)</li>
            <li> these are absolute crap! you use them once and the paint never comes out again. these were a complete wast of money</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! I had no problems with bristles falling out or metal clasps loose like I have on others I&#x27;ve purchased. These are well made and at a amazing price! A definite buy for anyone who&#x27;s into doing nails.</li>
            <li> I got the brushes sooner than expected but for what I paid, they are great. The brush piece on one, fell off the other day but it was an easy fix. Just some crazy glue and dry time gets its functional again. Overall, it was worth the 2 dollars and something cents.</li>
            <li> Nice looking brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice and soft.  They are as shown in the picture.  I am completely satisfied with my product.</li>
            <li> I used these to add vein detail on my eye themed jewelry, they work amazing!! If you are going to be doing fairly tiny detail, these brushes are awesome for that.</li>
            <li> great for the ladies young and old. a good gift also.</li>
            <li> Love these!! Fabulous price!!</li>
            <li> Bought for a friend. She is very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I loved this product great for professional or unprofessional nail artist, this is also very good for people who want quick designs.</li>
            <li> Not only are these practical, but they&#x27;re also good at what they do and I love how all of them has a brush guard so when I&#x27;m not using them, they&#x27;re protected in some way. I also love that I don&#x27;t need to buy these at Sally&#x27;s beauty for a fraction of the cost, I can just order them and I have plenty of uses for each of these brushes. I have had no problems ever since I got them and I will continue purchasing from this user. &amp;#60;3.</li>
            <li> The brushes function as they should. My only issue was within 24 hours some of the brushes fell apart. The silver cap came off of the wooden handle. I had to reglue them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that good for the price.</li>
            <li> I use these once in a while</li>
            <li> Love them! Came earlier than said, and work wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I use these nail art brushes, to preform different designs, on my clients nails.&lt;br /&gt;I love how they are comfortable, in your fingers, while working.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend them to anyone looking for good quality brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Work well with Acrylic Paints!</li>
            <li> These are as cheap as you would think from the price.  Not a bargain.  Recommend spending a few extra dollars to get a better product.  I am cheap as hell but this is not worth it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter and she is very happy with it.  The tools have allowed her to get creative.  good purchase!</li>
            <li> The brushes are all hard</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I was able to get a hold of this brush set!!! Very handy to my needs. TY!</li>
            <li> One brush broke, but other than that, they still work great. Had them for about a year now and they still work.</li>
            <li> I got these to try some cute nail designs but I&#x27;m apparently not good at doing nail designs.I didn&#x27;t use all the brushes but they seemed to be okay. Some of them came apart though. The brush parts detached from the white sticks. But some crazy glue can fix that problem.</li>
            <li> these are pretty good</li>
            <li> Liked it! packaged well! Comes with a case to keep them all in. Be careful cleaning them, one of the tips fell off because I pulled it.</li>
            <li> What can you say? At this price these just seem to work as well as the pricey ones.  15 pcs nail art paint brushes.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my purchase! Wasn&#x27;t expecting much at first but am very happy I bought these brushes!</li>
            <li> Works great for my small, detailed woodworking projects...I don&#x27;t use them for their intended purpose of nail art.</li>
            <li> These are cheap, and you get what you pay for. Some hairs are falling out, so not the most ideal for &amp;#34;nails.&amp;#34; They look more like paint brushes rather than for nail painting.</li>
            <li> These brushes come in so many sizes that you have many different options for your nails. My daughter likes them a lot.</li>
            <li> Great price, and they work nice. They are a little hard to clean, but I would order them again if needed.</li>
            <li> Just now really using them only recommend if your just want a one time use or practice tool. Paint on the brushes are cheap my nail remover was cleaning the white paint off the handles of the brushes :(</li>
            <li> love it received it quick</li>
            <li> They are cheap....you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> LOVe this vendor they ship super fast price is right &amp; brushes  work well very nice product that i ordered another set to add to my collection..))</li>
            <li> Exactly what we expected.</li>
            <li> Love designing my nails and they work perfectly and come just as expected!</li>
            <li> I actually bought these for painting with (not for nail art)....They come packaged nicely, and look like they are a good quality.  I haven&#x27;t had a chance to actually use them yet...but I am sure they will work just fine!!</li>
            <li> first time trying brushes on my nails, good beginner set.  some of the brushes have stray bristles but what can you expect for the price</li>
            <li> This brushes are good i like them the strippers are a little thick for my nails but you can still work with them for sure the detailing brushes are nice and small. Love that i can use them for the one stroke nail art. i have used them several times and so far I love them! Shipping took about 2 1/2 weeks!</li>
            <li> Great price nice brush for the price</li>
            <li> I got these for my nails and my husband wanted some (he does watercolor as a hobby). Great price, good brushes!!!</li>
            <li> super cheep.some of the medal tips with the brushes fell off, right after I opened the package; had to glue them back on</li>
            <li> My girls and I love these makes doing nails with designs easy! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Descent brushes, excellent quality for price.</li>
            <li> I gave this rating because my granddaughter uses this product and she said she really liked it. It&#x27;s has lots of options to use and is a good sturdy product, even though one of the pens was bent.  It did take a very long time to get because they were shipped from China. I think Amazon should tell people before they order that they are shipped from China and takes from a month to 6 weeks to receive. Still we are happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these brushes for a couple of years now. I bought them when I was going through a I-Need-To-Become-A-Self-Taught-Nail-Artist-Right-Now phase (I didn&#x27;t). After using them once or twice they went into my box of nail stuff and sat for a few months because I was too lazy to paint designs on my nails for a while.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, I did realize they are absolutely stellar for painting small detail (Omg no way I never would have guessed *sarcasm*), so now I use them for painting designs little wooden boxes with acrylic paints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One huge note for people using these for nail art ... DON&#x27;T GO ANYWHERE NEAR ACETONE WITH THESE THINGS. Seriously, one tiny drop of acetone got on the white part while I was cleaning them and suddenly my hands were covered in gooey white paint. Gross.&lt;br /&gt;But for acrylic, soap and water washes wet paint right off. Just don&#x27;t let the paint dry on them ... you&#x27;ll be sorry.</li>
            <li> Pretty good brushes. They got here on time, but one of them was broken when I got it. I had to glue the brush part back to the handle. I would expect that from something that was $2. But these were a little more than that. I&#x27;m not gonna freak about it though since the brush itself wasn&#x27;t damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am happy with these brushes :)</li>
            <li> I love the quality and good variety of brushes.  I received the quickly and in good shape.  They are a great for fine artwork and clean easily.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected... love them.</li>
            <li> These worked great for doing my own nail art.</li>
            <li> hair of the brushes started to fall when i opened it</li>
            <li> Grandaughter will just love them.&lt;br /&gt;She is really into doing her nails up fancy all the time, even during school when she should be studying!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat this for the price! Came nicely packaged and with a little case to keep all of the brushes in. So many different styles and tips, I can finally do a lot of the designs by myself that I&#x27;ve gotten done professionally. I was so excited when I finally received these. I soak them in hot water and soap after using them, NOT acetone nailpolish remover because it ruins the brissles of the brush! These are very good quality, wooden brushes not flimsy plastic. I&#x27;m in love! Definitely reccommend and will problably buy another set.</li>
            <li> These just arrived in my mailbox and I was very surprised by how fast they showed up. I have not yet had the chance to use these brushes, so I will need to update my review. They look like they are good quality though. Good enough for my use anyway. I will be using these for my own manicures at home. There are some striper brushes, two fans, and assorted fine detail brushes, angled brushes, and one metal tipped tool I will use for dotting.</li>
            <li> Al the tops came off the sticks, so just be ready to re-glue. Other than that there ok.</li>
            <li> I ordered these back in September and as of tonight November the 6th, I still have not gotten them in. So I am not very happy at all with this. Do not order from this seller unless you are ready to wait over a month for your stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;well it is November the 8th and I am still waiting for them to come in the mail. I am very disappointed. :(</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll use all 15, these are a great deal for the price! I have used one of the smaller ones, and they work wonderfully!</li>
            <li> The only word that I can use to say what best describes this product it cheap. The day that I got them I instantly pulled them out of the packaging and began to take the rubber protecting tubes off. Only a few did it however, it was kinda disappointing. When I pulled them off the brush fell apart. They were fixable but still disappointing. Another thing was that the brushes that have a brown looking tip are really a orange. But that doesn&#x27;t matter much i guess. Other then that good product for its price.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price 😃</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected and cant wait to start using them.</li>
            <li> I was debating whether to give it 3 or 4 stars. The shipping was like any other shipping from china, nothing special. When I first got the brushes, I was amazed at the quality considering I paid less than 3 dollars. What I didn&#x27;t like was that I found more than half the brushes too thick to even work with. The long brushes in particular lack control and is hard to work with. however, like everything you can get better with practice. I loved the fan brushes for adding glitter and the smaller brush for small designs. I also dipped my brushes in acetone and they worked great afterwards, no harm done.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes for my daughter as a gift. She loves to do nails so I thought it was perfect. The set has so many different sizes and she is able to paint details very easily.</li>
            <li> Absolutely great for the price, and you get a really nice variety of brush shapes.</li>
            <li> This is a great variety pack of brushes if you are just getting started with nail design or need a quick set. the brushes are well made, and I like that the shorter brushes are wider, which helps me greatly with my arthritic hands. I would recommend this set, it is a great value for the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of these brushes. Yes they were a great price, but they are poorly made and the top of my brushes would fall off and fray. They do not give clean lines and i wouldn&#x27;t recommend you buy this product.</li>
            <li> these are great quality brushes with a fantastic variety, you even get a dotting tool!  Im very pleased with this purchase.  :)</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own nails for over 20 years and I just really started getting into nail art, and I usually use brushed from walmart but I needed good stripping brushes, they arrived 2 weeks sooner than expected well packed, and not a broken or bent brush. I am very happy.</li>
            <li> Great brushes. I love how affordable they are and quality is solid I even use a few of them as clean up brushes for around my cuticles. I have two sets of these.</li>
            <li> Holy crap, by far the best deal for tiny brushes ever... EVER. These will be perfect for doing my nails!</li>
            <li> I use these for painting models, not nails. They work very well, haven&#x27;t lost any hairs. The paint comes right out. Overall a great buy, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> The metal tips had fallen off BEFORE I used them.  Got them in the mail like, this :(. I guess you really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive these, but they weren&#x27;t as nice as I was hoping. A couple of them had excess glue on them and one of them the head came off so I had to glue it back. I guess I should not have expected much for $7, but oh well.</li>
            <li> they work really well and my sister was very happy sith it for her birthday. but i have to say i ordered 1 yes my bill says i paid for two</li>
            <li> I have bought about half a dozen sets of these brushes for artist friends.  I love this product.  Low in cost, unbelievable...  and high in quality.  I have been using them for detail painting with acrylics on canvas daily  for months and they are still good as new.  The level and quality of detail possible with this varied array of brushes has brought my work to a new level.  Only minor problem is the heads are not always well attached to the shaft and just dip it in a little paint and stick it back on ends this immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has done it again.  .Professional quality at flea market prices.  What a bargain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bye a set for everyone who can use them like I have and increase your &amp;#34;love and understanding quotient&amp;#34; you have with them.  Just put them in as the shipping address and it is all covered.  I have received praise from every sit I have given and they are being used.</li>
            <li> I love this they last haven&#x27;t broken and there is so much variety of sizes the hair on the brushes are durable and easy to clean</li>
            <li> Love these! They&#x27;re great. Decent quality</li>
            <li> I love the variety of brushes</li>
            <li> works just beautifully</li>
            <li> GREAT assortment of brushes, lots of art to do on nails with these!</li>
            <li> This amazing for nails art!!!!!</li>
            <li> The brushes are cheaply made, you get what you pay for. They will work fine for nail art, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> My experience with these were horrible.</li>
            <li> I really like the brushes.. I needed something different to get precise lines and I needed different tools than just the dotting tool, these brushes do it all from straight lines and precise designs.. I loved my order.. It comes from china so expect the delivery time to be very lengthy.. I ordered the 28 th of November and they came in the 16th of December, but other than that the brushes are awesome and can&#x27;t beat it for the price, will def buy again if I lose or break the brushes..</li>
            <li> I bought these to be able to put designs on my nails when I polish them. This pack comes with all kinds of different shapes to put any kind of design on your nails. The brushes are all really nice and soft. I would recommend these nail art brushes.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy. I use them for makeup brushes (eye shadow, conceal , etc.) And I don&#x27;t use them very harshly at all and the heads just fall right off. Even the brushes I haven&#x27;t used yet the heads come unglued. The brushes work nicely to apply the makeup I just wish they were made with better quality!</li>
            <li> the brushes are good, well---one of the brushes is ruined but its alright, its just 1 brush.&lt;br /&gt;anyway, i tested it out and these brushes are better than i expected.&lt;br /&gt;my mom is a retired manicurist and when she saw the brushes she got all excited.&lt;br /&gt;anyway, i would have given this a 5 star if only that 1 brush is not ruined.&lt;br /&gt;im going to recommend this to my friends!</li>
            <li> recive order and we was not happy about it.  the could of have made it more stronger and not weak</li>
            <li> i bought these as a gift so i dont know how well or long they&#x27;ll last but they look sturdy and great im happy with them so far</li>
            <li> I have not used them all but the ones i have are great easy to handle👌</li>
            <li> The brushes ends came off during the very first use. Very cheap useless and annoying. The Fan brush is the only one that&#x27;s lasted. All the others sucked.</li>
            <li> This may sound bizarre, but these little bitty brushes are great for eyelining!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, I am CRAZY into makeup and makeup artistry. Although I did purchase these brushes for nail designs, I find that most of them are particularly useful for detailed eyelining, such as waterlining and tightlining. I have been on the hunt for the tiniest brush I could find for tightlining, as I have never been satisfied with traditional eyeliner brushes on the market, high end or low end. I needed something that I can really get into the lash line with, and create perfect winged eye looks. I know I am not the first to \\&quot;go there\\&quot; on my eye makeup with nail brushes, but I just wanted mention that these are quite useful for the idea and a great price. I did actually try using a couple of brushes with nail polish, and these are wonderful for their intended purpose. I used the metal ball-tipped \\&quot;brush\\&quot; to apply little diamonds on my nails, which was better than using toothpicks. These white pearl brushes arrived neatly packaged at my door about two weeks after I ordered them, and I am in Virginia. My only complaint is that I received 12 brushes, not 15. Still, I will probably get a couple more sets, one just for nails.</li>
            <li> They look good but the just came in a bag and not case like my other ones. Hopefully there are good since I made a gift with them</li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t fallen apart. They work great, if you know what you&#x27;re doing. I learned a lot by watching tutorials on youtube, so as I watch I use them and learn what they can do. They&#x27;re amazing.</li>
            <li> They are exactly how they were described to me. They make painting my nails so much more fun!! I am really glad I bought them!</li>
            <li> I really hate how this brush never come in. it past the due date that I expect it to come, they say they will send to again n still never get it.. not going to buy stuff from here.. I know it only couple dollars but still..</li>
            <li> when i got them they all where bent out of shape and some broke in half. very cheap product not worth your money</li>
            <li> Horrible quality dont waste your money they are workless</li>
            <li> The paint on the brushes is TERRIBLE.  I like the brushes; they don&#x27;t fall apart.  But it takes nothing, just to be wet, like when you&#x27;re rinsing them off, the paint comes off - on your hands, in the sink, off of the wood.  Other than that, they&#x27;re fine; you get what you pay for here.</li>
            <li> shipping took forever!!! when they finally arrived one of the tools was broken. i ordered a couple of items  all at once and was very disappointed by each one. never again.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to everyone .. are of very good quality and very beautiful .. besides that they are not very expensive</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, these brushes are cheap and the bristles are flimsy. I guess they serve their purpose.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used them yet but like the product variety and how fast I received them. didn&#x27;t really purchase then for nail art though. want to use them for very fine details while face painting so I hope they hold up. even if they don&#x27;t they were cheap enough so I hope I will be able to find them again if I need to any time soon</li>
            <li> Great purchase. Highly Recommended seller.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to start doing nail art for a while now, but I dont want to buy  a very expencive pack of brushes. These are perfect for beginers.</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes a while back and they are still going strong. I use these brushes frequently and it&#x27;s not a lie to say that this set is everything you need and more. They&#x27;ve held up nicely and I haven&#x27;t had any of them break, although one of the tips is a little jiggly. You do have to be careful around the acetone, however, as the paint will wash off. I would still recommend it though. Also make sure you clean the brushes right after using them because the dried paint isn&#x27;t too easy to get off.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and just as described</li>
            <li> For the money, this isn&#x27;t a bad set. A few of the brushes were bent right out of the package but I was able to bend them back and still use them. I haven&#x27;t found a use for the majority of the ones in the set (there are quite a bit) but the ones that I have used have been ok. Not fantastic, not high quality but again, for the price - they are ok.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good product and they work really good, they came really fast, the time I was expecting. Really good conditions.</li>
            <li> I really love all of these little brushes. I have always wanted to get into learning how to do cool designs on my nails like how they do in nail salons, and with the price of these, I figured I&#x27;m not really losing anything if they suck. Although they took forever to arrive, I was really surprised by the quality of the brushes. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is a beginner when it comes to nail decorating (and isn&#x27;t in a huge hurry to get them)</li>
            <li> This goes with the nail art set of 24 polish colors that I purchased for my adult granddaughter. Such a wonderful variety of brushes that encourages her creativity.</li>
            <li> Im very satisfied with the brushes c: plus they arrived so much faster then expected.</li>
            <li> Thede arrived as expected the packing could have had more padding  though none broken they are new, as advertised will update when they get put to use.</li>
            <li> I gave this on star because it was not all that sone of them but i like it</li>
            <li> So far so good. A little staining but no running of different colors. Love that I got so many for the price. Shipping was as to be expected coming from China but ordered 3pc set at the same time and they shipped a day apart which came out to be a 2 week difference making it to me but still within reason.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the brush tips to be tiny, but not that tiny! I guess you need it that tiny for nail art (I bought it to paint cookie and stuff and to act as food-safe brushes since they are made of synthethic hair, and a few brushes for my polymer clay creations). They are really good quality for such a cheap price, but for me the shipping was a tad bit slow, but I&#x27;d rather get a slightly slow shipping speed and a low price than anything else (unless that anything is a good buy and a fast shipping speed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would easily recommend to anyone - bakers, nail artists, painters, crafters and so on.</li>
            <li> I have used these a few times since I purchased them. I&#x27;ve never used them before so I&#x27;m still playing around with them so I can use them better.</li>
            <li> So, far, I like this.  The fan brush did not work a s I expected.</li>
            <li> Surprising quality for how inexpensive these brushes are.  I am able to do so much more with my nails now, I love it!</li>
            <li> They are too cheap. When the brushes get near nail polish remover the paint starts to come off. After a few uses they come off from the wood stick and its hard to use them.</li>
            <li> The brush part unglued from the wand</li>
            <li> These brushes may as well be feathers - although feathers may even have better control. This picture does not even show the same items that are delivered. These brushes are much too soft to work with nail art. They cannot even be used by adults for make-up brushes. Since I&#x27;m an artist I will figure out a way to incorporate them into my painting, but I&#x27;m very disappointed that they are not suitable for nail art.</li>
            <li> Ok, but I can&#x27;t imagine they will last long</li>
            <li> My daughter (17 yo) loves doing her nails, and these brushes just made things a whole lot easier for her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish they&#x27;d included some care instructions, though. :/</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t 100 dollar brushes so don&#x27;t expect that but they work and are very sturdy. I recommend this to anyone who needs a few brushes for on the go, beauty school, or just for practicing. These came WAYYYY before the expected date also and I was very pleased with that. I love the brushes and they get the job done. Highly highly recommended!</li>
            <li> for an international package the delivery time was not too bad. the quality of the brushes r very nice the hairs r soft and bend able each brush was individually package and nothing was broken the pouch that came with it was very convenient</li>
            <li> This is a very large quantity of brushes.  I&#x27;ve only used a few of the brushes, but they are definitely nifty items for polish lovers. Very easy to clean with alcohol and letting them air dry.  I create YouTube tutorials, so you can see me use these tools at: http://youtu.be/yvP2jl7ebQo</li>
            <li> When the item arrived I notice the metal part came of the handle on one of the brushes. I have only used the fan brush as I was doing a craft project with my son when it came.  It has a nice feathery texture and worked well for the others I will have to wait and see</li>
            <li> Its pretty nice considering the price.</li>
            <li> Not great quality..still pretty decent and a steal for the price</li>
            <li> First time using nail art brushes. Good item for beginners. Had to go on YouTube to figure out what each brush was used for.</li>
            <li> I rated the item four stars because one of the slanted brush&#x27;s bristles push in. Other than that one defect, no other complaints...</li>
            <li> Perfect for finite detail work. Works great for alternative surfaces… i.e. leather shoes. The longer brush took some extra TLC due to barely fitting within the confined plastic carrying case. However, I&#x27;m quite pleased!</li>
            <li> Very disapointed not sure what I saw when I ordered but did not mee my expectation very poor quality merchandise</li>
            <li> The package was open from the bottom..but the brushes were the same as in the picture... so good job mailing .</li>
            <li> I like this but make sure the stick doesnt hit acetone or else the paint gets all over</li>
            <li> These are my favorite!&lt;br /&gt;I love using them and I use them almost every time I do my nails. The shipment came fast and it was worth the money!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, brushes are great. Good size and is as expected without flaws. 10 / 10 would buy again.</li>
            <li> I Love These So Much.!! They Were Perfect &amp; Exactly What I Was Looking For.!</li>
            <li> The product was supposed to arrive July 30th or later but ended up coming July 17th which was a great surprise. My only complaint is that the packaging had a very harsh, unpleasant smell of plastic but I&#x27;m sure that is out of the seller&#x27;s control. I have no idea what to do with a few of the brushes yet (particularly the fan brushes and longer brushes), but the rest are amazing. I can&#x27;t believe I got this product for like $2. I am very pleased and excited to try many nail looks with these brushes! Great seller.</li>
            <li> Good brushes lasted longer than I thought</li>
            <li> nice but some of the ends were off and had to re-glue them on.</li>
            <li> For the price, cannot complain. They work fine for me, and are decent products. I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with these tools.</li>
            <li> These are so cute, and work perfectly. Great buy, and I had no issues receiving it. They, although did break easily.  My dotting tool bent and then snapped within a few days.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these brushes to anybody. I use them for my crafts rather than nail art. They are good quality brushes with an incredible price. They also have relatively fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Come in nice and good quality.  Items as describe, as picture...  I can use them to several nail art practice.  Will buy from again once in need.</li>
            <li> The product was good but don&#x27;t put acetone remove nail polish. Because it will remove paint stick. It took two week to delivery from me.</li>
            <li> Low quality brushes. They will get the job done but be careful they&#x27;re easy to break.</li>
            <li> Great brushes for my nail art, they clean very easy with nail polish remover. This brush set has every brush you can possibly think of.</li>
            <li> The brushes are good quality and easy to clean.  The size is right for close, precise work.  Have used them for several types of paint and been satisfied with all of them.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing deal. You get all sorts of brushes. I actually purchased these for painting. A few of the brushes have loose metal clasps- but nothing a little glue wont fix. I will buy these again. Also, you should know, they ship from outside the country and do take a while to arrive but if you don&#x27;t need them urgently, what a deal!!!</li>
            <li> I got the set and it was in great condition for the price I paid.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again in the future if needed.</li>
            <li> came exactly as pictured! high quality &amp; professional looking. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;came in a clear, plastic case instead of just loose like i was expecting. excellent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;took forever to get here, though. probably because they&#x27;re from china.</li>
            <li> Works great for nail art!</li>
            <li> The brushes look kind of cheap but they do work OK. You can see the hot glue that they used in some of the brushes. Some also came bended.  At neck of the brush you should be careful to not bend it. Overall, they are OK for the price</li>
            <li> i chose this rating because as well as the othr detailer brushes these come in every size you could possibly need in painting nails.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product. I just haven&#x27;t found time to use all these brushes.... cheap too, so its worth it.</li>
            <li> It is good they are awesome but beware when I got it the holder  for it it was broken so beware</li>
            <li> All of the brushes are way smaller than I expected, but then again they are nail art brushes. They are decent brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes were perfect and have allowed me to expand my nail techniques.  Items were just as described!  Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes for the price so many things you can accomplish with them</li>
            <li> They came in way early which was awesome. One brush was bent but still usable. So over all for price is amazing and great brushes. Thin and great for nails.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for nail art brushes when I came across this set and am so glad that I did. Not only are they inexpensive but they are of really good quality. They don&#x27;t seem cheap and you probably wouldn&#x27;t even know that I got them for so little. I love that they come with a case so you don&#x27;t have to worry about losing any of them or having to take up more space than needed. I tried most of these and they work really good. I now can&#x27;t wait to do some searching on how to make some fabulous nail art with these brushes! I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> The brushes took awhile to arrive, but they were very affordable, so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal. The white paint seems to chip off the brushes very easily which is messy.</li>
            <li> arrived earlier than expected, in good condition.  Are pretty decent quality and work well right out of the package</li>
            <li> Very good although after you use it the polish sticks to the brush and also it&#x27;s notvery easy to work with;</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes came in damaged.</li>
            <li> these brushes are great. they get the nail art jobs done and they wash easily. they glide on the nail too</li>
            <li> She loves them! There is a brush for everything she needs, and this ended up replacing another set that I had bought her.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made. Each brush (of the ones that arrived undamaged) would likely only be used once. So cheap it gets 3 starts since its basically disposable in price and quality.</li>
            <li> great for the price. a little bit of them look kinda frayed but totally fixable. work it for a dollar. cant complain. works great.</li>
            <li> Great addition to an already awesome collection</li>
            <li> I have used the brushes for everything! Doing my nails, painting small buttons and bow decorations, mod podging tiny gems onto a 100 day bow, these tiny brushes have been so very useful!.</li>
            <li> WILL STEAL...GOT MY MONEY AND NO ITEMS...CROOKS ROBBERS AND THIEVES...I WOULD LIKE MY MONEY PLEASE.ITS NOT NICE TO BE HERE TO STEAL...DID YOU KNOW THERE IS A GOD!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice looking quality and for the price can&#x27;t go wrong. Just an added note they aren&#x27;t just white it&#x27;s more of a pearl white.</li>
            <li> On time and very good condition. They work great for Nail art designs. Warm waterband soap clean up is all thats needed to keep them clean. Very cheap but of decent quality! Would I buyvthem again if needed?? MOST DEFF!!</li>
            <li> exactly what I ordered. Haven&#x27;t used it too much the one time i did they worked well! Good price and good quality.</li>
            <li> Really easy to use. I have been using mine for 3 years.</li>
            <li> they took forever for me to get them when i did 1 of the metal tips was bent in half but the ones i have wanted to use worked just fine</li>
            <li> I love the different types of brushes. I have become a pretty good nail artist as a result. I was very impressed with the fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Amazing value of these brushes! just one in the store is the amount I paid for the entire set!!!! Now I can design nails like a pro!!!</li>
            <li> These came in a lot faster than expected! One of the brushes was bent. I don&#x27;t know if it was supposed to be like that but it wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal since there&#x27;s like 4 other brushes that size.</li>
            <li> I use these brushes for paint, not nails!&lt;br /&gt;So my review for these will be from a painting perspective!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are smooth and fine, clean easy and are well built!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it in my business,thanks</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t work well as nail tools, or painting really</li>
            <li> Received this product sooner than expected. The only complaint I have is that a few of the brushes were broken as well as the plastics pouch they come in. Broken as in a hole in the bottom but that was not a big deal to me. Tape can fix it but I will be putting them in brush holder anyways. A few of the brush tips were off of the sticks. They pop right back on and were not loose or anything like that. A little glue could even reinforce it. Overall great product and exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> The metal sleeve that holds the brush to the handle slipped off two brushes the day I received them, but really that&#x27;s my only qualm with them.  Totally worth $2.</li>
            <li> Its not the best quality, I mean it was only like $2 so can&#x27;t really complain about that. I like to do different nail designs myself so they work pretty well for that. If you own a nail salon I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these but if you are just playing around at home and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money they&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain anything about this brush as the price is so cheap but wonderful quality. I love how stiff the brush is so I can make a clear fine line, but not for blending lines.&lt;br /&gt;Each brush except the 2 fan come with plastic cap to make sure they still intact. So far, just by touching, I don&#x27;t think they will shed any except for one brush that look more fragile than other. Also the brush handle is quite sturdy that they don&#x27;t look to cheap at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really happy for making decision to buy this  despite some feedback, really no regret at all :)</li>
            <li> Love the variety of different types of brushes this kit comes with!</li>
            <li> They are ok so far - average quality - ok for a beginner, but a professional might like something a little better</li>
            <li> I ordered these months ago and they never did show up...I quit waiting and bought a pair at my local beauty store since I need these for my Cosmetology School.</li>
            <li> I bought this set for quite a while and it still hold up really well.  I usually use some of them once every other week.  Good price for quality product.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again if this set ever worn out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with how the brushes have worked making small nail designs, but if you clean the brushes with nail polish remover (even non acetone) the paint will come off and make a mess.  However, the tiny brushes have worked well and I&#x27;ve had the set for four months now, and I recommend the largest square brush for cleaning up around the edges of nails :)</li>
            <li> I love making everyone&#x27;s nails look beautiful with my new kit. they are made sturdy and have worked for everything I used them for so far</li>
            <li> Very bad quality. Impossible to get the polish off of, good if you don&#x27;t want a good nail design, and are only hoping for one time use though. As though they are painted with nail polish, it gets sticky and the paint comes off when it comes in contact with nail polish remover. I would not reccomend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> I Love all of the brushes but it took 5 weeks to get to me. The white is actually white pearl.</li>
            <li> These arrived quicker than expected. Only one of them was bent. Good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> All good quality. Wish it had an acrylic brush and a thin nail art brush but what can u ask for for a few bucks. Worth it stil.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes after watching a couple of online videos about building nails using gels and saw that no one used the applicator out of the bottles. I&#x27;ve only used a couple of them so far -- because, to be honest, I&#x27;m still learning about what they all do -- but the two flat brushes have changed my life. I will never ever use the brushes that come with nail polish bottles again. Seriously. The slightly stiffer bristles means that I can control the polish. For the first time I was able to apply polish and not get ANY on my cuticles and even managed a pretty durn good smile line on French tips. I have now used them with both gels and regular polish and it&#x27;s just far superior to the applicator in the bottle. I can&#x27;t compare to other art brushes -- but as far as this set goes, I would recommend them in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for what my daughter was looking for, and the price was perfect considering how long we had to wait for them. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy. Too cheaply made.</li>
            <li> one of them came broken but nothing gorilla glue couldn&#x27;t fix plus they were cheap but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> horrible quality everyone feel apart first time i used terrible</li>
            <li> All of them were thrown out first use because the brush fell apart, paint on the handle peeled, very poor quality...</li>
            <li> I did have to wait a month do my order but hey it was a good price and the are a great quality! One brushs meatle piece did come a bit bent but that&#x27;s nobody&#x27;s fault an I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> A good variety of brushes for several different styles/designs. The versatility of the brushes is quite advantageous given the price! You could use some as makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> Wow amazing! Such good quality brushes I expected flimsy old brushes. Not the case at all would recommend!</li>
            <li> I like this set of brushes, there are so many different types. I use them for nail art and am happy that I purchased them, decent price too!</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve already posted this but hey I got these brushes for nail but me I&#x27;m useing these for fine liner to make ur eyeliner define I love them I couldn&#x27;t get these anywhere else should buy my daughter some was worth the wait a great price</li>
            <li> good quality for the price. I love them.</li>
            <li> The brushes are fine, however you&#x27;d think something that will probably come into contact with nail polish remover would be more durable against acetone. It is not. Maybe it should have been obvious to me that it would happen but I got white paint all over my fingers. Probably would be better for the real nail artists who use paint.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these brushes! None have fallen apart or anything yet. Easy to clean and easy to use. I think every beginning nail artist should have this kit!</li>
            <li> It is not a bad product but the bristles came apart easily and straight away so I couldn&#x27;t use one or two of the brushes. The metal parts also came off of the wood very easily when I was cleaning the brush. Hope this helps people!</li>
            <li> These are a great set. My girls use these for their nail art. The different sizes help with the different designs. I would recommend these brushes. If taken care of these brush last for quite a while.</li>
            <li> OUT FINGERS AN TOES HAVE NOT BEEN THE SAME AND THEY LOOK GERORGOUS! NOW HER BRO AND DAD WELL. THEY AINT REALL HAPPY WITH THE GEMS AN BOWS BUT I AM</li>
            <li> It depends how you use it but they are really nice I like it. They&#x27;re so cheap but works for me</li>
            <li> Extremely nice for the price,  Well worth the wait!</li>
            <li> For the price, was ok, !</li>
            <li> works for me, love the price</li>
            <li> Very nice set and the plastic bag to keep them in is a plus.</li>
            <li> All ready wrote this one.</li>
            <li> Be warned that you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought these for my 12 year old niece who is into nail art. For a kid, who made be going through a fad, I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much $.  So, these looked okay and are so inexpensive.  I ended up having to glue 8 out of the 15 brush heads back on the handles before giving them to her!  I guess I didn&#x27;t mind because they were so inexpensive.  Just make sure to have some super glue on hand.</li>
            <li> The brushes work well but the white paint on the handles came off when in contact with nail polish remover. I recommend removing the white paint prior to using them. It is light wood underneath.</li>
            <li> Quality not so good. But definitely worth the price and all if you are just testing out different nail designs.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. Cant wait to use them. Great quality. What a deal. Will be shopping again very soon.</li>
            <li> Look at that price! God it&#x27;s almost free!! I can&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re so good in quality for that price. I love them.</li>
            <li> the art painting pen brushes are good and useful.  you can use it for nails and make-up, i do.  thank you.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I ordered, I am very pleased and ordered another! I love doing my nails and usually use toothpicks but these are so much better!</li>
            <li> they were shipped very fast and have been extremely useful! I only wish i wouldn&#x27;t have brought them to work as the other ladies didn&#x27;t clean them and now i will have to purchase another set cause my others are ruined! luckily they ship quick and are inexpensive!</li>
            <li> Lots of good brushes for doing nail art or for other cosmetic uses.  Cheaper buying on Amazon than buying each one individually at a craft store!</li>
            <li> These things are great and you can&#x27;t beat the price or quality. Glad that I purchased. Will definitely do so again.</li>
            <li> I love buying nail supplies and this product is another great additiuon to my collectio and it&#x27;s great quality as well.</li>
            <li> These brushes were great at first, I was excited to use them once they came in, but I&#x27;ve had them for more than half a year and they&#x27;re getting ruined. The brush pieces are coming off so when I&#x27;m doing nail art, it ruins it because the little strings of the brush are all over the place. I&#x27;ve only used about 4 out of these 15 brushes, mostly for cuticle clean up and those 4 brushes aren&#x27;t even brushes anymore because there&#x27;s just 2 strings left of the entire brush that fell off. So they were good at first but after a while they get bad; I rather pay more for better quality than this cheap quality. ALSO, the brush strings are also too separated, they are together in a line to make perfect lines or nail art.</li>
            <li> These are just what I wanted! I even use some for my make up as well! Order these right away!</li>
            <li> These are pretty darn good considering how cheap they are. Plus, 15 different brushes gives me plenty of options to work with on my modeling and hobbies. They&#x27;re not pro brushes, but they&#x27;ll do the job, at least for a while.</li>
            <li> A bunch were broke, &amp; looked cheap. Take a pass.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my grand daughter, she was pleased with the quality. I was pleased that they came on time. Thank.you.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected, haven&#x27;t used them yet but they seem like good brushes. For $2.39 I&#x27;m not complaining!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this set in the mail! I have used 5 different brushes so far and live them. My artist skills aren&#x27;t the best but these great brushes make it easier! Great product!</li>
            <li> My younger was very excited to receive these brushes. She has only used them a few times but so far they have held up well.</li>
            <li> The broke really fast</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and in great shape. Quality is better than expected...way better. I&#x27;ve been using these with actual oil and watercolor paints, simply because i cannot find affordable and small enough ones in craft stores. Worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Super happy to receive the brushes, I have been creating beautiful nail art designs since I received the brushes.  The work well, clean well.  Only one down fall is that the brush tip came off on a couple, nothing as little super glue didn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> Love doing my daughters nails. So many different size brushes</li>
            <li> This set is great! I can do almost anything on my nails because of this set!!! One of the brushes did lose it&#x27;s head but with super glue, it went back up.</li>
            <li> You would be hard pressed to beat this deal even at triple the price. Love using the brushes to decorate my nails.</li>
            <li> It took 3 months to receive this order. They had to resend it but when I received it, it was worth the wait.  The brushes are in good order.  They are not long term high quality, but they will definitely do the job and for the price I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> As soon as I got the package some of the brushes had already fallen apart.</li>
            <li> These are good brushes. I have several sets, including the Shany Cosmetics set of 30 nail art brushes and some of the ones in this package I prefer over these. The striper brush in this pack is my favorite striper brush ever and was worth the $3 alone so I cant complain</li>
            <li> Good product for the price there are different sizes of brushes and I love them all I even used two of them to apply eyeliner and they worked fine.</li>
            <li> I actually barely use these, but only because I&#x27;m not artistic. I wanted to try to do free hand designs. I failed, but these tools don&#x27;t. You get a lot of bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> They work amazing for the price and have many uses.  make sure you wash them right after you use them, or you will only be able to use each brush once.  i wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for nail businesses.</li>
            <li> The brush it&#x27;s ok, I&#x27;ve got what I paid for. It&#x27;s reasonable price, I can&#x27;t wait to use it. Thanks</li>
            <li> Very good product for the low price, works great, and is exactly as described, the only problem is the seller don´t give a tracking number.</li>
            <li> Good selection and the main reason I set away for this item. It has a broad range to choose from and nice bristles.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s are hands down the best value for money detail brushes I&#x27;ve ever found.  Great quality!  They&#x27;ve enabled me to paint tiny details on the faces of my dolls (smallest face is 1\\&quot;).  I would never have been able to make smaller dolls were it not for these brushes!  I&#x27;ll be able to use them on my illustrations, too.  Happiness!</li>
            <li> Strange that they would paint the handles of these brushes with paint that dissolves and gets gummy when it touches acetone. You would think if they are marketed as NAIL art brushes, they would be non-reactive with acetone. Other than that, they are fine.</li>
            <li> Loved these brushes and they even came with a little stylist. Great buy for a low price. Would buy from vender again.</li>
            <li> Not the best quality, but nice variety of various sizes. Brushes are rather still, and one of the tips fell off, but I was able to glue it and make it hold..</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Perfect condition,  all brushes painted beautifully, arrived sooner than I expected.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> For less than $3, I can&#x27;t complain. The brushes were better than I thought they would be. It took about 3 weeks to get them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot of brushes for a low price but the caps of the brushed easily fall off and they are not good quality.</li>
            <li> Excellent, exceeds expectations</li>
            <li> Wow, what an array of brushes -- you&#x27;re bound to find a size and shape for every need, not to mention that they vary in stiffness which is great for detail work. Not only can you tell they are durable, the bristles don&#x27;t fall out after much use and they clean up well, too.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply put together, tips fall off.</li>
            <li> I ordered about 6 or 7 of these and my customers love it. They are having fun with it and the price is just right. Just don&#x27;t let these get near to acetone, or brushes are ruined. I also have a set for myself and like it alot.</li>
            <li> The brushes were a great deal. We use them in our pottery shop for fine detail work.</li>
            <li> Works really great and great price! I have used these numerous time and have been very impressed with them and the quality, especially considering the price. The only downside was the wait time since they were coming from overseas.</li>
            <li> Came very quickly and i use them all the time! They&#x27;re very nice and easy to use, they create such great desugns!</li>
            <li> Horrible. Never again.... But then again, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I bought these for the price of course did not expect much - they are not the greatest but will do the job</li>
            <li> I use these brushes to create all kinds of cute nail art. Great product and at a super low price.</li>
            <li> Every single one of them seems to be in perfect condition. I&#x27;ve not gotten the chance to use them just yet, but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be perfect!</li>
            <li> not that great but not awful.. Took FOREVER to get but the brushes are nice an the ones I&#x27;ve tried they&#x27;re easy to use.</li>
            <li> Poor quality paint on handle.  Brush bristles come out when rinsing.  Good for one time use. ....not multiple uses.  Need for details on nail design. ....not even worthy of amount paid.</li>
            <li> This package has a good variety of brush sizes in it.  The dotting tool is small for detail dots.  I haven&#x27;t used the fan brushes yet, but I plan to use it to lay glitter on my designs.  The long thin brush is good for lines and stripes.  I will buy more from this seller in the future.</li>
            <li> OMG these are awesome. I constantly use these. I save so much money at the nail salon since i purchased these fun brushes. Cheap and really fast shipping! thank you!</li>
            <li> Great brushes for small jobs, can&#x27;t beat the price. Came in a timely manner</li>
            <li> like all good love it</li>
            <li> For the price they are excellent..&lt;br /&gt;came with a dotting tool also which I didnt expect..&lt;br /&gt;I had went to the store and spent more than 5 bucks on some nail art brushes and I like these way better&lt;br /&gt;lots of little burshes for little detaling...Love it!! &#x3D;) have nothing bad to say they are decent quality used them already havn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;had any problems with the hairs coming out and they seem to keep there shape..LOVE! &#x3D;))</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BUY THESE BRUSHES!!! Some came apart right after opening. Had to glue the tops back onto the sticks. Don&#x27;t get acetone on the stick because the paint comes off and it gets sticky. You pay for what you get...</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price! I love these brushes! The paint rubs off a little with acetone and one of mine came apart at the metal part, but a little super glue and its good as new!</li>
            <li> You cannot beat these brushes for the price!  Great variety of types of brushes!  I actually use them for handpainting on cakes and they are perfect.  Coming from Asia, they took about a week and a half to arrive.</li>
            <li> I liked this set so much that I bought a set for my best friend. She loves it too! The only thing that has happened was that some of the tips were not securely fastened. Nothing a little super glue couldn&#x27;t fix! I recommend this set! Can&#x27;t be beat for the low price!</li>
            <li> I bought the brushes for working with my gel nails, and they are good. Mainly the set contains of brushes and one dotting pen. Can&#x27;t complain. Can&#x27;t compare with any other brushes though, since this is my first purchase, so I&#x27;m not sure if they are the best ever.</li>
            <li> I received these today,  Im satisfied because you do get what you pay for though. The clear plastic pouch they vome in was split and two of the brushes came detached from the handle</li>
            <li> I need to learn how to use these more but theyre not super easy to start using. I need to do some more youtube research on these.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone! The brushes are incredible! They haven&#x27;t fallen apart for me and they make everything so much more simpler!</li>
            <li> Nice set of brushes for adult paint by numbers. The worst thing it took about a month to get them but worth it after I got them</li>
            <li> great item. thank you!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister she loves to do nails and this came in she was very please about the quality and nothing was broken. I was also please about the prices .No complaints a very happy customer</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s possible draw in nail. i&#x27;m happy to buy art bush .it give me pleasure low price and fast survice ..thank you</li>
            <li> most of them wwere broken but I just fixed them</li>
            <li> Love it, daughter is an artist and these work good, I ordered two sets so I could paint with her</li>
            <li> 15 brushes for $3.00!  I bought 1 brush in a beauty supply store and it was $4.79.  Between the rhinestones I bought here and the and the nail polish holder and these brushes I&#x27;m never going to leave my house!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are great.  The bristles don&#x27;t pill or pull out and they hold they&#x27;re shape well.  This would make a great christmas present.</li>
            <li> I bought these nail art tools just for learning purposes and for what I needed it was great for the price and seemingly good quality too.</li>
            <li> Love doing my nails and these tools are a perfect addition to my personal nail supply</li>
            <li> The top of the fan brush fell off as soon as I took it out of the bag. I&#x27;m gonna glue it back on. The quality of the brush is just ok.</li>
            <li> They are ok, but most of them fell apart the first day i got them.  I would not recommend these to anyone</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet but I just received them the other day . They seem put together pretty well and for the price I can&#x27;t complain either way , I can&#x27;t wait to use them</li>
            <li> I try to make myself pretty , but it cost soooooo much. Getting my nails done every 2 weeks, my hair and clothes- plus it&#x27;s like another full time job. It&#x27;s tasking. Then I got the 15pcs Nail Art Painting Pens by Crazy Cart. I can get the professional look at home. I am super excited because with the sleek and slender handle, I can use my non dominant hand and it still look good!</li>
            <li> These brushes arrived exactly two weeks before the estimated delivery date. The brushes were in good shape, they all came with a protective cover. The case they came in was folded oddly and stuck in that position so I just stuck it in a heavy book for a little while and now it is fine. I have found only one brush tip to be loose but I will fix that with super glue. Over all, I am very happy with my nail art brushes.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t use these brushes for my nails, I use them as detail brushes for my acrylic and oil paintings, they&#x27;re surprisingly durable and the tip keeps point, 10/10 would paint again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect to do nail art but the paint on the brush comes off if acetone or nail polish remover gets on it</li>
            <li> Great brushes.  Great condition. Great Price. Speedy shipping.  Overall I am very pleased with this purchase.  Love all the different shapes and sizes of the tools too!</li>
            <li> The brushes break really easily and the tips come off of the wooden stick too easily.</li>
            <li> I use these for oil painting.  Highly recommend.  Great price.</li>
            <li> I would actually give it a 4.5/5.0 but I can&#x27;t chose a half star so I&#x27;m telling ya here, it&#x27;s 4.5! Here are some pros &amp; cons about this item.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- easy to use&lt;br /&gt;- brushes are quite soft&lt;br /&gt;- arrived a few days earlier than expected date&lt;br /&gt;- price is very low and favorable&lt;br /&gt;- quality is decent.&lt;br /&gt;- light weight, stick is wooden&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- the metal part for some cane off &amp; to solve it I used my hot glue gun and attached the wooden stick and metal back together; very small, easy to solve problem&lt;br /&gt;- make sure you know how to clean nail polish off the white brushes, they can get stuck for a long time</li>
            <li> I love that there are 15 brushes, all different sizes for anything you need to make wonderful art on just about anything. I&#x27;m going to be able to make even the finest detail on nails, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could give this seller like 20 stars, because they deserve it. It was over a month before I received them, but in no way was it there fault. It was estimated to arrive April 25, but it didn&#x27;t I contact the seller and they went over and beyond to correct the issue. I received the order 3 days later, so it wasn&#x27;t lost just late. I would recommend this seller to everyone. I would totally purchase more from them anytime!</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes because I wanted some inexpensive brushes to do some of my own nail art.  I&#x27;ve used the dotter a few times after the first use it already fell apart.  This is pretty annoying.  I still use it but if I knew this was going to happen I&#x27;d gladly pay a few more bucks for something that keeps breaking.  I&#x27;d recommend to try another set.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> I do not like leaving bad reviews but I believe in being honest and I would want someone to tell me the truth about a product so here goes... I wish I would have read through more of the reviews before I made my purchase. I did receive my purchase on time and paid a decent price that was the only good thing! Half of the brushes were broken, very poor quality but for the price I guess I got what I paid for. This however is only my opinion.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great! They arrived eariler than I expected and I used them 3 days later!! The striper is awesome and so is the short lettering brush! Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Hairs falling out and I was screwed out of extra $25 for what was sold as \\&quot;free shipping\\&quot;. Watch out and stay away from these sales. You will be screwed.</li>
            <li> The product came EXACTLY how it&#x27;s shown in the picture. Quality is great too! I&#x27;ve been using this item for at least a month now and nothing is wrong with it so far.</li>
            <li> Took a while but when it finally came in; it was perfect , good condition. I have used it twice since I got it an it works like a charm</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes were bent up.  I was Not able to use them. I&#x27;m not happy with them at all</li>
            <li> I ordered this July 30, and received this item on August 11, which is earlier than expected. The brushes had a strong odor when I opened them, like the smell of varnish. However,  every brush was different and I am really happy with the way they handle. The brushes clean up well too, and the bristles seem to be attached well and don&#x27;t seem to come off on my nails. The paint on the actual handle came off after I cleaned it, but I&#x27;m not too concerned because I don&#x27;t need them to be pretty. Update, initially I did not notice, but one brush was bent. The brush still worked, but it is something worth noting.</li>
            <li> These pen brushes are great!! They are well made and easy to use. Having all sorts of different shapes really makes it easy to create your own nail designs. I use one of the brushes to do french nails and it is much much easier to control brush stroke compared to using my regular nail polish brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wait was long, since it&#x27;s shipped from China, but it was well worth it and I will buy from this vendor when these need replacement.</li>
            <li> Got it within a reasonable amount of time even with it being around the holidays. I haven&#x27;t used these though because they are a gift for my niece, but they look like they will work just fine for her! none were broke or anything.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set for my 15-yr old grand-daughter who has an obsession with nail polish and art.&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived soon after her birthday, but I am sure that she will be delighted to receive one more gift.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the seller for sending it.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all.  I am trying to come up with 20 words.  LOL</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it.  Perfect for styling her nails</li>
            <li> The brushes are awesome they work perfectly im happy with my purchase they do however take a bit long to arrive but that was expected other than that they do what their supposed to.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for... or a little more with these. They ate poor quality but will due until I find nicer ones.</li>
            <li> This is a great nail brush set for the price! I love doing nails and I didn&#x27;t want to waste money for brushes that would fall apart, but this is far from a waste. They came fast and I am very glad with these brushes. I would 150% recommend these to a friend!</li>
            <li> i use these for painting fine areas of my sculptures and they work great. they&#x27;re easy to wash and none of my brushes have fallen apart yet. they actually work better than the brushes i bought at MIchaels.. and they cost a lot less!</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes with sturdy handles and good shapes.  There are two fan brushes, several with very tiny points and some squared-off ones all of which should be very useful.</li>
            <li> You get a very nice collection of different size and types of brushes for nail art. They are long lasting and can be cleaned off with regular nail polish remover. Great for detailed art, one-stroke painting, dotting, gradients, or anything else you can think of.</li>
            <li> well i dont like all the brushes but most of them i like some are tweaked but i trim them to my liking so the price and quantiy are great but some were not to my liking but i made them useable!!!</li>
            <li> I love them except 2 of the brushes lost their bristles. The rest of the brushes work awesome and are great for detail.</li>
            <li> The product arrived early, and I&#x27;ve already started using them to make beautiful nail designs. Thanks! Quality and price is great, also!</li>
            <li> I love nail art.  Unfortunately with my busy schedule these days I haven&#x27;t had much time to play around with these.  The few that I did use were good.  It&#x27;s hard to get the polish off the brushes though.  You really have to soak them in remover for a long time after to clean them.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good just make sure to wash them before use.&lt;br /&gt;I only received 1 fan brush, which isn&#x27;t as wide as pictured, &amp; a dot pen...?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever. They&#x27;re good for the time being.</li>
            <li> They are good for a cheap set, but they are quick to be ruined and thy don&#x27;t wash out at all.</li>
            <li> well if you&#x27;re doing designs these are amazing i would definitely buy this product again. Although i did have one minor problem which is when i took of the cap that protects the bristles. The metal part and up came off,but i was able to put it together again</li>
            <li> This product is a good one for a penny but the shipping is 5 per brush set! RIP OFF! Not worth it</li>
            <li> Good brushes at a remarkable price....worth the wait.  I&#x27;m glad I gave them a try.</li>
            <li> Works well. Their good nail art tools. It&#x27;s just what I expected. I am completely satisfied with this product. Just Awesome!</li>
            <li> They were a gift, and the recipient really likes them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too early to tell how they&#x27;ll last...but this large set was quite a bargain!</li>
            <li> Brushes came in early!!! :) Great and happy I bought them so cheap. Worth the wait. There are so many choices. Came in its own packaging. Perfect!</li>
            <li> I just love my new brushes. They are exactly as described. They are good brushes for the money. Very happy with my purchase!!!</li>
            <li> this pack of several brushes can be used in many ways. you have your fan brushes, swirl brush, also dot brush. whatever your desire to create on nails you will find it in this set. my customers love the fact i have many brushes to select from to service their needs.</li>
            <li> Good value. Shipped quickly</li>
            <li> The metal part came off from most of them. I had to re-glue it back together.</li>
            <li> U have given me the tools to do my nails like I&#x27;ve been doing it for years.  I now have others asking me to do their nails as well. I will definitely be interested in purchasing from you again.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t as cheap as I thought they would be and they worked fine I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> My 9 yr old loves it and thinks I&#x27;m the coolest mom ever for all the amazing things we can do to her nails!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m astounded at the price for this kit.  I haven&#x27;t had it a long time, so I can&#x27;t yet attest to the long term quality of the brushes, but I&#x27;m an artist who paints very small details and these fit the bill.  As brushes go, you can&#x27;t beat the price. On price alone, I would recommend trying this kit if you need a variety of tiny brushes for any application.</li>
            <li> I like the brushes and there are many different sizes to chose from. I would recommend buying this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> The handles are much longer than I was expecting and it takes a LONG time to get these, but there are many of them, designed to do different things, so just handy to have -- can certainly use them for other delicate painting also!</li>
            <li> Cheaply made! The bristles come out on the nail! And the whole brush head comes right off...</li>
            <li> These are okay - definitely get what you pay for. The paint for the handles was coming off before they even got to me.</li>
            <li> I love this item. They are so useful and neat. Seller is so good. Love this item and I will buy another set for my friend as a gift.</li>
            <li> I like the set its a nice variety but one of my brushes is missing the whole silver part with the bristles on so I got jepted a brush cuase obvously I can&#x27;t use a brush with no bristles attached and  it came in the mail that way :/</li>
            <li> Great brushes great price will recommend this product to friends I used the brushes for nail art very easy to handle and small enough to make nail master pieces loved it .</li>
            <li> I picked the 5 Star because the product was first of all: nicely packed, perfect condition, and MOST important of all it arrived home so Fast!!! The delivery date was between April 9 &amp; 30, but I actually received my item yesterday 4/2/2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product, and specially the seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now back to work on my nails :D</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered, nice collection of brushes. Can&#x27;t think of anything else you would need to complete the job.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for this price, I just wanted a cheap nail art brush set so I could get more creative with my nails. But I was pleasantly surprised to find that these are pretty good quality. They come in a flimsy little plastic pouch, but I&#x27;m okay with that. The brushes themselves are sturdy and soft-bristled.</li>
            <li> JUST LIKE THE TOOLS THAT THE NAIL TECHNICIAN USES IN THE NAIL SALON. VERY GOOD FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE DOING HER OWN NAILS.</li>
            <li> Loved it. Just had to wait a very long time to get it.</li>
            <li> Great variety of brushes</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good considering the price. I did have one brush that started to split on the handle, but otherwise the rest are in good condition. I&#x27;ve used them multiple and cleaned them and haven&#x27;t had any issue with bristles coming out or anything like that.</li>
            <li> These brushes are exactly what I expected them to be. They are of good quality, and there&#x27;s two of each brush, except for the dotting tool. Definitely a good purchase.</li>
            <li> i can not wait to use these they dont seem cheap and great deal thank you! i will be back</li>
            <li> Even came with a dotting tool that I wasn&#x27;t expecting! They took a whole to get here but I&#x27;m very happy with them :)</li>
            <li> Perfect.. exactly what I wanted it.. even tho there was one broken!! But its ok, I kinda fixed it...... thsnks</li>
            <li> First, I want to say these brushes are good for the price I paid. The top of the pocket case was scrunched up when I received it out of the envelope package. Not pleased about that. One brush was scrunched and ruined. I think water will fix it. Other than that, these are good brushes. About delivery time: I placed my order on the 28th of April and received them on May 10th.  I live in California, US., and these brushes came from Hong Kong. I received them weeks before delivery time.</li>
            <li> Well, where should I start? These are pretty good nail tools, the only downfall is they fall apart easy.. So just glue them on and they&#x27;re good!</li>
            <li> This is a great little set of brushes for an amazingly low price.&lt;br /&gt;Best brush bargain I have found anywhere!</li>
            <li> Plenty to experiment with! My favorite is the small detail brush. Easy to work with and draws to my expectation.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a package post marked from China as a Free gift cell phone case.  Unsure of what it was, I opened it outside my home, nearly threw it out.  I guess that labeling it this way they dont have to pay for postage.  Have not used them, but they are as they look, and for the cost it is worth it.</li>
            <li> These are my first set of brushes I&#x27;ve purchased, but for the price they&#x27;re asking for, these are perfect. I don&#x27;t use all of them and customized some of the small brushes by cutting them down even more, but they&#x27;re quite useful in doing intricate designs on my nails.</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes are soft but it works well.</li>
            <li> These are literally perfect. The sizes, options, price...everything about these is wonderful. Worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I love it, so cute, easy to grab... its useful for what i do :)&lt;br /&gt;Yes, i would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Some brushes arrived broken.  Shi0pint took forever!  I didn&#x27;t realize they were coming from China.  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> the item came really early and in perfect condition they work great I couldn&#x27;t get this deal in a store if I tried I&#x27;d give a ten star rating if I could if you&#x27;re into nail art or any painting get them</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this item but I was very disappointed because even after soaking the brushes, the bristles are hard therefore, very hard to work with.</li>
            <li> I love these. I can&#x27;t beleive i got so many for so cheap. work great for nail  art. i love themmm!!</li>
            <li> I have a small craft business and I used them to paint signs with. I needed them for detailing and they do the trick. The brush themselves are good quality but sometimes the metal piece will detach from the wooden handle but nothing some wood glue or hot glue won&#x27;t fix. I&#x27;ve only had that problem a few times and this is the second set I&#x27;ve had just because I like them so much.</li>
            <li> Prefect set good price</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes. Only drawback was the fact that it came from out of the country so a lil bit longer on delivery time. Otherwise, great pieces.</li>
            <li> GREAT DEAL FOR THE PRICE, I HAVEN&#x27;T TRIED TO USE ANY POLISH REMOVER TO CLEAN THEM YET THOUGH :-) STILL WORTH THE PRICE</li>
            <li> My item never arrived. Very disappointed. Not surprised, but very disappointed. That&#x27;s what you get for looking for the cheapest price.</li>
            <li> Like all the different brushes. Could not have gotten a greater deal for the price I paid. Several duplicates, but they work great.</li>
            <li> Use these for fine detail on face painting. Work really well. Would be good for any craft/hobby where fine detail is needed.</li>
            <li> does what it suppose to. Good product for the price. For the price I have rated it 5 star product.</li>
            <li> My product came in a clear pouch that was damaged upon arrival. Also, one of the brushes have a dent in the silver aluminum part and 2 of the small brushed didn&#x27;t come with a protected cover on them like the others did. All in all the product was fine besides these problems. My daughter didn&#x27;t care too much about returning them so I&#x27;m just keeping them but I do wish it would have came undamaged.</li>
            <li> I use these mostly for detail work on my paintings, they do the job very well.</li>
            <li> Nice quality and varied sizes, and shapes.</li>
            <li> You get so many nice quality brushes for a low price. Shipping is slow but it&#x27;s worth it. Great tool for any nail artist.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for nails but I am not sure what to do with such a wide variety. What am I supposed to do with the two fan brushes? Why do I have a curved brush? Why does several of my brushed look like they can be used for make up? As with everything I have, I will eventually find a use for the ones I do not use.</li>
            <li> Love all the brushes and sizes ONLY a tiny issue when u put them in nail polish remover the white paint comes off and the glue that attached to the brush loosens the brush. But super glue can fix that</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift and the recipient absolutely LOVES it! With so many options she&#x27;s found new ways to design nails and be as artistic as her heart desires. Perfect for anyone who likes doing nails.</li>
            <li> No, they are not top quality but for scale model builders they are a great choice and you don&#x27;t have to fret when you ruin one as they are not expensive.</li>
            <li> I have only used about 5 of these brushes, considering some of them can&#x27;t even really be used for nail art unless you get really creative, I guess. They&#x27;re alright, and get the job done. A bit hard to clean, but what brushes aren&#x27;t. They arrived in good condition though.</li>
            <li> It came a week late. When I finally got them some of the brush tips came off and they were attached at an angel. The brissels feel out too</li>
            <li> What a great bunch of brushes for my growing art tools. I enjoy playing with them every chance I get</li>
            <li> Pleased customer. The brushes are made of a fine brush all the way to a thicker brush with many variations in between. I use them for nail art and many other craft type projects.</li>
            <li> They are cheap brushes but they work. I would suggest a little trimming before use so you wont have small lines where you dont want them. Also keep the white painted handles away from polish remover as it eats it right off.</li>
            <li> Some many selections out of this set! I love the thin brush it is perfect for intricate designs. This is a great deal</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with nail art brushes, but this was an awesome buy to start with. I was able to do more than I could ever imagine with this set, and its worth it just to use for manicure clean-up.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother. These are garbage. Used mine once and they are falling apart.</li>
            <li> she was happy to get the gift but has yet to try it.</li>
            <li> I loved this item it works really well. The brushes were rough though but I fixed them so thank you</li>
            <li> Very happy with the quick delivery and quality of the items within the package. The brushes were spectacular and fit my purpose well. I use them for art related painting.</li>
            <li> Works the way they&#x27;re supposed to. Recomend this for anyone that wants to try new designs on their nails! And good quality</li>
            <li> I thought the really tiny flatter brushes would be more precise when I tried to draw skinny lines on my nails but they don&#x27;t really work that well. Maybe it just takes practice, I&#x27;m kind of new to designing nails so I&#x27;m sure for a professional these would work perfect.</li>
            <li> Great products. Exactly what I was looking for at a great price. I love the variety of precision brushes that help make my nail art easy to do.</li>
            <li> many of the brush heads were off when they arrived, I easily glued them, but obviously I would have preferred a product that wasn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> Arrived in good time, this set is better made than I had expected for the price. wide selection of brushes, I haven&#x27;t used all of them yet but so far they are holding up with good points after several uses.</li>
            <li> This was the 2nd set I ordered. Very good brushes at an excellent price!  My nail designs have gotten better thanks to these brushes!</li>
            <li> Finally my brushes arrived and I love them! Very well made and arrived a bit late but came with a nice plastic pouch! Only one of the tips came off so I put a drop of super glue gel on the wood and pressed it back together! All perfect! I use mine with acrylic paints to paint figurines and on wooden signs and ceramic gnomes etc... Plus nail details! Great buy! I suggest giving each one a tug to check for the fit and if any heads come off just a dot of super gel glue works great( Dollar Tree) !!! Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I ordered this set specifically for the large brush pictured and it didn&#x27;t come with it. I wouldn&#x27;t have order this if I knew that brush didn&#x27;t come with it. Not super happy, but otherwise everything came as expected.</li>
            <li> Let me start off with the&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-CHEAP in material&lt;br /&gt;-They don&#x27;t even paint your nails at all, I think they&#x27;re made for makeup use or something. NOT for nail polish. I&#x27;d rather use the original Nailpolish brush than these.&lt;br /&gt;-The paint on the brush handle comes off with acetone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Came in on time&lt;br /&gt;-Good packaging&lt;br /&gt;-Nothing was missing, looked neat</li>
            <li> 15 pcs of good brushes, very good quality and they do their job! Easy to clean and the price is very fair. Even for amateurs or new in the nail business is easy to use. Good luck!</li>
            <li> Took awhile to arrive. But since it was free shipping and came from China it was still worth the wait. Brushes are each covered with their own plastic piece which is nice. I find they are a little difficult to clean. Regular nail polish remover doesn&#x27;t work well and %100 acetone obviously strips the paint. There are a few doubles as shown in the picture which is nice as a &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34;. Overall a great selection and totally worth the few bucks!</li>
            <li> Although these were advertised  for nail art use, I purchased these to do fine detail work in my paintings.  Love the set--very good quality.  Arrived much sooner than expected</li>
            <li> These are decent brushes but when I opened them 2 of my brushes were falling off of the handle part. There kinda hard to clean too.</li>
            <li> I got these because I am just getting into nail art. These have been perfect. They didn&#x27;t cost much so I would not be upset if one got messed up, lost, or broken. They work perfectly and I love the little pouch to keep them organized.</li>
            <li> The product arrived promptly but some items fell apart just as quickly. The items are cheaply made. You get what you pay for. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> For the most art these nail art brushes are really nice, a few of them are really hard, and it takes a while to break them in. Overall, I was pleased.</li>
            <li> Product was just as stated in the ad. I would purchase again if needed. The items met my expectations completely</li>
            <li> My friend was very excited and she said that her teacher said this item was a very good product. I will buy again. Thank you once again.</li>
            <li> It took a while for me to receive my brushes in the mail, but they were worth the wait.  They apply nail polish smoothly and they clean up easily with nail polish thinner. My favorite thing about them is the variety of shapes and sizes!!!</li>
            <li> these are not professional brushes. They&#x27;re only good if you want them for beginners the brushes are not thin enough to do some designs so you have to cut some bristles. When you hold any brush you can tell it&#x27;s super cheap stuff and you can take them apart. They don&#x27;t deserve a 4star rating.</li>
            <li> Great for nails and other art work.  Thats all I have to say about that. Thats all I have to say about that.</li>
            <li> these are great /just as good as the very expensive ones&lt;br /&gt; - I don&#x27;t paint nails - I paints dogs - collies specifically to donate to rescues for their fundraisers. I have been painting collie pictures on small shells for a project this summer - LOVE these brushes I use acrylic, sometimes water color (on paper).&lt;br /&gt;Just shared this seller with friends who do art with kids in Children&#x27;s hospital  - they are estatic</li>
            <li> What a great array of brushes for different strokes. Should have ordered more at this price.  Great for arts and crafts too.</li>
            <li> Not a bad set of brushes</li>
            <li> I bought these for myself, but I found that they work much better for acrylic painting more than nail art. Still, they are very cute and high quality paintbrushes.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved these! They have such a variety of tips to choose from! Good quality and lots of fun for nail art!</li>
            <li> I bought this 15-piece brush set to use for art projects. There are 15 decently-made tiny brushes in this set, for a very low price. This was a great deal.</li>
            <li> That was just how they look in the picture, i like it and for a cheap price, and they came in excellent conditions...</li>
            <li> I like them but the top pieces keep detaching from the stick.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I hoped for as a newbie to nailart. Lots of fabulous options!</li>
            <li> Amazing pricing on these brushes. I like the variety, excited to do some nail artwork. Hopefully they look good. thanks</li>
            <li> I love these brushes they are exactly what they look like in the picture and they all came in a little pouch too for easy storage. I used them the first day i got them.</li>
            <li> Great for the price I paid for them! I ordered an extra set for my younger cousin who is barely getting into nail art.</li>
            <li> These are great if you&#x27;re just starting out with nail art brushes. They&#x27;re cheap, but sturdy. Come in an array of shapes and as long as you educate yourself on what each ones purpose is then you&#x27;ll do great with them.</li>
            <li> I though i was gona get cheap material but this product is awesome it works perfect it gets clean easy and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> These suck they are just paintbrushes</li>
            <li> Placed my order November 5, 2013. Delivery window was Dec. 3-19, 2013. NEVER RECEIVED IT. I patiently waited until last minute of the last day stated on order and NOTHING. I emailed seller, but I will assume I will not get a response since others stated the same. Thankfully I only paid $1.97 for my item and I purchased other items as a Christmas gift for this family member, so no major loss although I was excited for it. I will be putting in a claim shortly so Amazon stops all accounts with this seller. Poor business. Beware. Gave it one star because I had to put something up.</li>
            <li> Great stuff very useful but the delivery is completely not good it takes about 8 weeks to get it that&#x27;s the only reason I give 1 stars otherwise I would totally give 4</li>
            <li> Arrived early and just as described online.</li>
            <li> The brushes fell apart as soon as I started using them.</li>
            <li> Great product considering the price!</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of using the brushes they are a lot of fun.  I&#x27;ve done several seasonal designs and everyone thinks I got my nails done at the salon.</li>
            <li> I was expecting them to be cheap and fall apart when I tried to use or clean them, But they  have held up pretty well. Over all I am really pleased with them!</li>
            <li> For the price of these I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much.  Thankfully, this was one of the times when I was surprised.  For the price (worth much more) you won&#x27;t do better.  Really!</li>
            <li> This took a long time receive. I thought there was more than one tool that made dots.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, good product</li>
            <li> Bought these tools a while ago and they are very useful. I do nails for the ladies in my family Using these brushes and they help a lot. Try it if you like nail art.</li>
            <li> Some of the brush tips have fallen off, but it is easy enough to glue them back on. I will probably be buying myself another set of these soon. They are the perfect size and variety for creative manicures.</li>
            <li> I love these Nail Art Painting Pen Brust they are easy to use compared on the toothpick .These painting pen has smooth brust they are easy to use,and now I can make different designs on my nails everyday.</li>
            <li> This kit is really efficient and cool. The pencils come in a pretty envelope. They come diferent sizes. I like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this nail art painting pack because I wanted to learn how do do my nails so that they would look stunning. I have learned how to use these pens, but I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m the best. These are well-made and I think that they will last me for a while :)</li>
            <li> The tips of the brushes fall off the sticks so make sure you have some glue handy to slip them back on. Nice set for the price though.</li>
            <li> have not used this yet</li>
            <li> I love the different brushes. It helps create different designs. I love it because i am able to create works of art with them.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very good , but the heads of them seem to constantly fall off at the slightest touch . It is just a hassle to try and put them back on everytime you want to use them.</li>
            <li> I use some of these brushes weekly for painting anchors and hearts on my and my daughters&#x27; nails. Although some of the brushes don&#x27;t seem practical at all, some are incredible! Worth the money. (and the ridiculously long wait...)</li>
            <li> I give this 5 stars because there are no hair fall out. it does smell a little, but i usually wash everything i receive. besides that everything was awesome.</li>
            <li> I think that the quantity of the product for the price was great but a few of the heads came off after one use. I thought they were more sturdy but dor the price I guess I cant complain.</li>
            <li> Everything in that picture you get! It&#x27;s awesome and it came really fast! A month ahead of my delivery estimation date! (Since it was coming from China)</li>
            <li> Nice brushes. I mostly use the small synthetic brushes to clean the sides of my nails with polish remover it works perfectly for that! Haven&#x27;t used every single brush yet. The striper brush gives me a little difficulty but overall the product is good.</li>
            <li> These tools are great for a starter nail artist! Yes, they are cheap and some came a bit too frayed to use very well, but you get what you pay for. You can see the art I&#x27;ve tried with mine at my Instagram account @nails7615</li>
            <li> These are terrific, and a really great price.  They work exactly as they are supposed to and help you make great designs!</li>
            <li> Great!! Items will make a wonderful christmas gift this year for my niece! Would purchase from again in the future!</li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter has become a professional nail artist ever since she starting using these little nail brushes.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, my daughter uses them constantly. They are inexpensive and they are not cheaply made. My daughter has used them frequently without problems</li>
            <li> When the package arrived at my house, the little bag containing the brushes was pretty damaged, but the brushes themselves were in perfect condition so I&#x27;m not complaining, especially since this had a bumpy ride from Hong Kong all the way to here (at least my package said it was from HK).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush bristles are the perfect size for drawing various designs, and I was very happy the worked like I hoped. This is the first time I&#x27;ve actually used art brushes instead of toothpicks or whatnot, and it&#x27;s much easier to draw with in my opinion. I also liked how they included a small dotting tool into the mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The area where the wood and metal of the brushes connect aren&#x27;t glued together very tightly, but this can be fixed very easily with some extra glue or tape on your own hand. The brushes worked well enough, and I was happy with what I got since I paid such a low price for these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So excited I have these now; I&#x27;ll be messing around with my polishes for quite a while.</li>
            <li> They look pretty much the same but they seem a little fragile. I am  giving them as a gift so I plan to make them look a little more fancy than they are.</li>
            <li> The brushes are pretty standard and basic.  I&#x27;m sure once I learn how to fully use them, I could have more of an opinion of them. They didn&#x27;t come the during the time that they were supposed to. I contacted the seller to let them know the issue. They promised to ship out another set, and they arrived within two weeks. Two thumbs up for the great communication for the seller!</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with my purchase! I would totally recommend this 15 piece nail art set. I use them every day :)</li>
            <li> I am happy with these nail brushes.  One of them was a little bent when I received it, but it was nothing that was too problematic.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. . I use them for my nail art.  They are perfect for them, and they were so cheap!</li>
            <li> These were bought as stocking stuffers for teen girls and they were a huge hit. We split the pack into three stockings easily with plenty of brushes for each girl to go crazy with.</li>
            <li> Good quality, nice array of brushes to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;Very useful for other art work.  Highly recommend these&lt;br /&gt;brushes for anyone!</li>
            <li> Unbelievable that I could purchase these for the price they are.  They are beautiful brushes.  Made for nail art, but I am using them to paint glassware.  I have tried so hard to find really fine brushes and haven&#x27;t been successful, until now!  Sending this link to my friends who are also artists.  thank you so much!  Just perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> Received it yesterday and was very happy because I used it the same day brushes do look cheap but does a expensive job!</li>
            <li> Great set for a beginner like me, very precise lines and fans are awesome. They Paint well and clean up well.</li>
            <li> I got these brushes for my daughter for Christmas.  She loves them.  We are able to do so much with them when having fun designing her nails and mine.  Makes nail are more fun.</li>
            <li> The brushes were so helpful the only thing that I didn&#x27;t like was it took so long to get them.</li>
            <li> These are okay but they are hard to clean they work really well though i love them though i  reccomend them</li>
            <li> Poor quality.  Came apart too easily.</li>
            <li> brushes easily fall off stick</li>
            <li> One of the brushes was broke</li>
            <li> Nice small brushes. I would have given a 5 star rating except some of them were loose from the wooden handle, and I had to put a drop of superglue in them to make them usable.</li>
            <li> What was shown on the picture of this ebay listing is what was delivered. I must warn you, the fan brushes are not wide. Arrived on time and undamaged. All brushes have plastic protectors over the hair.</li>
            <li> These brushes arrived within a week &amp; I am very happy with the quality for the money. Only one brush was slightly bent but still usable. I really didn&#x27;t expect them to be as good since they were so cheap but they exceeded my expectations I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very cost efficient, and good quality.  I do lots of nail art and haven&#x27;t had any issues.  There is a great variety of shapes and sizes with these brushes and I&#x27;ve not had any quality issues.</li>
            <li> I liked these. Very good variety of shapes and sizes. Had to taper a few to make them exactly how I wanted but that&#x27;s to be expected. All in all, a good product.</li>
            <li> Great Price! Good brushes.</li>
            <li> Went to use them for the first time and they fell apart ....</li>
            <li> Decent product for the price.  I got a 2nd set as a gift.  The brushes seem fine for the price.</li>
            <li> They are great except that they aren&#x27;t put together very well..  They come apart very easily.  And they aren&#x27;t clear coated so the paint is coming off them already..  But the brushes are nice and do their job.  :)</li>
            <li> nail polish would not wash out and im pretty sure they are just paint brushes. never buying again. i threw them away</li>
            <li> The package was missing a brush, other than that the brushes were packaged properly and were all new like listed</li>
            <li> Does not work with nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t control the strokes.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it will work better with acrylic paint.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed.</li>
            <li> It took over a month to get them, and when I did the orange brush tip was messed up and wouldn&#x27;t go back to normal.  And all the tips come off the handle.</li>
            <li> Loved this product!!! Easy to use!! The brushes are great and smooth on the nail! Love the dotting tool so much !</li>
            <li> My brushes just arrived, earlier than expected so that was a plus and they were what I expected except I was shorted 2 brushes!! I mean seriously I know that they didn&#x27;t cost me that much, but can I get what I paid for!</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes came off stick during first use.</li>
            <li> They fall apart really easily</li>
            <li> Not only are these brushes great for nails, but i use them for my makeup as well. The thing brushes are great for eyeliner, all i had to do was trim them a bit and i was good to go! And you really can&#x27;t beat the price. I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> Such a wide variety of brushes! I wish the thin ones were even thinner to allow for more smaller detailed designs, but that&#x27;s my only complaint. Otherwise the quality is very good.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very nice but some of mine are damaged. One of them seem to be used! Yes used. It looks like glue is all over it or its scratched I&#x27;m not sure. Not all of them had the little plastic caps, but that&#x27;s no biggie. But also, one if my brushes are bent.</li>
            <li> Items arrived quickly and were well packaged to prevent any damage. I was initially worried that the quality of the product would be poor due to the low price but I was pleasantly surprised.I have used many of the brushes several times and haven&#x27;t had any issues with shedding brushes.</li>
            <li> brushes are very cheap</li>
            <li> This was a very good product the brushes have been a great help with working on nails.  Love these brushes.</li>
            <li> My daughter is very happy with this items. She has been using them alot and no problems what so ever. great quality</li>
            <li> The only problem I had with this set was I had to super glue some of the heads back on. Otherwise it was worth the money I paid for it and I also bought my friend a set for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself. Great set. It comes with all kinds of different tips, so you can do all kinds of designs!</li>
            <li> good product, i use one of the brush as lip brush it&#x27;s affordable and cute and comes with a white mini package that keeps the brush clean. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Low quality brushes. They take forever to get to you, and they send you multiples of the same thing. They fall apart after a few uses. Find better brushes elsewhere, its a waste of money.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these.  It is the best deal out there.  Better than the Sephora 2 pack I bought for $10.</li>
            <li> I like having these brushes on hand for crafts. I use them for cleaning my keyboard too.  The price was right, delivered to my door always makes me smile.  Nail Art is not my thing but I can see how making dots and swirls would be easy with these brushes.</li>
            <li> I like how the brushes handle. I&#x27;m able to get whatever detail work that I want done. The paint on the brushes handle chips very easily though. But for a cheap set of brushes, I think they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li> The brushed have since come out of their holders and fray easily. I have purchased more brushes from a local store. This product took weeks to come, and was definitely not worth the wait.</li>
            <li> the heads fall off better buy a glue gun while your at it for these products but that&#x27;s what you get for the price I suppose</li>
            <li> Good quality, fast shipping</li>
            <li> Brushes. Everybody get their brushes at the lowest price. Heck a lot cheaper and better quality than the crap at Walmart.</li>
            <li> the brushes are smaller than I thought but they do the job.&lt;br /&gt;my granddaughter does all kinds of design&lt;br /&gt;on her fingers and toes.she thinks there</li>
            <li> I have used about 6 brushes out of this package and all seem to be a very good quality for the price.  I dont see them lasting in an actual salon, but for personal use they work perfectly.</li>
            <li> I finally recived the brushes and they came in 26 days as a pose to 28..so cool I guess. But I was disapointed to see that I got 2 of the same brush and not the fine striping brush I wanted. Oh well you get what you pay for and good thing I have others. Cant wait to use them they look like look pretty good...for a beginer.</li>
            <li> This item came faster then the date  . So far I used them twice , they were able to help me do new designs . The only problem is cleaning them , I&#x27;m unsure how and I don&#x27;t want to ruin them .</li>
            <li> I bought these products, and for the price I paid I was afraid they were going to fall apart. But surprisingly they worked amazingly. The only thing I have against these is that some of the brushes are really stiff so its hard to create nail art with some of the brushes. I would recommend these but to someone who needed a nail set that couldn&#x27;t spend a lot of money for it but if you had money for a better set then I suggest getting a different set.</li>
            <li> For the price these are not that bad, two of the brushes were broken. But I can get over that since they were relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Very happy with these. This is my first set and the quality is good, but the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> This set of brushes has a great variety of shapes and sizes.  They look to be of a decent quality and you really cannot beat the price.  Coud be used for many more applications than nail painting.</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes especially for the price.  They are exactly what I was looking for to add designs to my nails.  They work very well with no loss of bristles like other brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Got these for art work - nice set of small brushes for fine work! Can&#x27;t wait to use them!(Bought for friend as well.)</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made. I understand they were only a few dollars, but honestly don&#x27;t waste your money. The brushes have paint on the handles and if you have nail polish remover on your hands the paint from the brush handles end up all over your hands. It has ruined my nails on numerous occasions. Honestly just spend the money and get good brushes.</li>
            <li> they were nice but didn&#x27;t come in handy. Save your money and just use a toothpick. only buy it if you know you will use it.</li>
            <li> my grand daughter liked it. She is in to nail art and loves any thing to so with nails. thanks</li>
            <li> Well it was only Two dollars so i didn,t expect much it took 2 months to get to me and the brushes were not put on securely or straight.</li>
            <li> I was excited to use the brushes and the first time I used one, the pieces fell apart!  This was not worth all the wait.</li>
            <li> I got these because they were recommended, but they were disappointing. The bristles were already hard and clumped together and the metal part that connects to the bristles to the handle often came off.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten a chance to use these brushes yet, but I can&#x27;t wait. They arrived on time and everything has a plastic cover so none of the brushes were messed up. The fan brushes don&#x27;t come with a plastic protector but they were still perfect. I will definitely buy from them again.</li>
            <li> Since buying this kit - It hasn&#x27;t fail me to disappointed. My husband, 2 girls and myself really love this. We were able to craft our pictures such as minions, cupcakes, shamrocks, valentine, and more. Amazing to have!</li>
            <li> They are not too fun to clean but they work fantastic. Very helpful with nail art designs. I would definitely recommend,</li>
            <li> This was a great price for all the brushes that came in this set.  The quality of the brushes seems to be good as I just received them and haven&#x27;t tried them yet.  The plastic covers seem a little low quality but I believe the brushes will definitely fit the bill and again at a great price.  Shipping was very quick and I am very happy so far with the product.  ...will update later.</li>
            <li> So yes, these are very cheap brushes, they do break, most came off of the wood handles. But what do you expect for them being so cheap. They came really fast and the brush part still works lol</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price, but some of the paintbrushes did start to fall apart. Nothing a little glue can&#x27;t fix, but it was still a little annoying. You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> i ordered these for my artist child ok 24 year old. she loves using these brushes on her easle. great quality</li>
            <li> They broke before i even opened the box. i know they&#x27;re cheap, but not worth it. they such so much</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t find a decent set of brushes for such a low price.  I will use these for nail art as well as acrylic paintings.</li>
            <li> This set it&#x27;s better than I thought and meet all my expectation. Great quality for the price and arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Not a bad deal for the price.  A few brushes were slightly bent in the shipping I assume, but they did come all the way from China.  The bristles are very fine and ideal from detailed work such as nail art.  Looking forward to using them</li>
            <li> These brushes are so easy to use, I love them! You can do so many designs with them. Also, the brushes work just as good with nail pOlish as they do with acrylic paint. All you need to do to clean these brushes is pure acetone! I absolutely love thes brushes. If you&#x27;re considering to buy these, do it! You can do so many designs with these brushes. Also they packing was in great quality and they came weeks before they were supposed to! These are a great buy at great price!</li>
            <li> still haven&#x27;t figured out how to use this stuff with nail polish, but hopefully i&#x27;ll figure something out.. i should probably youtube it</li>
            <li> VARIETY OF STYLES MAKE IT EASY TO USE FOR ANY PROJECT, NOT ONLY NAILS BUT ANY SMALL PAINTING YOU HAVE IN MIND, AS LONG AS YOU ALWAYS CLEAN THEM GOOD YOU HAVE WONDERFUL TOOLS... FAST SHIPPING.</li>
            <li> these were a steal! i cant believe how many brushes you get for the price and they are nice brushes!</li>
            <li> very nice brushes for detail work ...i paint on canvas wanted a set of tiny brushes ...these are perfect thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, and got here in decent time....but the brushes are already fraying. Maybe I was a bit rough on them....</li>
            <li> They feel very cheap and didn&#x27;t last after the first use. The paint chipped and the brushes I used fell apart.</li>
            <li> good product, high quality, and great for makeup application too.</li>
            <li> Love all the different brushes, and dotting tool, did have to glue the tops on a few, but they still arrived in a timely manner.  Thanks</li>
            <li> So much fun.  Love them. Everything I wanted and more!</li>
            <li> Bad! Brushes began to fall apart 2nd time I used them to clean the nail polish out! Wish I can give it 0 stars!</li>
            <li> The product is just okay for me. The packaging is not that grand but the product serve its purpose.</li>
            <li> The metal part fell off some of my brushes but the rest were okay. They weren&#x27;t that bad. I just glued the piece on.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable price in my contry</li>
            <li> Love the large selection there is!! Great for many different styles of nails!</li>
            <li> Like then. ,but have not use then yet</li>
            <li> Item as described and shipped in a timely manner, thank you.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used these yet but when they arrived they had a very strong chemical odor.</li>
            <li> Excelente el articulo me llego en buen estado y funciona a la perfección!</li>
            <li> The quality of these brushes are very good, they are very soft and precise on the lines used while painting</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes like the two fan ones...how do you use it? No ones nails are that large anyway. But whatever why am I complaining it comes with so many brushes that I don&#x27;t even know how to use.</li>
            <li> Some of them fell apart but a little hot glue fixed it easily. For the price it&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
            <li> You will not get the product! I have bought the thing and its has been 4 months and I still haven&#x27;t gotten it....</li>
            <li> I do nail art all the time, and this is perfect. the brushes are quality and you can&#x27;t beat the price. you truly cant match this product</li>
            <li> its beautiful ,i love it very much .i havent use it .but i think it well work well. just like it!</li>
            <li> My daughter love her nail art painting. Thank you so much for all the work you put on it to these item get to her. I really appreciate.</li>
            <li> These turned out to be my favorite so I bought another set.  I use them a lot on my fondant cakes, etc.</li>
            <li> These are really nice. I have ordered several more sets.</li>
            <li> I ended up not really using them more than once, but if you dont mind cleaning these pretty roughly after each use, its a good deal. I used them for nail art in black polish and it stained them pretty bad, now they&#x27;re too ugly to use.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush set for under 3 dollars. Good for beginners. Make sure after you use it... clean it property or it will get stiff.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes for the money. They do detail and larger designs. Fun for me and my daughter to play with.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used and even so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m an expert to judge the quality of these brushes.  So I gave a 5.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these! I at least one of them every week if not more. The possibilities are endless with these. I would definitely recommend these for any level nail artist!</li>
            <li> The brushes were cheap so the quality is just as cheap. I pulled one of the fan brushes out of the package and almost all the bristles fell out. The rest of the brushes have decent quality but not really the best. They get the job done but at times you&#x27;ll see bristles falling out in the middle of doing your nail art.</li>
            <li> They feel and look cheap. One broke before I even used them. When I tried to use one to draw a design, it came out very sloppy looking. Brush hairs didn&#x27;t hold their shap/ form very well so they wouldn&#x27;t be good for detailed art on nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was good and I had no issues with the company that sold them, just the quality of the brushes.</li>
            <li> This 15 pc brush (1 dot dabber) set of nail art brushes will allow me to add artistic embellishment to my otherwise decorated cards...&lt;br /&gt;They have further sparked my creativity :-) ... Giving a few for gifts also.  Toni</li>
            <li> This again is for my great niece. Again can&#x27;t give it 5 stars until she actually uses it. But once again thanks for the great deal</li>
            <li> I ordered these for the small details on my paintings.  As long as you clean them they should last, they haven&#x27;t shedded and for under $3.00 usd im happy no matter how long they&#x27;ll last.</li>
            <li> the brushes came really well packed with no problem. easy to clean and use. i am very happy with this product. will recommend this to friends and family.</li>
            <li> These brushes are wonderful!!!!! I use them everyday. Only thing is you have to make sure you clean then really good and lay them out to dry or they will fall apart the next time you try to use them.</li>
            <li> You pay for what u get</li>
            <li> I got these for nail and toe art and they are kinda cheap made. 5 of the tip of the brushes were broke off and I take very good care of all my art needs... I know things happen. I also had a few problems with others but as far as the seller... GREAT!! I can see me coming back too shop with you but lets check them brushes and make it a team thing to make your sells grow and I don&#x27;t mind helping out... :)  Sorry it was a bad batch of brushes but lets make them better too have all the nice sells you can have!!</li>
            <li> I do my own nail art.. This nail art brush  is very useful.&lt;br /&gt;came pretty fast. packing was great. Love the nail art brush&lt;br /&gt;Shipping rate is little high.&lt;br /&gt;overall Good product for nail art!</li>
            <li> Great my wife loves it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally inexpensive for the value you obtain for it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a very smart purchase, I hope we can do business in future</li>
            <li> Being so cheap and coming from China I didn&#x27;t expect much... the brushes are nice, but 3 of my striping brushes were bent in the middle (the packaging was folded down creating a crease).. but there are still some useful brushes so this isn&#x27;t a total waste..</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied, a product of bad quality. I put 2 stars for all categories. I have not recommended this product to my friends</li>
            <li> great little product arrived in good time</li>
            <li> These are fun if you like painting designs on your nails. Clean them off with polish remover when done.</li>
            <li> They are exactly as pictured. A few of the brushes were stuck together, but they were easy to separate. They are great for the price.</li>
            <li> These brushes help me put different designs on my nails. It makes my nails look very professional and is not hard to do.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I will repurchase more in the future cause some brushes are hard to clean but not this it so fast to clean and it comes with everything u are going to need.</li>
            <li> I like the nail art brushes but when I got it, one brush was damaged. Would have rated it a five....</li>
            <li> The brushes arrived before scheduled ship date. They were nice quality for the price. I did have to soften the striping brushes a bit. But overall very satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> Some hairs came out but they do their job</li>
            <li> For the price, these brushes are great. However, after continued use the heads of the brushes start to pop right off. Luckily, you can slide them back on, provided they aren&#x27;t caked in nail polish, in which case you should probably clean it first.</li>
            <li> Delivery and condition of product as expected.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine bought the exact same identical set at a beauty supply shop nearby for over 5 times what I paid for these. They are not necessarily professional quality but they are GREAT for home use and even if you feel the need to buy an extra set to have as back up they are still much cheaper than buying them in a shop or salon. Shipping took quite awhile as they were coming from overseas but for the price it was well worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I was really excited about these arriving. When they did, three of my brushes were already broken. These brushes are extremely affordable tho so I suppose you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made. Tip of brush came off handle, I stuck it back on. Will glue on later. You get what you pay for so this is a fair value for what I paid. No complaints, they will serve their intended purpose. When I have had enough practice, I will buy a better set. These are great for kids or beginners looking to practice.</li>
            <li> the brushes are sturdy and the tips are strong and paint smoothly. i love them. be carefull when cleaning them though because the white part of the brush comes off with only a little bit of polish remover. otherwise great</li>
            <li> These Brushes are great when you need them for fine lines, dusting off extra flocking powder, ETC.  I would recommend to a friend. There is a brush for everything you need.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Some I the brushes works and some are Soooo bent up its impossible to use them, a set for under $3 you can&#x27;t expect more then that I guess lol</li>
            <li> The brushes are very nice and it even has a marbling tool. The sleeves don&#x27;t stay on too well but that&#x27;s ok given the price.</li>
            <li> Very nice set of brushes for my daughter.  Nicely packaged in heavy plastic case, brushes well protected and in proper shape on arrival.</li>
            <li> there awesome work great to paint detail on nails and make designs and the fan brush is perfect to dust off glitter</li>
            <li> they work well, and have lasted.</li>
            <li> The worst brushes ever. Half of them were already broken, the rest broke in the middle of use. I would have been better off going to a craft store and picking the brushes I needed. Oh and it took almost two months for them to arrive. Would suggest purchasing.</li>
            <li> Great set at a great price! I use these all the time, not even for nails but for my canvas paintings! Good for more than one purpose!</li>
            <li> I Like the brushes and they are a good value but the customer service was HORRIBLE.  My order got messed up and I caught it right away that when I changed payment type it accidentally ordered two.  I contacted seller immediately (not even 5 min after submitting order) and got this reply:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;if you only need one set, you can send the other set to your friend who need it,&amp;#34;  clearly they are not in the US and don&#x27;t care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you say horrible customer service?  Because of the low price I didn&#x27;t fight it but will never order from this seller again!!!</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loved it</li>
            <li> this is a great product for my sister</li>
            <li> Great brushes. Just what I needed. Thank you. Item looks just like the picture.</li>
            <li> my grand daughters into doing her nails, she got a lot of nail products from amazon this Christmas, She luved them all. now to experiment on her family and friends!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are synthetic therefore continue to lose bristles and forget about using them with nail polish or acetone. For the price, Its a good beginner set if you&#x27;re using acrylic paints only and water.</li>
            <li> These are ok brushes and work very well but I had to re-glue some of the metal pieces back on to the stick, But over all good brushes.</li>
            <li> These just came in the mail today much earlier than estimated which was a wonderful surprise! I went to work right away on some nail designs to try them out and I absolutely LOVE them! I had no problem using them and none of the hairs fell out on me. To be honest I thought it was too good to be true for the price but truly everything exceeded my expectations. I already used them with regular acrylic paint and my makeup. I definitely recommend these for anyone who paints, uses brushes for makeup, and of course does nail art!!</li>
            <li> Not really what I was expecting. The brushs I received were very cheap and didn&#x27;t do what I wanted them to do.</li>
            <li> One of the heads fell off the first time I opened the package but I can&#x27;t really complain since they are so cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional nail person, but I love these brushes, the effects you can make with them are Great!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter as a stocking stuffer, The brushes for the most part are good enough quality, one of the brushes was damaged but not unusable, they were great for the price, I certainly couldn&#x27;t have found anything like this anywhere else for so cheap, I did shop it prior to finding these. My daughter has a great time decorating her and her friends nails.</li>
            <li> Most of the ends have fallen off of the stick portion. one small drop of glue to hold these together makes so much sense. On the very cheap side of quality. I would pass myself</li>
            <li> my daughter loved it and it shipped sooner than we expected</li>
            <li> Please go buy expensive ones if it makes you feel better to scatter money about. I&#x27;ve spent a lot more on brushes that shed strands.  So far these have not.  While shopping online for professional paint brushes I discovered these manicure paint brush sets are inexpensive yet perfect tools for detail work.  I make paper mache figurines with celluclay and these manicure brushes are perfect for adding detail.  I like to take scissors to my paint brushes to tailor the tips for my own quirky way of painting.  I&#x27;d much rather snip away at a paint brush that cost a mere 20 cents each than cut away at a more expensive brush any day.  I ordered a lifetime supply!</li>
            <li> Overall these brushes are a great buy for a great price. They do their job well. I used the brushes today, to mix a few colors together, and they blended smoothly. I will upload the pictures as soon as possible.</li>
            <li> These weren&#x27;t that great at alllllll</li>
            <li> AWESOME DEAL............</li>
            <li> Very useful set!! Love it!</li>
            <li> Good but hard to wash</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought. Not very useful.</li>
            <li> all brushes came and love the quality</li>
            <li> They broke. This was a waste of money</li>
            <li> These seem more like makeup brushes. They don&#x27;t work well for nail designs.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes.  I ordered 3 sets, I think.  They are so good for flower dusting.  Very useful.</li>
            <li> after a while, they all fell a part</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE BRUSHES. They&#x27;ve lasted me quite a while.</li>
            <li> I received these earlier than expected, but when they arrived a few of them were bent fairly bad. :( &amp; of course it&#x27;d be the main ones I wanted..</li>
            <li> Good Quality. Took too long to ship.</li>
            <li> fun for the  for price</li>
            <li> They are wonderful to use , I love them !!!</li>
            <li> This is a fun nail art kit. Very articulate brushes</li>
            <li> Good product, they break easily/fall apart but I just use super glue. Overall, good product</li>
            <li> Awsome brushes love them n came on time !</li>
            <li> Brushes are how they appear, although one did show its quality by coming apart in the package. A little glue fixes it up, but watch what glues you use; Acetone as a solvent could ruin your day :) In short, I&#x27;ve paid more for latest quality.</li>
            <li> These brushes work  good however, when they arrived, I had to super glue the ends back on. They do an OK job but the quality ain&#x27;t great. You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> This is a nice set for the price the quality isn&#x27;t the best though this is ok I guess. Good</li>
            <li> These brushes get the job done. They aren&#x27;t super high quality, but what would you expect for such a low price? Beware though that the paint on the brush handles strips when inserted into acetone to clean the brushes.</li>
            <li> The product came in extremly late but, when it arrived I was very pleased. The only thing I really don&#x27;t like is the brushes seem very brittle.</li>
            <li> This brush set is good but not strong enough to used with arcylic powder with. Need a stronger brush.  Brush painting is just fine</li>
            <li> these are pretty good. except for the fact that some of them came broken.&lt;br /&gt;luckily, the ones that came broken were the ones that i wasn&#x27;t going to use anyway, but either though, they should definitely take care of their products way better.&lt;br /&gt;nevertheless, the brushes work well, and they look beautiful and professional.</li>
            <li> they all came in a thick plastic reusable bag. overall i am happy with them but one of them was bent on the metal part. i was able to bend it back but it night break later on.</li>
            <li> I like the variety, but worried about the cleaning process if the bristles will be damaged over time.  Have cleaned them very very carefully - but for the price, it is easy to replace.</li>
            <li> falling apart. get bristles wet they stick out and dont stay together. get fingernail polish remover on them and the paint comes off. if it wasnt so cheap id send it. but not worth the effort.</li>
            <li> This brushes are perfect for nail art! Such a great price and came in within a reasonable time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Great got them early then expected. One brush came bended but Don&#x27;t mater im happy with the order brushes work great</li>
            <li> please could you tell me how can i clean the brushes please, its very important! thanks. the product is very good to use in art paint.</li>
            <li> My Nail Art Painting Pen Brush arrived as promised and so far I have enjoyed using it and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Nice product fast shipment very impressed love nail art these are perfect for what I do thanks will do business again</li>
            <li> I really thought that they had been worth every penny and they are. Easy to clean as well as to use, the only problem is that on a two brushes is that they stick out, and those do get a bit sloppy, but otherwise they have been fantastic.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to find these on amazon. The product arrived early, I was so excited to start using them. They work great and I love how my nail art designs look when I use the brushes.</li>
            <li> My child is happy now.</li>
            <li> The quality was poor but price was awesome!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves them</li>
            <li> like the range of brushes</li>
            <li> The metal part just comes of so you have tu glue it</li>
            <li> I received makeup brushes instead of nail ones</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just learning how to do nails and this set of nail brushes was exactly what I needed to do the designs I&#x27;m trying to learn next.</li>
            <li> Relatively fast shipping. All in excellent condition and for the price, I couldn&#x27;t pass them up! I am not a pro so I will require practice to do well with them all, but they seem like they will hold up well, if taken care of.</li>
            <li> I love it, it is everything as advertised, I only wish they had larger dotting tools, but for the most part it serves me well</li>
            <li> Im obsessed with this item.It came in PERFECT condition.I super recommend this item if your obsessed on doing nail art.It makes it so much easier to do it.I also want to include that it came way earlier than it was told to come!</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;d paid anything substantial for these I probably would have returned or even given less stars, however in the grand scheme of things even with the lengthy shipping and a couple of brushes arriving broken they are ok :)</li>
            <li> These were very inexpensive brushes so I cannot complain.  The quality was okay but the shipping was a little slow.  Still, no complaints.  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Nice brush set.  Good variety.  It arrived quickly and as advertised.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> For the price, I&#x27;m pretty happy with what I got. Because they were pretty cheap I don&#x27;t worry about ruining them, and I plan on trimming some brushes for a finer point. Took a really long time to get to me.</li>
            <li> all the pieces came, i use them often and they haven&#x27;t worn out. this is great for beginning nail art enthusiasts.</li>
            <li> The brushes are just like in the picture. I can&#x27;t wait to put them to use. If you are Artist this is a great deal.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of nail art and for the price, they&#x27;re good.  I Would buy these brushes again in the future.</li>
            <li> Good set of brushes for the price</li>
            <li> It is as shown. I haven&#x27;t used them much on my nails. I have tried but maybe I am just not good with them yet but so far there just okay.</li>
            <li> The shipping time was a little bit of a wait, but the price more than made up for it.  The brushes are good quality brushes that I have used over and over in doing nail art for my clients.  I love the wide variety for effects that I have with this particular brush set.</li>
            <li> Great great great!! I loved doing my nails. I love doing different designs on my nails. I love the fact that I get to use any kind of brush for all my beautiful different designs on my nails. I love all the brushes, I use all of them.</li>
            <li> these are useful but are cheaply made hence the price. They do work for what u need but it would be good to add some glue to the metal part because it does fall off other than that its good.</li>
            <li> I just love these so much! If you love nails like me, you&#x27;ve gotta have this set!!</li>
            <li> i use this for nail art designs, and it works great. It was well worth the wait for the price and quality.</li>
            <li> Works really well for the price I paid! Haven&#x27;t used all the tools yet but the ones I have used work really well!</li>
            <li> I guess China is pretty far. It was well worth the wait as the brushes are an extreme value and are very nice quality.</li>
            <li> Pencils are simple and like the white material, they do not look cheap. I have seen some tutorials on youtube of how to use them and they all have a particular function. I have use some of those for applying a normal coat of enamel, it works good. The only thing is that my practice is not enough in terms that I cant make very fine lines, which is the number one thing I am looking for.</li>
            <li> Love! Super soft &amp; it came way earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> I have grown up with a mother that does nails, so I prefer the best quality. I love these brushes for the price! And they aware comparable with nail polish removed to take away polish for French tips! I have spend over $15 on one brush to do this job and it doesn&#x27;t work! All 15 for two something?? GREAT! I love them, use them daily when I do my nails! Recommend! But buy two if you don&#x27;t clean them right away they get a little hard to work with! I&#x27;m buying more sets for my dorm, my sisters, and some friends ASAP!!</li>
            <li> Arrived from China in 5 weeks which was still earlier than estimated delivery date. Very happy. Decent quality for starter brushes</li>
            <li> Love all the different sizes and shapes, can do some beautiful art work with these</li>
            <li> These were nice but metal handles were a bit loose. Added a little glue &amp; now the are great. Nice product.</li>
            <li> I ordered two sets of these but did not get the second set. The price is good and I like the brushes but very disappointed that I only got one set and paid for 2 sets!</li>
            <li> My DIL Loved the set as she is just starting to do her Own nails instead of going to a Salon. They are a little flimsy, but are more than worth the price paid for them which was REALLY low. Will order from the Seller again!</li>
            <li> This is a good selection of brushes for nail art or other detailed work. You probably dont need all of them unless you&#x27;re doing some super ornate work. The fan is good for tapping on glitter, and the square for cleaning edges.</li>
            <li> I ended up covering mine with some foil so I could use them. They smell off, like cheap paint and if you hold them enough the smell transfers to your hand. I wrapped aluminum foil around the painted wood and aside from that they are fantastic, lots of sizes, and they make painting your nails a lot easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a beginner with a tight budget these are what you want, just consider repainting these yourself before using them.</li>
            <li> Love this! Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> I got these brushes to use with nail art.  They work very well for that purpose.  I did have a couple bristle fall out, but that is to be expected since they did only cost $2.50.  I cleaned them with nail polish remover and they cleaned up nicely.  I have had them for several months now and they are still going strong.  Well work the price I paid.</li>
            <li> white paint comes off with 1st washing</li>
            <li> Definitely got what I paid for..super cheap, trinkets. If your looking for a product that is going to last, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Came fast in the mail I love it</li>
            <li> Brushes come off sometimes, but overall a good buy!</li>
            <li> Very happy with product and it came earlier than expected. Very happy with seller and will buy again!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much, the brushes are very nice, they came quite quickly.</li>
            <li> You cannot clean these with acetone.  The white paint comes off and ruins everything.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister, she really liked it, they don&#x27;t come apart, she has had them for over a year and they are still in good shape.</li>
            <li> Bad quality. Won&#x27;t absorb polish!</li>
            <li> Im giving this product 2 stars because some of the tips of the brush, the metal parts, would come off the wood. It can be easily fixed with some hot glue.  I only wish the fibers were a little bit stiffer because I used them dipped in polish remover to remove excess polish.</li>
            <li> Excellent product &amp; seller!!!!</li>
            <li> I would no suggest getting this 2 of the brushes were damaged and 4 arrived broken. It is very cheap so you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great product just like the photo</li>
            <li> Good for the price.  Great for beginners.</li>
            <li> The handles are already coming apart for the metal. Spend a little more money and get good brushes</li>
            <li> The nail tools that I have bought are not  good because, the first time you use them the brushes get all crunchy, the tools do not clean, and they are cheap materials.   The tools were on my porch ready to be used. I opened the box ran to get nail polish and started painting. I dipped the new clean soft brush in the polish pulled it out and tried painting. It did not work even with all the paint on it. I tried again, still did not work. I tried cleaning off the paint but it did not come off but the brush was all crunchy. If you love painting nails this product is not good. Using the nail brushes for the first time is Amazing but, when the brushes get all crunchy it’s not fun.  When putting the brushes down to do something and you come back they are dry and crunchy and impossible to use to use again. Do you like having to use crunchy brushes? It’s not fun when you are trying something new. Don’t people like using products more than once? Well after the brushes get used once then you try to clean them off then but the polish does not come off, how disappointing. Starting with a nice crunchy brush is not fun you can’t do what you originally want to do it will be all sloppy and not clean designs. Who want’s cheap materials? Certainly not me! The brushes are made out of thin almost bendy wood, the part connected to the brush is cheap plastic. The brushes are thin and not all even  Even though the brushes get all crunchy, the tools don&#x27;t clean and they are made out of cheap materials, The brushes can be really helpful at making small designs and you want to use real tools and not homemade tools. But if you want better more sturdy tools or clean easy to use brushes DON’T GET THESE ! Save your money to get something pretty.</li>
            <li> Very nice beginners brushes. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> good for the money - the fan brushes are always good to have</li>
            <li> These brushes are perfect for nail art!! It came with so many different kinds that I can do just about anything :) I would definitely recommend these brushes and also the seller (UnitedMail).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice items. Just one of item was banded a little bit. Should pack with more hardy material to prevent this happen.</li>
            <li> Will probably use them for more crafting than nail art. If you need it quick, look somewhere else. It did take almost 30 days.</li>
            <li> This is a nice set to have and worth the price if you&#x27;re really into doing your nails up nicely.</li>
            <li> The end of the brush came off on the first use. Had to use pliers to make sure it didn&#x27;t fall off.</li>
            <li> I love love them I love all the size it that it has I can usu them in all the designs that I what</li>
            <li> Love the brushes. Quality its to bad for the price. Makes my job easier. Price is great and came super fast. I was shocked. I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> the quality for the price is pretty amazing, i don&#x27;t think you can get it anywhere else....it does a really good job cleaning up polishes and putting on designs</li>
            <li> I did not order these for nail art. I actually use them for the fine details in my regular canvas painting. They are great and theyou can&#x27;t beat the price anywhere. They also arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I expected better than this. This is not what i expected it did not work the way i wanted it to</li>
            <li> Were a gift so I rely can&#x27;t review I don&#x27;t know if I would by them again . Shipping was OK. We will try them out this weekend to see how they hold up.</li>
            <li> These took a while to get here but now they are here, I am happy. They have nice tips that hold up well to small design. Clean up well without loosing all the hairs. You can&#x27;t really beat them for the price.</li>
            <li> This was such a good price for a nail art set. The brushes seem to be good quality, and it has all the types of brushes I need for nail art. I&#x27;m really glad I found these. Some of the brushes I probably will never use (like most of the larger ones, besides the fan brushes), but it&#x27;s still nice to have them, I suppose.</li>
            <li> Are the brushes the best you can get?  Nope.  Are they the best you can get at this price?  Probably!</li>
            <li> its a good set for beginners. all brushes are there. took a little long to get here though. its ok.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my nail designs!</li>
            <li> these are great to use if you want to do different designs on your nails. they do come from hong kong so you will want to order them about a month before you want them. they are great and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I purchased the set of 15 brushes and I only received 14 brushes. I saw that in the picture there were 2 fan brushes, the brush that&#x27;s missing in my set is the white fan brush.</li>
            <li> Great!!! Tried them out for the first time, i am no professional which is why i love these brushes. Different sshapesand sizes even tthoughtthey look simila. Whoever designed these did amazing. So much easier than using those nail art design polishes that come wit the basic one size brush. These are just great, im going to order another set for make up, planning on making some fierce eyes.</li>
            <li> Work well but are cheaply made. If you are a serious professional for nails, do not buy these, invest your money into quality brushes.</li>
            <li> Pretty cheap, cheap plastic,  little brush hairs come off. My wife enjoyed the brushes while they lasted I guess.</li>
            <li> From the metal to the wooden part not al the brushes were glued together, but a little super glue fixed it al :)</li>
            <li> GOOD FOR PAINTING NOT FOR NAIL ART&lt;br /&gt;I GAVE THEM AWAY TO MY LITTLE SISTER TO PAINT WITH</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, looks great, can&#x27;t wait for my kids to see them christmas day. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great detail brushes... I was even able to paint a person on my nail! Great!</li>
            <li> Grandaughter having so much fun and she loves these brushes for the nails!</li>
            <li> Nice set of brushes for nail art, I would recommend for anyone looking to buy some brushes for nail art. Good quality too.</li>
            <li> So far I have only used two of my brushes. They have been great for painting tiny stripes for flags on our finger and toenails for the 4th of July.</li>
            <li> The glue that holds the brush to the stick was loose on 2 of the brushes, other than that I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> I like the brush styles because I have been searching for a long time to find these type of nail brushes. When I opened the package, one of my brushes was bent. Three of the other brushes came apart at the silver connecting piece so I had to tape them together. I like the brushes, I just don&#x27;t like the fact that the main brushes I use are partially put together.</li>
            <li> They arrived sooner than I thought. Pretty good brushes. Was concerned about quality with such a low price, but they work well for my needs.</li>
            <li> gave them to my nail lady. she was thrilled! she had broken one of hers the day before, so it worked out great.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes, they work great, better than what I thought, I use them for other things also not just good for nails but detail painting also. ty</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected. It&#x27;s a very good value for the price with many different types of brushes. They work well and the fibers on the brushes don&#x27;t fall off easily like I expected them to. My only problem is that two of them arrived broken. Other than that, it&#x27;s a very good product and I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> unbelieveable price and quality  all the brushes are of good quality and they are very easy to use and clean</li>
            <li> I bought these to use for fine lines, etc., when I am actually painting.  I ordered three sets and I really like them.  I used some for a huge project that turned out really well.  When I was done, I had to throw them away, but they were well worth the money.  I also bought some for my kids, who are using them to tie dye clothes!</li>
            <li> This would be a very nice product for a manicurist.  I have not gotten much use of them for myself but I imagine they would be very useful for use on someone else.  It is  a nice product and the price was good.</li>
            <li> Shipping was long - but great brush set.</li>
            <li> Ready to use whn it&#x27;s the next ladies day to hang out and do manicures..thank you</li>
            <li> Price is good and shipping is fast. However, they are not great quality. They start to somewhat fall apart and the bristles are hard to clean. I think it&#x27;s a great kit for someone starting out in nail art (such as I was) to play around and see what types of brushes you like best. Great starter kit, but I think if you know what type of nail art brush you want then it might be better to purchase that one separately as this kit isn&#x27;t the greatest quality.</li>
            <li> Nice assortment of brushes but the bristles came out fairly easily and no one likes bristles in their nail art.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Was sent right out.</li>
            <li> Breaking already :/ and I haven&#x27;t even used them. But for the cost what should I expect. So I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> Any size brush you want... It&#x27;s here!!</li>
            <li> Received them early! &amp;I love them!</li>
            <li> Nice brushes for the price, serves their purpose.</li>
            <li> Nice assortment of sizes and styles, now to channel my artistic side and see what I can accomplish!</li>
            <li> Thank you for your professional work!</li>
            <li> Wish these came with instructions on who to use each one properly.</li>
            <li> The bristle are a very good quality and they were packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;The down side to this product is that some of the brushes were bent at the metal and the they came un-glued (fell off) from the wooden stick. So i have to either re-glue it or tape it back on.&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for...cheap price, cheap product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, some of the bristle were bent as well.</li>
            <li> Good good good good good good good for my kid</li>
            <li> love having all the tools to work with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very happy with these. Fortunately, I only spent a few bucks. But I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money again on this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate them, but you get what you pay for. Two of the brushes fell apart on the first use. By fell apart, I mean that brush hairs came out in clumps on top of freshly painted nails art. I&#x27;m able to use most of them, but am leary in doing so. Have made them my last resort, in case of emergency set.</li>
            <li> very poor quality wood and the tips dont stay on . when i recieved one of them was already broken and one of the tips were broken off</li>
            <li> good quality, but shipping took forever.</li>
            <li> They help out with great nail art.</li>
            <li> These are terrific!  So many to chose from and a dotting tool! Awesome value..im very happy with these.</li>
            <li> Very recived item. Will never order again .</li>
            <li> Love you he brushes you can do all different kinds of design&#x27;s.. With your nails..</li>
            <li> I love these tools. I&#x27;ve now purchased 2 sets. I will be buying more in the future. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. I use them for nails and all other small detail painting jobs which I daily do. They don&#x27;t last that long so this is why I will frequently purchase them.&lt;br /&gt;Best small detail brushes I&#x27;ve come across!</li>
            <li> I expected it to be better</li>
            <li> What a great deal they have similar smaller set at Sally for $20!!! Good quality and bristles were all good too!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok,not the best. Took a long time to get in the mail</li>
            <li> I was looking for some brushes for my nails that i can do my own nail art at home with out having to spend a fortune at the nail salon. I spent a small price for these quality brushes and I love them! I have been using them non stop since I got them in the mail just 2 days ago. Even my 4 year old daughter loves how i can get done more quickly with these brushes than doing it alone and it also dont take as long as well. I believe this is a product worth looking into and worth buying if you are into trying to do your own nail designs and art.</li>
            <li> My brushes arrived a whole TWO WEEKS before the estimated arrival date. Exactly as described in picture, if not better. Very fine bristles, none are strayed or falling out. Can somewhat hold a lot of paint as well. I have no complaints what-so-ever about these brushes. Quite the bargain!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know a lot of nail art designs, and I really don&#x27;t have very good skills, but these brushes have definitely helped me learn a lot more about the beauty of nail art. I have learned that I can do a lot more designs than I gave my self credit for, and these brushes have made the experience even more relaxing and enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping took a while, but it was free and it was more than worth the wait.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these to anyone that is interested in doing their own nails!</li>
            <li> Variety of brushes, you can&#x27;t go wrong for the price!</li>
            <li> At first, I was searching for just a fan brush when I stumbled upon this set for cheaper. AMAZING! They work great,too. However, when they arrived, the brush end actually fell off several of the brushes as soon as I opened the packaging. I&#x27;ll be honest, for the price I payed, that was no big deal. I always have super glue handy in an accident prone household. Easily fixed. They were soft and very good quality for my intentions. I love the dotting tool, because I don&#x27;t have to use the end of a brush to make stars and what not. The handle of them also feels like great quality as well. I don&#x27;t feel like they will break if I get too into it. They work great for acrylics and watercolors.</li>
            <li> Needed some brushes for disigns. This is a great value. Can&#x27;t go wrong. Took a little long to get the it but I got them :)</li>
            <li> I felt like I cheated the company. Such a good deal!!!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes, I just wished they had smaller tips</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement set of nail art brushes and this one came with so many options. I was worried about the quality but having used them at least a dozen times since I bought them, I am super happy! A couple of the brushes came apart where the metal meets the wood but if you do nails as much as I do, you have some superglue very handy to fix this so it wasn&#x27;t an issue for me at all!</li>
            <li> I received the brushes in a reasonable amount of time.  But some of the handles were cracked and broken, so I had to tape them in order to use them without the pieces of wood cutting me.  Also, on some of the brushes, the metal head would pop off while using them.</li>
            <li> I have been using these brushes for my china painting. They are perfect for painting those small areas. Would I order them again YES!</li>
            <li> These are nicer then I was thinking they would be. The price was good. If you need brushes then these are ones to get.</li>
            <li> The quality of these brushes, and the amount you receive for the price you pay is fantastic. There is indeed a great variety to choose from, that allow all sorts of different designing options. I haven&#x27;t had any issues thus far with the brushes I received, they&#x27;re easy to clean, although they do stain (which is common with any type of brush). Only downside to these is impatiently waiting the two weeks for them to get here, but for the price I paid, I&#x27;m not complaining :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these brushes. The bristles are soft, and seem to be of pretty good quality. They have allowed me to easily expand my nail-art creations. They come in such a variety that you can literally do anything with them. The possibilities are endless! I would recommend these to anyone who is sick of painting with toothpicks!</li>
            <li> These brushes are perfect for designing! So many to use, and they don&#x27;t feel flimsy or cheap. They come starched though, so make sure you rinse them gently to get the bristles soft again. Never leave polish in the brush, and clean it with NON ACETONE SOLUTIONS to keep bristles soft. Acetone will dissolve the glue holding the strands to the brush and destroy it, while also making it dry and brittle. I recommend keeping an old dish towel handy when designing to wipe off excess polish before cleaning.</li>
            <li> high quality brushes!! :) there very detailed.. They showed up before the schedule time &amp; im enjoying them very much!! :)</li>
            <li> The brushes were delivered fairly quickly, and were in good shape with little plastic tubes to protect the bristles. There are so many different kinds of brushes in this pack that make it perfect for designing nails!</li>
            <li> I love them , it is really nice ..... I start painting on my nails and i like it ❤</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome AND cheap. Theres every brush you could need. I didn&#x27;t realize they had a \\&quot;dotting\\&quot; pen either. I do all kinds of fancy desgns and I have like 10 people lined up for me to do their nails for prom. And I was just helplessly trying to copy stuff off pinterest a little bit ago. They&#x27;re good quality for the price. The only thing is on the fan brushes there was a few longer hairs so it didn&#x27;t come out even when painting but it was as simple as trim them with a scissors or nail clipper!</li>
            <li> I really loved this set. It took a while to get here but is really nice. I probably will order another for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Bought these for face painting purposes and the little ones work fantastic for smaller details! Love it highly recommend! Also super soft on the face</li>
            <li> Item Came From China, My Kids &amp; Wife Love It.</li>
            <li> Amazing deal for all you get</li>
            <li> Good variety and good quality. The only things is the paint of the handle comes off if it comes into contact with nail polish remover. Other than that it is great for such a low price. They are versatile and I&#x27;ve even grabbed one to use as my gel eyeliner applicator</li>
            <li> These brushes arrived promptly and were really reasonably priced! Unfortunately one the smaller brushes was broken when I received them in the mail (one of the metal/brush tips had separated from the wooden handle) but I was able to put it back together easily. Overall a great purchase!</li>
            <li> My wife is a painter as has enjoy the set</li>
            <li> a little flimsy but what I expected for the price</li>
            <li> exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> While I knew I wasn&#x27;t getting an extremely high-quality brush set at this price, I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using these for a couple months now to create fun art with my home Gel Polish kit. I needed to pinch the metal ends a little tighter onto the handles when they arrived and trimmed a stray hair from just one brush, but I&#x27;ve heavily used these, cleaned them each time with running alcohol or pure acetone, dabbed and even tugged at the bristles when cleaning, and have had no problems at all. I don&#x27;t get brush strands in my polish like I sometimes have even with the brushes in some cheap polish bottles. My designs look great, they&#x27;re fun to use and experiment with, and at this price I&#x27;ll be happy to replace them if I need you in time, though I don&#x27;t expect that to be necessary any time soon. If you&#x27;re looking for the ultimate in professional high quality, these may not be it, but if they just have to work well, hold up nicely, and clean up easily then there&#x27;s no need to break the bank on another brush set.</li>
            <li> The variety is nice but the quality is obviously not that great. Good to try out if you&#x27;re just starting to get interested in nail art. If you&#x27;re going serious maybe another set.</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes have fallen out of the stick.</li>
            <li> It took me 4 weeks to actually get these brushes from the time I ordered them.&lt;br /&gt;First off, It&#x27;s slightly hard to clean these brushes. If you get acetone near the actually stick part(white part), the paint starts coming off and the paint will get everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Second off, my stick part(white part) actually came off of the silver holding. It looks like these just hot glue it in there. Some of the brush hairs has fallen out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say it&#x27;s worth the price since they are fairly cheap. The brushes are easy to clean though.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great! They are suprisingly low-priced and they are of great value! They are good quality brushes and they work well with all of my polishes!</li>
            <li> Great price, super fast shipping.  This set is awesome.  There is a good quality brush for all of my nail art needs.  Will surely buy from again!</li>
            <li> The brushes came 5 days before the expected delivery and were exactly the same as the ones shown in the picture. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> My product arrived in a timely manner. I am unable to use one of the brushes because it arrived with glue attached to the bristles. overall, good quality</li>
            <li> These are great brushes for the price. Nice collection of sizes and styles for crafters...just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Bigger than expected, closer to paintbrush length. Fingernails are already a small area and having these longer brushes helps make the process of applying nail art smoother without so many tiny utensils in your other hand. Recipient was well pleased.</li>
            <li> it took what seemed like forEVER for these brushes to arrive...but well worth the wait.  I was surprised to see that there was also a small dot tool included in the set.  This is the best set I have seen yet. It has two long stripping brushes..which I haven&#x27;t seen in the brush sets at the beauty supply stores. A great buy!</li>
            <li> She loved it. Although the brushes head piece were out for a couple of them when package was opened. Easy to fix back on. Yet that deters it from a 5 star.</li>
            <li> Really great product.  A great gift for anyone that loves being creative with their nails.  I still haven&#x27;t used the entire kit</li>
            <li> Lots of brushes to choose from, and they aren&#x27;t bad for the price. They haven&#x27;t fallen apart in me yet, ha, so I&#x27;m happy with them. Not sure how I will use all 15 but they&#x27;re fun for nail art.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very nice. I would recommend. Quality product at great price...order with confidence! What more do you need?</li>
            <li> loving in i can make too many designs with them</li>
            <li> These are amazing although made for nails i used them for regular painting. Good quality for the price</li>
            <li> i love this set plus it was cheap! the only thing i dont know is how to keep them clean!! Or what types of nail polish to use it with or is their special paint for them??</li>
            <li> they are really good, and brushes of all different thicknesses, i am excited to try them out!! I dont really know what else to say about them...</li>
            <li> I cant wait to use this product. I&#x27;m going to love doing designs with this product. My friends are going to want me to do there nails too</li>
            <li> I like using these. They arrived much earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. It just didn&#x27;t get here on time.</li>
            <li> Great so many different size and shape brushes</li>
            <li> most of them work really well. these are more like temporary brushes unless you really keep them clean</li>
            <li> I really like all the brushes but some of them started coming apart, it&#x27;s no big deal though I can still use the ones I need most</li>
            <li> I ordered these but some of them where broken. I dont recommended these</li>
            <li> Useful brushes, you can make many styles and designs with them</li>
            <li> I really like then there great for doing lots of good designs there are many to choose from, and there cheap what else can u ask for...... only one thing they take to long to arrive.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes.  These brushes are going to be great for doing nail art.  I&#x27;m an oil painter and water colorist and can tell this set of brushes is a good set for the nails.</li>
            <li> Im a beginner and these are perfect for me. I didn&#x27;t want to waste expensive nail brushes or money so i opted for these. They are cheap but get the job done! None came damaged or broken</li>
            <li> One of the brush heads separated from the handle, not the best quality</li>
            <li> I confess, I don&#x27;t use them for nails.  I use them to paint my miniatures.  But when one of my good brush for miniature cost 5+x the cost of this entire set, these brush are great for work that are damaging to brushes (e.g. dry brushing, painting over large area of rough surface)</li>
            <li> PERFECT for nail desgins, however, i use this for special fx and face paintings and it has the PERECT small brushes just for those little details i put in..</li>
            <li> Received this product early and packaged neatly. I&#x27;ve never used nail brushes for my nails but looking to expand my technique options to create more looks and this is a perfect set. I can&#x27;t wait to see what I&#x27;m able to create!</li>
            <li> I like these brushes they work pretty well. Im still learning how to use them but so far so good.</li>
            <li> While these are great brushes,I was under the impression they were for painting on canvas as I found them IN crafts and paint supplies, I will see if they can work for the small areas I need to paint But had I known they were so small I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered them.</li>
            <li> Shipping did take some time but very happy once it arrived, although I did not use them for nail art I used most of the brushes to apply make up. Works great for eye makeup, the other brushed that I did not use went in with our ore arts and crafts stuff for the kids.</li>
            <li> these are very nice brushes especially for the price! mine work fantasically. i use them for nail art and love them.</li>
            <li> Hi, I think it&#x27;s really great set to start with. I just wasted couple of brushes so I can easily afford myself to buy  a new one.</li>
            <li> Most difficult nail brushes I have EVER had . At least 7 of the heads/brushes fell off. Hairs kept falling off too. Very difficult to clean ! Will never buy these again. Spend more money and get quality brushes.</li>
            <li> Dont make the same mistake I did. Order a second set, because this is a great quality brush at an exceptional price</li>
            <li> These are nice brushes. I know you shouldnt review on shipping info but jus a heads up, mine shipped from Hong Kong and took FOREVER to arrive. Its not that big of a deal since they were only a couple of bucks but I literally forgot that I had ordered them by the time they arrived. I wasnt in dire need of nail art brushes though, so no big deal. The set is very nice, quite a few different brushes and it comes with the dotter which I didnt see in the description but I am happy with. Definately worth the money, especially when these brushes are crazy expensive in some stores.</li>
            <li> not enough good, can be said they do their intended purpose, easy to use. easy to store and clean up.</li>
            <li> Thid product is awesome! There&#x27;s so many brushes, and they&#x27;re pretty good quality. I have a brush now for everything!</li>
            <li> Likj lojyy mniyg htcth yryb  tygvfyh  tydstg  ftyjvdtgbfryimvxetyhb hftyb jh jiuh nhjm nhjm byub fyh ftyh vdgredfh vghvfyhh bvgh hghn</li>
            <li> I could believe the price for the brushes. When you look at the hair store they are so expensive. My money was well spent.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these brushes! What a great price! Definitely not professional quality but for fun nail art they are GREAT!!</li>
            <li> The product came two weeks earlier than est. time and all the brushes are still in great shape. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use the brushes yet but I am looking forward to trying them out, they feel pretty nice. Not bad for the price i paid</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used them yet.. will probably use them on my feet first since my nails are short right now.. nonetheless i&#x27;m excited.. these cost way more in the store..</li>
            <li> I love the brushes. They will make making the designs easier. Plus they come in a variety of styles and sizes.</li>
            <li> these are really good quality brushes and for the price you cant go wrong!!! i would definately recommend these brushes to any beginner, professionals may want to look for better quality bristles though</li>
            <li> I was pleased with my order, except, a few of the brushes were frayed and i had to trim off loose strands but all in all I still use them often.</li>
            <li> The brushes are OK sine the price was really low but you get what you pay for because the brushes are really poorly made.</li>
            <li> Purchased these for $3 under a different listing. Shop around. Great brushes, I use them for artwork and not nails and they work great for that price. Low rating is on account of the $5 markup, for the same thing you can buy from the same company under: 15pcs Nail Art Painting Pen Brush. It isn&#x27;t Amazon Prime, so it doesn&#x27;t come right away but it&#x27;ll save you money.</li>
            <li> I really love these brushes. The shipping was really fast and the brushes look just like the ones in the pic. I gave them four stars because of the weird smell you get when you open the packaging. you have to remove them from the plastic and let them air out for a few days to get rid of the smell. Overall great product,great service!</li>
            <li> These are perfect quality and such a nice variety of sizes. I have already used them and they are great for fine detail as well as not so fine. I love these brushes.</li>
            <li> This brush set is awesome.  So many brushes to choose from.  I was really impressed with the quality for the great price I paid.</li>
            <li> They are light and fit perfectly in my hand. Not awkward at all. cant wait to use them. But I have one question, how do you use the fan brushes?</li>
            <li> These are SO cheap and flimsy! All of them fall apart when you start using them!</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to have to wait longer for these brushes, but they came sooner than I thought. I totally love these brushes. The quality was good too. I will surely buy more and reconmend this to anyone who ask.</li>
            <li> These are ok. The fan brush is great. But the heads keep c</li>
            <li> The tips came off of the brushes easily, but I simply glued them back on. They came in early, and I love painting with them.</li>
            <li> When I got then they all where broken</li>
            <li> i havent used all of them yet ive used two and they are ok i havent gotten to expierment with them all just yet but they got here sooner than expected</li>
            <li> I purchased the brushes because the price was right and most of the reviews were excellent.  I just received the brushes and was excited to use them for my nails.  While using two brushes, the paint from the handles came off and went all over my hands.  The metal that held the brushes started deteriorating. Perhaps it was due to the nail polish remover ... but then again it is a \\&quot;Nail Art Painting Pen Brush\\&quot;. Needless to say I was quite shocked and very unhappy. Thus my title above you get what you paid for.  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I use these tools all the time &amp; I love them! Great for intricate nail art, clean up &amp; for various nail art designs, the possibilities are endless. Will definitely be buying this product again when needed.</li>
            <li> You definitely get what you pay.. Wasn&#x27;t expecting anything professional or even for them to last more then a month but as soon as I took them out of the package the metal part with the brush fell off of most of them. So I was pretty disappointed at that. But other then that they are ok.</li>
            <li> She really found these easy to use, she has done her nails over &amp; over using these tools. She likes them alot.</li>
            <li> When I got these brushes one of them were bent. another brush, the metal part fell off, and this was right when I opened them, I haven&#x27;t used them yet but will and hoping they will be good, since when I received them and they were damaged and dried up as if someone&#x27;s already used them...</li>
            <li> Just in case ... they are not meant for acrylic</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 sets of nail art but I only got one</li>
            <li> Great set for the price, can&#x27;t wait to use! Shipped fast!!</li>
            <li> Poduct took a long time to get to me but otherwise good quality.</li>
            <li> The dotting tool fell off pretty much as soon as I got it. The some of the brushes could be a little more stiff. I like it, but I would rather for the handles to be all metal than soft wood. The paint chips off quickly also. The upside is that everything was there.</li>
            <li> Good product for nail designing</li>
            <li> Great brush set for fine nail work.&lt;br /&gt;I bought another set of these brushes for canvass painting. They work well.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans up well with regular nail polish remover but don&#x27;t let the paint dry out on the brushes before cleaning&lt;br /&gt;and don&#x27;t use acetone.</li>
            <li> Arrived early, however not all the brushes were there. I was shorted 3 brushes. I was happy with the ones I did receive. They were just as described and worked great while doing my nails. Too bad all of them weren&#x27;t there!</li>
            <li> Good guality for the price,just have to be careful of the painted handles when using polish remover but they do the job</li>
            <li> These are nice tools to have for nail art design. I don&#x27;t understand the purpose of some, but the price made it worth it.</li>
            <li> Bought these for birthday gifts, they thought I spent a fortune and they love them!! I would recommend these to everyone, shipping was pretty fast also considering they are coming from another country.</li>
            <li> i got them today actually and they are as advertised and i love them they work just fine and at a good price. came at the time stated.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the brushes very much but they seem to work well. A lot of control when doing designs. The paint on the handle though seems to come off, it gets all over my hands and is sticky. They came in about two weeks.</li>
            <li> I PAIRED THIS WITH A FEW NAIL POLISHES AND GAVE IT TO A FRIEND.  SHE LOVED IT.  IT WAS WELL WORTH IT.  IT ARRIVED PROMPTLY AND THE BRUSH QUALITY WAS OUTSTANDING.</li>
            <li> I love my brushes!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve aways saw pretty nail designs,but they always required nail art brushes. So I ordered these and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. Now I can have stylish nails!</li>
            <li> I love them I do my nails all the time and my kids nails as well. They like that I can do designs now.</li>
            <li> Excellent value for the price. I am learning nail design now, so the price verses the number of brushes was fantastic. Although they were shipped from China, which wasntba problem, they still arrived a full week before the expected delivery date. Thanks Amazon for yourbvalues...!!!!!</li>
            <li> Add this economical set to your tool box for spa night!  I bought these primarily for the small, blunt brush to clean up around the cuticles like the pros do.  Works great.</li>
            <li> Na verdade comprei estes pinceis p/ pintar quadros, imaginei q se são precisos para aqueles desenhos minusculos das unhas seriam bons para  como pretendo usar.</li>
            <li> Is very good this product.</li>
            <li> For the price, this isn&#x27;t a bad set of brushes. I use one of them as an eyeliner brush and the rest for my nails. A few of them have had issues with the bristles falling out, which certainly isn&#x27;t ideal for a nail brush.</li>
            <li> Awesome Deal!  - Great value for the amount of brushes received.  Loved the brushes plan to use as stocking stuffers.  My girls will love these.</li>
            <li> 15pcs Nail Art Painting Pen Brush  - two of them were bent  but that was a easy fix .. I have been happy with them, art work of all sorts canvas nails, murals ....</li>
            <li> Fantastic price! I have never had issues with the quality of any of the brushes. I&#x27;ve used them many times, and washed them with both polish remover and water many times - polish remover *instantly* removes every trace of the white paint of the handles, but the wood underneath isn&#x27;t too rough and doesn&#x27;t splinter, so it&#x27;s okay. They&#x27;re easy to use and easy to experiment with. I use them nearly every time I paint my nails!</li>
            <li> great quality -  love them</li>
            <li> good product, the brush are soft as I expected and as I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;buen producto, las brochas son suaves como lo esperaba y tal como me gustan</li>
            <li> Decent quality for the price. $2.40 plus free shipping for 15 brushes makes you wonder if they made a mistake on the price?</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t the best but worth the few dollars.  I was hoping the brushes wouldn&#x27;t be so stiff which makes it hard to do designs.</li>
            <li> Best of its kind, gavethe nameof the company to my pedicure and manicure salon owner.  She bought 4 brushes for $10., could not believe what I paid for.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced... I&#x27;ve had these for months and they are still like new with a little TLC. Would recommend for purchase to a friend.</li>
            <li> these are really great</li>
            <li> I got these to use at work and they are wonderful. They were a great price and are exactly the same as some of the other brushes my co-workes had and paid twice as much for</li>
            <li> Daughter loves them.  They were shipped surprisingly fast considering they came from the Far East.</li>
            <li> A great set of brushes for a super price. I would definitely recommend these!</li>
            <li> Definetly recommend. Brushes are well made. I use them for personal use and I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase. Recommend.</li>
            <li> LOVE the price LOVE the brushes LOVE bag that keeps them all in one place! I would recommend these brushes to professionals and beginners!</li>
            <li> They shipped fast and has everything I&#x27;ve needed so far to do nail art. They&#x27;re also easy to clean and work very well</li>
            <li> i love these brushes!! the various different sizes help with all kinds of nail art. however they work better with acrylic paint than they do with nail polish. also they were more fragile than i expected but still nice. cleaning them, you should use a mix of acetone and water i found this method helpful. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I like using these brushes for clean up on my nails and using the stripers. The fan brushes are good for loose glitter placement. Other than that, I really don&#x27;t need 15 brushes. But for a couple dollars, you can&#x27;t beat the price. If you like doing intricate free hand nail art, get these. They are a great price and will do the job.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes, so far. I suspect after a lot of use and cleaning they will start to lose bristles, but these were a pretty cheap purchase so I&#x27;m not complaining. There is a very good assortment and even two of the same brush so you don&#x27;t have to clean between uses if you want to use the same brush for a different color,</li>
            <li> cant put my brushes down they are really good and for a good price, as soon as i need new ones ill be purchensing some more</li>
            <li> i got these in today and they look so cute .. can not wait to use them .. my customers will love them</li>
            <li> I liked the brushes, I am very happy with purchase, The brushes were in good condition, free shipping, and arrived early that the Delivery Estimate, these lovely brushes are excellent for my nail art designs.</li>
            <li> These pens help a lot , they help me do mostly every design I search up on YouTube. My favorite pen is the dotting pen, because it does very pretty dots. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Wow! I can&#x27;t believe it, this is such a great deal. If you&#x27;re having some doubts about this product, no worries because it is totally worth it. It didn&#x27;t come damaged, and it was packaged nicely. Not only that, but it even shipped faster than me compared to the suggested date! I was supposed to get it in two more weeks, but it arrived today!</li>
            <li> Love how easy it is to use this brushes the best easy to clean them love how amazing your nail art comes out love everything about them.</li>
            <li> Item was as described, was received ahead of date! It made a great gift for my sister who is learning to do nail designs.</li>
            <li> For the price, you get a lot of brushes, but the white paint on the handle has a tendency to bleed off onto your hands as you work, and sometimes onto your nail, which can be especially frustrating. Also, the bristles harden quickly after your first use.</li>
            <li> They were shipped to me very fast and is exactly what it says! I cant wait to use them on my nails all the time!</li>
            <li> These I give an A++++++ rating. So many to choose from and you can switch from smaller to bigger. I have recommended and 2 of my friends have already purchased a set.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried using these brushes yet but they look to be in good shape. Each brush has its own cover to protect the hair. Item arrived a week earlier then estimated and seller included a cute butterfly magnet in the package that I definitely appreciate. I would definitely order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the brushes yet, but they seem to be a really nice set for the price.  And, there&#x27;s a lot in the kit!  My daughter and I will be able to do tons of designs with these!  Excited to try them!</li>
            <li> I got these for my niece and she loves them. She said it is just what the professionals use.  Makes applying nail art much easier and look more professional.</li>
            <li> Has all the required pieces, although the ends are a bit loose and tend to fall off.  They just require a good squeeze to tighten them up.  But I only paid a couple bucks for them, so, they rock!</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes.  Very nice large set with several size and style options. Price was great . Shipping took a little long but nothing to complain about</li>
            <li> these brushes are really good. prefect gift for those who love to do nails. they came in a nice package and the brushes were not bent or ruined.</li>
            <li> i love it! it comes with good brushes that can be cleaned easily and for such a great price! and a great quantity!</li>
            <li> These brushes are GREAT and anyone who says otherwise is full of poo. They are well packaged and a great price. Some of the bristles on some of the brushes are even made out of feathers no stray bristles all! ;)</li>
            <li> One came broken but that is nothing that a lil hot glue can not fix, the pens work great and they  do not curve when painting. Great but for the price</li>
            <li> I wanted nail art brushes to design my own manicures, and, sure enough, I was able to create some master pieces with these brushes!</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for in this case. I only paid a few dollars for these, with the intention of using them for nail art. The brushes are very stiff and difficult to paint [anything] with. I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend them, and I wouldn&#x27;t buy the same ones again.</li>
            <li> I have used these a couple times now and I&#x27;ve noticed that some of the brushes have started falling apart. The metal pieces and wooden pieces are not put together very well at all.</li>
            <li> took 2 weeks to arrive, the brushes are really nice but one of my brushes wasnt glued right so the metal and wood came apart.. but easy fixed with crazy glue. the hairs on the brushes are good quality and they dont fall out. I been using my brushes for a month now and still in good condition. i like the fact thet they are plain white so i can diy decorate my brushes</li>
            <li> you cant beat this price. Although some of the brush heads came off, its still all good. you could always glue them back together. hope i can get the most out of these brushes. other than the quality, its a pretty good set of brushes for the price amazon offers you.</li>
            <li> I have started to get in to nail art. So I decided to get these mainly becouse they were so cheap. I used them as soon as I got them. They are a bit of a pain to clean but, they work great. These are really going to help with my new found intrested in nail art.</li>
            <li> my friend loved it this is what she was looking for and she used it right away she liked all the different designs she can do</li>
            <li> Most of them were ok but one was bent. Still works just crooked. My daughter loves them though. Thank you.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great. I do my own nails and these have worked great, only wish they had come with a bigger dotting tool!</li>
            <li> Now I have some tools to use to create a lot of fun manicure designs. YouTube will be my best friend learning each brush and how to use them.</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes as a gift for a friend for her birthday. I was disappointed that gift wrapping wasn&#x27;t available. The item arrived as described. When asked about the item, she replied &amp;#34;I love them.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was looking for skinny brushes to do thinner lines. I have onto used a few of the brushes so far but I did get what I originally wanted so, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> The brushes were in good condition, free shipping, and arrived quickly! I have used 4 brushes already and they have made it so much easier to do nail art.</li>
            <li> These are great, all of mine came intact with plastic covers. Comes in a little plastic holder. Just make sure to not be dumb like me and dip the white parts in acetone nail polish removed, it kind of makes the paint wipe off.</li>
            <li> First, the delivery time was good, I suppose, so it got one star. When it came, though, the brushes were all scrunched up, and a lot of the little plastic caps were coming off. A lot of the metal parts of the brushes were bent and/or flattened. Not what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> a nice variety of brushes for the price but they are not as easy to clean as i would have liked</li>
            <li> These are so much fun to make designs on your nails. You can do almost anything with these! They are great!</li>
            <li> It was fasy delivery.  It was what I wanted and more. The tool were new and came In a bag. I love these brushes</li>
            <li> So much fun with so many different brushes - every conceivable size cleanly applies polish and there is a variety of styles to execute</li>
            <li> I use this for pretty much everything to do with nail art. It came about 2 weeks in advance so I am very very pleased</li>
            <li> Nice but shipping isn&#x27;t great. One of mine were bent at the top but I think I will get alot of use out of them.already found my favorite one.( short one fat handle)  will order again. Package was 2 weeks early.</li>
            <li> But it took 2 months to get in..</li>
            <li> These work beautifully, but there are slight issues with them. The brush tips tend to come off, even if they havnt been used. Nothing a little bit of super glue cant fix. Just with they were a little more durable.</li>
            <li> Awesome purchase happy with them long after</li>
            <li> lots of ways to decorate nails and anything else you want to paint - great christmas gifts.  good price too</li>
            <li> My highschool daughter as recently become addicted to painting fingernails and designing them.  This was the perfect addition for you and i love to be the guina pig as well.  Great product, great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Loved it, great gift for a beginner and it came in great condition. I wpuld recommend it to anyone who wants to get serious with their nails!</li>
            <li> I do great detailed nail designs, in a hurry I needed brushed and purchased these. They are good for the price but I will be buying better, and trashing these. They are stiff and have bushy edges, The metal around the hair bends and the pain on the wood comes off as I use acetone, or nail polish remover. Very poor quality but I should have expected that for the price.</li>
            <li> Great product, also came 4 weeks early! Just upset that I used nail polish instead of paint lol! Ruined my brushes but well def buy some more! They are awesome though, did what they are described as just can&#x27;t get the polish off of them lol</li>
            <li> These seem to be fairly good brushes for the price. The fan brushes are a little delicate but other wise a fairly nice set. Shipping took quite a while and they do come in a plastic pouch and the smaller brushes all have plastic tubing to keep them from getting roughed up.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the quality of the packaging and the bristles on the brushes. The packaging caused the bristles to point in every direction and was hard to fix for most of them I had to cut the bristles or throw away. I was happy though that the set arrived early, but again, the crappy quality kinda overlooks the arrival speed.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely great for nail designs. All kinds of shaped/length brushes to do art with. Be sure to keep them cleaned. If you fail to clean one, you&#x27;re going to ruin it- and that&#x27;s your fault, not the product&#x27;s. These are also great for dipping in nail polish remover to clean small spots you&#x27;ve messed up.</li>
            <li> They are okay, not the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I only use about half of the items in the set, but thats probably because I&#x27;m a noob with nail design. I really do like the ones I have been using though. the angled dotting tool is a bit awkward but still totally usuable. I only wish the brushes stayed stiff, helps for an unsteady hand.</li>
            <li> These brushes were cheap so I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything that would last a lifetime. But I at least expected them to last long enough to use just once! I went to take them out of the package and the bristles on one brush just all fell out at once. So not a big deal I paid like 3$ for the set. I was still disappointed though.</li>
            <li> These brushes SUCK the paint peels off and they lost their shape don&#x27;t buy them the bristles brake off and I only received fourteen</li>
            <li> been waiting on this i love it so much easier to do designs with!</li>
            <li> Poor quality. But it was so cheap I&#x27;m not surprised. 1 brush fell apart after i took them out of the packaging, another fell apart while i was doing my nails.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Works well.</li>
            <li> Brushes are mostly all the same size. Paint on handles came off after first use. You get what you pay for ... Barely...</li>
            <li> The nail.brushes r very nice for the price I just wish the came in a holder or wrap or something ..Easy to use study well built I will purchase again</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really go wrong here because of how cheap they are, the brushes themselves are not the greatest quality, but overall good enough for the cheap price. Some of the hairs on the brushes were a bit split when I received them, but can easily be fixed by trimming them down with scissors. Also, one of the ends of the brushes fell off right away, but I was able to fix that as well with some glue. Worth it for the price and amount of brushes, honestly.</li>
            <li> LOVE these! Excellent deal, and I use them for jewelry (PMC silver, copper, bronze) making! Excellent deal!!</li>
            <li> I loved the product....&lt;br /&gt;Im so glad I purchased it....&lt;br /&gt;it works great.&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to know how to clean them without ruining them.......</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes they are very easy to use and easy to clean will purchase more nail products again.</li>
            <li> These are an excellent set of brushes.  This was a great deal because there were so many sizes and shapes.  The price and shipping were both perfect!</li>
            <li> These brushes work alright. I&#x27;m no nail artist but these make painting nails fun and easy to create designs. I enjoy using them.</li>
            <li> I use these little brushes for painting details on miniatures.  Very fine brushes.  They&#x27;ve held up well so far and have used them a number of times with craft acrylics.</li>
            <li> The nail kit encased in a plastic envelop, which was wrapped in a bubble-wrap. Each brush protected by plactic tubing. I highly recommend this nail art kit to all...Now I&#x27;m using You Tube to learn how to use this kit.</li>
            <li> Im learning how too do nails it&#x27;s just the right tools thanks so much !!!!GOD Bless!!! just what you need too get started.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make nail designs it was really cheap and had 15 different  pieces it worked really good but I used acrylic paint and it easily took off with water if you use nail polish use nail polish remover to remove it also  it was fast shipping</li>
            <li> Brushes are excellent quality and a very good selection of shapes &amp; sizes.  Will purchase again in the future! Thanks!</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used them yet i just got them but they look like it is in great condition and i cant wait to try them out :)</li>
            <li> The brushes were awesome but about 6 of them had tips that fell off. Nothing a lil glue couldn&#x27;t fix</li>
            <li> When fresh, these brushes do great work. Cleanup is near impossible, howver, as the glue holding the bristles is extremely weak and the aluminum brace is weak as well. I dipped a brush too far into my cleaner the first time and managed to destroy the glue and essentially melt the paint off of the handle even though the remover had been in contact with the brush for no more than a couple of seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, get these brushes only if you&#x27;re a first-timer and can&#x27;t find good cheap paintbrushes at the store. If you get them, be extremely careful and gentle when cleaning.</li>
            <li> this product is working very well, I&#x27;m happy with it, I&#x27;m just still in the process using it, so I&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> I use these doing my friends nails and they come out wonderfully, its like every brush you will ever need.</li>
            <li> My daughter got these for her birthday and has been having a lot of with them! She has come up with so many cute designs!</li>
            <li> These are great tools for nails, the long handles make it easier to use.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!!!! This brushes are just great! I love them! So far I haven&#x27;t had any issues with them. I defffffff recommend.</li>
            <li> Could not believe the quality for the price! Bought them for my daughter, She Loves Loves them!! Would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter to do her nail art and she loves them. For the price, they are perfect for her.</li>
            <li> I bought these a few months ago because I wanted all the nail art tools that the pros have in the cheapest way possible. I don&#x27;t use these brushes. The bristles are too soft to even get a proper design on the nail, and once I pulled out the bristles from one brush just from cleaning it. For 3 bucks these are probably good for less precise designs and smaller jobs, so if you&#x27;re not too serious about your designs and looking for cheap brushes, this is good for you.</li>
            <li> I will be delighted to rate it when it shows up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Resend the message when it has been sent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a few of these and so far so good.  I&#x27;ve used the detail brush for making nail art flowers and they turned out AWESOME!  I&#x27;ve also used the brown fan brush for nail art strips...turn out amazing...wish we could post pictures.  I love them!!!  Can&#x27;t wait to find way to use the rest!!!</li>
            <li> This product had a very long shipping time. It said it wasn&#x27;t supposed to be here until sometime between August 13th thru August 31st. I got this product today August 7th. I was really surprised as I wasn&#x27;t expecting them for a while. I decided to use them right away as I was going to paint my nails tonight anyways. I got out the polish and brushes and got straight to work. I am not too crafty, but I ordered these so I could learn. I think these brushes seem a little cheap, but overall, I thought they worked really good for the price that they go for. The brushes did shed a little and I was worried at first that I wasted my money, but they actually worked really well. I think for practice brushes, these are a really good deal and I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> A few of the same brushes. But no shedding and durable</li>
            <li> I love these! And you really can&#x27;t beat the bang for your buck!  My little daughter and I love painting our nails and these REALLY help me achieve more fun patterns. (ESPECIALLY since her nail beds are so tiny right now!) I would recommend these to any nail hobbyist, like me, who does two set of nails two times a week. I can&#x27;t weigh in on how they&#x27;d hold up for a professional.</li>
            <li> They work great and the price was awesome, but I had to glue the brushes to their handles, they fall right off if you pull on them even a little.</li>
            <li> For the price these brushes are superb!  My original intention was to use them when painting. And they are perfect for that.. some have been used for nail designs and I even used some with makeup! However I wish I had ordered more lol</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t  had any  problems</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used them all, but they are all cool none the less.</li>
            <li> do not buy you are wasting your money they arrived broken and the ines that did survive dint work for s***!</li>
            <li> Quality isnt too good. They separate from the wood part. Unhappy !</li>
            <li> Received package. I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas gift and a couple of the Pen Brushes are bent. Not happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I was very excited when my order came because these are my first nail art brushes! Love them, but they are fragile. They easily come apart, so don&#x27;t water the whole brush (brush plus stick) just clean where you applied nail polish. Other then that, they are great for beginners!</li>
            <li> These brushes seemed like a great value, but you truly get what you pay for, some of the brush heads have already come off before even using them, I guess it was good there were so many in the package.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described and was a wonderful set given how low the price was. I will be ordering more for gifts.</li>
            <li> They were exactly what I was looking for, and my nails always turn out so beautiful because of the designs I can do now. They last forever, and there&#x27;s so many of them. Erase your doubts! Get them! You won&#x27;t regret it</li>
            <li> OMG, I&#x27;VE BOUGHT OTHER BRUSHES AND WAS DISAPPOINTED. THESE BRUSHES TRULY WHAT I NEED AND SIZES EXCELLENT FOR DETAILING!  GREAT QUALITY ALSO.</li>
            <li> It came earlier than expected. The item was what I order. I&#x27;m very happy that I bought this for my nails!</li>
            <li> I used these paint brushes for painting with acrylics and they&#x27;re just as good if not better than my paintbrushes that were made to do that! Plus these were way cheaper! I would buy these again!</li>
            <li> great value, so many brushes for so many applications.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, I guess.  A third of them arrived with the brush separated from the handle and I had to glue them back together.  Brush quality itself is OK, but a little delicate.</li>
            <li> The estimated shipping time was a 1 time span starting 1 month after the order was placed. So I was excited when they arived 1.5 weeks before the soonest estimated time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They came in the case as pictured in the product pictures and shipped in a bubble lined manila envelope. All the ends of the brushes were capped except the fan brushes and 1 other brush.. I think maybe the cap fell off during packaging. But regardless they were all in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one flag I would raise is, You should know the ends are painted wood not plastic (They totally feel like plastic). So don&#x27;t use the end for dotting. Nail polish remover will eat the paint off of it. I coated the end that I messed up in clear coat and it is good as new. This is not even a complaint really. More just a stupidity on my part. It does not take away at all from the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this so could design my nails,but instead I used it for painting. So now I want another paintbrush set so I can use that set for my nails &#x3D;P</li>
            <li> Very handy Just as described. Fast delivery.  Good transaction.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been almost a month and I haven&#x27;t even gotten my this product I have ordered and it said complete order NO I haven&#x27;t got nothing what so ever I even called the mail people and they have not even received anything from this company at all. I am not a happy camper right now. Until I see my order in my hands and in good good quality then I will write another review but till then I will complain</li>
            <li> I LOVE THEM! excellent quality, i will not gonna use them for nails but for makeup and they are really good!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my niece for nail art she really liked them. I hope they work out well for her ,if not I may make another comment, Good price very slooooooow shipping.</li>
            <li> The white paint completely falls apart. You get what you paid for</li>
            <li> For the money it can&#x27;t be beat although I haven&#x27;t used any of them yet. I think they will be fine for my needs</li>
            <li> Fast shipping , good I like the product! Don&#x27;t really like the fact that I over payed 17cent for each in total 34 cents.... Ill make sure to not buy any else from you guys after today 3/11/2013 seller lucky electronics</li>
            <li> Great for the money, good variety of brushes.</li>
            <li> My girls will love this!</li>
            <li> These paint brushes are great for a first time use and first time use only. The tops have popped off a lot and the nail polish paint gets stuck quickly. I&#x27;ve tried nail poish remover and hot water on multiple occasions to take it out and nothing ever works.</li>
            <li> The white paint on the brushes comes off with acetone, so be sure to keep it dry.</li>
            <li> Cheap. Brushes fall out. Feathers thin</li>
            <li> Great brushes. I use for art projects!</li>
            <li> Thank you! Very good)</li>
            <li> Great service. My daughter was excited to get theses and I loved the price.</li>
            <li> Brushes took forever to arrive, then the hairs fell out first time used.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> These work very nice.</li>
            <li> Had everything I need it! Love them</li>
            <li> Very Nice tool for Nails Art ... Thx U !!!</li>
            <li> I love to do nail art and this kit has it all.  I also use it with my acrylic paints.  It is VERY useful for those small touchups.</li>
            <li> This is my first nail brush purchase and I am happy with what I received. They don&#x27;t break after the first use, there are so many different type of brushes, and it&#x27;s a great price! I recommend :)</li>
            <li> Are great quality , look like in the picture work ok&lt;br /&gt;is very usseful for nails desings come on time and in great&lt;br /&gt;shape</li>
            <li> The item arrived quickly, and my sister absolutely adores it. It&#x27;s the perfect brush set for doing intricate, tiny details on nails. We&#x27;ve been looking for a product like this for a long while, and we&#x27;re very pleased with it!</li>
            <li> I received my package after a delay and when I got these brushes, I couldn&#x27;t use most of them. Very disappointed. I ended up giving them away.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.  Love the amount of product you receive for the price.  They are cheap, not the best quality, but you get what you pay for and I am a happy customer!</li>
            <li> Poor quality. The heads come off so easily and the hairs of the brushes fall out continuously. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes, perfect price, perfect quality, perfect for small detailed work!!  I am amazed at how accurate I can be with them.</li>
            <li> Quite a nice deal!&lt;br /&gt;pretty good quality</li>
            <li> I LOVE these brushes!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed I was looking forward for this and they lost it.</li>
            <li> Love the possibilities that came with this set. Love nail art but hate struggling with the toothpicks that I usually use to draw with! Looking forward to using real tools to paint with!</li>
            <li> I liked the brushes and I&#x27;ve used a couple of them... BUT on first use and even upon delivery, some of the barrels had already broken off the handles and had to be super glued back on. And, as another user suggested - DO NOT LET THESE BRUSHES GO NEAR ACETONE! THEY STRIP THE BRUSHES OF THEIR PAINT AND THAT PAINT STAINS EVERYTHING!!! For me, the paint doesn&#x27;t wash off easily either. Letting them soak, not soak, washing immediately, washing after the paint dried - nothing made it easy to clean the stripers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, they&#x27;re an okay set and they get the job done.</li>
            <li> each one of these broke, dont buy. poor quality brushes that just arent worth it. again, avoid these and buy something else even if you do have to spend alittle more. at least you&#x27;ll be able to use them!</li>
            <li> Loving the nail art paint brushes! They work great! Makes nail art easy and fun!! If you are into nail art these brushes are a must have and at an awesome price!</li>
            <li> Some of the brush tips pop off a lot when I&#x27;m painting. The brushes were also much smaller than I expected. For me, this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect set to use for any kind of fingernail art.  There are a variety of brushes that help you achieve the look you want and they are well made.</li>
            <li> excellent product fulfills all my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;recommend their quality is very good and the price even better.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue buying him his sevice and attention no comparison.</li>
            <li> You definitely get what you pay for. Within 5 minutes of using the first brush it broke. All but two of the brushes pulled away from the stick/handle when the plastic brush protector was removed.</li>
            <li> These brushes which I purchased for miniature painting are a great buy. So inexpensive and they arrived promptly. Nice quality amazing for the modest price.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this set for the beginner nail artist.  I&#x27;m just starting out, and I love it, especially at the low price!  I received exactly what is pictured.  This is not the fanciest set of brushes, but it has everything you might need!  Shipping was a lot faster than expected, so that is also a plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an everyday make-up lady. here I found a lot of accessories for not a lot of money. From now, if I really like one model in particular, maybe I would spend more for better quality???? Not even sure as the global quality was pretty good. The shipping was... as the package came home walking (more than one month). Actually it came directly from China so it might be explained.</li>
            <li> This took a LONG time to receive, but the quality is pretty good. I actually use these brushes for hand painting cakes and they work very well.</li>
            <li> Just as described and will purchase from again! :)</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price for the amount of brushes received! A lot of them do have the same function but for the number of brushes, there&#x27;s no complaints given the price and free shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried it with nail polish, but It applies cream makeup nicely. You really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> they work great just took a month to arrive. Then i find out they come from Singapore... other than that.. great products</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my daughter for Christmas.  The set is exactly as promised and they look to be of very good quality.</li>
            <li> My husband uses these brushes to paint small game figures.  He really likes the detail they allow him to achieve.</li>
            <li> e x a  c t l y  w h  a t  i  n e e d  w i l l  s h o p  a g a i n</li>
            <li> good service. They return back my money and i can leave product, coz low cost, but anyway it was accident purchase</li>
            <li> My daughter is really into doing nails and she saw these brushes and wanted me to order and when she got them she was so pleased.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the quality and variety of brushes for such a great price ($2.75). Even though some of the brushes, like the smaller striping brushes came with some of the bristles sticking out, I fixed this by sticking them in hot soapy water then squeezing them back to there rightful places.&lt;br /&gt;Such a beautiful set of brushes</li>
            <li> Ive never had any problems with anything ... if it was damaged they send new.. if it is missing they replace it.</li>
            <li> Great selection, No defects, fast delivery, Quality seems to be good and I&#x27;ve found use for everyone. You are getting more for your money with this product and I will most definitely be purchasing this again! If your into nail designs like I am then this product is a must have! Hope this was helpful.</li>
            <li> For this price, who cares what the quality is! I took a little while to ship, because it came from china, but I got exactly what the picture and description said I would get! They are a little cheap, which was expected, but none of the hairs fall out. If you are using it for nail polish, keep in mind that it is hard to clean the brushed with water and soap, so I use a little bit of rubbing alcohol and it it works perfectly! Great buy!</li>
            <li> This was a really good quality product, especially for the price I paid. 15 brushes- all, but one were in perfect condition. That one didn&#x27;t bother me because the pack came with so many others. It&#x27;s great for fine and detailed nail art. I love the fan brushes!</li>
            <li> I just received this set of brushes today, and upon inspecting them, they appear to be very nice quality brushes.  I have not had a chance to use them yet, but I think I will be happy with them.  I plan on using them solely for nail art.  There are so many different sizes, and I can&#x27;t wait to use every single one of them.</li>
            <li> I like the brushes that I received they were in very good condition;  The brushes are very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great, great deal on these brushes. One of the 15 brushes is actually a very small dotting tool. Which is very handy, it makes the set all the better since it has a design tool and not solely brushes. The handles are made of wood, and are very sturdy. The hairs are synthetic. I&#x27;ve had these since September or October, and they&#x27;re still in great condition! Overall, great product, and awesome deal!!</li>
            <li> They are exactly as pictured and work great. Great stuff for the price. The only problem was that it took foreverrrrrrrrrrrr to arrive! I almost thought I wasn&#x27;t going to get it anymore....</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried out the brushes yet because I just received them today. Great price &amp; I got it even quicker than expected! I liked the little note that came with &amp; the extra butterfly magnet..super cute. Great customer service.</li>
            <li> I am yet to use all the brushes included but the ones I have used have proved to be good quality and the price? Geez it was a dang steal for me! I highly recommend this product..</li>
            <li> not too big of a fan but for the money they were ok. i have had a couple of them just have the bristles come off.</li>
            <li> The metal tips fall off.</li>
            <li> My Review on this product is:&lt;br /&gt;I did not receive it so I do not like it. It is far too invisible to be enjoyed!!!</li>
            <li> I do not need all the brushes, but they all might be put to use soon!</li>
            <li> When I opened this is checked all the brushes out of only the 5 that came and 3 of which all the hair just came out from even the slightest pull. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> It was what I expected.</li>
            <li> Love these for nail art!! The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is two of them came off the stick but I crazy glue them back &amp; so far so good been using these for a year now.</li>
            <li> Still haven&#x27;t even used all the brushes yet, but they are very nice quality and the ones I&#x27;ve used so far work wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Was shipped very fast then what was expected thank you!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive these brushes. When I opens the package 2 of the metal pieces where not attached to the wooden brush. A few of the brushes when I was starting to use them all the bristles fell out.</li>
            <li> Love the all size nail brushes</li>
            <li> these brushes work good,, i use them to paint with not on nail and they work good, i recommend these for all painting</li>
            <li> This nail brush set makes it easy to do your nails at home. There is so many different designs you can do at home with this set.</li>
            <li> Very easy to work with and clean-up is just as easy. Thank-you KLS</li>
            <li> I love these very much, the only thing I would say I dont like about this product is thst the white on the sticks of the brushes, if you dip it in nail polish remover the white comes off like nail polish, I think if you make something for nail art it should be nail polish remover proof</li>
            <li> Very cheap brushes. They don&#x27;t work very well and they constantly broke.</li>
            <li> Love these! Purchased them to paint small wooden dolls am actually using on canvas now.</li>
            <li> The brushes were really cheap quality. The silver part fell off the wooden part of the brush. Don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> Decent set for the price</li>
            <li> Items arrived intact and look better than pictured. The bristels appear to be high quality and should last about as long as any small headed brush would last. I will definitely purchase these again.</li>
            <li> Save your money,  My daughter dont&#x27; even use it.  No use for it. when you by polist from the store the brush it come with is enough.</li>
            <li> Item exactly as pictured. love it!  Will buy from again!! arrived in awesome condition! I especially liked how it arrived in a thin plastic case, all in one piece and not a mess. Thanks!</li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter loves these brushed. She is able to do amazingly creative things with her nails. Every couple of weeks, she comes up with a new design. They are great!</li>
            <li> Price was reasonable and quality of brushes matches price. Not the best but they are manageable and will do the job,</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing and are beautiful and easy to handle. they exceed my expectations and I love using them! Thanks!</li>
            <li> 15pcs Nail Art Painting Pen Brush...I Love them...they are great and the perfect size for your nail art. There is a brush for all of your nail art needs in this kits.</li>
            <li> Bought brushes for my teenage daughter to use for nail art.  She loved them, they are a variety of sizes and because they are not expensive, she doesn&#x27;t have to worry about ruining them.  Will definitely buy them again if she needs more.</li>
            <li> They come in all different shapes and sizes, as depicted in the description of this product. The bristles are pretty skinny and easy to do detailed work. Good product, cheap, and it takes a little while to receive the item in the mail but it&#x27;s not that serious so I&#x27;m sure you can wait for it to arrive. I believe it took a month to get here, but as I said earlier, the sense of urgency for this product should be low so it does not need to be shipped any faster than it does, considering where it is coming from (I think Taiwan or something).</li>
            <li> Terrible product, I never did anything, I feel cheated , do not buy</li>
            <li> Amazing hands down!!&lt;br /&gt;I will definaly buy again for my sisters. I reccomend it</li>
            <li> Brushes are good but I had to cut all the striping brushes thin to my liking.They have some bounce back so overall yes I do recommend for nail artist and people who do nail designs.</li>
            <li> You get the quality you pay for</li>
            <li> Wish these were good but once u go to wipe them off the whole brush comes off it&#x27;s like they didn&#x27;t glue them togather and by the way don&#x27;t use acetone if ur doing nails the hairs fall out</li>
            <li> some of the brushes had the silver part not glued to the stick but you can glue it easily back on</li>
            <li> I ordered these for multiple purposes.  One I am a crafter and these brushes work great for small projects!  I also do my own nails and have a couple I use for that.  Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> They took a while to get to me but they seem to be good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> These are  agreat set of brushes! Met all my expectations I had for them. They were cheap, and came earlier than expected. I would def recomment these to anyone who loves to do nails.</li>
            <li> Good value to have a collection of brushes, but I can&#x27;t think of what I&#x27;d use half of them for- and I do ALOT of nail art.</li>
            <li> The brushes are just amazing! The bristles are sturdy and don&#x27;t shed like the brushes I&#x27;ve purchased from other stores. The quality is just great for the fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t very satisfied with these. Very cheap.</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about these brushes. They are fantastic to use and come in all the right sizes! They even got here way before i was expecting them too. DEFINITLEY worth the price.</li>
            <li> well I choose this rateing because I haven&#x27;t used this yet so I&#x27;m not sure if there is anything wring with this product. I guess I would get another if I need it again.</li>
            <li> I bought a set of 4 brushes for 15$ at a local beauty supply store and they are as good as these brushes! you really cant go wrong with these, awesome! Great variety and easy to use! Fun would recommend and buy again! :)</li>
            <li> As you can see in the picture, some are very wide, I don&#x27;t know what I will ever do with them. Some are also really long, so I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do with those either. There&#x27;s a couple that are good size, easy to use, and I really like them. They&#x27;re really helpful in making fun designs!</li>
            <li> I love the little brushes. so does my 4 year old. :) makes doing designs a lot more easy. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Very good product, excellent quality of the pain brushes, they are great. with this set of brushes I can do any design on my nails and my clients. The price and quality of the brushes is excellent.</li>
            <li> Great price and they work fine. You get more then you pay for really. The only thing is they take a long time to arrive</li>
            <li> Great. I am very happy with purchase, and it was exactly what I was looking for. I highly recommend for nails but also any art project</li>
            <li> Everything that&#x27;s in the picture is was I got. I&#x27;m happy with what I bought.</li>
            <li> The product has been fine.  No real complaints for the price paid.  I wish I would have ordered these locally since it took over a month to deliver as it came from China.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for nails it has every brush that you may need while you do your own nails.</li>
            <li> I love these they are better quality then expected. I use some for gel Nails and some for makeup.</li>
            <li> I waited for them to get here a little longer&lt;br /&gt;than expected...but I am very happy with the item.&lt;br /&gt;A must buy..&lt;br /&gt;For this price..I would never expect to get something like this!&lt;br /&gt;The brushes just feel so soft and professional,not rough and&lt;br /&gt;torn...&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will order it again!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you! Thank you ! Thank you!</li>
            <li> These brushes are fantastic.  I am very pleased with the quality and design of my new brushes.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  They were also a great value.</li>
            <li> This product was shipped very fast. They are nice and durable. They were bubbled wrapped the only  problem I had is One of my brushes were bent. :(  but overall its something i can work with!</li>
            <li> Nice variety of brushes that seem to be holding up well. Can make many designs from all the brushes in the package.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all. the tops to all the burshes ( you know, the brush part of it) fell off right out of the little bag they came in with. Disappointed. After adding some glue on the ones I planned to use, as soon as I dipped it in nail polish, the bristles fall off, ruining my attempt on chevron nails.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, pretty much. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they will get the job done..... kinda. Be sure not to get anything on the handles of the brushes. The white is just cheap paint that gets suuuuuper sticky &amp; smudged.</li>
            <li> I needed a selection of brushes for face painting as well as nail art. I ordered 5 sets of these for different uses. Shipping was fast considering it was international, the package was sent registered mail to protect sender and recipient, and it was packaged well. I did  have 2 brushes that had some minor imperfections (the fan brushes only) but they were easily fixed by trimming the stray bristles. I have only good things to say about my brush collection. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Thank you for a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Brushes are not that great they really don&#x27;t paint on the nail good and they don&#x27;t clean off that good either.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know nail art from a mail cart, but my daughter thought they were cool and pointed this one and that one out and explained how neat they were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very inexpensive way to put a smile on a young girls face.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as described.  I would recommend this item to anyone wanting to add to their nail art tools!.</li>
            <li> 15 pcs.  is a great deal for this price.  I&#x27;m still learning how to use the brushes at this point, but they seem adequate enough to do the job!</li>
            <li> Its workable brushes some one of them is to thick for lines but they are all decent brushes I like them I dont love them but they are ok.</li>
            <li> I do nail art for fun, not a professional so I just wanted a cheap set of brushes intended for nails that I could do cute little designs with. This kit contains pretty much any kind of brush I could need! They all work really well and there is great variety. However I had the brushes less than I week and one of the fan brushes lost all of its bristles. (I mean all of them) I was not being particularly rough with them or doing anything out of the ordinary, they had been passed between me and someone else, and were kind of rolled on a bed, but no mistreatment and the bristles just fell out. the other brushes seem to be fine, although I am treating them carefully! Even after using a few and cleaning them they seem to be holding up well, it was just the brown fan brush that seemed messed up. Although perhaps there was a flaw with just that one. Otherwise, really enjoying trying new designs I couldn&#x27;t do before!</li>
            <li> I love these. They came either in time or early, I can&#x27;t remember. I&#x27;m learning to do nail art and these are fun to use, there is a variety in the brushes and for the price I&#x27;d say these are good if you&#x27;re learning as well.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price on this. The shipping was quicker than anticipated which isn&#x27;t a bad thing either. The brushes are good quality. I haven&#x27;t had any fall out on any of them. The bristles are a bit stiff at first but if you take the time to work them out- they work well.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price! if your a beginner on nail art for fun or professionally this is the kit for you</li>
            <li> Excellent set for nail art. It&#x27;s more than great for the price sold. I would say it was  quite fast delivery. Thank you.</li>
            <li> So I recieved the set way before time and i am excited about that i used a brush and the whole head came off so i just used nail glue and put it back together !!! i really am enjoying these and i will be ordering from you guys again a very satisfied customer</li>
            <li> it works great! it came fast and when i put the nail polish on it works great i love it and would really recommend it for anybody who has time and patience for nail art i would bye it again but no need because it is lasting me a long time</li>
            <li> I didnt realize that there were so many different brushes to use!!  The creative possibilities are ENDLESS!!!!!!!!! I cant wait to use them all!</li>
            <li> THIS WAS PERFECT.  IT CAME ON TIME AND IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL.  THIS IS A GREAT GIFT IDEA OR SOMETHING FOR YOURSELF.</li>
            <li> these brushes are really handy. I actually brought them cause I needed to clean my laptop around the keys and these are perfect!</li>
            <li> I received these as a gift for Christmas (they were on my wishlist) These are decent, especially for the price, but I was hoping at least one of them would do really fine lines well, and none of them do.  The hairs splay out a lot, even with minimal pressure, and are straggly on the ends on some of the brushes, so it makes it hard to get neat lines.  Also, the metal barrel part completely fell off on 2 of the brushes– the first time I was using them– and it made a huge mess.  So, I had to hot glue them back on.  Some of the square brushes work great for doing french tips, so that is why I gave this set 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Ordered these for my daughter for Christmas.  She is really into nail design.  Lots of different brushes to choose from.  The plastic container it came in had a hole in it.  She doesn&#x27;t intend to keep it in the container so that wasn&#x27;t a problem.  Other than that she was very excited with them.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t tried it yet but for the price it&#x27;s a very great deal!i love the different type of brushes</li>
            <li> I bought these for purposes other than decorating fingernails, so I don&#x27;t know how they would work for nail art. I often need tiny  brushes that I use under a magnifier for details. These were a great price, so I thought I couldn&#x27;t go wrong. I am very pleased with the product and the wide assortment of small brushes in the set. It is as described, of nice quality, and it arrived within the stated time-frame.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. I like the quality and quantity of them. I highly recommend this set if you are looking to expand your creative side on your nails.</li>
            <li> This set was exactly what I hoped for...seem to be perfect for my needs...great value as well...I ordered a second set!</li>
            <li> Well they work great except for the fact that its impossible to have them clean. I&#x27;ve tried everything but they just wont get clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, good product, thanks very much&lt;br /&gt;Pretty, makes awesome designs, easy for a young teenager to use. Was bought for her as a gift but she uses it a lot</li>
            <li> These brushes are great. There is a ton of great things you can do with all the sizes. They seem to hold up pretty well. A great purchase</li>
            <li> These are a wonderful value and great addition to my nail art brushes, giving me a large range of options! I have no issues with the bristles and the handles and brush heads are well attached.&lt;br /&gt;I clean mine up with a no-lint pad and acetone without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent selection of brushes, excellent price.</li>
            <li> The seller of this item was a pleasure to work with...I had a problem with the previous order, but their prompt response made them wonderful to work with...They replaced my item with no problem...contacted me to apologize and gave me an option to replace or refund.  The item is nice.  My experience focuses mainly on the seller and their prompt response...I would order again....remember to clean item and then rinse with warm soapy water after use.</li>
            <li> Good quality and great price. Gives you plenty of different styles to create many different looks on your nails. Recommend.</li>
            <li> I have four girls so we like to do our nails. Great for experimenting and new design ideas. Also for craft projects.</li>
            <li> It was delivered on time...at first glance they seemed to be nice.&lt;br /&gt;But when used the brushes were stiff and pieces of brush&lt;br /&gt;Started to fall off. They are still useable, but for how long?&lt;br /&gt;The price for this product was a good deal, I just expected them&lt;br /&gt;To last a little longer.</li>
            <li> this set is exactly what is advertised.  now all I need is the paints that are supposed to be used with the fan brush so I can try that out.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great, came in good shape and within the estimated arrival time. The only down side is it takes so long to get to you but it does ship from all the way China, so it is understandable.</li>
            <li> I received my brushes today and I am very pleased. They work great! I have been able to finally do some designs I&#x27;ve been wanting to try! I will be ordering from this seller again :)</li>
            <li> I got the brushes and right when I took them out the bristles weren&#x27;t right. I&#x27;ll continue to try snipping uneven edges to make them right and hopefully they&#x27;ll be right eventually.</li>
            <li> These very tiny brushes work for when I have to be very detailed in the portraits I make. I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> When fresh, these brushes do great work. Cleanup is near impossible, howver, as the glue holding the bristles is extremely weak and the aluminum brace is weak as well. I dipped a brush too far into my cleaner the first time and managed to destroy the glue and essentially melt the paint off of the handle  even though the remover had been in contact with the brush for no more than a couple of seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, get these brushes only if you&#x27;re a first-timer and can&#x27;t find good cheap paintbrushes at the store. If you get them, be extremely careful and gentle when cleaning.</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price! I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase ☺</li>
            <li> these brushed frayed after one use not worth the wait shipping cost or money go to a art store and pay full price for these</li>
            <li> The brushes continuously shed fibers, and arrived in an unreasonable amount of time. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> They are alright some of the brushes are like getting nappy but overall good I can still use them just make sure that when you clean them with acetone you don&#x27;t leave me there for more than 4 seconds :)</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and a killer brush set! Wow! These are incredible and at a STEAL of a price. Absolutely recommend to anyone!!! Great for makeup, art, or nails!</li>
            <li> Not the greatest nail art brushes .</li>
            <li> Had been going to school for nail technology and these were a gift for that, they where amazing and exactly what I needed for class. (Yes I now have my licence!)</li>
            <li> These nail art brushes are a great deal for the price. They are good for small detail work when doing nail art designs at paintthatnaildotcom</li>
            <li> This set is wonderful! I have two of everything I need, plus some extra ones too. And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Really great brushes and so very affordable. Since they come from overseas, it takes awhile to get them but worth the wait</li>
            <li> Super cheaply made. Of no actual use.</li>
            <li> ehh, they&#x27;re not that great</li>
            <li> I love love love these! Out of all the nail art brushes I&#x27;ve used, these are my favorite! They&#x27;re versatile and clean easy! I had one of the handles come apart from the bristles, but it was easily fixed with nail glue. I would recommend and buy more!</li>
            <li> These came earlier than estimated delivery date. These a really nice brushes. Been using them and they work well with all my nail art designs.</li>
            <li> you cant be the prize and you can do a lot with it. It all brand new when arrived. Really love it</li>
            <li> The brushes aren&#x27;t of the highest quality, but they serve the function well enough. The only problem is that I&#x27;m not sure what I would need all of the brushes for.</li>
            <li> These are great. I got them for my daughter. It comes exactly what you see. The quality seems great. The price is right. Try them.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the quality of set. It was as described and a great experience. (It took a little long coming from China, but I didn&#x27;t expect as quick as coming from U.S.). Thank you</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect so many brushes for the price but when it arrived, I was amazed at the amount and type of brushes included.  Great value.  Took a little while to arrive but that was expected.  I would have liked some type of tracking information but for the price, it was acceptable.</li>
            <li> Good number of brushes for the price. I am not using them for nails, will use for fine work on greeting cards.</li>
            <li> These brushes and other specialty detail tools  are wonderful.  Do not pass these up.  Item came as pictured and have stood up to cleaning.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The pricing was ideal for 15 brushes overall, as going to the store costs more just for 3-5 brushes. They&#x27;re of fairly good quality, as they&#x27;re not too rough. They&#x27;re just the right size for nail art though, as you need small/tiny brushes for detailed designs. One of my brushes came slightly dented in at the metal handle part, but it&#x27;s not too bad that it hinders the usability. Overall, I can see why this is so popular among nail artists :)</li>
            <li> These work so well, came in so much faster than expected even though it came from Hong Kong. Works great and is worth the wait, for the price paid.</li>
            <li> Just what she wanted.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter and she loves it... Fast shipping</li>
            <li> do not use acetone with these as it will take the cheap white paint off of the brushes and makes them sticky and it gets everywhere. cant be used with real nail polish as there is not a way to clean them with out using nail polish remover or acetone. the metal that is supposed to hold the brushes together is loose.</li>
            <li> The brushes broke right after a week</li>
            <li> Nice set,  although a couple of the brush tops pulled off with the clear protective ends.  But that eas easily fixed.</li>
            <li> Everything I need for my nail art is in this set.</li>
            <li> Great item...fun to use.</li>
            <li> These brushes are perfect! They are great for just about any type of nail art! The bristles themselves arrive very stiff but, run them under hot water for a bit and they are good to go! To clean it&#x27;d be easier if you had 100% acetone nail polish.I recommend these to anyone interested in doing intricate designs! Great buy and can a lot sooner then expected!</li>
            <li> Low Quality Deplete itself within a few days of use</li>
            <li> Love this set. A brush for every use. The fine ones are perfect for making flowers.</li>
            <li> the brush fell off the handle of a few of them, nothing a little super clue couldn&#x27;t do, but still.</li>
            <li> all above were for the same person.</li>
            <li> I received my package yesterday and got right to work with them. happy how my nails look at this moment.</li>
            <li> Excited to make good art with these tools!!</li>
            <li> Horrible! You truly get what you pay for, they took six months for them to actually get to me! Tips fall off of the stick and brushes are horrible!!</li>
            <li> I got these brushes as a gift.  Some of the brushes had stray bristles, but all you need to do is trim off the stray bristles.  My real problem is that after a few uses the nail polish gets caked onto the brush. I tried soaking them in nail polish remover but the paint on the handle comes off and stains everything  in sight.  Also, I&#x27;ve experienced instances where the metal brush tip falls off the handle,but that is easily corrected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I will be buying a new set that hopefully is easier to clean, but overall it is an ok set for the price</li>
            <li> Thank you for the good item and the fast shipping! Item as discribed! The brushes are really  good and now  I can design  my  nails for my own</li>
            <li> I was worried that for the price I paid, I would receive flimsy broken brushes... however these are fantastic! I ordered two sets and am sure they will last me for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked through several different brush sets, such as [[ASIN:B005BG02BU MASH Professional 15 piece Nail Art Brush Kit Set]], [[ASIN:B000VDEQJW Debra Lynn Professional 6 piece Nail Art Set]] but the first option had way too many brushes for me and the second had some fairly poor reviews -- much like many of the other brush sets. This one had great reviews but I did notice that the seller shipped from Hong Kong and was worried it would take far too long for it to reach me, or even get lost. I got them in about two weeks (1 week before the estimated delivery date) and this was definitely worth the wait. They arrived padded between protective styrofoam and each of the brushes came covered in a protective cap (with the exception of the two fan brushes) in a soft plastic pocket w/ flap lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO glad I grabbed these! I&#x27;ve used the fine brushes a few times now for some nail art and they work perfectly. I use nail polish remover and a cotton pad to clean them and they work brilliantly every time.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and matched description</li>
            <li> I liked these brushes because they are easy to clean and the price makes them disposable if need be.  I use a couple of them to even apply my eye liner and shadow!</li>
            <li> Great price for an  amazing set. Just be sure to use non acetone polish remover for clean up. I am 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> They are very nice for the price!!</li>
            <li> love this product. it came faster than i expected. package was not damaged. i love these brushes, makes my nail art work so much easier and better.</li>
            <li> They are what they are worth... Cheap small brushes. I marked it down a star because a few of the brushes in the middle were bent. Not worth going threw an exchange/refund but still would be nice to have an undamaged product arrive.</li>
            <li> two brushes were broken when arrived but we can make it work like Tim Gun says. Love the fan brushes very nice set.</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes and it was a great deal, however, it took forever for them to get to my house. It took well over a month for me to receive my brushes. The product was of good quality.</li>
            <li> I ordered these to expand my manicure techniques and I was not at all disappointed with what I got!! This is a great set for a beginner and an excellent price!!</li>
            <li> The main reason I ordered this set was for the white fan brush to do art work on my nails.  The first time I used it, the tip came unglued from the wooden stick.  If I use it again, which I had planned on doing a lot, I&#x27;ll have to super glue it bad and hope it holds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed to say the least.  :(</li>
            <li> My daughter will love these tools for doing her nails.  Have used similar items, but these are better quality and a great price for the product.</li>
            <li> I got all 15 n they are very light weight. But the medal are ALREADY. Comin apart from the wood pencil part!! They all work jus fine but i think i may hv to super glue all the pieces together</li>
            <li> These have become my go to nail art brushes ever since I purchased them. I spend a lot of time doing my nails and creating new designs for my blog, so a good set of brushes is crucial to have in my arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before making the purchase, I shopped around quite a bit and took the time to read the Amazon reviews. I was a bit leary of this set, given the inexpensive price tag,but figured I really couldn&#x27;t go wrong with 15 different brushes for $2.00 and free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really pleased that I went ahead and took a chance on these brushes. They have withstood many uses so far, and do not shed at all. You will want to be sure to clean them thoroughly and properly after each use though, or the bristles will stick together and the brush will not work well in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, WELL worth the money I paid and they are still going strong a year later.</li>
            <li> very good quality for the cost. shipping is from asia so don&#x27;t order this if you need it exactly by a certain date.  i paint small models and cards so i got this set to get a variety of small brushes.</li>
            <li> Such an awesome treat! These give me so many options, which is important cause I&#x27;m a bit of a nail freak !</li>
            <li> Great price for this set of brushes! Work great!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Very nice!</li>
            <li> worth to buy, good quality</li>
            <li> Used for painting small details on canvas, sculpture and more.</li>
            <li> the metal part comes off the stick.</li>
            <li> Delivery:&lt;br /&gt;The brushes were delivered in a clear vinyl pouch.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes with wide-set bristles were a bit &amp;#34;smushed.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance:&lt;br /&gt;The metal brush heads are not well attached to the wooden handles, but you can just as easily pop them back on with a bit of glue.&lt;br /&gt;When using these brushes with some simple nail polishes, it did not seem to be able to hold on to the nail polish well enough for me to apply it easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased these on a whim, and they will serve their purposes for a short period of time. Perhaps I am doing something wrong in the actual use, but I felt that if I wanted the brushes to apply nail polish as desired, I would have to glob a bunch of nail polish on the tips of my brushes, which is not very nice in both affect or conservation of polish...</li>
            <li> The brushes fall off a lot</li>
            <li> So many brushed for so many designs. They&#x27;re easy to clean and are durable.</li>
            <li> Love them! very useful!</li>
            <li> Not the best. Several of the metal parts with the brush on it fell of the day I got them. The bristles fall out easily. I love the fan brushes though!</li>
            <li> Awesome!!! They came early!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Not bad product.  The only problem is that for some reason, on some brushes some hairs got longer and that made difficult to do the decorations. So i had to cut them with scissors to make them even.</li>
            <li> For some reason it takes a month to get these things, but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be great when the arrive, if I even remember that I ordered them.</li>
            <li> Great good quality awsome price</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes are bent and/or broken. The ones that I would use the most!! So sad about this!</li>
            <li> A great variety of brushes and tools for creating endless designs on nails. I have also used to paint with on canvas and wood. Brushes are sturdy and clean up nicely. Very good price without sacrificing quality.</li>
            <li> some ruined quickly but thats okayy cuz i just needed them for a while. but they were a very good price in general</li>
            <li> Good variety of brushes and great price! Seems like a great set for those who enjoy doing nail art. would repurchase</li>
            <li> Perfect brushes I still use after over a year from buying them.&lt;br /&gt;All came in perfect condition although they seemed to have been stepped on in package - there was a footprint! But they weren&#x27;t damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love them.</li>
            <li> i use them every other day it is amazing to me the are useful helpful i really like it. Amazing</li>
            <li> They work just fine and I love using them on my nails to get my nail art done. The tips of these brushes are fine so it can be very ideal to use for painting little details. Good buy!</li>
            <li> amazing.. great quality.. always wanted a set like this.. doing my daughters nails is so much more exciting with these designs i can create!</li>
            <li> It came early and the brushes are nice but the tops come off very easily.</li>
            <li> Despite the two tips that came off; and I glued back on, for the amount I paid, this was a steal.  They work, they are wonderful, they don&#x27;t release the hairs as most cheap brushes usually do.  They are great, even for other such art medias, not just nail.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. I use acrylic paint on my nails over a top coat and they work very well for different techniques and detail. I use alcohol to remove acrylic paint so no acetone. Although the one time I did use acetone it did mess up the ends of one of the flat top brushes. I assume if I let it sit in acetone it may ruin the brushes as other reviewers have said.</li>
            <li> These are fun to play with and figure out what they can do. Great for nail art.</li>
            <li> For the price you need to expect them not to be excellent quality.  if You don&#x27;t mind Trimming the bristles then this will work fine. Expect a long wait if you live in USA.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Has described by the seller.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! And at such a low price, these tools are sturdy. No matter how much you tug at the bristles of the brush, the don&#x27;t come off. I really like how there are fifteen brushes in this set. This gives me the variety that I need to do multiple nail art designs. The most specific reason why I bought these brushes was because they look so nice in white! They are so pretty! I love these tools, they are wonderful!</li>
            <li> I was very happy to see that all the brushes were in the package but there was a slight problem. Every time I removed the clear caps of the brushes the top of the brush would come off. A little bit of krazy flue fixed the problem.</li>
            <li> For a set of 15, this is a really good value. Everything came on time and in perfect condition. I&#x27;ve only been able to use one brush so far and it does the job well.</li>
            <li> I order 15 Nail painting pen brush, Month ago and this is the time I haven&#x27;t received, no even the money or the product.  I am very up-sad.</li>
            <li> The nail brushes are a little flimsy. However, for the price you can&#x27;t really complain. Spend a little extra and get art/paint brushes from a store like Michaels and you&#x27;ll get better quality.</li>
            <li> These look like they will be great brushes. I&#x27;m starting to buy item for Christmas. My girls will love them.</li>
            <li> received it on time. package good. my first nail tool set, can&#x27;t wait to ues it. the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used the brushes very much, but so far they are very nice. Exactly as pictured. Product came within expected delivery period. Very satisfied with purchase, would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a great value and surprisingly arrived pretty darn quick for where it ships from, China I believe?&lt;br /&gt;I love these. I use them for face painting and detailing my little cars as well&lt;br /&gt;Many uses&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these :)&lt;br /&gt;Note that the fans are uber tiny just as an fyi</li>
            <li> I purchased this set of brushes for my daughter who loves to paint/decorate her own nails. This set arrived quickly and was exactly as shown. She has used it multiple times so far and they clean up very well. Not sure how the quality and durability would be if used in a salon setting, but for home use, this was perfect!</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY useful &amp; quite well constructed.  Shipping &amp; arrival very quick.</li>
            <li> They are what they say they are and good value haven&#x27;t lost any bristles and I&#x27;ve been using them for a week or two :)</li>
            <li> I love this product. These brush&#x27;s are awesome. They are very easy to use and great to work with when painting my nails.</li>
            <li> Like it. Its has a variety of brushes that can be used for multiple purposes like a fan brush nail look</li>
            <li> This set is very good for the price. But upon arrival some of the brush heads cane off. But nothing that a little super glue doesn&#x27;t fix it.</li>
            <li> Great price, durable bristles and sturdy wooden handles! I haven&#x27;t had a single issue with any of these brushes and am known for being a little hard on my tools. I do a lot of nail art, both gel polish and regular, and they&#x27;ve held up to a decent amount of cleaning in acetone and other sterilizing chemicals. Love them and considering ordering a second set!</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes so I could do detailed manicures, though my hands are not the most steady. Excellent product though, I was able to do very detailed manicures</li>
            <li> Maybe I just don&#x27;t know how to use these but they did nothing foe me haha I don&#x27;t even know</li>
            <li> these are super!!!&lt;br /&gt;order a few sets&lt;br /&gt;some for my nail tech daughter and some for me.as I like to paint.</li>
            <li> 5 weeks waiting, Really?  I mean, REALLY?  I didn&#x27;t order an investigation into the failures of the Obama care website.  You are probably ordering this for a kid, they cant wait that long.  Ended up buying elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Great price for some great brushes! They look exactly like the picture and will be great to use for Nail Art!</li>
            <li> I got the package on the day it said for the arrival, so I was happy about that. The only thing that i disliked was thet in my package one of the fan brushes bristles were coming out, and the dotting tool&#x27;s head came out. i was disheartened by that but there was one more fan brush that i had in that pack to use. Also the dotting tool came broken, but i do have a pack of 5 already. So it wasn&#x27;t so bad getting two pieces broken because i wasn&#x27;t going t use them anyway.</li>
            <li> This item has not made it to me again im very upset that is has been over a month without any feedback</li>
            <li> There are 15 pieces, however many are repeats or way too similar to be used differently. Also if you use acetone or get it near, it takes off the paint and gets very messy. The fan brushes both came a bit bent/ weird. However I would recommend it because the price is great, and there are about 6 brushes that I am absolutely in love with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I have lost even more brushes because they do not clean well</li>
            <li> Not fantastic, but i got what I paid for. Works well, although a few of the brushes were unnecessary (the really big ones, how am I supposed to paint my nails with something twice the size?). Be sure to clean and maintain</li>
            <li> so far so good on these brushes.  Haven&#x27;t lost any bristles.  Just don&#x27;t get any nail remover on the white part of the brush becasue that is paint that will come off on your hands or surfaces.</li>
            <li> Good nail brushes are important for great nail art. I didn&#x27;t expect much because these were cheap, but they get the job done surprisingly well. I would definitely buy them again. The variety also helps.</li>
            <li> Loved the product. Price couldn&#x27;t be beat anywhere.  You get so many for the price. I don&#x27;t really know what to do with some of them, but the others were great! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I ordered theses May 14 and was supposed to get them by June 10 - June 24&lt;br /&gt;but I received them yesterday on the 27th!! I was so elated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that, they are exactly as pictured and I love the quality of the brushes!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to anyone!!!</li>
            <li> Loved how many there was but the heads on some were off of the sticks, and then some of the brushes did not have protesters covers on them as others did, will not be ordering from this again.unhappy.</li>
            <li> The fan brushes are cheap but for the price, i&#x27;m certainly happy with my purchase. i should have gotten two orders one just for back up.</li>
            <li> All my expectations were full filled and thanks to them now I can make all my desired designs... wonderful and awesome for all types of nails</li>
            <li> I had to cut the wood part down. Way to long and hard to use. Okay for the price.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Very low quality. don&#x27;t work well at all</li>
            <li> Ordered this item as a gift for a teenager that enjoys doing nails. The Item is cute however I received some of the brushes bent from the top silver portion. Received before ETA. Happy with item</li>
            <li> these brushes were purchased as a Christmas gift for my sister, who recently got a gel nail kit. Not sure about quality because I don&#x27;t know if she started using them yet. They looked just as pictured, except that they arrived in a cheap, disposable plastic bag instead of the reusable package they are pictured in my seller in last picture posted.</li>
            <li> Was looking for brushes to help me reach desired effects and these were the perfect ones. Only $2 and fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> Brushes fray easily, but with care they are a great price.</li>
            <li> i use these brushes on my nails close to every other day, simply because they are so much fun to use. i&amp;#34;ve had mine for over 2 months now, and i have yet to loose a single fiber! NO SHEDDING WHATS SO EVER!!! i was shocked at the quality of these brushes!! i&#x27;ll probably buy two more sets just in case i ever loose them. and as long as i wipe them off on a cotton ball soaked in nail polish remover they come completely clean, even the white brushes!!</li>
            <li> Love this item. I got all inspired watching youtube nail art tutorials and this set is just what I needed to help me create the different designs I wanted.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great item!</li>
            <li> Perfect set of brushes and tools to do just about any kind of nail art you can think of !! I am very surprised at how well these brushes have held up, and how well they are designed for articulate nail art. Very pleased !</li>
            <li> A great buy for anybody who loves painting nails and doing nail art. Lots of different tips for many different designs. Also a low price!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anybody who loves doing nail art. They&#x27;re cheap and super great nail art brushes that I use whenever I do my nails.</li>
            <li> I was not going to spend a lot of money on nail paint brushes.  I bought some cheap ones on Amazon before that were OK, but lost bristles after a few uses.  These are nice.  They actually remind me more of artist&#x27;s brushes.  I love the variety too, and they are the same price as you&#x27;d normally get only a few brushes!  I even took one of the fan brushes to apply a face acid peel to my skin.  It works well.</li>
            <li> These are amazing nail detail brushes, especially for the price! Love them! My friend bought me a set for Christmas so now I&#x27;ve got 30 brushes to do my nail art with. :)</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes when I was first starting to get into nail art and I absolutely LOVE them. They are fantastic and they are perfect for any design. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The head of some of the brushes came off on first use. I only use a few of them, so not a big problem.</li>
            <li> This is no joke, no rip off. I&#x27;m seriously allover the whole concept of cheap nail stuff from China. It&#x27;s high quality. Like legit.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these but when they finally came I was disappointed.The fan brushes were so small and there bristles weren&#x27;t fan out like in the picture the thing holding it fell off before I even used it.On some of the other brushes the hairs (or bristles) were falling off or sticking out I haven&#x27;t used these yet but when I do I&#x27;ll write a review.I probably could of gotten better and cheaper ones on eBay. The one thing I did like about them was that there small so i could probably make pretty small designs on my nails.</li>
            <li> penny wise and pound foolish for buying this product.  the heads are coming off and the paint in nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> These are decent quality brushes!! And the fact that they were so inexpensive makes them the BEST starter brushes for beginners or they make the most perfect back up set ;)</li>
            <li> cheap, work well and used for art--not nails. Cannot beat the price and they actually are not a bad quality. They make a very fine line with the tiny points, each point is individually covered with a plastic protector to preserve the bristles, and they worked just fine. Cannot comment on their longevity, but for the price, who cares! Well worth the long wait from China mail. I could not have found brushes this fine in a craft shop for anything close to the price here.</li>
            <li> required for all crafting and cake paintinggreat for christmas and other holiday art that require fine touches.  this is what i have been looking for.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so cool! I make nails like a pro now lol!! I don&#x27;t use the big ones however being my nails arent that wide.</li>
            <li> just got my brushes can&#x27;t wait to try them out:-) i would recommend theses to anyone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  thanks will be buying again</li>
            <li> Loved this product I am very much into nail art and this just makes it easier and fun to continue</li>
            <li> thank you very much,i love it,so amazing.now i can get my design so much better,really great,i would refer my friends to buy this and i think am gonna buy it again</li>
            <li> The brush set is ok. I bought it for my girls because the love doing their nails. I also love that it was so cheap and it arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Lots of variety brushes (still didn&#x27;t figure out what to use the fan ones for though). Although the white paint on the brushes do come off and get sticky if you have acetone residue on your fingers. But other than that, so far so good.</li>
            <li> Was cheap enough for $2 bucks so why not? Well some of them are great! And others are bent &amp; the hairs are uneven so we just chopped them to the length that we wanted &amp; they work ok. They are worth what I paid for them $2.00</li>
            <li> Wow, these usually cost a lot more sold seperately. This is a great find! Very nice addition to our nail salon! Definately recommend!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They&#x27;re so nice and very easy to use. Use non Acetone nail polishes to clean!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for me as I am just starting out with nail art and designs. They arrived were exactly as described.I love these brushes! And at such a low price thanks.</li>
            <li> These brushes were such a great price, and I love all the different shapes. I have yet to use all of these brushes, but the ones I have used have been great! I am still learning how to make designs and freehand paint my nails.</li>
            <li> These are nice brushes for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> My set arrived in a timely fashion, considering that it was an international shipment that I didn&#x27;t have to pay for. I&#x27;ve used them to do a full one-stroke flower design, including leaves and vines. There is a bit of instability where the metal caps attach to the shaft, but none have separated. The brushes stand up well to washing with soap and cold water and dry fairly quickly. The shafts are painted white so if you try to remove any accidental polish application with a remover, it will more than likely come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with these brushes.</li>
            <li> this seller sent me two orders i had to double check to make sure i didnt purchase two and i didnt. but overall these brushes are great. a nice variety for a few bucks plus free shipping you cant pass up this deal. trust me these brushes are better to have than buying nail polishes with the skinny brushes which cost more than a regular size bottle. that bugs me. but i recommend these to anyone who loves to do nail designs.</li>
            <li> One of the brushes was bent</li>
            <li> These brushes are top quality and easy to use!  Thanks to these brushes it looks like a professional does my nail designs now!</li>
            <li> I have not yet received this order. I&#x27;m hoping it will come soon, as I dearly love brushes and these looked like ones I really could use.</li>
            <li> I love my 15pc nail art brush pen set it finally arrived and it arrived safely and carefully packaged and it was what i expected and i will definately be ordering from you again in the near future.</li>
            <li> These are revolutionary in the sense that I haven&#x27;t seen anything like this before.&lt;br /&gt;They do the job, but the reason for my 3 star rating is because the bristles tend to strip off when they come in contact with nail polish remover. It is possible I got a bad lot, but when that happened to 4 different ones, I suspected that it was a product flaw.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is good value for money and recommended if you can take good care of it.&lt;br /&gt;Again. for the price, this is a steal.</li>
            <li> The brushes work very good. I love them all. They make doing nail art a whole lot easier. I got them within two days after ordering from Crazy Cart.</li>
            <li> These brushes work well on what you need to do on your nails, specially doing lines! I just tried it doing my nail&#x27;s border and it was so much easy!!</li>
            <li> These brushes come with everything and for the price they are a great beginner set.  My daughter and I have really started getting into creating art with our nails and this set is going to be a great addition to our collection.  There is every type of brush you can think of to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold, bristles seem sturdy but I&#x27;ve only used them a couple of times. Very lightweight, great set for the price. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Most of the brushes seem great. The white fan brush just fell apart as soon as I took it out of the package. The rest seem fine, there is also a metal dotting tool included which is an added bonus. Other than the white fan brush they seem pretty good so far, but I will update this once I get a chance to use some of them.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time. Not worth buying.</li>
            <li> These are SUPER STINKY - like pure chemicals.  Plus they are so cheap.  Fairly soft, but I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell - threw them out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this set for about two years and I love it. My only complaint is that the coating on the handles comes off after some useage. No big deal but that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> I figured since I got a steal with the price for these brushes that they would have been horrible quality but they aren&#x27;t! They came packaged in a plastic case with small bristle protectors. Very sturdy and strong brush handles. Everything came as described. Great deal!</li>
            <li> The quality of these brushes is not the best.  A few of them have had the brush and reinforcement slip off leaving me only with a wooden stick.  I&#x27;d splurge for a more pro set next time.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to be delivered August. 10-26 but it came July 27. Neatly packaged and the brushes are great would buy again 😃</li>
            <li> Excellent for nail art!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my granddaughter along with some rhinestones and tape, she is just new to experimenting with nail polish.  A great bargain for a set this size!</li>
            <li> packaged well.  received quickly.  they look fine.  have not used but in appearance they look better than what you would find at a dollar store.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for all you have done for me. Good luck to you in future sales.&lt;br /&gt;Have a nice rest of the day&lt;br /&gt;goodbye</li>
            <li> they work but they get stuck together the britles</li>
            <li> Great variety. I use them to do sweet nail designs! :)&lt;br /&gt;Very happy</li>
            <li> I have use most of them they are perfect and the price is even better i have bouth more expensive ones but this ones are better than the one i allredy have as a nail artist this are kne of the best</li>
            <li> Giving it 4 stars because I have not used them.  However, based on look and feel they appear to be great brushes for the price</li>
            <li> $2.62/ free shipping- ships from Hong Kong, how do they sell it so cheap?  Really worth the money. I haven&#x27;t used it yet but looks like good quality.</li>
            <li> Received it as expected. Looks just like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to test the product, but it looks sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to try it with designs during this holiday season.</li>
            <li> Perfect brushes. Love them ♥</li>
            <li> Ok, you get what you pay for. Some of the hairs came out after a few times. I would recommend for someone that was not a professional and just practicing, and not tidying on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Not the best quality, but fine for the price. Then again, these were for my 9 yo daughter.</li>
            <li> HAVE NOT USED THEM YET BUT I LIKE THEM</li>
            <li> These look well made and the price was certainly right.  They are to be a gift along with nail polish for a young teenage friend.  Therefore, they don&#x27;t have to be professional quality.</li>
            <li> lots of nice brushes - only 4 stars because they took to long to come!</li>
            <li> These are very pretty as well as functional. I&#x27;ve watched YouTube and the lady&#x27;s who do nails show u what to do with all the brushes but how to clean the brushes. Thanks, kay</li>
            <li> As described. Would recommend seller.</li>
            <li> The brushes seem to be OK for a young girl to try embellishing her fingernails.  A couple of them are probably worthless, but the price is right.  I would buy them again for a young girl.</li>
            <li> I bought these and a few other items as gifts for my manicurist, who does not have much time for ordering things like this. She was delighted and does use them.</li>
            <li> amazing quality for the price,</li>
            <li> I plan to use these to practice brush art on cakes. I didn&#x27;t want to invest too much until I could see if it was something I was interested in learing more. They seem decent for the money.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter is thrilled to have them great price and fast delivery team</li>
            <li> I got my brushes in the mail yesterday and I absolutely love them already! So many to choose from and one for every line you want to make on your nails. :)</li>
            <li> The product works great. It just took a a long long time to get here. But great overall! Works great.</li>
            <li> Not that impressed. One of them came broken. And some of the other brushes had nail polish on them. It wasn&#x27;t that bad</li>
            <li> These brushes are cool! but the bristles are a little cheap,they aren&#x27;t very flexible or soft, but they work great for nail art.</li>
            <li> These get the job done. they were a little hard at first but after cleaning them they are softer and much easier to design with.great price as well!</li>
            <li> Great price and came a lot quicker than expected. This came with all pieces and just in time for new nail art.</li>
            <li> I love the brushes and the quality. The only problem I had was the strong smell as I opened the package.</li>
            <li> The product is so great and extremely cheap. I  cannot wait to start making cool designs with the brushes! Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> These are a nice variety of brushes and seem to cover a large spectrum of nail art tasks.  That being said, I do think the quality of the bristles on some of them should be able to produce a nicer paint flow, therefore only four stars.</li>
            <li> Amazing colors for spring and summer!!!&lt;br /&gt;To make the color really  pop I always apply a coat of while polish and it makes all the difference plus you use less polish.</li>
            <li> these are amazing! They work so perfectly. they exceeded my expectations. I am really happy i purchased these pen brushes. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I love my 15 pcs nail art painting pen brush. It is get in my hand n easy to hold. I love it</li>
            <li> My daughter ordered these and has been enjoying them. It took a couple weeks to arrive but that is not bad since it was coming from out of the country.</li>
            <li> they are perfect for making my nail designs and at a great price. i would recommend this product for doing detailed nail designs</li>
            <li> The order was recived sooner than expected. I would&#x27;ve given this review 5 stars but one of the brushes was broken. Other than that everything else was fine. I would recommend this product hopefully yours doesn&#x27;t come broken the brushes are really good for nail designs.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 15pcs nail art painting pen brush kit and it arrived early, and the brushes are good quality, so don&#x27;t wait just go ahead and order, the price is right!!</li>
            <li> These came promptly. Great assortment of brushes for the price! I paid $6 for one brush and these were better quality! Great buy!</li>
            <li> i use them for nail art they do fine.no sheding and the slide with no problem. effortless will order agin when needing replacing</li>
            <li> I am vvery glad for the variety of these brushes and I also love the fact they are not weak brushes great price great brushes worth the buy!</li>
            <li> It took a little longer for delivery....but for the amount of money your paying for the product. AWESOME!...my daughter is into nail art ...and I just don&#x27;t have the skills...these brushes help out a lot...</li>
            <li> love them i find my self using my brushes a lot i really like them good quality. be careful when dipping them on acetone they will damage the paint that was use to make them white. so just clean the tips dont dip them all in their i should have known better i forgot that happens</li>
            <li> The brushes started falling apart after one use and the paint just peeled off when I cleaned them.</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing these brushes for my nail art and tiny detail I love to do on my paintings. Easy to clean, the glue holding the brushes together is sturdy, and I will purchase them again in the future.</li>
            <li> Just arrived today and had to try them. First of all,the bristles are soft yet firm enough for any nail art task. The photo provided show&#x27;s two fan brushes, the white bristles fan out a little more then 1&amp;#34;, and  is slightly  fluffier then the yellow one. The yellow one fans outs about 1 1/4&amp;#34; .Both measure about  7 1/2 &amp;#34; in length from end of bristle to end of handle of brush. The smallest brush is about 5 1/4 &amp;#34; with a wider handle for  better control,the brush is about 1/4&amp;#34; long. All but  the fan brushes come with clear rubber open ended sleeves covering the bristles. They all average about 7-7 1/2&amp;#34; long from end of brush to end of handles. The longest brush is 8&amp;#34; long,including the bristle being 1&amp;#34; itself. Included in this set is a small pointed dotting tool. These brushes are very light weight and also come in a clear plastic flap closing pouch. One more thing to add, is I clean all my new brushes before storing them or using them,when doing this I immediately noticed there were no loose bristles,none on my fingertips or sink. They dried without losing their shape at all. That can be important to most nail art fanatics. Again,buy them &amp; try them. THANKS.</li>
            <li> I used these for standard painting as opposed to using them for nails, great idea and great value! Good buy!</li>
            <li> They where paintbrushes but the metal part came off of the wood part way to easily. I got them about a week ago and just started using them, the first time I did anything with them the metal part fell off, so I had to wood glue them back together.&lt;br /&gt;  Moral of this... always have wood glue around! **or don&#x27;t buy cheaply made stuff**</li>
            <li> I was not one for design till I bought these brushes to do my nails with and they make the world of designing your nails so much easier . I have created things on my nails that I thought were impossible to do.Having fun with this product and will recommend it to all my friends with nails to do!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  One of the brushes head popped off the second time I used it.</li>
            <li> good price for good brushes. DEFFFFinitely will buy again!!!!</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes came apart.</li>
            <li> The brushes are good quality as far as the bristles go, but the farrels are coming off of the handles</li>
            <li> looking forward to using this set to decorate my dogs toenails, I am a groomer.  Lots of different size brushes to accomplish a lot of different looks</li>
            <li> I got 2 pack of this brushes it&#x27;s kind of strong not really cheap but nice I also use it for my makeup at times</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for the price a lot the end came off and I had to glue them back on but other then that they are ok</li>
            <li> These definatly do not hold the pain like they were expected to. I can&#x27;t get many designs because the they wont hold the paint. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome! It even comes with a dotting pen! But the brushes aren&#x27;t as fine as they look in the picture so it&#x27;s hard to make small designs. But great purchase. Would buy again</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes to use for my cake decorating business and they work great!  15 pcs is really more than I needed, though, so I gave a few to my daughter to use for her nails.  She has had such success with them!  Great find at a great price!  Definitely recommend for purchase.</li>
            <li> My brushes arrived in great shape, other than one brush being bent during the mailing process. They work great and it is an awesome deal for $3.00. I wish it came with more dotting tools but I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I love to use these tools when I give myself a manicure the tools make it easy to give myself a manicure or a pedicure! I absolutely love theses tools!</li>
            <li> Been wanting some brushes for soo long. But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using these with polish, it&#x27;s hard to take off. More like acrylic paint, which in my opinion is easier to do details with</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten these yet so not sure what to say about them. I look forward to seeing what they look like.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any of these brushes yet, but they&#x27;re good to have on hand. The price of these brushes are a steal..good buy!</li>
            <li> Great selection of brushes for an amazing price. Really cool to paint miniatures on a budget. When the brushes wear out (usually after a few sessions of use) just dispose of them and move on to a new brush! Beats the $15 brushes I was having to shell out for and really take careful care of. They are also really great for having friends over to paint. Just hand them a few brushes and let them go at it! You don&#x27;t have to worry about them messing up your really expensive, special brushes.</li>
            <li> Product is as described and came fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Great quality! The bristles are very nice! Very slender. For the price, you absolutely can not beat this!</li>
            <li> I got these for fine touches in paintin oils or acrylics....can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten a chance to try them out yet but so far from what I saw I think they&#x27;ll help me achieve th manicure of my dreams.</li>
            <li> These brushes were alright for me. When they came in, I was surprised at the quality (maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have been since I paid very little for them), but the paint was uneven on some of the brushes and one of the brushes seemed to be falling apart. The metal part that was holding the bristles seeming to be lopsided compared to all the other brushes so I had to put some arm muscle into it and move it with some pliers. The medium size bristles worked well for some designs, but the very thin ones was hard to work with since I couldn&#x27;t make clean strokes with my nail polish to make intricate designs. Sometimes, the bristles would come out when I was washing them even if I was gentle which made me nervous thinking if I were to paint my nails, were one of the bristles going to come off in the process?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if you are just starting off at nail art, I would recommend this. They are inexpensive and you get a lot of brushes. That way, you can save your money and buy quality ones. They weren&#x27;t completely horrible, but they certainly weren&#x27;t the best. Also, please be careful with getting nail polish remover on the handles. The nail polish eats away at the paint and the paint gets all over your hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no professional but these are amazing i made christmas trees and tons of other designs already. I would recommened.</li>
            <li> Makes doing art on my nails much easier. The only problem is the white paint on the brushes will wipe of with some nail polish removers.</li>
            <li> I ordered on the 23rd of November. Estimated delivery date is December 19, 2012 - January 8, 2013. I got it on the 18th. It arrived a day earlier than the estimated delivery date! That&#x27;s 25 days. The packaging was not bad. The brushes are exactly like the picture shown. The brushes I got don&#x27;t shed. I actually received two of the same brushes, and end up not getting a dotting tool which I was looking forward to, but the price is so good that it does not bother me much. Overall it&#x27;s a really good brush set to get and especially for the price! The seller I got it from was 360 Dealz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I tested out these brushes, they work well but it leaves a stain from the nail polish and will not come out.</li>
            <li> the 3 stars is mostly because I am still trying to figure out what all I can do with these.  the price is great and delivery didn&#x27;t take as long as I thought it would have.  haven&#x27;t had any issues with the product, using and cleaning.</li>
            <li> I gave this 4 out of 5 stars as a few of the bristles have fallen out of the fan brush. I haven&#x27;t had any issues otherwise with the product, and find them to be a great addition to my growing collection of nail artistry items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mostly use the brushes for cleanup, and the thin brushes for my attempts at more intricate designs. I like that they&#x27;re user friendly even for someone such as myself who is really just winging it, and also very easy to clean. They fit nicely in my collection, and store easily.</li>
            <li> WE HAVE NOT GOT THIS ITEM YET AND IT IS 4 JAN 2013.  WE WERE SUPPOSE TO GET THIS ON 27 DEC 2012.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I regret in buying these brushes, is that I should have ordered 2 instead of the 1.  Excellent brush quality for nail designs and 3D effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would totally order through your company again!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Finally arrived, great set</li>
            <li> well what can you say about something that cost less than a dollar?, One of the brushes were bent before I opened the package, some of the protector tops were missing off the brush tips. But other than those issues the brushes have done the job for what I purchased them to do. So if you don&#x27;t mind waiting a solid month to receive these brushes there well worth it for a buck.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but when I got it some of the brushes&#x27; bristles were a little stiff and hard. I had to end up soaking some of them in water for a little bit to help fix that. Also, one did fall apart but it was easy to stick back together. Other than that they look like they will do what I need them to do.</li>
            <li> I got my product on the exact estimated delivery date. It was packaged securely. I got lots of variety and none of the brushes were repeated. Awesome brushes for precision work on nails, which is what I do. Love&#x27;em!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love to do our nails with more nail art then many people. We will come up with ideas of our own or find tutorials on youtube showing different designs we can do.These brushes gives us the possiblity to do any kind of nail art we may like.</li>
            <li> Looked like tole painting brushes instead of nail brushes.  There were no directions or tips on how to use these brushes.</li>
            <li> These are for sure cheaply made, I haven&#x27;t even had them a week and one brushes head just popped right off and one metal part is bent...  Save your money buy some higher quality stuff ;)</li>
            <li> Worth it for the price and works well. Really great if you want to just have something to start off with. Shipping was also pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Got this as part of a Christmas gift for a huge nail fan and she loves them. No complaints yet so I&#x27;m assuming they must be pretty nice.</li>
            <li> Cheap brushes but decent. So far I only had one instance where the tips of the brush were coming out so eventually I had to throw it out. Sometimes you may catch one of the hairs in your nail. But overall good.</li>
            <li> These work great they don&#x27;t shed, and were vey easy for me to se my first time. Though I was using gel If you  are using acrylic it would be kind of difficult to figure out which brush is used for what. The basics it has a fan brush, a dotting brush, as well as the flat brushes. I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
            <li> A good nail are painting set.  However, I found that I only use several of the brushes, but it&#x27;s a great deal anyway.  Use the extra brushes in my oil painting class.</li>
            <li> I got just what I wanted for a great price! It did come from China, so be aware that it will take a few weeks to get to you. Totes worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I love working with these brushes. They are made well and are wonderful for detail painting. There&#x27;s a brush for your every need. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These brushes are nice and go for a low price. I don&#x27;t do nail art but they work for my crafting projects. 10/10 would buy again.</li>
            <li> Terrible - all of these BREAK at the joint. I used 4 brushes, all of them broke midway as I was painting my nails.</li>
            <li> I just got them., great set of brushes for the price! Works great! I&#x27;m planning to order four sets more.</li>
            <li> I got these for nail art and for the fine details on my dolls. They are wicked good for the price will buy again when these ones are done with!</li>
            <li> Really cheap. They just fall apart</li>
            <li> too good for the price. i love it and have ordered my second set, gave my 1st set to my sister and she loves them too... this time i am going to try these for my make up art also, will see how it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend it to people. :)</li>
            <li> Great for doing nail art</li>
            <li> These are decent little nail art brushes. They got to me rather quickly and have lasted over a year. The only complaint I have is that they ARE made of wood, and they are painted white so if youre going to use any nail polish remover to clean them off, you have to be careful or you will end up with a stripped brush and paint all over your hands.</li>
            <li> I placed the order on July 1st and it was suppose to be here August 8th at the latest. I never even recieved the product I paid for. Waste of my four dollars.</li>
            <li> i LOVE THESE! im kind of obsessed with nails so i ordered this set and couldnt be happier. makes nail designs so so much easier and so much neater and the price wasnt bad either. shipping didnt take too long either. if you like doing nails and wanna save some money, DIY, and get crafty you should deffinitly invest in a nail brush set. for those of you who are new to the whole diy nail thing, there are some pretty good tutorials on youtube on how to use these brushes. i would recommend</li>
            <li> Good price and good quality</li>
            <li> I am in love with these brushes. They did take about a month to get here but it was worth the wait. They all come in a plastic cover and most of them have covers on them to keep them clean and to keep their shape intact. However, they are a bit stiff and take a while to get used to. Most of the brushes look very similar but the creator of these brushes tried making them look different by using an assortment of colors. The only serious problem I have had was my own fault. Please notice that there IS a slanted one so don&#x27;t assume it was dented like I did (I tried fixing it almost causing it to break off)&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love these brushes and can&#x27;t wait to use them for further nail designs.</li>
            <li> Awesome quality...fantastic pricing...super quick delivery and the item was given as a gift and the recipient was blown away! What else could you ask for? I would use this seller again and again...Thanx!</li>
            <li> The pens were on time and what I order but they are cheaply made. I now wish I bought the ones that cost more.</li>
            <li> Really good!  Shipping was fast.  I haven&#x27;t tried them all yet, but looks very good!</li>
            <li> I bought this set and was surprised with the quality of the brushes. Great set for doing your own nails.</li>
            <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO EXCELENTE CALIDAD Y SUPER ACORDE CON EL TAMAÑO  LOS FELICITO POR PRESENTAR PRODUCTOS DE ESTA CALIDAD JSIUDIUDF IYDFIUYF</li>
            <li> These do not work well with nail polish. Could just be me, but I was not impressed. They seem like they would be better for for makeup or something....&lt;br /&gt;Idk. But I have had lots of success with nial art..... but not with these brushes. :(&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t complain too much though because they were very inexpesnive.&lt;br /&gt;Just would have rather used the 4 bucks on something else.</li>
            <li> came as described, its a fine product.</li>
            <li> The paintbrush does come off the wood but it&#x27;s nothing super glue can&#x27;t fix! Not one hair has come off yet! I know it&#x27;s for nails but I actually use them to paint on canvas sometimes ! That&#x27;s how much I trust them. Really just fantastic price, and good for detail! Great for any artist really (for small jobs) !</li>
            <li> Shipping was quite fast, the quality of the brushes are above average but not &#x27;amazing&#x27;. they get the job done and it&#x27;s a great price for the amount of brushes you receive.</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes fell apart</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get exactly what it looks like in the picture! Cheaply made but worth the price</li>
            <li> Poor quality some brushes fell apart after the first use.</li>
            <li> these are a really great product. they are very sturdy and the price is very cheap. i thought that for them being so cheap in price that they would also be cheap in the quality, but to my surprise they werent. they are not at all cheaply made, none of them have broken or anything. i really recommend these to anyone who loves to do nail art and needs some new tools. :)</li>
            <li> nice product....my girl loved the 15 nail art painting pen brush.</li>
            <li> Great inexpensive gift for a tween girl. Perfect stocking stuffer or to use in a gift basket</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and I love the brushes</li>
            <li> Great product and great seller. Fast delivery, we received it in 10 days.The brushes came covered in a protective cap, except of the two fan brushes in a soft plastic pocket. the brushes handle made from plastic.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very nice and are good for a few uses and just can&#x27;t find a brush that the ends don&#x27;t go bad on them...I use them for ceramics and cleaning up around my fingernails but the acetone makes the brushes fall out.</li>
            <li> just what i expected now i can do nail art on my toes</li>
            <li> Worst brushes ever!! Cheaply made and metal piece keeps falling off the brushes.</li>
            <li> They came in fast and are all nice</li>
            <li> These work so perfect.</li>
            <li> What a piece of CRAP! I had to try to super glue seven of the brushes back together after they fell apart BEFORE the first use. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Find another product. Find another vendor.</li>
            <li> A few of them broke but overall ive gotten a lot of use out of them and they serve their purpose.</li>
            <li> Nice for the price, nail art set.</li>
            <li> The fan brush wasnt as sturdy as I expected</li>
            <li> excellent product I recommend</li>
            <li> Excellent price, product, and shipping</li>
            <li> The brushes came earlier than the 30 day delivery window said they would. So that&#x27;s a plus, but a most every brush fell apart as soon as I touched it. I&#x27;d be much more upset if I had paid more, I kind of expected that to happen. But it&#x27;s still slightly disatisfying. I think next time I&#x27;ll just sucker it up and pay more for a decent set of brushes.</li>
            <li> Excellent Seller. A+++</li>
            <li> Brushes seem to be great quality.  Excellent price, I was going to order more but I wanted to see the quality first. I am defiantly going to order some more for myself and for gifts.</li>
            <li> Brushes are great , them seem like great quality , overall worth the price</li>
            <li> These are great for detailed work. I didn&#x27;t buy these for my nails, I use them on the little boxes and clay charms I make and they are the perfect sizes. They range from itty bitty to small (compared to regular brushes), and there&#x27;s also a metal dotter, which is GREAT!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t beat the price and they shipped fast most of all the are wonderful I am using the to paint with,,,,,</li>
            <li> Love them! Came in on estimated date. Each brush was excellent quality exactly why I expected! I can&#x27;t wait to use them!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect much from these as art brushes but for nail art I bet they would be pretty decent. Don&#x27;t regret it, but also wouldn&#x27;t get any more of these.</li>
            <li> These pieces are great for more than just nails. I use a couple of these brushes to apply my makeup. Mostly I use it for my eyeliner. It&#x27;s very precise and these tools work very well. I love the dotting tool it comes with. I&#x27;ve used it a few times for my nails and it works great. For this price, just add it to your cart and you&#x27;ll be pleased with yourself.</li>
            <li> Even though these are for nail art, I purchased them for makeup application.  So far they are proving very useful.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who loves to do mani/pedis. The price was great for such a variety of brushes. I actually stole one from her so I could use it for my eyeliner! Works great! Would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> U can use it to do a lot of things it&#x27;s very nice I love it . . . .</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and is exactly what that pictures shows.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in great condition and is perfect for my needs. These brushes are high quality for a low price.</li>
            <li> The brushes must be one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made. They clean easily and make the detailed designs I want.</li>
            <li> No complaints from the wife. She uses them everyday to do her nails. Not a bad price point given the usage.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever purchased here, is exactly what they offered me. Are happy with this.</li>
            <li> They were high quality and I enjoy them, I use them a lot and it is a really good buy. I wish they had a non-flimsy smaller brush, their are not a lot of brushes that you can make really small strokes with, so if you want small lines that are cool and crisp (weird choice of words) than choose different brushes.</li>
            <li> The quality is good for the price but they are not applicators. They are a set of fine brushes that can only be used for nail art.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes the brush set.  She loves doing nails, and likes to do nails for her friends (and for me).</li>
            <li> great set of brushes for an unbelievable price.  I think they were 1.98 and they seem to be very good quality.  Think I will use some in my oil painting.</li>
            <li> there ok not the best I just wish there better quality</li>
            <li> Brushes work well. I like the long handles, makes it easier for nail art. Be prepared to wait a long time for your order though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do nails, but I use art brushes for various projects and painting. These are wonderful for different effects and fine detailing. They clean up well.</li>
            <li> Use them all the time.</li>
            <li> the brushes are so long and thin i love them  id buy this again. and they came before it said it would</li>
            <li> there ok. a few of them came undone but was still able to use. they don&#x27;t clean very well but for the price I cant complain</li>
            <li> Great Brushes and arrived as expected!</li>
            <li> Great deals and Awesome priced. Good quality brushes, I can&#x27;t complain one bit. I did a French mani with them and it came out beautiful.</li>
            <li> This are the must amazing brushes I have ever used! I do doll costumizing and they are great if you want to paint really thin and small lines! Amazing! They are also amazing with nails! Plus a great price for a 15 Pc pack! I also like the dotting tool! The packaging is good it comes in a sealed plastic type of Bag/ package kinda like u would find special brushes in at like Michels! Great product I recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> Nice set of brush you don&#x27;t have to worry about ruining or abusing. Cheap, varied, and nice detail brushes. Help me paint my charms and minis.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes and can also be used for applying makeup. One of my favorites has a metal ball on the tip of it, so you can easily apply polka dots on your nails, which I think is really cute. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase, except for the fact that it took over two weeks to get this in the mail, but the wait was worth it.</li>
            <li> These nail brushes don&#x27;t really work...... When I put it in the nail polish and try to paint it on to my nail it just smears it around. But they are fun for make up!!!</li>
            <li> good brushes for anything from gems to acrylic nails...not to mention that you cant beat the price...just try to go to sallys and walk out with  nail brush for $5 or less!! in love</li>
            <li> Everything came as pictured, but once I took them out of the package the chrome tops started coming off the &#x27;handles&#x27;. You get what you pay for though, so I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> I love the variety of the brushes! I don&#x27;t even know what you use some of them for! I guess I&#x27;ll just fiddle with it and figure it out!</li>
            <li> These are very cheap quality brushes. They broke off and they got unglued very easily. Not the best purchase I&#x27;ve done.</li>
            <li> Very nice and the price is great</li>
            <li> I was really excited about these brushes until the tops started falling off. They have everything you would ever want or need to do amazing nails but once they get wet the glue seems to loosen to where the top falls off and then I have to throw them away. :(</li>
            <li> great product no complaints</li>
            <li> Very helpful. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I work with miniatures and the brushes were ideal and the price was unbelievable</li>
            <li> I use these brushes for painting on canvas. They are great for small details and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> some of them started to detach after one use.</li>
            <li> I only bought this kit to fill up my makeup kit for small brushes. This has awesome eyeliner brushes. Love!</li>
            <li> Cheap and good for sugar work.</li>
            <li> These brushes are really good! No they aren&#x27;t the best brushes out there, but this brush set is way too amazing for the price. Every bush is well made and really useful. I am super happy with the quality and verity of these brushes.</li>
            <li> this is a great seller. Item as described. great deal. i bought a few of these for stocking stuffers and they were perfect. thank you.</li>
            <li> Took awhile to come here but it was within the long shipping time but it&#x27;s very good.</li>
            <li> these are so perfect  i wasnt sure if they would be too big i use lots of brushes for  working on dolls and i was uncertian if they would all be to big  but they turned out to be just right !! there smaller then i thought and just what i needed  so i can use more then i thought  what a great buy !!! i recommend them  110% for people makeup or for dolls lol ...i htink im going to order myself a set lol !!!</li>
            <li> These brushes server their purpose.  For the price, they are a good value.  All the brushes were in good shape and all (except the fan bushes) had bristle protector covers.  I haven&#x27;t used them with acetone so  haven&#x27;t experiences the paint coming off like some of the other reviews.  However, I&#x27;ve used them with the Gelish cleaner for French manicures and with the Gelish Builder gel.  I used an acrylic brush cleaner solution to clean the brushes and the bristles shaped back nicely.</li>
            <li> I use these all the time! They really come in handy. To clean nail polish off the bristles use acetone, but be careful because the white paint might come off.</li>
            <li> Kinda made cheap the brush parts keep falling off the white stick but they work well now cause I glued them on</li>
            <li> I paint on canvas, I bought these just to see if they would work. They work great. For those complaining about slow shipping it comes from China, it always take at least 3 weeks to get items from there. I&#x27;m buying another couple sets!</li>
            <li> Not the highest of quality, but they are good for everything you&#x27;ll need while doing nail art. I&#x27;ve used mine mainly for cleaning up around the cuticles with acetone. The acetone will eat away the paint on the handle. Yikes. What the acetone will not do is damage the bristles.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent starter brush kit! I&#x27;m a professional artist that has become intrigued with nail art. I have some really nice brushes that I didn&#x27;t want to destroy by using nail polish and acetone just to have some fun painting my nails. (Art brushes this tiny are hella expensive!) This kit is a set of synthetic (guessing taklon) brushes with a good variety of shapes and sizes. You will find a brush to do just about everything from details, lines, clean up, and there is even a dotting tool! And an angled brush for hard to reach places. :) Only one brush had a few funky hairs out of place (a very common prob - a little snip with my sharp cuticle nippers - and fixed!) I gave the ferrules a tug and they were sturdy. Using acetone on ANY brush is a lot to ask and any brush will slowly get destroyed. Rather these ones tho! They shipped fast too! Ordered 3/11 and got on 3/26. Overall EXTREMELY PLEASED!</li>
            <li> I bought it to my sister who loves doing her nails. She uses since then and works great. Good quality.</li>
            <li> i bought this as  apart of one sale a day . it took a while to arrive but that is not unusual from items shipped from overseas. these brushes are of great quality and would recommend to anyone. I use them for painting miniatures, Ball Jointed Dolls ,makeup and for nail art. The bent brush is great for eye-lining..i probably need another set :)</li>
            <li> These are nice brushes!  There are so many of them.  I can do all different designs with them.  A great choice if you do a lot of nail art.  I have my manicurist license.  These let you do just about any design you want.  Let your mind go wild and be super creative.  It&#x27;s nice having such a wide variety of brushes to pick from while I&#x27;m designing !</li>
            <li> I am starting an apprentice this summer as a nail tech at a beauty shop and these will help me in achieving my goals.</li>
            <li> my girls are having fun learning to use these and making some really cool designs of their own</li>
            <li> Again just got into doing my nails recently and I wanted to do some cool designs so I ordered these. I am in love I change my nails every other day if not every day!</li>
            <li> I guess they work like they should. the bristles seem too stiff to me. I can not get them to do much designing but this must be user error.</li>
            <li> Super cheap looking but they work OK. Took forever to arrive.</li>
            <li> I just love these brushes. making designs is so much eaiser now thati have them. the store easi;y and clean well too</li>
            <li> This was a really good price.. I thought that they were gonna come broken or not come at all.. But they did and even earlier than i expected.. I love the brushes..</li>
            <li> I havent gotten my things yet but they are doing everything they can to help me as soon as they fix my issue i will buy more they are verry nice and trying to help i love that</li>
            <li> I used this product for my nails and they were kinda great. some of the brushes just broke completely but arrived very good. It is hard to clean too.</li>
            <li> These brushes are good quality and come in a handy variety of shapes and sizes. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them such as hairs falling out.  I know that I will use these very often to create my artistic nail designs.  For this price, these are GREAT brushes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for awhile and they are good for the price but some of the brushes shed and the &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; peeled off some of the brushes when I accidentally spilled polish remover on them :/ but there decent for what I&#x27;m using them for.</li>
            <li> Took longer to arrive than advertised but good brushes :-D</li>
            <li> She honestly hasn&#x27;t used it all that much but it is a neat add on to her collection of nail art supplies.</li>
            <li> 15pcs nail art painting pen brushes for this price is unheard of. I thought it was a misprint. Brushes were purchased for 10 year old starting nail design. It passed her test with flying colors. What else can I say?</li>
            <li> It will be great to decorate my fingernails.  It arrived exactly as shown.  I know I&#x27;m going to enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Poor material. Can&#x27;t really reuse, due to the fact that it&#x27;s difficult to clean them.</li>
            <li> This nail art painting brushes were given as a gift.  The recipient loved them.</li>
            <li> I purchased this with a 36-piece paint set. I didn&#x27;t realize that it was for nails, but&lt;br /&gt;it works very well with my paint set. Less expensive also.</li>
            <li> Such an amazing set of brushes and for the price you cant beat it!&lt;br /&gt;I love doing my own nails and these work out wonderful</li>
            <li> I was so gee when I got my nail art brush I can&#x27;t wait to use them you just don&#x27;t how long I been waiting and looking for these..........I so geeeeeee</li>
            <li> good product i just need to practice more because it takes a steady hand, and know how.  Practice makes perfect</li>
            <li> When I ordered this, I made myself forget about it so I wouldnt chase the mail for it. It arrived almost 3 weeks ahead of my estimated arrival date. It was exactly what I thought it was gonna be. I even got a tiny dotting tool which is awesome. You can use these for make up or nail art. Thanks Crazy Cart!</li>
            <li> Using these for fine details in my oil paintings and they work great! Easy to clean and don&#x27;t shed. And they&#x27;re so cheap!!!</li>
            <li> The brushes are really horrible to work with, really cheap products used to make the brush. Never going to buy them again!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how fast I  got this! Definitely recommend to my friends. I did some funky nail art with these.</li>
            <li> These brushes were very cheaply made. Half of the brushes, I kid you not, we&#x27;re literally just the sticks and no brush. Others were glued together and unusable. Only a few were useful, making this a waste of your money!!!!</li>
            <li> Just what i wanted: good price, good quality</li>
            <li> Really enjoy these,&lt;br /&gt;Use them so often.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone</li>
            <li> poor quality bristles and flimsy brushes. the only thing these brushes are good for is experimenting, the results they give are not worth wearing out in public.</li>
            <li> White pairing comes of handles very easily</li>
            <li> Took awhile to get, but came as described. Not too shabby for the price i must admit. I wouldve liked different sized dotting and a minus a brush or two but so far the toes and i are happy. I will say provided you use non acetone cleaner the brushes return to normal. They do stain a bit but ive yet to find a brush that dosent.</li>
            <li> I got everything that was shown in the picture, it was delivered at a reasonable time, and everything was in good condition! I&#x27;m having trouble with cleaning them though. I&#x27;ve been searching everywhere on how to clean the brushes after using them but I haven&#x27;t found anything good.</li>
            <li> Good price,good product</li>
            <li> I received these for my daughter she will do her nails 10 times in a day if they don&#x27;t turn out how she wants them too. So I figured if I got these nail paint brushes for her she could design them even more. They have worked wonders for her. She loves them. Now my q-tips wont keep disappearing. These are wonderful for teen girls. They are easy to use and easy to clean. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. They will make the perfect gift for that girly girl in your life.</li>
            <li> delivered before the declared period, brushes standards</li>
            <li> Got here before expected date. One was broken, but overall it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the tiny painting I am doing on my miniatures! (Warhammer 40K)</li>
            <li> Perfect for my nails.</li>
            <li> Excellent new item. Love it; one of the best products in this genre. Will definitely buy other new items too. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Not the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever used but they do have a few brushes that fit the needs I have when I&#x27;m doing certain designs</li>
            <li> I just received my set yesterday, it took only 2 weeks to get to my house and the package and brushes were in perfect condition. I&#x27;m not a professional or anything so I was looking for something inexpensive to do some creative nail art for my mom, my daughter and me. I really love this set and for less than the cost of most nail polish I got it shipped and can start experimenting with my nails. If you would like something to try and do your nails and others but are afraid to spend lots of money on it I recommend this set as it comes with a great variety of brushes and gives you plenty of options to get creative!</li>
            <li> So I got these for a steal. They are my first set of nail art brushes but I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing this brand again.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something cheap for minimal use than they are ok. But the reason I gave them 3 stars is that i have had them for about a week now. I&#x27;ve experimented and played with each brush...some i find i am using more than others. Those brushes are looking very worn already and i&#x27;ve only had them a week! also..i use nail polish remover to clean the tips, i dipped too low once and the white on the handle of the brush immediately came off! disappointed but got the immediate job done...</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these brushes, just as descibed and does the job, very easy to make her designs, happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Very cheap material, some came already broken in the package. Was a fast delivery. Overall wouldn&#x27;t recommend. Rather spend more to get a better result</li>
            <li> Purchased these brushes for my Granddaughter. She loves them  Makes doing designs on her nails easy and neat. Good value for the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not great at nail art but love to try. I enjoy the option of the different brushes available &amp; designs you can make.</li>
            <li> I received these brushes SUPER fast 13 days before it said they should be here! Good range on different types of brushes. Over all nice brushes..</li>
            <li> Everything was great except one of the brushes were bent. Fast shipping though!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the product. I was a great buy for the price</li>
            <li> All of the brushes shown arrived in great shape and on time. The pouch the came in was very flimsy. And if you wish to use the point protectors some of the brushes won&#x27;t even fit into the pouch. I feel that even a mildly better pouch would have made me a lot happier with the product.</li>
            <li> Great value for the money! Good brushes!</li>
            <li> some of these brushes are great for your nails, you get so many and i have used about 8 of them with my watercolor paints, which they also work good on</li>
            <li> This is a total piece of crap and it comes from China.</li>
            <li> These are a super deal for the brushes.  They look like the pictures. Please keep in mind these a priced very reasonable. They do the job but No these are not long term brushes Or Makeup brushes (too small) If you are looking for high end ones please feel free to keep looking and pay the appropriate price.  Shipping does take a bit but not bad considering its coming from another country. Overall I am very satisfied ~ my daughter likes them ~ &amp; my pocket book is happy, happy, happy lol. Happy Shopping :)</li>
            <li> The brushes aren&#x27;t very good quality but mine have held up well under moderate use (2-3 times per week) and no bristles are falling out. There is a nice variety of sizes and shapes, though I could wish for a shorter thinner striping brush. They are decent and do what they are supposed to, overall I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t cost much, but they shouldn&#x27;t -- they fall apart really easily. They can be glued back together, but it&#x27;d be nice to not have to almost immediately repair new items.</li>
            <li> It is great. Exactly what I expected. I got these to practice doing nails. So I wasn&#x27;t expecting amazing quality. But they do have pretty decent quality. I was really impressed on how fast it took. I wasn&#x27;t supposed to get it for another two weeks.</li>
            <li> Comes with all the tools you need and they are pretty good for the price so I can not complain</li>
            <li> Really bad. I first got it and already the brush heads falling of. It&#x27;s like it wasn&#x27;t stuck on In the first place.</li>
            <li> These are very inexpensive brushes but are really nice! The only down fall is they are kinda hard to clean out!</li>
            <li> Cute set! Really wonderful Quality for the price!</li>
            <li> Great quality and easy to clean. The different sizes make creating designs a breeze, even a beginner can use them :)</li>
            <li> These brushes are very nice. I would suggest these to anyone. Of course theg aren&#x27;t AMAZING but definantly if you want nail art brushes these are the way to go. I have ordered another set of brushes from anothee vendor on amazon and they were horrible. These are wonderful please buy!</li>
            <li> very nice for the price</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They are so much longer than I expected them to be! I will admit, I was very skeptical about buying them at first because of their cheap price, and the pictures made them look soo small and fragile, but, since they were so cheap, and I needed a set of brushes to do my nails for prom this year, I thought, \\&quot;what the hell. Worst case scenario, I&#x27;ll just resell them in a garage sale!\\&quot; Then, when my shipping date was set for over a month, I lost hope. I was super please to receive them the week before prom! When they came, I was just amazed. They are really durable and hold the polish well. I would definitely buy this product again. :)</li>
            <li> i love the brushes...great designs with then...easy to use...strong quality...works well...and its simple and cute. i recommend it for others</li>
            <li> The product provided was exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great job guys. Keep up the good work as I&#x27;m very pleased with the product provided.</li>
            <li> I chose to rate a 5 because the product is just perfect. I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better, and I price is the best I could find!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone that does nail art and is looking for tools.</li>
            <li> Finding good brushes that produce incredible nail art is incredibly difficult these days. I’m so glad that I found this!</li>
            <li> It was difficult to use these brushes. They&#x27;re terrible for nail art. I couldn&#x27;t navigate the brushes around my nail at all. Forget making lines with them, the bristles don&#x27;t stay together and tend to go whichever way they want. Cleaning them is a nightmare, it&#x27;s impossible for some odd reason to get nail polish out of the bristles. Go to a craft store and buy paint brushes there and use those because if you purchase this product, you&#x27;re seriously getting what you&#x27;re paying for.</li>
            <li> For as cheap as they are these are great. A good variety of brushes and one dotting tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint: they don&#x27;t handle being in acetone well. My angled brush that I usually use for clean up now has the problem where the bristles push back inside the metal, luckily they are just long enough that I can pull them back out again, but it&#x27;s quite frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But again, for the price you can&#x27;t beat them. I&#x27;d rather have to buy 5 sets of these brushes then drop a lot of cash on a different set.</li>
            <li> I spent what seemed forever for these to be delivered, but when they came, what a bargain!  So many styles, shapes and versions of brushes and at a terrific price. The wait was worth it; now I&#x27;m having fun doing my own nail art and save time and money doing them myself. Thank you for this great set of nail art brushes!</li>
            <li> Loved the different brushes that you received.  I was able to do all kinds of designs on nails. Thank you</li>
            <li> These brushes are great!  I bought them to paint acrylic nails and do my own art ! So far they work well and acrylic comes off the brushes with 100 acetone .  But the only thing is they took along time to get to me. But it&#x27;s expected.  If your willing to wait for 1month for them to come then this product is for you!</li>
            <li> They are a Big Bang for the buck! They aren&#x27;t the most professional ones out there, but they are really good quality!</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, good for starting out and practicing nail art designs. i have no complaints so far.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re okay. Great for do it yourself basic designs.&lt;br /&gt;A lot of brushes for good price.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing special but worth what i spent on it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain for the price it was!</li>
            <li> Just as described,these do come from overseas so will take around 2 wks to receive.</li>
            <li> Item as expected.  Great price.  Arrived when promised.</li>
            <li> Great for the price! Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Perfect I loved them! Great for painting on canvases</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> I bought this for the low price and I didn&#x27;t expect it to be so great! The brushes are long, lightweight and way more professional than the measly two brushes I can buy from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Store. They are all very soft and well worth the purchase! I enjoy doing my own nails and this makes it so much easier to get creative! No one ever thinks I do them myself:) I have only used three so far and I haven&#x27;t gotten around to cleaning them. I think someone said that the hairs fall off if you use acetone but they seem pretty sturdy to me. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product!</li>
            <li> These brushes are really nice and they are just perfect for when I want put a design on my nails. And I didnt think that they would be this high of quality.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my nail designs and I use it when I paint wine glasses and other glass objects. Very nice</li>
            <li> when i decided to get these brushes, i was obssessed with nails!&lt;br /&gt;when i found these brushes for a great price i jumped at the chance, and ordered them.&lt;br /&gt;It took so long to get here, i eventually forgot i even ordered them, and thought they got lost in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;Finally after weeks of waiting it came! It came in a lovely case to hold them in, so i was thrilled i had a place to keep them! As soon as i got them i started doing my nails and there was a bigger selection of the things i could paint on them. I love these brushes and i still use them now. The only thing i suggest you beware of, is how long it takes to get here, but after all it was shipped from hong cong, all the way to FL. so thats about half way around the globe. But over all, it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves that I can do patterns n designs on our nails instead of having plain polish. Very happy with the kit and can&#x27;t wait to learn how to use the rest of the brushes.</li>
            <li> Cheap, arrived early, Practical. They can be used for many other uses, not only nail art. They are a bit difficult to clean if you use regular nail polish, but if you insist with nail polish remover they will be ok. I would recommend them :) ps: the angled brush is perfect for eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Took awhile to get, some of them pulled apart just taking the brush protector off.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes don&#x27;t shed</li>
            <li> I am actually thinking about ordering a couple more as gifts because of the quality. They look like they are really good.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the quality of the product, until I dipped the brush into nail polish remover (with acetone) obviously, acetone wears paint off of cars, windows, ect. But the paint went all over my hand, and made the brushes look cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I needed! they came as described and were delivered before the promised date. I use these everyday on me my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Lots of brushes with a wide variety of applications. Unaffected by even pure acetone, perfect for detailed nail art designs</li>
            <li> they are small and easy to use, i share some of them with my mom and even though we dont have lots of experiences with brushes we can still used them.</li>
            <li> Products came within a few weeks. 3 of the sets of brushes were missing. They made sure they contacted me and made it right. Got the 3 that were missing yesterday and they kept in contact with me. Was VERY happy with the customer service.</li>
            <li> It looks as though they would actually do what nail shop brushes do, but they are in fact really thin and don&#x27;t do what they are supposed to.</li>
            <li> This product makes doing my nails much easer. When I do a french tip it makes the job look very nice and neat</li>
            <li> For the price, there are pretty good brushes.  We will never be professional nail artists, but for this family, they are the perfect tools for teen experimentation.</li>
            <li> Quite a variety of brush sizes for nails, not as easy to design with, but I am getting there.&lt;br /&gt;Am also using them on the OOAK reborn doll kits I have.</li>
            <li> I love how they have a plastic around the brushes so they don&#x27;t get squished in the mail. They seem to be sturdy and nice haven&#x27;t used them yet. I ordered these on May 14 and got them the 29th, when they said I wouldn&#x27;t get it from june 10-26th so I got them super quick which is amazing.</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes for my nails and I have to say for the price they are amazing! For less than $3 you can&#x27;t go wrong. I loved the nail dotting tool and the thin flat brushes. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase and would definitely purchase again if needed. I actually did clean the brushes I used with nail polish remover and the paint did not strip or come off like others claimed. I also used one of the angled brushes to apply my gel eyeliner and it works great, which was surprising since I originally purchased them for my nails. The only con that I found was that they are a bit long for my hands, but that&#x27;s not a big deal. Again, for $2.70 you can&#x27;t go wrong! :)</li>
            <li> Delivered on time love all the different brushes. Happy with the purchase will buy again</li>
            <li> Great set of nail brushes</li>
            <li> fast delivery love it&lt;br /&gt;only negative is the white paint comes off when cleaning in nail polish remover and the tips came off of some but I glued the back on for the price it is right!</li>
            <li> Really good for the price. They took a while but cheaper than the almost $20 at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Not good quality. better to pay more for something better</li>
            <li> Love them very pe and cool but one was broken when I got then💅💅💅💅</li>
            <li> absolutely love these nail brushes the only problem that I have with them is that they took at least two months to get here, I totally forgot about them and was surprised when the came.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t work for nail polish. They really are just mini make up brushes or paint brushes that at this rate, I would just use as eye brushes or small designs. The nail polish itself doesn&#x27;t really work with the material of the brush. it also dries fast on the brushes and makes a rough look on your nail. It&#x27;s easier to use the brush that came with the nail polish instead of these.</li>
            <li> Super cheap, in quality and $$, but they still do the job. When they came in the mail, several of the brushes still attached to the metal ends came off the white stick portion of the tool, but a little super glue and it&#x27;s right as rain. All better!</li>
            <li> Crap, metal parts keep breaking off</li>
            <li> I received my brush set the other day and upon inspecting the brushes one by one I came across four of them which the brushes fell off the handles. Slipped right off. Not a big deal, I glued them back into place, but it was a bit of an annoyance. However, you get what you pay for apparently. They still work great and are nice brushes, only problem was that little handle to brush separation.</li>
            <li> Good quality love it.</li>
            <li> loved the price and variety</li>
            <li> I just received this 2 days ago and I love it.</li>
            <li> It took about 3 weeks to get here. The brushes themselves are really good they apply well but the glue that holds the two pieces together is not good at all.</li>
            <li> Great price fast shipping!! And a lot of brushes!!! Simply amazing!!</li>
            <li> Very nicely made and the bristles are soft and keep to shape. Would recommend cleaning with NON ACETONE POLISH REMOVER. I haven&#x27;t had any shedding either, like other brushes I&#x27;ve bought at Walmart. Came earlier than expected too!</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of having all the different choices, but they&#x27;ve all fallen apart. I&#x27;ve had to superglue them all back on. You get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Ordered on Christmas Eve and received it by New Year&#x27;s Eve! Awesome! Thank you so much. It is good condition. and received with no problems.</li>
            <li> Took a while to get and some of the metal pieces that hold the brushes ob are falling off after one use.</li>
            <li> i like these for my nails.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of nail art and this set is great. The quality is good and the price can&#x27;t be beat. I haven&#x27;t used all the brushes yet, but the ones I have used have stood up to the use and cleaning.</li>
            <li> the pens works very good. I understand that I need to work in my habilities. but I love it. Too usefull and good quality</li>
            <li> The brush set arrived earlier than expected about two weeks early. Although, they do feel a little flimsy when you first touch them and you might need some super glue especially for the part where the metal meets the wood, and I wish there had been some type of description for the different brushes but overall it is a good product for the price.</li>
            <li> This brush shet is perfect for nail decorating. I have purchased a set from Sally&#x27;s and this one by far exceeds those. I would definitely purchase this set again when mine need replacing. Why spend so much when this is cheaper and a superior set.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I run a beauty parlor and clients these days look for more detailed nail painting. My pen brushes had worn out and I was looking for a good quality painting pen brush, I found it on Amazon. This nail art painting pen brush allows me to paint accurately even in tight areas. There are so many brushes from thick bristles and extremely thin bristles this allows me to work on any design from my catalogue. The brushes are comfortable to hold and have given life to my designs. Cleaning the brush is simple, all I have to do is to wash it clean and dry them and the brushes are ready for next use. I got fifteen nail art pens and for less than $3 it is a great deal.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes for nail art.  I love to use the flat chisled brush to remove excess paint and mistakes from my fingers and cuticles.  The ferrules seem to be pretty well made and I have not lost any fibers from the brushes since using them.  The only brush that I find not to great is the fan brush - I have not been able to use it successfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great brush set for the price.  Great for beginners and pros alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I loved all the brushes that came in this and it was all for a good price!</li>
            <li> These are great!!! I love them.</li>
            <li> very cheap quality. I&#x27;m unable to make details because it&#x27;s very flimsy.</li>
            <li> Im very good at designing my nails. I bought the brushes so i could be more creative &amp; make lots of designs and the brushes are really useful andI I bought them for a great price! They come in a lot of sizes and I hope you enjoy this product like I did:)</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe price that  I paid for quality of items I bought  , so  I had to go back to my order and double checked price.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how they&#x27;re making any profit with this items but I am not complain.&lt;br /&gt;One words &amp;#34; BEST ! &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These are great quality brushes I still can&#x27;t believe I got them for such a steal! The set looks just like the picture. They come in a plastic transparent flap case bag thingy lol.</li>
            <li> I got these as a stocking stuffer for my 11 year old daughter so I have not actually used them yet but something did strike me as odd... Maybe I am the only one who thought this but I was expecting them to be shorter, easier to handle. They are as long as normal paint brushes. Worth the couple bucks I spent on them though. I&#x27;m sure she will use them.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes they are so good. But they sorta stain depending on the nail polish. However, the quality is five star regardless.</li>
            <li> Nice brush variety however not made too great.  Says they are for nails but as soon as you use nail polish remover to clean the nail polish the finish of the brush starts to come off...</li>
            <li> they were really cheap so for that price its absoloutely amazing quality. The brushes are just like they were portrayed in the picture. I thought that brushes like these could be cleaned by using nail polish remover but i was wrong.</li>
            <li> Lots of brushes to choose from. I took off one star because the quality isn&#x27;t all that great. Great deal for the price though!</li>
            <li> I needed some brushes to help me improve my nail art and these were perfect. They even arrived earlier than scheduled. I definitely recommend this company.</li>
            <li> These arrived about 2-3 weeks sooner than the estimated delivery date which made me so excited.  Upon inspection, they came in a clear pouch with each brush covered with a clear tube except the two fan brushes.  The bristles feel very durable and solid.  The handles are white and feel comfortable.  For the price,  I think these brushes are exceptional.  I plan on using them for nail art using acrylic paint.  I think they can be used with nail polish but cleaning them in acetone may damage the brush hairs.  Happy painting!!</li>
            <li> really interesting set. Kinda confusing as to how to use them, but it&#x27;s fun.&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to clean the nail polish out of the brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes arrived in a timely manner. I have only used 2 of them for nail art (because I&#x27;m new to this) but have found them to be very good so far. I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> Super package!&lt;br /&gt;There are lot of strange brushes but i love the quality. I think it is great present for person who loves to have strange nail art.</li>
            <li> These were so exciting to receive in the mail. You don&#x27;t have to use them as nail brushes, either, they could easily be used as make-up brushes.</li>
            <li> I think that the product itself is okay, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. When I got it, one of the brushes was bent at the metal part and was about to crack, the package was torn, and the package also smelled strange. :( Overall, I just wasn&#x27;t happy with it.</li>
            <li> perfect finish for my nails, love it</li>
            <li> My 16yr old daughter changes her nail polish every other day... so she like using this basic brushes.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are more defined and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> i love them i designs my nails I also use them for acyclic paint to do different things to them.....</li>
            <li> They work well but there&#x27;s little variety. You have 2 fans, two normal brushes and then a lot of detail and striping brushes. not bad for the price though.</li>
            <li> EXCELENT ALL I M HAPPY&lt;br /&gt; VERY  THANKS PLEASE SEND ME INFO FOR MORE&lt;br /&gt; I HOPE WILL BE YOU CUSTOMER AGAIN SOON</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still learning how to use the brushes, but they work well. All of the bristles are intact shaped correctly and intact. I&#x27;ve used 3 of the brushes and they seem to work great.</li>
            <li> First of all you can&#x27;t bet this price for all these brushes. I&#x27;m going to have fun creating so many designes on my nails.</li>
            <li> I draw and paint using mostly water colors. These are perfect for my purposes and the price is great, too. I will probably buy these again in the future. :))</li>
            <li> The brushes are an excellent deal. The only complaint I have is that the plastic end caps that were put on them were bent thus causing the bristles of the liner brushes to be bent. This is a minor problem given what you get for the money.</li>
            <li> I bought these mainly for the thin tipped brushes, but after using them about 5 times, they no longer produced the perfect thin lines that they did when i got them.</li>
            <li> These are great as really small paintbrushes especially for watercolors, nail polish also works though nailpolish remover takes the paint on the handles off so be careful with that.</li>
            <li> takes a while to get here, but when you do you can do anything with this wonderful little brushes</li>
            <li> I bought these for my acrylic craft paints. Great bargain and assortment if sizes!  Who would have thought...!</li>
            <li> i really could design,&lt;br /&gt;and they are perfect size for me to use...&lt;br /&gt;and i really consentrate on the design well...&lt;br /&gt;came in perfect packaging as well...&lt;br /&gt;if these get old i would buy more! :)</li>
            <li> I like the product and it comes as pictured, however, if you want to soak the nail polish out of the brush after use, make sure you don&#x27;t dunk the white handle of the brush in the nail polish remover, or the white handle paint soaks right off, and it MAKES A MESS! If I had known this ahead of time, I would go for a solid plastic or metal handle left unpainted.</li>
            <li> The set arrived quicker then I imagined and I can&#x27;t wait to try it out. The whole set had great variety to use and any professional would love to order a set like this. So you don&#x27;t want to pass up a deal like this.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;they are great for tiny details or very long details. As an artist who deals with these styles&lt;br /&gt;I suggest these brushes to anyone. They are a bit on the cheap side.&lt;br /&gt;So try not to yank the silver pieces. (if you do) They can eaiser be repaired with super glue or hot glue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be-warned!&lt;br /&gt;The shipping is very slow. so work youre projects around waiting 3-4 weeks till they arrive.&lt;br /&gt;Badjuju86 - xox</li>
            <li> Poor quality paint brushes. Tried doing nail art with these and they it turned out awful.</li>
            <li> Very low quality and they took forever to ship</li>
            <li> I have reviewed before and the company contacted me to send another kit. The first set of brushes were bent or broken. The second set had one or two brushes that were bent or broken off. So there was some improvement but it was still not worth it.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very good for the price. Shipping was fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are good for beginners as well as professional nail designers.</li>
            <li> For the cost what can you expect?  I bought this for a niece, she really wanted a variety of brushes.  Some of them came bent and some came with the bristles destroyed.  They were in a plastic baggie like container and a simple envelope, which may have contributed to their poor condition.</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy nail art tools for myself. Everywhere these tools are very expensive. I saw this one and was surprised looking at price. I ordered them right away. Very good quality. Looks professional too.</li>
            <li> they work pretty good but two of the nail brushes were bent and messed up when i got them but the other brushes work great.</li>
            <li> I was excited about these, but when they arrived I discovered that the bristles of all the brushes are wonky (a fine tip brush with a few bristles that splay every which way, screwing up any attempts at fine detailing), the white paint comes off it seems if acetone gas even gets near it (my hands have ended up WHITE, and the paint will melt on to EVERYTHING it touches), and the entire brush+metal part broke off of many of the sticks and needs to be super glued back on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I was using one of the larger brushes to \\&quot;clean up\\&quot; my edges. It was working great for about two tries. At first I thought that the acetone I was dipping the brush in was eating away at the bristles because the brush seemed to be getting shorter, but I discovered that the bristles were actually being pushed up into the metal part and any attempt at pulling them down again just completely destroyed the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically these things are complete crap and fall apart very quickly. Now I need to find a better set and spend the money for quality.</li>
            <li> These brushes get the job done. They aren&#x27;t super high quality, but what would you expect for such a low price?</li>
            <li> I received the brushes just how they were on the screen.When I got the brushes I started making Cup cakes and fluffy bunny&#x27;s on my nails.I&#x27;m Serious I really did!!!!They work great I did not really want lots of nail polish brushes so I bought these thank goodness I did !!!!!</li>
            <li> I just got these also so i have not yet used them neither so give a little time to use.</li>
            <li> The brushes were more than I expected.  Very professional and very nice for the price.  Thank You and Have a Great Day</li>
            <li> I love how many brushes come in this set although i have not been able to use them all they seem good and have not had issues with the brushes i have been able to use.</li>
            <li> I gave them as birthday gifts to my God Daughter and Grand Daughter. Both were ecstatic about receiving and using them. Included nail polishes as part of the gift and pictures of nail designs. Great Idea!&lt;br /&gt;Kept a set for myself. Great purchase, I&#x27;m glad I ordered.</li>
            <li> I would buy these again. Great brushes.</li>
            <li> Arrived early. Great seller A+++. They arrived safely. Brushes are EXACTLY as pictured. None were damaged. Ive used 3 of the 15 and WOW... lines, flowers, and freehand art looked amazing. Each brush head is protected by little plastic tubes. Ohhh and they were NOT too Hard nor super soft... Love em!!!!</li>
            <li> I Got the nail art brushes in time and they&#x27;re great. Thanks! I also love the variety of brushes to choose from</li>
            <li> This is a pretty great product. I bought it for a friend, who actually uses it more for acrylic painting than nail painting, but she says they&#x27;re pretty awesome. The brushes themselves are very small and well-made so you can paint tiny areas without being afraid of the hairs on the brush splitting anytime soon and making things messy. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE NAIL ART, so i am always looking for new nail art accessories to purchase. however since  these brushes are really cheap, their quality is cheap as well. after one use i tried cleaning them with nail polish remover and it made the brush to stiff and really couldn&#x27;t use it any. also the white handle should stay away form any nail polish remover, because it will eat it up casing to melt the color off! I would say skip and buy professional ones!</li>
            <li> I love love love these brushes! use them the same day they arrived. great tool for the price. I do my own manicures and these brushes allow me to make great designs and I received many compliments. alone with a brushes you receive a dotting tool to make dots, striper brushes which are very difficult to find and brushes that I love you to make flower designs leave the signs and many more. You will also receive two fan brushes. easy to clean with a little bit of nail polish remover and you&#x27;re done. just don&#x27;t let the nail polish remover touch the base of the brush which is white it will strip the white paint off the handle of the brushes. but that&#x27;s very hard to do you would need to soak the entire brush in acetone and that&#x27;s not needed if you clean the brush just pour a little acetone into the bottle top and dip the brush into that acetone and it will clear off the nail polish without having to touch the wooden base. I think that anyone who&#x27;s complaining about the paint being stripped off the wooden handles has to be soaking the entire brush in acetone which is not required. if you handle these brushes the way brushes is supposed to be handled you will get a long life out of them. I am giving this seller 5 stars because they deserve it for a great product. A great price. shipping ahead of time.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE VARIETY OF BRUSHES, GREAT FOR GLITTER APPLICATION OR DOING NAIL ART. REALLY RECOMMEND FOR THOSE WHO ARE INTO NAIL ART.</li>
            <li> I really like the different kind of brushes&lt;br /&gt;I like how im able to manage with the stiffness of the brush</li>
            <li> good for your money, but definitely not pro. some heads fall off, just stick some super glue and they&#x27;re good as new. good for starters such as myself</li>
            <li> wow such a bargain so many to work with now I just have to learn how to decorate my nails lol I am going to try it soon</li>
            <li> These came about a month earlier than expected. They work great for nail art and I can do so many more designs it is so nice I would definatley recommend buying these if you love nail art</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and it worked great. I&#x27;m glad I bought it and it was a great price.</li>
            <li> These are some pretty good brushes considering how cheap they were! Some of the other reviews say that one of the brushes was bent and they were unhappy, but one of them is supposed to be bent. I really like that brush because its easier to hold while painting. I use these on my nails for designs with acrylic paints. I find them easier to work with. And water doesn&#x27;t melt away the paint the way acetone does. I like that there are a few types of brushes with different sizes of each. Overall this is a great product and came in about 2-3 weeks. :)</li>
            <li> There are so many things I love about these brushes. They&#x27;re sturdy and very useful. They are VERY cheap for 15 brushes. They came soooo fast!!! I got them in exactly two weeks when they were supposed to take almost 4 weeks! The only problem is that some of the bristles on the white fan brush are out of place... but I don&#x27;t really care. The brushes are still AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> These are great nail brushes for the beginner nail artist. I just use them for fun, and only occasionally, so I don&#x27;t know how durable they are. But they have done well so far with the things I have done, and I love that there is a variety so I can try new designs out!</li>
