            <li>I did some research on the best Mascaras.  </li>
            <li>My favorite!!!!</li>
            <li>Goes on perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Love it!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping he&#x27;ll make good on and send me the correct one, since I&#x27;ve ordered from him befor and consider him a 5 star seller!</li>
            <li>if the mascara itself was any good, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>A good mascara for the price.</li>
            <li>The price and availability were good .</li>
            <li>The product was good for the price.</li>
            <li>but the product is very good, one of the best for me of all different kinds tried.</li>
            <li>I continue to love this mascara for its volumizing effect on my lashes!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>was THRILLED to find that Amazon has stock, and even better was the price.</li>
            <li>This was supposed to be at the top, but I don&#x27;t agree.  </li>
            <li>Been using different Maybelline mascaras over the years and have found this one for me is the best at separating lashes and not clumping.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Mascara that lengthens my eyelashes, gives more volum and thickness ...&lt;</li>
            <li>recommended, we&#x27;ll purchase more once its needed :)</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the brush.</li>
            <li>I do love this mascara.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite mascaras of all time.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years</li>
            <li>Found it on line and bought as many of them as I could find.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily, the brush is perfect for my eyelashes, and a tube seems to last me quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It flows quite nicely for an economically priced mascara.</li>
            <li>Hope it will always be available to me.</li>
            <li>Though I haven&#x27;t opened the product I&#x27;m assuming the quality will be great as when I ordered it last year .</li>
            <li>Amazons price is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This one has &#x27;rubber&#x27; bristles rather than the soft brush kind, and it just seems to work better for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;P.S. brown as well as black are very good.</li>
            <li>Women often ask me what mascara I use and tell me how much they love my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes have a nice thickened but natural look when I use this.</li>
            <li>really great, does its job very well, one and only</li>
            <li>I have tried many different mascaras and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>This mascara not only lengthens nicely but it doesn&#x27;t clump and it helps curl.</li>
            <li>i thinks its my third or 4th purchase of this product, I&#x27;m really glad I&#x27;ve found it since ones that are available at my place</li>
            <li>so buying it on here is very convenient!</li>
            <li>Amazon helps me find it for a price much more reasonable than my local retailers.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for application, but when you try to put it back in the container it feels like it is going to snap off because it is so flexible.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for something affordable that really defines the lashes and don&#x27;t think this is it.  </li>
            <li>It works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>Just what I wanted thanks</li>
            <li>not to do the \\&quot;quick in and out several times\\&quot; that manufacturers warn against.  </li>
            <li>Normally my lashes will stay curled all day, but with this on, I look like Snuffleupagus (think Sesame Street) in a matter of minutes.  </li>
            <li>I have used this mascara for a few years, and I love it.</li>
            <li>but it seems that this one was maybe old</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad mascara, but just average.  </li>
            <li>I found it to be not thick enough</li>
            <li>So glad to have gotten a few to  hopefully last for several years.</li>
            <li>The brown-black color is almost impossible to find locally and I was happy to find online.</li>
            <li>Oddly though, it weighs down my lashes much more than the exact same product in black.  </li>
            <li>It started out fine, but after about a week of use, each time I pulled the applicator out, it was half covered in a goopy mess of mascara.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried about 4 or 5 other Maybelline mascaras, and I just never seem to like the different brushes.</li>
            <li> and I love but received the waterproof version, which is dry and very difficult to remove.  </li>

            <li> Cannot find the brownish black in stores anymore.</li>

            <li> hope Maybelline reconsiders taking the brownish black off the market.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Also, like the brownish black color which was hard to find.  </li>
            <li> These usually sell for around $7 each in stores.</li>
            <li> Also, the flexible wand is hard to work with.  </li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding this at the store and tried amazon..</li>
            <li> It can be hard to find sometimes</li>
            <li> so it turned out to become too thick in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> was really disappointed to find recently that Maybelline no longer seems to be making the brownish black in this mascara.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on fairly high ratings, but was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> But wrong mascara...</li>
            <li> After about two weeks, it got so bad</li>
            <li> If you do, it will start to flake and the tube will go bad quicker.</li>

            <li> I have been using this mascara for years now and I often can&#x27;t find it in stores, there would usually be one left and it would be waterproof one and I don&#x27;t use waterproof makeup. I have been and still receive a lot of compliments when I wear this mascara. Women often ask me what mascara I use and tell me how much they love my eyelashes. This mascara not only lengthens nicely but it doesn&#x27;t clump and it helps curl. My eyelashes have a nice thickened but natural look when I use this. Hope it will always be available to me.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on fairly high ratings, but was very disappointed.  It started out fine, but after about a week of use, each time I pulled the applicator out, it was half covered in a goopy mess of mascara.  I am careful not to do the \\&quot;quick in and out several times\\&quot; that manufacturers warn against.  This stuff just gooped up on it&#x27;s own.  After about two weeks, it got so bad I just need to throw it away.  Also, the flexible wand is hard to work with.  I could get used to that if the mascara itself was any good, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> I did some research on the best Mascaras.  This was supposed to be at the top, but I don&#x27;t agree.  It&#x27;s not a bad mascara, but just average.  I have been looking for something affordable that really defines the lashes and don&#x27;t think this is it.  I found it to be not thick enough and it takes long to dry, so I almost always wind up with mascara below my eyes from blinking while it&#x27;s still wet.  I also don&#x27;t like the brush. It&#x27;s fine for application, but when you try to put it back in the container it feels like it is going to snap off because it is so flexible.  So I consider this just an average product.</li>
            <li> Been using different Maybelline mascaras over the years and have found this one for me is the best at separating lashes and not clumping.  I think the brush shape may be a key but the product is very good, one of the best for me of all different kinds tried.</li>
            <li> I have been using the mascara for some time now.  It works very well for me.  It never seems to clump, smudge, or smear.  Amazon helps me find it for a price much more reasonable than my local retailers.  :)</li>
            <li> I used to like it but it seems that this one was maybe old so it turned out to become too thick in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> i thinks its my third or 4th purchase of this product, I&#x27;m really glad I&#x27;ve found it since ones that are available at my place are not the same as this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its really great, does its job very well, one and only Mascara that lengthens my eyelashes, gives more volum and thickness ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended, we&#x27;ll purchase more once its needed :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. brown as well as black are very good.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted thanks</li>
            <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s the washable one. I have never tried the water proof. I love the brush. However, you ONLY apply it once, while it&#x27;s wet. Once it dries, don&#x27;t put on anymore. If you do, it will start to flake and the tube will go bad quicker. I do love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different mascaras and this is my favorite. I had a hard time finding this at the store and tried amazon..thankful I found it here, so ordered several</li>
            <li> A good mascara for the price. It flows quite nicely for an economically priced mascara. The brown-black color is almost impossible to find locally and I was happy to find online.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.  Cannot find the brownish black in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Just like the stores&#x27; but cheaper.</li>
            <li> But wrong mascara...I ordered the &amp;#34;washable&amp;#34; version of this mascara, which I&#x27;ve used before and I love but received the waterproof version, which is dry and very difficult to remove.  I&#x27;m hoping he&#x27;ll make good on and send me the correct one, since I&#x27;ve ordered from him befor and consider him a 5 star seller!</li>
            <li> I have  used Maybelline Define-A-Lash for years in brownish black and was disappointed when it was obviously being phased out at my local stores. I decided I&#x27;d &#x27;stock up&#x27; while I still could. I continue to love this mascara for its volumizing effect on my lashes!</li>
            <li> The product arrived on the date as promised . The price and availability were good . Though I haven&#x27;t opened the product I&#x27;m assuming the quality will be great as when I ordered it last year .</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find these in the stores anymore.  So glad to have gotten a few to  hopefully last for several years.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite mascaras of all time. It can be hard to find sometimes so buying it on here is very convenient!</li>
            <li> Color is as expected.  Oddly though, it weighs down my lashes much more than the exact same product in black.  Normally my lashes will stay curled all day, but with this on, I look like Snuffleupagus (think Sesame Street) in a matter of minutes.  No clue why this color does it and the black doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Cant find this color at local store.  Love it.</li>
            <li> The product was good for the price.</li>
            <li> I have used this mascara for a few years, and I love it. It goes on easily, the brush is perfect for my eyelashes, and a tube seems to last me quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;I was really disappointed to find recently that Maybelline no longer seems to be making the brownish black in this mascara. Multiple trips to various retail stores and all I could find was black.&lt;br /&gt;I was THRILLED to find that Amazon has stock, and even better was the price. These usually sell for around $7 each in stores. Amazons price is fantastic. I bought 6 tubes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried about 4 or 5 other Maybelline mascaras, and I just never seem to like the different brushes. This one has &#x27;rubber&#x27; bristles rather than the soft brush kind, and it just seems to work better for me. I have short, thin eyelashes, and a regular soft brush just never seems to get enough mascara onto my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I hope Maybelline reconsiders taking the brownish black off the market.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product, and especially at the price I got it for from Amazon.</li>
            <li> My favorite!!!! Makes eyelashes look long and never clumpy</li>
            <li> I could not find Black/Brown Define a Lash anywhere.  Ordered here and when it arrived it also included a Define A Line eyeliner with each mascara....I&#x27;m set for a year. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years and I can&#x27;t find it in stores any longer.  Found it on line and bought as many of them as I could find.  I hope this is not a product which is being discontinued by Maybelline !!!</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  Goes on perfectly.  Also, like the brownish black color which was hard to find.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
