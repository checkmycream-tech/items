            <li>They looked so good, in fact, that I ended up wearing them out with some friends one night, not in costume, and got a ton of compliments on how great I looked.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful lashes, love them!</li>
            <li>The ardell lashes are beautiful and a great price love them</li>
            <li>I did not have to trim them and they look absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Its a good deal.</li>
            <li>Fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>Great lashes and came in wrapped nicely.</li>
            <li>so these fit perfect.  </li>
            <li>The video is not so good</li>
            <li>good delivery time</li>
            <li>so I figured they were probably good.</li>
            <li>Used these for my cousin&#x27;s wedding and loved the effect.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re beautiful and if you take care of them by removing the excess glue when you put them away and keeping them in the mold so they retain their shape, you should be able to wear them 4-5 times before they start getting lumpy or just dinky looking.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great quality, the band is very nice, and allows for easy application.</li>
            <li>Great quality lashes and sooo cheap!</li>

            <li>im super satisfied with it</li>
            <li>im super satisfied with it</li>
            <li>I was incredibly impressed the first time i tried Ardell 120 Demi Black, they give the eye a winged volumous look perfect for individuals with smaller eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Very natural looking and look good in pictures.  </li>
            <li>Ardell lashes are my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re are extremely reusable and not to mention the price is amazing!!</li>
            <li>but overall I am happy with them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on these lashes and many people have asked me if they were my real lashes.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li>These are my first lashes I got them since they look natural,  when wearing them they looked great</li>
            <li>They are perfect and makes me look like i have awesome natural long dark lashes.</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend Ardell lashes because both the demis and the whispies look amazing in pictures.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what you buy at CVS or Walgreens, for a much better price.</li>
            <li>I wear falsies on a regular basis and I was thrilled to find my favorite brand in bulk.</li>
            <li>Great price cheaper then buying at the beauty store and a great alternative to purchasing expensive lashes from M.a.c or Sephora.</li>
            <li>I had never done false lashes,these fit perfect and were easy to apply, stayed on all day</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super fun!</li>
            <li>I love thies lashes very easy and stik very well its like normal haire</li>
            <li>Amazing, natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li>Most people think they are real and compliment me</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re extremely light, the band is very comfortable, AND if you want, you can wear them without having to line the band with eyeliner because they look that natural!</li>
            <li>To me its a big difference, I wear my Ardell&#x27;s on a daily basis,they give me sort of an eyeliner look without wearing any and fill in the gaps perfectly.</li>
            <li>The 120s are my go to lash style for the look of a glamourous but still very natural and believable lashes.</li>
            <li>These lashes are very natural looking and with care I can wear a pair for more than a week.</li>
            <li>I love these lashes because they look so natural!</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments when I wear them and people always think that they&#x27;re my natural lashes!</li>
            <li>They are nice, not too fancy but just enough.</li>
            <li>They are my favorite and they look so natural.</li>
            <li>I like to have fun</li>
            <li>I even ordered another 4 pack, 8 all together and completely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The auto-ship option is just icing on the cake, and I&#x27;ve always got a fresh pair when I need them.</li>
            <li>What I expected and good price</li>
            <li>Ardell 120 is the best false eyelash yet.  </li>
            <li>Other than that its Good quality lashes.</li>
            <li>I wear them both day and night and get about 5 uses out of them if I take care of them right.</li>
            <li>I did have to snip off a tiny bit on the outer edge for a good fit for my eye shape which is very simple to do.</li>
            <li>, they&#x27;re pretty and that makes them fun.</li>
            <li>I dont really have any, and the ones i do have are super fine light and short.</li>
            <li>Soft band, and so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>These are cute but they&#x27;re too &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; meaning they don&#x27;t look at all natural because the length of the lashes are too even and straight.  </li>
            <li>They are natural looking and easy to put on.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>it takes some patience but very much practice.</li>
            <li>to wear &amp; light, as well as natural looking</li>
            <li>a pair can last me more than 20 wears.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>/&gt;re-apply them many times with proper care.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>I got 4 sets in my purchase and I&#x27;m still on my first one</li>
            <li>are those your real eyelashes?!</li>
            <li>it worked exactly as it said it would convenient got here on it</li>
            <li>it worked exactly as it said it would convenient got here on it</li>
            <li>OK, so I have recently become an eyelash addict.</li>
            <li>Very upset!</li>
            <li>I really loved them;) I bought six of them and used them everyday.</li>
            <li>So they must&#x27;ve blended in pretty well.  </li>
            <li>and I must say that although they are definitely not very real-looking (as compared to my own lashes)</li>
            <li>I love these lashes, but white strips at the lashline?</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!!</li>
            <li>They look so predty even better if you double them up</li>
            <li>I wear these daily, and they are the most natrual looking ones I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I was able to use them multiple times.  </li>
            <li>First of all they look like your own lashes, very natural looking; second, they are very easy to install, third, you can wear them all day comfortably and feel like they are barely there.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great because they&#x27;re easy to apply and they&#x27;re not too dressy for a casual outfit.</li>
            <li>You get 4 seprate packs of lashes and they&#x27;re nice and long and give a great natural (maybe a bit thin but nothing a quick swipe of mascara can&#x27;t fix) winged look.  </li>
            <li>These are more for a very natural (barely there) look.</li>
            <li>Each pair came in their own separate packaging you would find at a local store and were also inside an Amazon box, so they shipped very well and were completely protected.  </li>
            <li>These lashes are full but natural.</li>
            <li>this was such a downer not getting the right ones!!</li>
            <li>These babies look super natural.</li>
            <li>They are very realistic looking.</li>
            <li>I use them everyday and get constant compliments on how beautiful my eyelashes are.</li>
            <li>I love how you get four packs of lashes not many cosmetic companies offer such amazing deals.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t look ridiculous, but I did look amazing!</li>
            <li>It was my first time using fake eye lashes, and it was a good experience!</li>
            <li>Nice lashes to add a little drama to the eyes.</li>
            <li>They go straight out.</li>
            <li>But these are very glamorous for a date, or a night out with the girls.</li>
            <li>The lashes were the perfect length for my eye, they look really natural with the soft overlapping lashes, and no one even guessed they were false.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these to anyone!</li>
            <li>Seller was fast.</li>
            <li>I didnt really have to put on mascara with these on.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I don&#x27;t really see myself wearing them unless I&#x27;m going to a costume party.</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected.</li>
            <li>The seller sent them through very fast, i was suprised since i live overseas.</li>
            <li>Possibly the most natural and still dramatic lashes I&#x27;ve ever bought and a great deal.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t the most natural looking lashes as they are fairly long, but they add a beautiful dramatic flare.</li>
            <li>so easy to apply and lasts long.</li>
            <li>They were much longer than normal</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s enough to give yourself a FULL eyelash look.</li>
            <li>I usually buy these in bulk from my local CVS store but the store stopped carrying them in stock (or they are just really popular and gone quickly)</li>
            <li>I have always had a problem with my lashes, actually its more of a medical condition...</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, so easy to apply, and if careful removing the lashes, they may be worn again for several times.</li>
            <li>Such a better deal on amazon than paying $10 extra in a salon.</li>
            <li>they look very natural and work very well.</li>
            <li>they were not black , they were brown!!!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>If you like a little more drama with your lashes these are not probably for you.</li>
            <li>Very whispy and lightweight looking with a natural curl at the end.  </li>
            <li>It looks great and does look fake at all.</li>
            <li>Cheaper on Amazon than the normal 3.99-3.60</li>
            <li>Ardell lashes are my new favorite lashes I have completely stopped purchasing the more expensive brand lashes.</li>
            <li>The lashes do not feel cheap and hard, the band is pretty much invisible(easy</li>
            <li>They can be easily trimmed down, i recommend using Duo Eyelash glue.</li>
            <li>I keep them on for 2weeks and remove, then grab a new pair.</li>
            <li>they gave a staggered lash length making them look completely natural, even being &amp;#34;unnaturally&amp;#34; long and full</li>
            <li>These are very natural looking with the exception of their length.</li>
            <li>Very natural Looking and durable.</li>
            <li>Lash band is clear and durable!</li>
            <li>But these look so natural!</li>
            <li>They appear natural and can be worn every day!</li>
            <li>They look so natural!</li>
            <li>I love this lashes but somehow i found them all 4 to look different from each other.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even wear much makeup generally.  </li>
            <li>I got the hang of it pretty quickly, especially after I figured out to put them on the outer 2/3 of my eyelid.  </li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t ever ever send the funny looking lashes in the peach box and white strip.  </li>
            <li>Ardell is my go-to brand for natural looking lashes!</li>
            <li>I was first exposed to this brand at my local Target.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other lashes and always go back to these.</li>
            <li>And easy to use a few times.</li>
            <li>I love that they provide a full lash look without being obviously fake.</li>
            <li>I have previously purchased exact brand from Amazon through another supplier and lashes were MUCH better from other supplier.</li>
            <li>This batch however was not as good as other ones Ive purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li>Load up on the mascara and lay these bad boys on top and better wear will come of them</li>
            <li>Luv the way they look, they truly stand for they&#x27;re name, natural lashes.</li>
            <li>However, I much prefer the Demi Wispies over the 120 regular wispies.</li>
            <li>they look natural with a bit of flair.</li>
            <li>they look so natural</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:moB2025J45XZH0]]I wanted to post this video to show you lash wearers how natural Ardell brand lashes look.</li>
            <li>These are by far my favourite lashes.</li>
            <li>Also the price is far cheaper on Amazon than you would find in any drugstore.</li>
            <li>The look so natural and</li>
            <li>Natural looking.</li>
            <li>Band is nearly invisible after applying eyeliner over it to camouflage it.</li>
            <li>Natural look.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re glam but natural looking.</li>
            <li>:) if you wash them properly you can wear them a few times.</li>
            <li>People can&#x27;t really tell if they are fake or my own lashes...</li>
            <li>They are nice but too small for long lashes.</li>
            <li>The right lash is a VERY crucial part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li>But they are a liiiiittle bit more thicker than natural lashes but not too much that they&#x27;re so dramatic.</li>
            <li>the 120 demi black eyelashes might be a little bit too much for daily makeup, but I still love it.</li>
            <li>I can wear mine over and over easily for at least a week.</li>
            <li>I do not want those tiny skimpy ones and so the 120s are just enough to be glamourous and yet not too much for work.  </li>
            <li>The demis are just as lush, but don&#x27;t go as far into my inner corner.</li>
            <li>Very natural and actually stayed on for 3 days!  </li>
            <li>my natural lashes are long but not very thick and that&#x27;s what I wanted them for.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have normally big eyelashes naturally</li>
            <li>They are very durable and can be worn over and over if you are careful not to over apply glue.</li>
            <li>So natural looking, yet so thick and full of volume.</li>
            <li>these are near impossible to get on and make look good.</li>
            <li>I find that other lashes are too wide which makes the look less natural and more obvious</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re more dramatic than I thought</li>
            <li>I bought two different styles of Ardell Lashes -- one for a more dramatic look for a social event and one style that could be used any time.  </li>
            <li>This lashes are good if you want a dramatic eye, but they are a little much if you want something for everyday.</li>
            <li>I normally buy crosses each other with a whispy effect and these ones do not.</li>

            <li> The ardell lashes are beautiful and a great price love them</li>

            <li> Used these for my cousin&#x27;s wedding and loved the effect.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re beautiful and if you take care of them by removing the excess glue when you put them away and keeping them in the mold so they retain their shape, you should be able to wear them 4-5 times before they start getting lumpy or just dinky looking.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great quality, the band is very nice, and allows for easy application.</li>

            <li> I wear falsies on a regular basis and I was thrilled to find my favorite brand in bulk.</li>
            <li> Great price cheaper then buying at the beauty store and a great alternative to purchasing expensive lashes from M.a.c or Sephora.</li>
            <li> I had never done false lashes,these fit perfect and were easy to apply, stayed on all day</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super fun!</li>

            <li> Most people think they are real and compliment me</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re extremely light, the band is very comfortable, AND if you want, you can wear them without having to line the band with eyeliner because they look that natural!</li>
            <li> To me its a big difference, I wear my Ardell&#x27;s on a daily basis,they give me sort of an eyeliner look without wearing any and fill in the gaps perfectly.</li>
            <li> The 120s are my go to lash style for the look of a glamourous but still very natural and believable lashes.</li>
            <li> These lashes are very natural looking and with care I can wear a pair for more than a week.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes because they look so natural!</li>

            <li> They are nice, not too fancy but just enough.</li>
            <li> They are my favorite and they look so natural.</li>
            <li> I like to have fun</li>
            <li> I even ordered another 4 pack, 8 all together and completely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The auto-ship option is just icing on the cake, and I&#x27;ve always got a fresh pair when I need them.</li>
            <li> What I expected and good price</li>
            <li> Ardell 120 is the best false eyelash yet.  </li>
            <li> Other than that its Good quality lashes.</li>
            <li> I wear them both day and night and get about 5 uses out of them if I take care of them right.</li>
            <li> I did have to snip off a tiny bit on the outer edge for a good fit for my eye shape which is very simple to do.</li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re pretty and that makes them fun.</li>
            <li> I dont really have any, and the ones i do have are super fine light and short.</li>
            <li> Soft band, and so easy to apply.</li>
            <li> These are cute but they&#x27;re too &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; meaning they don&#x27;t look at all natural because the length of the lashes are too even and straight.  </li>
            <li> They are natural looking and easy to put on.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> it takes some patience but very much practice.</li>
            <li> to wear &amp; light, as well as natural looking</li>
            <li> a pair can last me more than 20 wears.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> /&gt;re-apply them many times with proper care.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> I got 4 sets in my purchase and I&#x27;m still on my first one</li>
            <li> are those your real eyelashes?!</li>
            <li> it worked exactly as it said it would convenient got here on it</li>
            <li> it worked exactly as it said it would convenient got here on it</li>
            <li> OK, so I have recently become an eyelash addict.</li>
            <li> Very upset!</li>
            <li> I really loved them;) I bought six of them and used them everyday.</li>
            <li> So they must&#x27;ve blended in pretty well.  </li>
            <li> and I must say that although they are definitely not very real-looking (as compared to my own lashes)</li>
            <li> I love these lashes, but white strips at the lashline?</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them!!</li>
            <li> They look so predty even better if you double them up</li>
            <li> I wear these daily, and they are the most natrual looking ones I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I was able to use them multiple times.  </li>
            <li> First of all they look like your own lashes, very natural looking; second, they are very easy to install, third, you can wear them all day comfortably and feel like they are barely there.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great because they&#x27;re easy to apply and they&#x27;re not too dressy for a casual outfit.</li>
            <li> You get 4 seprate packs of lashes and they&#x27;re nice and long and give a great natural (maybe a bit thin but nothing a quick swipe of mascara can&#x27;t fix) winged look.  </li>
            <li> These are more for a very natural (barely there) look.</li>
            <li> Each pair came in their own separate packaging you would find at a local store and were also inside an Amazon box, so they shipped very well and were completely protected.  </li>
            <li> These lashes are full but natural.</li>
            <li> this was such a downer not getting the right ones!!</li>
            <li> These babies look super natural.</li>
            <li> They are very realistic looking.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday and get constant compliments on how beautiful my eyelashes are.</li>
            <li> I love how you get four packs of lashes not many cosmetic companies offer such amazing deals.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t look ridiculous, but I did look amazing!</li>
            <li> It was my first time using fake eye lashes, and it was a good experience!</li>
            <li> Nice lashes to add a little drama to the eyes.</li>
            <li> They go straight out.</li>
            <li> But these are very glamorous for a date, or a night out with the girls.</li>
            <li> The lashes were the perfect length for my eye, they look really natural with the soft overlapping lashes, and no one even guessed they were false.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these to anyone!</li>
            <li> Seller was fast.</li>
            <li> I didnt really have to put on mascara with these on.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I don&#x27;t really see myself wearing them unless I&#x27;m going to a costume party.</li>
            <li> It really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected.</li>
            <li> The seller sent them through very fast, i was suprised since i live overseas.</li>
            <li> Possibly the most natural and still dramatic lashes I&#x27;ve ever bought and a great deal.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t the most natural looking lashes as they are fairly long, but they add a beautiful dramatic flare.</li>
            <li> so easy to apply and lasts long.</li>
            <li> They were much longer than normal</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s enough to give yourself a FULL eyelash look.</li>
            <li> I usually buy these in bulk from my local CVS store but the store stopped carrying them in stock (or they are just really popular and gone quickly)</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem with my lashes, actually its more of a medical condition...</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, so easy to apply, and if careful removing the lashes, they may be worn again for several times.</li>
            <li> Such a better deal on amazon than paying $10 extra in a salon.</li>
            <li> they look very natural and work very well.</li>
            <li> they were not black , they were brown!!!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> If you like a little more drama with your lashes these are not probably for you.</li>
            <li> Very whispy and lightweight looking with a natural curl at the end.  </li>
            <li> It looks great and does look fake at all.</li>
            <li> Cheaper on Amazon than the normal 3.99-3.60</li>
            <li> Ardell lashes are my new favorite lashes I have completely stopped purchasing the more expensive brand lashes.</li>
            <li> The lashes do not feel cheap and hard, the band is pretty much invisible(easy</li>
            <li> They can be easily trimmed down, i recommend using Duo Eyelash glue.</li>
            <li> I keep them on for 2weeks and remove, then grab a new pair.</li>
            <li> they gave a staggered lash length making them look completely natural, even being &amp;#34;unnaturally&amp;#34; long and full</li>
            <li> These are very natural looking with the exception of their length.</li>
            <li> Very natural Looking and durable.</li>
            <li> Lash band is clear and durable!</li>
            <li> But these look so natural!</li>
            <li> They appear natural and can be worn every day!</li>
            <li> They look so natural!</li>
            <li> I love this lashes but somehow i found them all 4 to look different from each other.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even wear much makeup generally.  </li>
            <li> I got the hang of it pretty quickly, especially after I figured out to put them on the outer 2/3 of my eyelid.  </li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t ever ever send the funny looking lashes in the peach box and white strip.  </li>
            <li> Ardell is my go-to brand for natural looking lashes!</li>
            <li> I was first exposed to this brand at my local Target.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other lashes and always go back to these.</li>
            <li> And easy to use a few times.</li>
            <li> I love that they provide a full lash look without being obviously fake.</li>
            <li> I have previously purchased exact brand from Amazon through another supplier and lashes were MUCH better from other supplier.</li>
            <li> This batch however was not as good as other ones Ive purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> Load up on the mascara and lay these bad boys on top and better wear will come of them</li>
            <li> Luv the way they look, they truly stand for they&#x27;re name, natural lashes.</li>
            <li> However, I much prefer the Demi Wispies over the 120 regular wispies.</li>
            <li> they look natural with a bit of flair.</li>
            <li> they look so natural</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moB2025J45XZH0]]I wanted to post this video to show you lash wearers how natural Ardell brand lashes look.</li>
            <li> These are by far my favourite lashes.</li>
            <li> Also the price is far cheaper on Amazon than you would find in any drugstore.</li>
            <li> The look so natural and</li>
            <li> Natural looking.</li>
            <li> Band is nearly invisible after applying eyeliner over it to camouflage it.</li>
            <li> Natural look.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re glam but natural looking.</li>
            <li> :) if you wash them properly you can wear them a few times.</li>
            <li> People can&#x27;t really tell if they are fake or my own lashes...</li>
            <li> They are nice but too small for long lashes.</li>
            <li> The right lash is a VERY crucial part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> But they are a liiiiittle bit more thicker than natural lashes but not too much that they&#x27;re so dramatic.</li>
            <li> the 120 demi black eyelashes might be a little bit too much for daily makeup, but I still love it.</li>
            <li> I can wear mine over and over easily for at least a week.</li>
            <li> I do not want those tiny skimpy ones and so the 120s are just enough to be glamourous and yet not too much for work.  </li>
            <li> The demis are just as lush, but don&#x27;t go as far into my inner corner.</li>
            <li> Very natural and actually stayed on for 3 days!  </li>
            <li> my natural lashes are long but not very thick and that&#x27;s what I wanted them for.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have normally big eyelashes naturally</li>
            <li> They are very durable and can be worn over and over if you are careful not to over apply glue.</li>
            <li> So natural looking, yet so thick and full of volume.</li>
            <li> these are near impossible to get on and make look good.</li>
            <li> I find that other lashes are too wide which makes the look less natural and more obvious</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re more dramatic than I thought</li>
            <li> I bought two different styles of Ardell Lashes -- one for a more dramatic look for a social event and one style that could be used any time.  </li>
            <li> This lashes are good if you want a dramatic eye, but they are a little much if you want something for everyday.</li>
            <li> I normally buy crosses each other with a whispy effect and these ones do not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing lashes daily for years and these were just too long.</li>
            <li> When they look a bit flat</li>
            <li> and now i am getting them on here for life you can defiantly make these last a long time.</li>
            <li> I normally purchase these Demi or the 110, 113 and trim them just a bit since i wear them everyday and for every occasion.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on and didn&#x27;t look too fake.  </li>
            <li> Full, long, thick lashes are always in style, but applying false lashes daily isn’t always practical and is very time consuming.  </li>
            <li> I use them everyday when I&#x27;m not lazy</li>
            <li> They look mostly natural but are a little too long on the outer eyelash.</li>
            <li> I wish I had bought these a long time ago.</li>
            <li> False eye lashes are a lot of fun to have.</li>
            <li> Once I found about these lashes I knew I was never going back to any other ones.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are not this long!</li>
            <li> Super long lashes and were ultimately uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> These are natural for everyday wear !</li>
            <li> I use mine at least 5-6 times normally.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes, but it was very disappointing to pay for a 4 pack and only receive one.</li>
            <li> I got them as part of a costume and practiced putting them on a few times before the big day.  </li>
            <li> Product was as expected.</li>
            <li> Takes less time to dry and it lasts.</li>
            <li> Look pretty fake on but that&#x27;s what I was going for with my costume.</li>
            <li> I was expecting long wispy lashes that were pictured, the ones I received were straight, short and VERY fake looking.</li>
            <li> These will fool anyone and not just under the dark lights of a club.</li>
            <li> Ordering them from Amazon is at least 50% cheaper than getting them in local drug stores or beauty supply stores.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these late Saturday night and they arrived at my home the following Wednesday.</li>
            <li> I have short but thick lashes, so these strips give me the length I need.</li>
            <li> The band is also thin so if applied correctly it is invisible which makes them seem natural and weightless.</li>
            <li> style looks very natural on my eyes and it&#x27;s not too dramatic</li>
            <li> I think that this would be a really smart buy for anyone who craves really dramatic lashes but either can’t wear false lashes, or don’t have the time to apply falsies in their daily routine.</li>
            <li> so I had to cut them down a bit.</li>
            <li> I bought these hoping for the DEMI 120 Black lashes.</li>
            <li> but i would say still natural not super dramatic , adds volume</li>
            <li> Not too long or too thick.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear false eyelashes generally.  </li>
            <li> I did have to cut the length a little.</li>
            <li> They look so natural and not so dramatic like some lashes I have purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> But these aren&#x27;t everyday lashes, they&#x27;re going out lashes.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t wear them everyday though).</li>
            <li> There were always a few Ardell pairs</li>
            <li> I have started wearing these everyday.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t lose shape and are not too dramatic with just enough flare for day/night.</li>
            <li> Have worn the Demi 120 black lash for the past 10 years!  </li>
            <li> You can usually buy one pair for $5</li>
            <li> So finding a way to get the look of fake lashes without actually having to take the time to glue them on is life changing!</li>
            <li> I have small eyes</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s unbelievable...</li>
            <li> The #120&#x27;s give my short lashes length and volume, without looking over-the-top.</li>
            <li> I have always struggled with my brows and lashes and after trial and error.... and lots of money wasted!!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a ill stiff but no more than how mascara feels.</li>
            <li> Living in Australia, it&#x27;s hard to find quality fashion false eyelashes in bulk</li>
            <li> Ugh, I signed up for the monthly shipments too but had to cancel due to disappointment.</li>
            <li> I wear false lashes every single day and have never had such a terrible pair of lashes before.</li>
            <li> I usually get the 110 for fear of looking too fake, but I tried these</li>
            <li> These are dramatic without being ridiculous, wear them all them time.</li>
            <li> Not happy about the switch and to much trouble to return!!!</li>
            <li> I like how they are thin but still makes a statement.</li>
            <li> These lashes just looked very fake and weird on me as they were way too thick, and they also felt heavy.</li>
            <li> Not too over dramatic.</li>
            <li> my friend actually said \\&quot;Holy crap!</li>
            <li> I have looked all over online to find fashion lashes, and I have ended up ordering some that look plastic and fake when they arrive.</li>
            <li> I have bought expensive brands as well as not so expensive ones</li>
            <li> quite fake looking, so if this is what you want, then use -</li>
            <li> I never tried fake lashes I bought one at mac</li>
            <li> but since it was expensive I decided to buy these to play around with.</li>
            <li> They look so fake</li>
            <li> My friend asked me if I was planning on putting on false lashes for our night out!  </li>
            <li> , sorry !</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look fake at all!</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> However, I was VERY disappointed when I got them in the mail.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The rave about Ardell  eyelashes was insane, so I just had to make a purchase to experince this for myself.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are one of my favourite styles.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to wear &amp; light, as well as natural looking&lt;br /&gt;I love Ardell lashes because they are so comfortable and a pair can last me more than 20 wears.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Think I reviewed these before.  Took over 2 years but found &amp;#34;my lash&amp;#34; Ardell 120&#x27;s.  I want glam.  I do not want those tiny skimpy ones and so the 120s are just enough to be glamourous and yet not too much for work.  Try the 120s: I believe you&#x27;ll love them too.</li>
            <li> I bought these hoping for the DEMI 120 Black lashes. I usually buy these in bulk from my local CVS store but the store stopped carrying them in stock (or they are just really popular and gone quickly) but when I found these online I was ecstatic. However, I was VERY disappointed when I got them in the mail. They are NOT the 120 Demi lashes that I buy from the store. The DEMI 120 I normally buy crosses each other with a whispy effect and these ones do not. They go straight out. It says on the package though that they are the 120 DEMI. Either Ardell redesigned this style or they are mistaken. I am very disappointed. The right lash is a VERY crucial part of my daily routine. The only thing I wear is falsies, no makeup no foundation no eyeshadow...this was such a downer not getting the right ones!! Ugh, I signed up for the monthly shipments too but had to cancel due to disappointment.</li>
            <li> I Love Ardell Lashes!&lt;br /&gt;They are great and you can remove and&lt;br /&gt;re-apply them many times with proper care.&lt;br /&gt;Great price!!!  Fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li> These are great quality, as Ardell lashes always are. But these aren&#x27;t everyday lashes, they&#x27;re going out lashes. So just beware of that when you buy them. If you&#x27;re looking for a day lash, you&#x27;ll love the 110 or 113. But these are very glamorous for a date, or a night out with the girls. I love them! They&#x27;re super fun!</li>
            <li> These lashes are the best. I&#x27;ve been wearing them for 5 years. They are nice, not too fancy but just enough.</li>
            <li> I had never done false lashes,these fit perfect and were easy to apply, stayed on all day and I love them.</li>
            <li> These babies look super natural. I have short but thick lashes, so these strips give me the length I need.</li>
            <li> The lashes were the perfect length for my eye, they look really natural with the soft overlapping lashes, and no one even guessed they were false. I love them!</li>
            <li> The 120s are my go to lash style for the look of a glamourous but still very natural and believable lashes. This batch however was not as good as other ones Ive purchased in the past.  They were much longer than normal so I had to cut them down a bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep this simple: I refuse to use any eyelash extensions besides this one. I have big asian eyes and this is the only eyelashes that fit my eyes perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great quality lashes and sooo cheap! You can usually buy one pair for $5 so I&#x27;m happy :) These are the best natural lashes out there</li>
            <li> I love these lashes because they look so natural! I am not a pro at putting on my own lashes but these ones are so easy... I did not have to trim them and they look absolutely gorgeous. If you like a little more drama with your lashes these are not probably for you. I prefer the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look so these are just wonderful for me.</li>
            <li> Great length for a wedding or night out.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes.  They look so natural and not so dramatic like some lashes I have purchased in the past.  I got 4 sets in my purchase and I&#x27;m still on my first one (I don&#x27;t wear them everyday though).</li>
            <li> I love wearing lashes so i wanted to try these. They are perfect and makes me look like i have awesome natural long dark lashes. my friend actually said \\&quot;Holy crap! are those your real eyelashes?! They look amazing!!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> they were not black , they were brown!!! Not happy about the switch and to much trouble to return!!! Flora</li>
            <li> I so love these lashes. They are my favorite and they look so natural. Ever since I have purchased them I have been looking for them everywhere. I will definitely be purchasing them from here. Its a good deal.</li>
            <li> Luv the way they look, they truly stand for they&#x27;re name, natural lashes. ..I will definitely buy them again</li>
            <li> These lashes are not over the top. They are fine for day time wear. I did have to cut the length a little.</li>
            <li> I wear falsies on a regular basis and I was thrilled to find my favorite brand in bulk. They&#x27;re great because they&#x27;re easy to apply and they&#x27;re not too dressy for a casual outfit. They really give your look a perfect finishing touch. Ill definitely be back for more.</li>
            <li> Great price cheaper then buying at the beauty store and a great alternative to purchasing expensive lashes from M.a.c or Sephora. These are my go to lashes for both day and evening looks. Ardell lashes are my new favorite lashes I have completely stopped purchasing the more expensive brand lashes. Will definitely repurchase on Amazon !</li>
            <li> I bought two different styles of Ardell Lashes -- one for a more dramatic look for a social event and one style that could be used any time.  Once you master putting them on, they look very nice.  I did have to snip off a tiny bit on the outer edge for a good fit for my eye shape which is very simple to do.</li>
            <li> these are near impossible to get on and make look good.</li>
            <li> I love these! I have looked all over online to find fashion lashes, and I have ended up ordering some that look plastic and fake when they arrive. But these look so natural! They are also really comfortable and really easy to apply. I love that they provide a full lash look without being obviously fake. I would highly recommend these to anyone!</li>
            <li> Ardell 120 is the best false eyelash yet.  Cheaper on Amazon than the normal 3.99-3.60 I pay at the store.</li>
            <li> False eye lashes are a lot of fun to have. Amazon is a great place to find super deals</li>
            <li> Love them. They appear natural and can be worn every day! I wear them more than once. My favorite brand of lashes!</li>
            <li> First of all they look like your own lashes, very natural looking; second, they are very easy to install, third, you can wear them all day comfortably and feel like they are barely there. It&#x27;s much cheaper to get it here from Amazon than the stores, plus they can be reused if you take good care of them. They are one of my necessities if I&#x27;m having a night out. What can I say: Love Them!</li>
            <li> i love it itsi love it its amazing it worked exactly as it said it would convenient got here on it im super satisfied with it love love love  amazing it worked exactly as it said it would convenient got here on it im super satisfied with it love love love</li>
            <li> OK, so I have recently become an eyelash addict. The Ardell lashes are very nice. However, I much prefer the Demi Wispies over the 120 regular wispies. The demis are just as lush, but don&#x27;t go as far into my inner corner. Which for me, makes them more comfortable AND flattering. The three stars is for quality.</li>
            <li> Love this eyelashes! They look so natural!</li>
            <li> I love this lashes but somehow i found them all 4 to look different from each other. Other than that its Good quality lashes.</li>
            <li> so easy to apply and lasts long.</li>
            <li> Great lashes after I&#x27;ve been using the at ardell 105, this lashes is the next best lashes I am using now.the contour of it fits well to my eyelid.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite lashes. Very natural looking and look good in pictures.  Also the plastic packaging makes for easy storage.</li>
            <li> Once I found about these lashes I knew I was never going back to any other ones. They&#x27;re extremely light, the band is very comfortable, AND if you want, you can wear them without having to line the band with eyeliner because they look that natural! They&#x27;re are extremely reusable and not to mention the price is amazing!!</li>
            <li> Nice lashes that don&#x27;t look like plastic. These will fool anyone and not just under the dark lights of a club.</li>
            <li> These are great for when you want to just accentuate the eyes without the lift off! Easy app with Kiss&#x27;s glue. Takes less time to dry and it lasts. I&#x27;ve been able to reuse lashes 3 + times now. They&#x27;re a ill stiff but no more than how mascara feels. Load up on the mascara and lay these bad boys on top and better wear will come of them however sometimes I like the added drama nothing soap and water can&#x27;t soak off. (Luke warm water) hope this helps and enjoy!</li>
            <li> I have only received one pack. I love these lashes, but it was very disappointing to pay for a 4 pack and only receive one. Very upset!</li>
            <li> Disappointed. I have previously purchased exact brand from Amazon through another supplier and lashes were MUCH better from other supplier.</li>
            <li> We use these for both my dancing daughters for all their recitals and competitions. Great lashes at a great price!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re more dramatic than I thought but overall I am happy with them. Boyfriend said I look beautiful with them on and off.</li>
            <li> I always love ardell lashes. great quality every time. Shipping was quick, very satisfied</li>
            <li> Amazing, natural looking lashes. Not too long or too thick. Great for brides.</li>
            <li> Love these. Beautiful and natural looking lashes. Fit perfectly. Seller was fast. Packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> The rave about Ardell  eyelashes was insane, so I just had to make a purchase to experince this for myself. I am really big on beauty and glamour. I love these Ardell 120 eyelashes it takes some patience but very much practice. I love how you get four packs of lashes not many cosmetic companies offer such amazing deals. Defintely will be making another purchase. You can reuse the eyelashes if you peel off the glue after using them.</li>
            <li> These are natural for everyday wear ! Don&#x27;t lose shape and are not too dramatic with just enough flare for day/night.</li>
            <li> Full, long, thick lashes are always in style, but applying false lashes daily isn’t always practical and is very time consuming.  So finding a way to get the look of fake lashes without actually having to take the time to glue them on is life changing! I think that this would be a really smart buy for anyone who craves really dramatic lashes but either can’t wear false lashes, or don’t have the time to apply falsies in their daily routine. Visit my site and message me for details, I am more than happy to share my before and afters!    [...]</li>
            <li> Soft band, and so easy to apply. They&#x27;re great for every eye shape! And easy to use a few times. I use mine at least 5-6 times normally.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these babies! I use them everyday when I&#x27;m not lazy they look natural with a bit of flair. Most people think they are real and compliment me</li>
            <li> Got these lashes today and are very satisfied with them.  They are very realistic looking. You can trim them to any length you want, but probably don&#x27;t need to.  Very whispy and lightweight looking with a natural curl at the end.  Very cute!  You get 4 packs of 2 lashes, so they&#x27;ll last you a while.  Can&#x27;t wait to wear them out!  Each pair came in their own separate packaging you would find at a local store and were also inside an Amazon box, so they shipped very well and were completely protected.  A+ to the seller!</li>
            <li> I really loved them;) I bought six of them and used them everyday. I defiantly going to order more of em&#x27;.</li>
            <li> These are my first lashes I got them since they look natural,  when wearing them they looked great my natural lashes are long but not very thick and that&#x27;s what I wanted them for.  I didnt really have to put on mascara with these on.</li>
            <li> Great lashes and came in wrapped nicely. They look mostly natural but are a little too long on the outer eyelash. I would prefer something more even and gradual. But I do like them.</li>
            <li> Very natural and great quality. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> These lashes are my favorite brand and style.  I have small eyes so these fit perfect.  I find that other lashes are too wide which makes the look less natural and more obvious I am wearing fakes.&lt;br /&gt;This style looks very natural on my eyes and it&#x27;s not too dramatic but it&#x27;s enough to give yourself a FULL eyelash look.</li>
            <li> This pair of eyelashes are my new best friends! they look so natural, people can&#x27;t tell I&#x27;m wearing them. It just makes my eyes pop.</li>
            <li> Took about a year and a half but found the lash style that is perfect for me.  These are dramatic without being ridiculous, wear them all them time. I like to have fun, they&#x27;re pretty and that makes them fun.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moB2025J45XZH0]]I wanted to post this video to show you lash wearers how natural Ardell brand lashes look. I have always had a problem with my lashes, actually its more of a medical condition... I dont really have any, and the ones i do have are super fine light and short. I have always struggled with my brows and lashes and after trial and error.... and lots of money wasted!! lol, I have realized that there just isn&#x27;t anything better than Ardell&#x27;s. I have bought expensive brands as well as not so expensive ones and I keep coming back to this brand. The video is not so good but i hope you get the just of it, sorry ! To me its a big difference, I wear my Ardell&#x27;s on a daily basis,they give me sort of an eyeliner look without wearing any and fill in the gaps perfectly. I actually use a medical grade adhesive that is used for eyelash extensions so that I don&#x27;t need to take them off every night. I keep them on for 2weeks and remove, then grab a new pair. I normally purchase these Demi or the 110, 113 and trim them just a bit since i wear them everyday and for every occasion. I have many pairs and in many styles. I hope this review helps in justifying the quality of these amazing lashes. ;)&lt;br /&gt;Thank god for Amazon and suppliers making it possible to buy in bulk.</li>
            <li> The ardell lashes are beautiful and a great price love them And even tho everyone is broke these days we can all afford this price</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear false eyelashes generally.  I don&#x27;t even wear much makeup generally.  So when I bought these, I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing, and I didn&#x27;t realize they didn&#x27;t go all the way across my eyelid.  I got them as part of a costume and practiced putting them on a few times before the big day.  They look fantastic!  I got the hang of it pretty quickly, especially after I figured out to put them on the outer 2/3 of my eyelid.  They looked so good, in fact, that I ended up wearing them out with some friends one night, not in costume, and got a ton of compliments on how great I looked.  So they must&#x27;ve blended in pretty well.  I didn&#x27;t look ridiculous, but I did look amazing!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great quality, the band is very nice, and allows for easy application. But I&#x27;m glad that the purpose I bought these lashes was so I can practice while I am taking makeup classes. Otherwise, I don&#x27;t really see myself wearing them unless I&#x27;m going to a costume party.</li>
            <li> I love wearing fake lashes. I usually get the 110 for fear of looking too fake, but I tried these and I must say that although they are definitely not very real-looking (as compared to my own lashes) they look extremely nice. Someone even thought that I had just curled and put mascara on my lashes. They&#x27;re beautiful and if you take care of them by removing the excess glue when you put them away and keeping them in the mold so they retain their shape, you should be able to wear them 4-5 times before they start getting lumpy or just dinky looking.</li>
            <li> These are probably one of my favorite lashes out there..I just use the same glue  brand and it works best..</li>
            <li> These lashes just looked very fake and weird on me as they were way too thick, and they also felt heavy.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes, but white strips at the lashline? C&#x27;mon. Please don&#x27;t ever ever send the funny looking lashes in the peach box and white strip.  Horrible.</li>
            <li> Love love love these lashes. I get so many compliments when I wear them and people always think that they&#x27;re my natural lashes! But they are a liiiiittle bit more thicker than natural lashes but not too much that they&#x27;re so dramatic. I wear them both day and night and get about 5 uses out of them if I take care of them right.</li>
            <li> These are cute but they&#x27;re too &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; meaning they don&#x27;t look at all natural because the length of the lashes are too even and straight.  I love the Demi whispies bc they gave a staggered lash length making them look completely natural, even being &amp;#34;unnaturally&amp;#34; long and full</li>
            <li> Best lashes ever!!! They don&#x27;t look fake at all!</li>
            <li> great lashes , nice length full but i would say still natural not super dramatic , adds volume and i would repurchase them + good delivery time</li>
            <li> Living in Australia, it&#x27;s hard to find quality fashion false eyelashes in bulk so i thought buying online is the best way to go. I am a regular user of Ardell and i have to say these rival the quality of MAC Cosmetic eyelashes. I was incredibly impressed the first time i tried Ardell 120 Demi Black, they give the eye a winged volumous look perfect for individuals with smaller eyelashes. They can be easily trimmed down, i recommend using Duo Eyelash glue. The lashes do not feel cheap and hard, the band is pretty much invisible(easy to pull off with nude eyeshadow) and the have a feminine flick about them. I highly recommend these, they&#x27;re just beautiful. The seller sent them through very fast, i was suprised since i live overseas. I even ordered another 4 pack, 8 all together and completely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a very happy customer.</li>
            <li> These are the best lashes I&#x27;ve ever used! I use them everyday and get constant compliments on how beautiful my eyelashes are. They are natural looking and easy to put on. I highly recommend them!!</li>
            <li> great eye lashes perfect can use them from 2 to 3 time&lt;br /&gt;marvelous give a sexy not faking look&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love them</li>
            <li> Super long lashes and were ultimately uncomfortable. I&#x27;ve been wearing lashes daily for years and these were just too long. I&#x27;ll stick with my demi wispies.</li>
            <li> quite fake looking, so if this is what you want, then use - but I don&#x27;t have normally big eyelashes naturally so it may work for someone who does?</li>
            <li> the 120 demi black eyelashes might be a little bit too much for daily makeup, but I still love it.</li>
            <li> LOVE these lashes!!! They look so predty even better if you double them up (See huda kattan video).  Perfect lashes and so soft :) if you wash them properly you can wear them a few times.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful, full lashes. The best brand to buy because they look the most real. Would buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> These are very natural looking with the exception of their length. I wear them to work ocassionally. They make my eyes look huge!</li>
            <li> great lashes...much better price than the retail stores.  Quick delivery, so easy to apply, and if careful removing the lashes, they may be worn again for several times.</li>
            <li> Not human hair. These are synthetic. I buy lashes for my salon all the time so I do know the difference. The packaging doesn&#x27;t say %100 human hair and it&#x27;s obvious whey I saw them in person.</li>
            <li> Ardell is my go-to brand for natural looking lashes! I was first exposed to this brand at my local Target. There were always a few Ardell pairs so I figured they were probably good. They totally are. These lashes are very natural looking and with care I can wear a pair for more than a week. When they look a bit flat I just curl them. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on these lashes and many people have asked me if they were my real lashes. I wish!</li>
            <li> These are by far my favourite lashes. they look very natural and work very well. they are durable and I have gotten many uses out of just one pair. They keep their shape after multiple washes and still look great!</li>
            <li> very good quality lashes. if taken good care of i am able to use for up to 3 weeks. ardell lashes are the best!</li>
            <li> Love these lashes. I&#x27;ve reused them about ten times already (with proper care) and they still hold up after hours of wearing them.</li>
            <li> Love these lashes! Perfect for a night out! They aren&#x27;t the most natural looking lashes as they are fairly long, but they add a beautiful dramatic flare. The band is also thin so if applied correctly it is invisible which makes them seem natural and weightless. Also the price is far cheaper on Amazon than you would find in any drugstore. Would purchase these again and again!</li>
            <li> These are the best lashes I&#x27;ve had in a long time</li>
            <li> Beautiful lashes! I love them!</li>
            <li> Look pretty fake on but that&#x27;s what I was going for with my costume.</li>
            <li> I never tried fake lashes I bought one at mac but since it was expensive I decided to buy these to play around with. I actually love these. I plan on always buying. It looks great and does look fake at all. I wish I had bought these a long time ago. It really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I have tried different brands, but their lashes are the easiest to work with.</li>
            <li> Ardell lashes are my absolute favorite! You will not regret your purchase if you are looking for great lashes, great quality and a great price!</li>
            <li> It is cheaper to purchase this in bulk.</li>
            <li> I love thies lashes very easy and stik very well its like normal haire i well buy it again  and the price is soo goood</li>
            <li> The lashes arrived just as described (Ardell #120).  I wear these daily, and they are the most natrual looking ones I&#x27;ve tried.  Ordering them from Amazon is at least 50% cheaper than getting them in local drug stores or beauty supply stores.  The auto-ship option is just icing on the cake, and I&#x27;ve always got a fresh pair when I need them.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years,and continue to reorder them!</li>
            <li> Love this lash. Have worn the Demi 120 black lash for the past 10 years!  Defines my eyes beautifully and naturally!  I receive  many compliments!</li>
            <li> Wonderful eye lashes. Band&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Used these for my cousin&#x27;s wedding and loved the effect. Very natural and actually stayed on for 3 days!  I immediately ordered 4 pairs after the wedding to wear for upcoming weddings. Such a better deal on amazon than paying $10 extra in a salon.</li>
            <li> They look so fake it&#x27;s unbelievable... don&#x27;t buy it. Rather, buy a better quality and reuse.</li>
            <li> I ordered these late Saturday night and they arrived at my home the following Wednesday. They are exactly what you buy at CVS or Walgreens, for a much better price. The #120&#x27;s give my short lashes length and volume, without looking over-the-top. I have started wearing these everyday.</li>
            <li> Great price and great quality. I like how they are thin but still makes a statement.</li>
            <li> I get comments all the time on how great my lashes look!  I bet you will too!  Two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> There are my favortie eyelashes. The look so natural and after you learn how to put them on, they look really great!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these. Very natural Looking and durable. I can wear mine over and over easily for at least a week. Great price.  Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> These were great!  Easy to put on and didn&#x27;t look too fake.  Once they were on, I couldn&#x27;t feel that they were on unless they were falling off after several hours.  I was able to use them multiple times.  It was my first time using fake eye lashes, and it was a good experience!</li>
            <li> What I expected and good price</li>
            <li> Perfect every day lash!</li>
            <li> These are perfect. Possibly the most natural and still dramatic lashes I&#x27;ve ever bought and a great deal. You get 4 seprate packs of lashes and they&#x27;re nice and long and give a great natural (maybe a bit thin but nothing a quick swipe of mascara can&#x27;t fix) winged look.  They are very durable and can be worn over and over if you are careful not to over apply glue.</li>
            <li> the deal was 4 packs of Ardell Fashion Lashes Pair - 120 and  4 packs of Ardell Fashion Lashes Pair - 110&lt;br /&gt;but now I have received 8 packs of Ardell Fashion Lashes Pair - 120!!!!!</li>
            <li> The quality of these were so good! Better than I expected. Lash band is clear and durable! I also made a video review on YouTube! Check it out for more. YouTube.com/brrreathless</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend Ardell lashes because both the demis and the whispies look amazing in pictures. great price too! I love them</li>
            <li> I received four pairs of &amp;#34;Ardel Fashion Lashes- Style 120&amp;#34; the number on the product it self was correct, being style 120. However, the lashes I received were NOT what was in the photo itself. I was expecting long wispy lashes that were pictured, the ones I received were straight, short and VERY fake looking. I wear false lashes every single day and have never had such a terrible pair of lashes before.</li>
            <li> My favorite lashes ever! So natural looking, yet so thick and full of volume. I have tried many other lashes and always go back to these. I will never go with anything else! Plus, I love the subscription option. I get a packet of 4 every month!</li>
            <li> very good works very good !</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t look like unnatural. They are good length and very durable. My favorite type out of all of the styles!</li>
            <li> Nice lashes to add a little drama to the eyes. Natural looking. Not too over dramatic. Band is nearly invisible after applying eyeliner over it to camouflage it.</li>
            <li> Great lashes.  Easy to wear.  Natural look.  My friend asked me if I was planning on putting on false lashes for our night out!  I was like, &amp;#34;GIRL!  I have them on!  My eyelashes are not this long! I freaking wish!&amp;#34;  They blend in beautifully to your natural lashes but still have umph!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these lashes!! They&#x27;re glam but natural looking. Awesome!! Also, you can&#x27;t beat the price 😍</li>
            <li> Lovely lashes, very nice quality.</li>
            <li> Beautiful lashes, love them! These lashes are full but natural. Great look for day or night. Great buy!</li>
            <li> These are my favorite lashes in the World! They are perfect! People can&#x27;t really tell if they are fake or my own lashes... And thats the point! I use it every day! Love Love Love!</li>
            <li> This lashes are good if you want a dramatic eye, but they are a little much if you want something for everyday.</li>
            <li> They are nice but too small for long lashes. These are more for a very natural (barely there) look. The glamour wispies worked better.</li>
            <li> This is a deal you just cant pass up i used to get one pack of these lashes at sally&#x27;s beauty supply and now i am getting them on here for life you can defiantly make these last a long time. saves money and its a great product !</li>
            <li> the lashes look bunched up in segments when bought onlint.  when bought in the store the lashes look evenly distributed.</li>
