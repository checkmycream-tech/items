            <li>I loved this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>What I love about the product is that you don&#x27;t have to use a lot!</li>
            <li>and it made my hair feel amazing.</li>
            <li>my hair wasn&#x27;t loving it.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone no, but I think you should make your own mind up.</li>
            <li>I want it to be that I had to us so many products and gel to keep it curly</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>you can do it! :)</li>
            <li>I was suckered into buying this product because the bottle is so cute.  </li>
            <li>I should have read the label more closely and it ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Love the way my hair feels after washing it with this product.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome, and it will continue to be the only shampoo that I use.</li>
            <li>Love the way it smells but not quite the shampoo for my frizzy curly hair.</li>
            <li>I seriously love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I will still buy it, despite the (total lack of appropriate) packaging, so that should tell you how good it is!</li>
            <li>For that price, it wasn&#x27;t worth having a nice shine for droopy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With this shampoo, my hair had a smooth and not at all \\&quot;scraped\\&quot; feeling.</li>
            <li>It creates a silky, smooth, moisturizing lather.  </li>
            <li>I went to Sally Beauty Supply and bought this shampoo because I wanted something that will enhance my waves without stripping my color (reds) that is free of paraben, sulfate, BPA and mineral oil . . .</li>
            <li>it brings out the curls that took me 26 years to love and it leaves my hair soft and manageable with a nice scent.</li>
            <li>I think I just found my new favorite shampoo!</li>
            <li>It cleans well and seems gentle, but I found I needed more moisture than this shampoo gave me.</li>
            <li>It would most likely work better on fuller, thicker curls.</li>
            <li>i bought this wanting to try out my first sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>I quickly switched back to a all natural product line called \\&quot;Curls\\&quot; and my hair is once again beautiful.</li>
            <li>That smells mild and fresh.</li>
            <li>The lather has nice slip - enough to serve for de-tangling.</li>
            <li>Usually My jhair response good with a sulfate free shampoo</li>
            <li>and it made my hair soft and easy to comb along with the moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li>I am of Mexican descent and have wavy/curly hair and was looking for something to define my curls and get my wavy hair more curly.</li>
            <li>This in combination with the leave in conditioner from ORS gives me consistently soft, smooth curls.</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean and soft after using.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different shampoos and conditioners to wash my hair, including the ones most naturals swear by, and was never really impressed with the results; I thought I would never find a shampoo that I liked.</li>
            <li>My hair is very dry and more wavy than curly</li>
            <li>If I ran my hand lightly along my hair it left my hands feeling sticky and I had to wash my hands afterward.</li>
            <li>I have 4a/4b African-American hair without a very defined curl pattern.</li>
            <li>The first time it made it to me mostly intact, just with a little bit spilled into the box.</li>
            <li>and I only need to use a quarter-sized drop to clean my hair.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I really wanted some soft curls but it made it feel like it had product in it even if I didn&#x27;t add any styling creme/gel/mousse.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product in my search to finding a brand that really works on natural kinky curly hair...</li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>if you are thinking of going natural, go for it!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this shampoo does bring out the waves a little bit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s prefect, it has just enough lather to feel like your hair is clean but without leaving it dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a heavy perfume smell, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li>As far as volume it didn&#x27;t work for my curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I have naturally kinky hair.</li>
            <li>Works well on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>The consistency is like soft soap or a tad thinner.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel really soft.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>My hair is very tight basically kinks in back, more wavy in front.</li>
            <li>i have been natural for over a year and did my bc back in august &#x27;12.</li>
            <li>While I was working it into my hair, I noticed that it was creating A LOT of lather, way more than shampoos with sulfates in them, which made me assume that it was going to leave my hair dry and hard to manage.</li>
            <li>It still felt moisturized and not dry.</li>
            <li>It weighed my hair down too much, and made my roots look greasy by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>It really made my hair curlier and less frizzier.</li>
            <li>I have fairly thin and very temperamental curly hair (depending on the day it can be smooth ringlets or a frizzy mess).</li>
            <li>After Â½ a day, both my 3 year old&#x27;s typical dry frizzies and my typically normal hair looked greasy.</li>

            <li> To my surprise it also gives me natural curls, The down side is that the curls disappear after my hair dries.</li>
            <li> This is not for a truly natural girl with tight coils of curls.</li>
            <li> The second time, one bottle had opened and dumped about half its contents into the box.</li>
            <li> hair is half way down my back</li>
            <li> Also a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> However, you do need to wash your hair either every day or every other day so it doesn&#x27;t get greasy looking.  </li>
            <li> I give the product five stars, but I can only give it 4 on Amazon because Amazon does a pretty bad job packaging the shampoo.</li>
            <li> What I did not expect was to have hair so soft that a conditioner wasn&#x27;t needed for my thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the past I always added conditioner to dry hair and combed thru gingerly to detangle before going into the shower.</li>
            <li> And I did a pre-poo and use the shampoo and it left my hair a little hard</li>
            <li> So, it was a gloopy, buggy mess.</li>
            <li> so I was worried this shampoo would be too heavy</li>
            <li> I dried my hair out.  </li>
            <li> The box also had weird little air vents that allowed a giant bug to crawl in while it was sitting on my stoop.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t think ill ever look at regular shampoo again.</li>
            <li> The other shampoo with the sulfates always made my hair feel tough</li>
            <li> I believe it was due to all the artificial ingredients in this line of product.  </li>
            <li> and it was VERY hard to comb.</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian and my hair is thin, wavy and on the drier side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had previously tried the Wen products by Chaz Dean, however, I hated the way the product weighed down my hair and pulled out my waves.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> but with this one it hated it.</li>
            <li> I tried this product line for a week and hated it.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this shampoo a lot. It lathers great and smells good. It&#x27;s not a heavy perfume smell, which I appreciate. I have fine hair and this shampoo does bring out the waves a little bit.</li>
            <li> i bought this wanting to try out my first sulfate free shampoo. and it made my hair feel amazing. i don&#x27;t think ill ever look at regular shampoo again. btw im relaxed but im currently 4 months post and it made both textures feel like heaven. it was not drying at all! i love this product &lt;3</li>
            <li> After Â½ a day, both my 3 year old&#x27;s typical dry frizzies and my typically normal hair looked greasy. Yuck. Had to wash hair with something else to get this shampoo out?!? Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this shampoo. It weighed my hair down too much, and made my roots look greasy by the end of the day. As far as volume it didn&#x27;t work for my curly/wavy hair. It would most likely work better on fuller, thicker curls. I will be giving this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I have naturally kinky hair. This shampoo leaves my hair very soft and manageable. To my surprise it also gives me natural curls, The down side is that the curls disappear after my hair dries. I would definitely recommend this to someone who is looking for lots of lather and hair that you can comb through after a shampoo without using a conditioner.</li>
            <li> Works well on my natural hair. My hair feels clean and soft after using. Also a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I just use this product on my hair cause today is my hair day. And I did a pre-poo and use the shampoo and it left my hair a little hard I didn&#x27;t like it. Even with the pre-poo my hair wasn&#x27;t loving it. Usually My jhair response good with a sulfate free shampoo but with this one it hated it. I&#x27;m going to give it to my mother too see how is works for her. I will not repurchase this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I recommend this to anyone no, but I think you should make your own mind up. Because it didn&#x27;t work for me, it may work for you.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and more wavy than curly so I was worried this shampoo would be too heavy but I was wrong. It&#x27;s prefect, it has just enough lather to feel like your hair is clean but without leaving it dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> It cleans well and seems gentle, but I found I needed more moisture than this shampoo gave me. I am Caucasian and my hair is thin, wavy and on the drier side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it, but follow with  a moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product. I especially have curly hair that&#x27;s not the type of curly I want it to be that I had to us so many products and gel to keep it curly but after I bought this product it&#x27;s given my hair great results and leaves a great scent. Excellent results !</li>
            <li> I am of Mexican descent and have wavy/curly hair and was looking for something to define my curls and get my wavy hair more curly. This product along with the moisturizing conditioner worked well for my hair. It really made my hair curlier and less frizzier. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 starts because I did not like the way it felt in my hair. If I ran my hand lightly along my hair it left my hands feeling sticky and I had to wash my hands afterward. I really wanted some soft curls but it made it feel like it had product in it even if I didn&#x27;t add any styling creme/gel/mousse.</li>
            <li> Got a sample of this product and now I&#x27;m here shopping Amazon for a regular supply. I have been using no-poo process to avoid drying out my hair. My hair is very tight basically kinks in back, more wavy in front. The lather has nice slip - enough to serve for de-tangling. In the past I always added conditioner to dry hair and combed thru gingerly to detangle before going into the shower. With this shampoo, my hair had a smooth and not at all \\&quot;scraped\\&quot; feeling. Nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finished with a sample of the Curls Unleashed No Boundaries Leave-In Conditioner. That smells mild and fresh. The consistency is like soft soap or a tad thinner.  I got a lot of spring in my hair from these products. I&#x27;m buying this stuff for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair and this shampoo is amazing! It feels like a moisturizing conditioner. It makes my hair feel really soft.</li>
            <li> I loved this shampoo. I am 6 months post relaxer and it made my hair soft and easy to comb along with the moisturizing conditioner. The other shampoo with the sulfates always made my hair feel tough and it was VERY hard to comb. I won&#x27;t be going back to sulfate shampoos. I&#x27;m sticking with this! Love it!</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair and tried this product because I heard about it on youtube. I didnt put anything in my hair after I washed it because I wanted to see how it worked in my hair. I love it! It still felt moisturized and not dry. I was pleasantly surprised. I think I just found my new favorite shampoo!</li>
            <li> Absolutely best product on the market for curly hair. Love it.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product in my search to finding a brand that really works on natural kinky curly hair... What I love about the product is that you don&#x27;t have to use a lot! It creates a silky, smooth, moisturizing lather.  I must say that using this product was a wonderful experience for me,  lol.  After washing the shampoo out thoroughly, my hair felt as if it had already conditioned! I would definitely recommend this product to friends and family members.</li>
            <li> i didnt buy this from amazon but i had to come on here and give a review about the product itself. i got mine from sallys beauty supply and i was just looking to try out something different for my hair. this stuff works great. it brings out the curls that took me 26 years to love and it leaves my hair soft and manageable with a nice scent. i would recommend to others who are looking for something different. ^_^v&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. i have been natural for over a year and did my bc back in august &#x27;12. if you are thinking of going natural, go for it! you can do it! :)</li>

            <li> Love the way my hair feels after washing it with this product.</li>
            <li> I have 4a/4b African-American hair without a very defined curl pattern. I have tried many different shampoos and conditioners to wash my hair, including the ones most naturals swear by, and was never really impressed with the results; I thought I would never find a shampoo that I liked. Then I found a sample of this shampoo at Sally&#x27;s and decided to try it.  While I was working it into my hair, I noticed that it was creating A LOT of lather, way more than shampoos with sulfates in them, which made me assume that it was going to leave my hair dry and hard to manage. I was amazed, however, when I washed it all out and looked at my hair in the mirror. The only time I had ever seen my curl pattern so defined was after a henna treatment.  Not believing that the shampoo had worked so well, I kept using the sample packets and kept getting the same results. This product is awesome, and it will continue to be the only shampoo that I use.</li>
            <li> I had previously tried the Wen products by Chaz Dean, however, I hated the way the product weighed down my hair and pulled out my waves. For that price, it wasn&#x27;t worth having a nice shine for droopy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I went to Sally Beauty Supply and bought this shampoo because I wanted something that will enhance my waves without stripping my color (reds) that is free of paraben, sulfate, BPA and mineral oil . . . but still lathers. What I did not expect was to have hair so soft that a conditioner wasn&#x27;t needed for my thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is half way down my back and I only need to use a quarter-sized drop to clean my hair. I switch to another shampoo for two days a month, but I never feel like I have a build-up that requires this.</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells but not quite the shampoo for my frizzy curly hair.</li>
            <li> I seriously love this shampoo. I have fairly thin and very temperamental curly hair (depending on the day it can be smooth ringlets or a frizzy mess). This in combination with the leave in conditioner from ORS gives me consistently soft, smooth curls. It&#x27;s awesome. I give the product five stars, but I can only give it 4 on Amazon because Amazon does a pretty bad job packaging the shampoo. The first time it made it to me mostly intact, just with a little bit spilled into the box. The second time, one bottle had opened and dumped about half its contents into the box. The box also had weird little air vents that allowed a giant bug to crawl in while it was sitting on my stoop. So, it was a gloopy, buggy mess. If you can find this in a store, buy it there! Otherwise, order it here and cross your fingers. I will still buy it, despite the (total lack of appropriate) packaging, so that should tell you how good it is!</li>
            <li> It lathers well and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel as oily as Suave low sulfate shampoo.  However, you do need to wash your hair either every day or every other day so it doesn&#x27;t get greasy looking.  Uncertain wether I will spend the money on this product again as I feel it is a bit overpriced.</li>
