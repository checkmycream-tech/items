            <li>Amazing...</li>
            <li>I own three and gave two as gifts to my daughter-in-law and her mom who did not like getting waxings.</li>
            <li>The real ones that my mom has work great!  </li>
            <li>It does not work well, comes apart, I cannot use effectively.</li>
            <li>And these seem as good as the ones I paid triple the price for originally!</li>
            <li>I am super happy with this product and will keep on using it for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li>Very useful and great, just love it</li>
            <li>Great product and shipment was fast all the way from China!</li>
            <li>It looks very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>service and warranty are excellent but the product is of low quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use it all the time, so am glad that I could get a replacement.</li>
            <li>She can use it herself and is pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Shipping was ok.</li>
            <li>Works okay.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to get  the area I want most.</li>
            <li>has more power and delivers on its promise....</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I dropped mine too many times.</li>
            <li>It works better for me by feeling the hair folicles with my finger and then Tweeze-ing over them.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>For those of us with troublesome, unwanted facial hair, this is so perfect.  </li>
            <li>I have had one of these for years and love it.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t wate your money, you are better off shaving.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>so many AAA will have to sacrifice their lives before making up the price.</li>
            <li>great product and highly endorse....</li>
            <li>They work very well and when they break or stop working, I&#x27;m delighted to have a replacement.</li>
            <li>I love this, bought one years ago, and was excited to find another .</li>
            <li>it works well, but rusts/corrodes out easily...</li>
            <li>It is easy to hold and use on the face</li>
            <li>so it wasnt so easy to turn on</li>
            <li>easy to use.</li>
            <li>The coarser chin hairs are taken out easily with no pain at all.  </li>
            <li>But she had one before and loved it and wanted a new one</li>
            <li>Best little tool ever...</li>
            <li>This is the greatest little gadget I&#x27;ve come across in years.  </li>
            <li>It is great for facial and neck areas.  </li>
            <li>Works great for the hair you don&#x27;t want on facial area but can&#x27;t see.  </li>
            <li>Works great on coarse hair as well.</li>
            <li>They make great gifts -- I&#x27;ve given several of them.</li>
            <li>seem to use AAA batteries fairly fast and it would be nice to have AC power, but this is a heck of a lot cheaper</li>
            <li>Very useful tool for fastening bracelets with lobster claw clasps.</li>
            <li>and it works better than the first one i had.....</li>
            <li>I will never buy another without being able to look it over first.</li>
            <li>Worth having one!</li>
            <li>I already own this &amp; love it &amp; bought this extra one to carry in my purse.</li>
            <li>1. clean your face before using it and do it with soap and warm-hot water</li>
            <li>When you finish clean your face with soap and water.</li>
            <li>This becomes hot so fast which surprises me because I used to own one of these before and that never happened.</li>
            <li>I have used everything from hair removing creams to wax, and this is by far the most effective and gentle method for my skin.</li>
            <li>In addition, when I turn it on, I get a strong hot electrical smell.</li>
            <li>I would not buy from this seller, however, if you can find the real ones (not a cheap knock off one) they are great!</li>
            <li>Quick.</li>
            <li>Does the job quickly, does not hurt.</li>
            <li>However, this should not take more than 3 or 4 minutes because the main job is done.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to get very many hairs and certainly not coarse ones.  </li>
            <li>It arrived very fast!</li>
            <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful as my first one that lasted 6 years, it still serves the purpose just fine.</li>
            <li>Fast, and easy.</li>
            <li>When at first you want to find, always start your search on Amazon then if you don&#x27;t find it go elsewhere!</li>
            <li>and I only received one in the mail more than a month ago!</li>
            <li>Great for the little mustache</li>
            <li>They are definitely a cheap version of the real thing.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a trick to keeping the light on while using these, but, having said that, I really like using these.  </li>
            <li>I put in fresh batteries.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think many gave the device a chance or expected more than it is supposed to deliver.  </li>
            <li>Besides the fact this device is a real time saver; you don&#x27;t spend all your time plucking out individual hairs one at a time, it works well and is the next best thing to permanent hair removal.</li>
            <li>great product.. kind of scary to use at first</li>
            <li>You just have to learn how to position the Tweeze at the right angles of the area where the hair grows and they will all come out,</li>
            <li>This gives a smooth face and gets rid of strong wiry white face hairs</li>
            <li>but it only seems to pick up very fine hairs and it misses a lot of those.  </li>
            <li>This little gadget works perfectly for my facial hair.</li>
            <li>I have used this product to remove facial hair for several years and found it to be very effective.</li>
            <li>Also it only removes one hair at a time so make sure u don&#x27;t commit to a large area, it will take hours!</li>
            <li>(I think since they were first on the market) and don&#x27;t know what I ever did without them</li>
            <li>It broke on first usage.</li>
            <li>This is the second model of one I used for many years.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not even funny and</li>
            <li>My first one lasted years.</li>
            <li>I just finished using Tweez and my face and neck feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t work like my first one.</li>
            <li>In addition, please remember to clean the machine after you use it (remove hair, clean the detachable plastic cover with water and soap, and clean the metal area with a wet paper towel).</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>First of all, it is not a permanent hair removal system.</li>
            <li>I had one of these previous, and it was wonderful, needed to replace it, due to having it for about 3 years.</li>
            <li>have not much to say only that it was a great experience</li>
            <li>For all those fine hairs that always get missed that you can barely see, this will take care of it.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li>The product couldn&#x27;t remove the very light facial hair near the side bud.</li>
            <li>This thing has a very week grasp.</li>
            <li>I had used my tweeze so much imwore it out...</li>
            <li>It worked really well.</li>
            <li>very well.</li>
            <li>Very reliable item.  </li>
            <li>Gets a lot of hair, and saves so much time.  </li>
            <li>really recommend this item. . .</li>
            <li>It was more than I expected.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t grab the hair very well</li>
            <li>brow problem and has been a real solution for me.</li>
            <li>These on the other hand don&#x27;t pull out most of the hair and it also has made me bleed by pinching my skin.</li>
            <li>Also, don&#x27;t fret if the little clear plastic cap breaks (only one of my three because I dropped it several times), because the unit works perfectly well without it.</li>
            <li>The first one didn&#x27;t work properly but a new one was shipped quickly after seller was notified of the problem.</li>
            <li>I am ordering a second Tweeze not because I need aonther, my first one is going strong after over ten years of use</li>
            <li>bought one for my friend who has facial hair issues,  only problem is she has to wait until the hair gets longer,  but other than that for the cost works great</li>
            <li>So now I have a new one thanks to you.  </li>
            <li>It works well for upper lip, side burns and eyebrows also, just make sure not to do too close to ur eyebrow hair (which u don&#x27;t want to remove) &amp; it helps to go opposite direction as to which the hair is growing</li>
            <li>These are some tricks to avoid problems, and they come from more than ten years of experience removing facial hair:</li>
            <li>Even my very first one I still use daily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line is this is a good product, but the packaging sucks!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>had high hopes for this</li>
            <li>Recommend product highly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a repeat customer...have always been satisfied with the way this neat little instrument performs.  </li>
            <li>It did come with a new battery</li>
            <li>I will find a new one here in the states.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>I threw it away when I received my new epilator.  </li>
            <li>The shell did not come together at the top, the clear guard was cracked and did not sit down in its slots completely.</li>
            <li>It was purchased to replace an older one for my 83 year old mother.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic to remove hair in your upper lip, chin, upper neck, and corners of you</li>
            <li>(Mmm...I guess I was too young to need it before then!).</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t have made a 2nd purchase if the first purchase had not been satisfactory</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t use Tweeze like a razor; you use it in small circular motion barely touching the skin.</li>
            <li>After that it takes five mins or less to be hair free.</li>
            <li>Third, yes, it does hurt a bit at first, just like tweeting but a little more because you are targeting a larger area.  </li>
            <li>The more you use Tweeze the less you will notice the discomfort, especially because it works so well.  </li>
            <li>item was completely unusable.</li>
            <li>I bought two of these for gifts and both came to me directly from China.</li>
            <li>my old one still works,,,,,went to amazon to see if they were still listed and voila....</li>
            <li>far cry away in price from a &#x27;no no&#x27;.....and it lasts for years...</li>
            <li>I forgot how sensitive the skin is under my nose where the epilator couldn&#x27;t reach.  </li>
            <li>sensitive to sun, acne-prone, and I may also have irritations and allergies.</li>
            <li>In the upper lip I normally remove the plastic cover because I feel that it works better this way (at least in this area).</li>
            <li>This little machine does the same thing, but quickly without much effort.</li>
            <li>I wrote this review because I read many negative ones and I feel that some customers do not use Emjoi properly.</li>
            <li>root and all just like with a regular tweezers only a whole bunch at a time instead of just one at a time.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this to replace an old tweezie that I love but this arrived broken</li>
            <li>It hurts a little but is so worth it.</li>
            <li>Works great, doesn&#x27;t hurt that bad.</li>
            <li>At least it was cheap</li>
            <li>I am 60 years old and have dealt with all types of facial hair and hair removal.</li>
            <li>I order multi, afraid I won&#x27;t find after awhile, Work really good for removing unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li>Hurts the first few time, then you don&#x27;t even notice it.</li>
            <li>Once the area is hair-free, then you barely even feel anything when you use it daily and it only has one or two hairs to pull in an area.</li>
            <li>They do not last long as far as staying together.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> They work very well and when they break or stop working, I&#x27;m delighted to have a replacement.</li>
            <li> I love this, bought one years ago, and was excited to find another .</li>
            <li> it works well, but rusts/corrodes out easily...</li>
            <li> It is easy to hold and use on the face</li>
            <li> so it wasnt so easy to turn on</li>
            <li> easy to use.</li>
            <li> The coarser chin hairs are taken out easily with no pain at all.  </li>
            <li> But she had one before and loved it and wanted a new one</li>
            <li> Best little tool ever...</li>
            <li> This is the greatest little gadget I&#x27;ve come across in years.  </li>
            <li> It is great for facial and neck areas.  </li>
            <li> Works great for the hair you don&#x27;t want on facial area but can&#x27;t see.  </li>
            <li> Works great on coarse hair as well.</li>
            <li> They make great gifts -- I&#x27;ve given several of them.</li>
            <li> seem to use AAA batteries fairly fast and it would be nice to have AC power, but this is a heck of a lot cheaper</li>
            <li> Very useful tool for fastening bracelets with lobster claw clasps.</li>
            <li> and it works better than the first one i had.....</li>
            <li> I will never buy another without being able to look it over first.</li>
            <li> Worth having one!</li>
            <li> I already own this &amp; love it &amp; bought this extra one to carry in my purse.</li>
            <li> 1. clean your face before using it and do it with soap and warm-hot water</li>
            <li> When you finish clean your face with soap and water.</li>
            <li> This becomes hot so fast which surprises me because I used to own one of these before and that never happened.</li>
            <li> I have used everything from hair removing creams to wax, and this is by far the most effective and gentle method for my skin.</li>
            <li> In addition, when I turn it on, I get a strong hot electrical smell.</li>
            <li> I would not buy from this seller, however, if you can find the real ones (not a cheap knock off one) they are great!</li>
            <li> Quick.</li>
            <li> Does the job quickly, does not hurt.</li>
            <li> However, this should not take more than 3 or 4 minutes because the main job is done.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to get very many hairs and certainly not coarse ones.  </li>
            <li> It arrived very fast!</li>
            <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful as my first one that lasted 6 years, it still serves the purpose just fine.</li>
            <li> Fast, and easy.</li>
            <li> When at first you want to find, always start your search on Amazon then if you don&#x27;t find it go elsewhere!</li>
            <li> and I only received one in the mail more than a month ago!</li>
            <li> Great for the little mustache</li>
            <li> They are definitely a cheap version of the real thing.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a trick to keeping the light on while using these, but, having said that, I really like using these.  </li>
            <li> I put in fresh batteries.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think many gave the device a chance or expected more than it is supposed to deliver.  </li>
            <li> Besides the fact this device is a real time saver; you don&#x27;t spend all your time plucking out individual hairs one at a time, it works well and is the next best thing to permanent hair removal.</li>
            <li> great product.. kind of scary to use at first</li>
            <li> You just have to learn how to position the Tweeze at the right angles of the area where the hair grows and they will all come out,</li>
            <li> This gives a smooth face and gets rid of strong wiry white face hairs</li>
            <li> but it only seems to pick up very fine hairs and it misses a lot of those.  </li>
            <li> This little gadget works perfectly for my facial hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this product to remove facial hair for several years and found it to be very effective.</li>
            <li> Also it only removes one hair at a time so make sure u don&#x27;t commit to a large area, it will take hours!</li>
            <li> (I think since they were first on the market) and don&#x27;t know what I ever did without them</li>
            <li> It broke on first usage.</li>
            <li> This is the second model of one I used for many years.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not even funny and</li>
            <li> My first one lasted years.</li>
            <li> I just finished using Tweez and my face and neck feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t work like my first one.</li>
            <li> In addition, please remember to clean the machine after you use it (remove hair, clean the detachable plastic cover with water and soap, and clean the metal area with a wet paper towel).</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> First of all, it is not a permanent hair removal system.</li>
            <li> I had one of these previous, and it was wonderful, needed to replace it, due to having it for about 3 years.</li>
            <li> have not much to say only that it was a great experience</li>
            <li> For all those fine hairs that always get missed that you can barely see, this will take care of it.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> The product couldn&#x27;t remove the very light facial hair near the side bud.</li>
            <li> This thing has a very week grasp.</li>
            <li> I had used my tweeze so much imwore it out...</li>
            <li> It worked really well.</li>
            <li> very well.</li>
            <li> Very reliable item.  </li>
            <li> Gets a lot of hair, and saves so much time.  </li>
            <li> really recommend this item. . .</li>
            <li> It was more than I expected.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t grab the hair very well</li>
            <li> brow problem and has been a real solution for me.</li>
            <li> These on the other hand don&#x27;t pull out most of the hair and it also has made me bleed by pinching my skin.</li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t fret if the little clear plastic cap breaks (only one of my three because I dropped it several times), because the unit works perfectly well without it.</li>
            <li> The first one didn&#x27;t work properly but a new one was shipped quickly after seller was notified of the problem.</li>
            <li> I am ordering a second Tweeze not because I need aonther, my first one is going strong after over ten years of use</li>
            <li> bought one for my friend who has facial hair issues,  only problem is she has to wait until the hair gets longer,  but other than that for the cost works great</li>
            <li> So now I have a new one thanks to you.  </li>
            <li> It works well for upper lip, side burns and eyebrows also, just make sure not to do too close to ur eyebrow hair (which u don&#x27;t want to remove) &amp; it helps to go opposite direction as to which the hair is growing</li>
            <li> These are some tricks to avoid problems, and they come from more than ten years of experience removing facial hair:</li>
            <li> Even my very first one I still use daily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line is this is a good product, but the packaging sucks!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> had high hopes for this</li>
            <li> Recommend product highly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a repeat customer...have always been satisfied with the way this neat little instrument performs.  </li>
            <li> It did come with a new battery</li>
            <li> I will find a new one here in the states.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> I threw it away when I received my new epilator.  </li>
            <li> The shell did not come together at the top, the clear guard was cracked and did not sit down in its slots completely.</li>
            <li> It was purchased to replace an older one for my 83 year old mother.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic to remove hair in your upper lip, chin, upper neck, and corners of you</li>
            <li> (Mmm...I guess I was too young to need it before then!).</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t have made a 2nd purchase if the first purchase had not been satisfactory</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t use Tweeze like a razor; you use it in small circular motion barely touching the skin.</li>
            <li> After that it takes five mins or less to be hair free.</li>
            <li> Third, yes, it does hurt a bit at first, just like tweeting but a little more because you are targeting a larger area.  </li>
            <li> The more you use Tweeze the less you will notice the discomfort, especially because it works so well.  </li>
            <li> item was completely unusable.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these for gifts and both came to me directly from China.</li>
            <li> my old one still works,,,,,went to amazon to see if they were still listed and voila....</li>
            <li> far cry away in price from a &#x27;no no&#x27;.....and it lasts for years...</li>
            <li> I forgot how sensitive the skin is under my nose where the epilator couldn&#x27;t reach.  </li>
            <li> sensitive to sun, acne-prone, and I may also have irritations and allergies.</li>
            <li> In the upper lip I normally remove the plastic cover because I feel that it works better this way (at least in this area).</li>
            <li> This little machine does the same thing, but quickly without much effort.</li>
            <li> I wrote this review because I read many negative ones and I feel that some customers do not use Emjoi properly.</li>
            <li> root and all just like with a regular tweezers only a whole bunch at a time instead of just one at a time.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace an old tweezie that I love but this arrived broken</li>
            <li> It hurts a little but is so worth it.</li>
            <li> Works great, doesn&#x27;t hurt that bad.</li>
            <li> At least it was cheap</li>
            <li> I am 60 years old and have dealt with all types of facial hair and hair removal.</li>
            <li> I order multi, afraid I won&#x27;t find after awhile, Work really good for removing unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> Hurts the first few time, then you don&#x27;t even notice it.</li>
            <li> Once the area is hair-free, then you barely even feel anything when you use it daily and it only has one or two hairs to pull in an area.</li>
            <li> They do not last long as far as staying together.</li>
            <li> They are poor quality and not like the original &amp;#34;Tweeze&amp;#34; Niether on of them worked.</li>
            <li> Eventually I found that after time my skin became less sensitive and now I don&#x27;t feel it at all except for my upper lip.</li>
            <li> it was worst one ever bought, only needed top protective cover that breaks, why don&#x27;t they make those available?</li>
            <li> This item works very well for removing facial hair when some of us have hard time seeing them.  </li>
            <li> Dry your skin and move the Emjoi in circles, you should feel a bit of pain because it is actually working.</li>
            <li> For some reason she had always liked having her hair ripped out painfully</li>
            <li> I ordered this one to replace my old one which wore-out after a few years of use.</li>
            <li> When I turned it on was a strange burning smell &amp; It didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Works good on hair after it has grown out a bit, I hate to wait that long, but it does seem to delay return of unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my face and slowly but surely the hair actually stops growing in as thick and dark.</li>
            <li> Just start with a small area at first, keeping skin stretched tightly.</li>
            <li> It is different than the other one was.</li>
            <li> Without having to don glasses and a magnifying mirror and searching with tweezers in hand, you need only run this device over any little hair you can feel and it instantly is gone.  </li>
            <li> I would not use Emjoi for other areas in my body, only for my face.</li>
            <li> Not real fast.</li>
            <li> It is not worth the money to ship it back, but I shall not be using it.</li>
            <li> The machine needs to be in full speed, otherwise, at least in my case, it creates small pink spots.</li>
            <li> I broke down and bought what I thought was the same one.  </li>
            <li> I like it so far....as long as you&#x27;re patient and thoroughly go over the area you&#x27;re trying to clear slowly</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t help take out every single hair though and hence the stars!</li>
            <li> This one I ordered, I was excited to replace my old one, BUT was SO disappointed.</li>
            <li> but it was a little different.  </li>
            <li> It worked when we put batteries in it, but I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last.</li>
            <li> It does what is expected of it.</li>
            <li> It started to function and then jammed</li>
            <li> Item had missing parts, sounded like a chainsaw and didn&#x27;t work properly.</li>
            <li> The new Emjoi Tweeze while gentler and smaller for that delicate area, does not grab hair no matter how hard I try.  </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed.</li>
            <li> does not work at all, just a waste of money, I waited way to long</li>
            <li> They not only sent a replacement, but refunded my money for the small amount of hassle it was.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like the other one I had .</li>
            <li> I am on my fourth one and I usually have to replace them about every 6 months.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t argue with other people&#x27;s experiences</li>
            <li> I am throwing it away because it is not worth returning.</li>
            <li> If you press Tweeze to hard against the skin the hair will less likely to be tweezed out.</li>
            <li> The blade slows down while in use.</li>
            <li> so I hoped this would cut down on that</li>
            <li> I have little scabs in the places I have tried to use these.</li>
            <li> Just tingles a little.</li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s clearly less expensive than other similar items.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> sometimes there are a couple of stubborm hairs that must be tweezed, but I use a few times a week and have justed purchased one for two aunt, my sister and my mother.</li>
            <li> i use it every few days but still need to tweeze.</li>
            <li> A waste if money.</li>
            <li> A spare for me and one for my daughter and a few for Christmas presents for friendws (close friends!)</li>
            <li> You should use it until you feel there is no more hair collected by the machine.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> It was also packaged in one of those gawd-awful hard plastic clamshell thingies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used these to pull hairs on my chin for at least seven years now</li>
            <li> face (I mean the area in your cheeks closer to your ears).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much less expensive too.</li>
            <li> The plastic was dull and fitted together poorly at the seams.</li>
            <li> The power button was so hard to push, it actually looked pulled apart, and did not work  :(  </li>
            <li> I have very delicate skin:</li>
            <li> I was not happy when I received my product.</li>
            <li> Eliminates all those annoying facial hairs without having to tweeze each one.  </li>
            <li> for the price you cant go wrong</li>
            <li> This has got to be hands down the worst grooming product I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> She says it works just as well there as it does on those nasty little chin</li>
            <li> it will take the hair out of the roots instead of cutting like a razor.</li>
            <li> Bad purchase.</li>
            <li> HURTS SO BAD</li>
            <li> Sorry I ordered it and was so disappointed it did not work!!!</li>
            <li> I will say that it&#x27;s painful but not to an extent that you can&#x27;t bear it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed and would like a refund.</li>
            <li> Worked terribly did not cut</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Perfect. Actually bought two. One for my Mother in law. She loves hers too. Works really great,</li>
            <li> Bought for a friend....it works well, but rusts/corrodes out easily...this is her second one.</li>
            <li> This is amazing. I have used these to pull hairs on my chin for at least seven years now (I think since they were first on the market) and don&#x27;t know what I ever did without them (Mmm...I guess I was too young to need it before then!). I own three and gave two as gifts to my daughter-in-law and her mom who did not like getting waxings. Even my very first one I still use daily. Be patient, though, because if it has lots of hair to pull initially, that can hurt. Just start with a small area at first, keeping skin stretched tightly. Once the area is hair-free, then you barely even feel anything when you use it daily and it only has one or two hairs to pull in an area. Also, don&#x27;t fret if the little clear plastic cap breaks (only one of my three because I dropped it several times), because the unit works perfectly well without it. I hope they never stop selling these, though they last so well, I may never need to buy another. They run on alkaline or rechargeable AAAs. Best little tool ever...</li>
            <li> The Emjoi works alright. It does what is expected of it. The blade slows down while in use.</li>
            <li> It broke on first usage.</li>
            <li> I just keep buying these tweezer systems. They work very well and when they break or stop working, I&#x27;m delighted to have a replacement.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace an old tweezie that I love but this arrived broken it simply does not turn on.  It is such an inexpensive item and such a pain to return.  It did come with a new battery so I kept the battery and ditched the \\&quot;new\\&quot; tweezie.</li>
            <li> My mom has these tweezers and I loved them. I tried to find them in the store, but haven&#x27;t seen them anywhere. I decided to order these and I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed. They are definitely a cheap version of the real thing. The real ones that my mom has work great!  These on the other hand don&#x27;t pull out most of the hair and it also has made me bleed by pinching my skin. I have little scabs in the places I have tried to use these. I would not buy from this seller, however, if you can find the real ones (not a cheap knock off one) they are great!</li>
            <li> It does not work well, comes apart, I cannot use effectively.</li>
            <li> Had one this is just a replacement. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I was not happy when I received my product. I was not informed that it was &amp;#34;refurbished&amp;#34;, but it had obviously been taken apart and not put back together properly. The shell did not come together at the top, the clear guard was cracked and did not sit down in its slots completely. In addition, when I turn it on, I get a strong hot electrical smell. It is not worth the money to ship it back, but I shall not be using it. I will find a new one here in the states.</li>
            <li> I have used this product to remove facial hair for several years and found it to be very effective.</li>
            <li> The product couldn&#x27;t remove the very light facial hair near the side bud. It only reddened the skin</li>
            <li> This thing has a very week grasp. I had to return it. I would NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> service and warranty are excellent but the product is of low quality.&lt;br /&gt;I have not much to say only that it was a great experience</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. They do not work not even on the peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> it does not work sent note to seller</li>
            <li> bought one for my friend who has facial hair issues,  only problem is she has to wait until the hair gets longer,  but other than that for the cost works great</li>
            <li> I had used my tweeze so much imwore it out...wanted a replacement and found it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I was so exited to get it and it works better than the first one i had.....</li>
            <li> Very useful and great, just love it</li>
            <li> This product does not work at all</li>
            <li> These are a great product! I have bought several of them as gifts as well! I have also sent several people to sight for purchase and price on Amazon is a third of what it is in local stores, and that is if you can even find them? Very pleased! I have been using the original pair I purchased in the store for at least 3 yrs now! And these seem as good as the ones I paid triple the price for originally! Went back and they didn&#x27;t have them anymore! When at first you want to find, always start your search on Amazon then if you don&#x27;t find it go elsewhere!</li>
            <li> I bought one in 2010. It worked really well. This one didn&#x27;t.  It wouldnt even turn on</li>
            <li> Have been using this product several years ago.  Replace about every 2 yrs.&lt;br /&gt;works very well.</li>
            <li> had one before and used it for years and then it finally broke so I ordered 2 this time and gave one to a good friend. they work great for me.</li>
            <li> Works well. My last automatic tweezers lasted me 6 years (same brand) so I decided to get the same one. It works well for upper lip, side burns and eyebrows also, just make sure not to do too close to ur eyebrow hair (which u don&#x27;t want to remove) &amp; it helps to go opposite direction as to which the hair is growing it will take the hair out of the roots instead of cutting like a razor.Also it only removes one hair at a time so make sure u don&#x27;t commit to a large area, it will take hours!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years.  It is great for facial and neck areas.  My daughter wanted a Tweezer so on Amazon I went.  Purchased several.  A spare for me and one for my daughter and a few for Christmas presents for friendws (close friends!)</li>
            <li> Had one before and it got knocked off the sink and broke.  I was just replacing it.  I use it all the time, so am glad that I could get a replacement.</li>
            <li> Had one before, loved it!  This one doesn&#x27;t even work!</li>
            <li> This does not work very good at all! I have another enjoy that is great but this style does nothing!!</li>
            <li> It did not have the batteries included as stated.  I put in fresh batteries.  It started to function and then jammed and I never got it to start up again.&lt;br /&gt;The item was completely unusable.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to get very many hairs and certainly not coarse ones.  I have hairs on my chin that I detest and tweezing separately can take awhile so I hoped this would cut down on that but it only seems to pick up very fine hairs and it misses a lot of those.  At least it was cheap so I could give it a try, but I&#x27;m sticking with my tweezers.</li>
            <li> Works as it says.  Takes one use to get used to.  After that it takes five mins or less to be hair free.</li>
            <li> Works good on hair after it has grown out a bit, I hate to wait that long, but it does seem to delay return of unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these for gifts and both came to me directly from China. They are poor quality and not like the original &amp;#34;Tweeze&amp;#34; Niether on of them worked. Bad purchase.</li>
            <li> It is a Christmas present, so daughter has not opened it yet. But she had one before and loved it and wanted a new one so I am sure she will be happy.</li>
            <li> It hurts a little but is so worth it. I recommend this product for facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;It last longer than waxing.</li>
            <li> Love the concept of these lighted tweezers!  There&#x27;s a trick to keeping the light on while using these, but, having said that, I really like using these.  Good product.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years.  it does a great job.  sometimes there are a couple of stubborm hairs that must be tweezed, but I use a few times a week and have justed purchased one for two aunt, my sister and my mother.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with product. It was purchased to replace an older one for my 83 year old mother. She can use it herself and is pleased with the results.  It is easy to hold and use on the face (she removes the guard to improve results). Works great for the hair you don&#x27;t want on facial area but can&#x27;t see.  The first one didn&#x27;t work properly but a new one was shipped quickly after seller was notified of the problem.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Works great, doesn&#x27;t hurt that bad. Way easier than regular tweezers. Don&#x27;t need glasses to use it.  Quick. Gets those hairs that you can&#x27;t see.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Inexpensive and works great. For all those fine hairs that always get missed that you can barely see, this will take care of it.&lt;br /&gt;  Works great on coarse hair as well. Works as well or better than those expensive products. Bought my sisters and Mom these as gifts because they thought mine was great. Delivery of item timely. No problem with shipment.</li>
            <li> I have one but needed another.  Great product and shipment was fast all the way from China!</li>
            <li> does not work at all, just a waste of money, I waited way to long and then it just does nothing.</li>
            <li> This item works very well for removing facial hair when some of us have hard time seeing them.  It does not get the short ones but it does pick up the strays and the ones that get out of control.  It make take several passes however.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Got one that didn&#x27;t work when it arrived. They not only sent a replacement, but refunded my money for the small amount of hassle it was.  This is the second model of one I used for many years.  Very reliable item.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> HURTS SO BAD DONT BUY THIS.&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for this but it doesn&#x27;t pull out any hair and it hurts it&#x27;s not even funny and the spot burns for about 15 20 minutes after u go over that area. Waist of my money.</li>
            <li> I had one of these previous, and it was wonderful, needed to replace it, due to having it for about 3 years. This one I ordered, I was excited to replace my old one, BUT was SO disappointed. The power button was so hard to push, it actually looked pulled apart, and did not work  :(  Sorry I ordered it and was so disappointed it did not work!!!</li>
            <li> great product.. kind of scary to use at first but it was great! i wish there was a lock option so it wasnt so easy to turn on</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a  unit that I had already.  Wouldn&#x27;t have made a 2nd purchase if the first purchase had not been satisfactory</li>
            <li> Almost painless.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty inexpensive when compared to parlor costs&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;A set of AAA batteries should have been provided though.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
            <li> It is different than the other one was. Looks the same but performs different. Shipping was ok. Not real fast. Package wasn&#x27;t in the best shape when it was delivered.</li>
            <li> Works okay.  My friend says it worked great so I ordered one.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to get  the area I want most.</li>
            <li> I like it so far....as long as you&#x27;re patient and thoroughly go over the area you&#x27;re trying to clear slowly it gets the job done for me. It arrived very fast!</li>
            <li> i bought this for my face and slowly but surely the hair actually stops growing in as thick and dark. this works. i use it every few days but still need to tweeze. for the price you cant go wrong</li>
            <li> have had one for about 10 years and thought I would never find one again.....my old one still works,,,,,went to amazon to see if they were still listed and voila....there they were...ordered two....has more power and delivers on its promise....far cry away in price from a &#x27;no no&#x27;.....and it lasts for years...great product and highly endorse....</li>
            <li> My best friend. I use this on my chin all the time. Love it. Fast, and easy. Hurts the first few time, then you don&#x27;t even notice it. Gets a lot of hair, and saves so much time.  My first one lasted years. This is a replacement. I dropped mine too many times.</li>
            <li> I have been using Emjoi Tweezer System for 10 years.  I just purchased my second one only because I dropped the plastic cover and broke off one of the side insert pieces. I can still use Tweeze without the cover, but thought I would have a second one on standby. I am 60 years old and have dealt with all types of facial hair and hair removal. Tweeze is the best! Let&#x27;s face a fact. . .removing facial hair by a tweezer, wax or anything that pulls the hair out by the root has some pain involved. The more you use Tweeze the less you will notice the discomfort, especially because it works so well.  A novice to the system must be patient and practice the technique. Follow the directions.  You don&#x27;t use Tweeze like a razor; you use it in small circular motion barely touching the skin. If you press Tweeze to hard against the skin the hair will less likely to be tweezed out. My expertise after ten years allows me to use Tweeze without a mirror!  It works better for me by feeling the hair folicles with my finger and then Tweeze-ing over them. I just finished using Tweez and my face and neck feels smooth and soft. I apply a face lotion after I Tweeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to share my years of experience with Tweeze.  It&#x27;s a great product; it takes some practice; it works!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.  Love it</li>
            <li> Does the job quickly, does not hurt. Just tingles a little. I would definately recommend this product. Best thing i&#x27;ve found for hair removal.</li>
            <li> Item had missing parts, sounded like a chainsaw and didn&#x27;t work properly.</li>
            <li> For those of us with troublesome, unwanted facial hair, this is so perfect.  Without having to don glasses and a magnifying mirror and searching with tweezers in hand, you need only run this device over any little hair you can feel and it instantly is gone.  I can&#x27;t remember how i got along without it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given one to a friend, who also uses it on her legs.  I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.  She says it works just as well there as it does on those nasty little chin hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this item. . . and it&#x27;s clearly less expensive than other similar items.</li>
            <li> I already own this &amp; love it &amp; bought this extra one to carry in my purse. As a blonde, eyes do not see so this takes the guess work out of worring of unwanted hairs ! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectations!  Great price.  My husband asked me to order him one to get the hairs that he misses when he shaves.</li>
            <li> I have had one of these for years and love it. I bought this one as I gift for my mom. I was embarrassed when it came out of the package. It looks very cheaply made. It actually looks like a knock-off, even though it came in the official Tweeze package. The plastic was dull and fitted together poorly at the seams. It worked when we put batteries in it, but I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last. I will never buy another without being able to look it over first.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like the other one I had . A waste if money.</li>
            <li> It was more than I expected. .love it!</li>
            <li> it was worst one ever bought, only needed top protective cover that breaks, why don&#x27;t they make those available?</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. This little gadget works perfectly for my facial hair. I love it and it takes a great deal of time off of the plucking I used to do. They do not last long as far as staying together. I am on my fourth one and I usually have to replace them about every 6 months. It&#x27;s a shame though because these are the only ones I have found that work the way they are supposed to.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t work like my first one. Doesn&#x27;t grab the hair very well</li>
            <li> the thing didn&#x27;t even work</li>
            <li> This is the greatest little gadget I&#x27;ve come across in years.  Eliminates all those annoying facial hairs without having to tweeze each one.  They make great gifts -- I&#x27;ve given several of them.</li>
            <li> I love this.  I have had one for about 4 years and it finally quit and I couldn&#x27;t find one...so I tried Amazon!  Amazing...you have EVERYTHING!  So now I have a new one thanks to you.  Great for the little mustache we women get!</li>
            <li> This has got to be hands down the worst grooming product I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Does not do what it is advertised as doing. Don&#x27;t wate your money, you are better off shaving.</li>
            <li> it didnt work then it broke</li>
            <li> I order multi, afraid I won&#x27;t find after awhile, Work really good for removing unwanted facial hair. Recommend product highly.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this item all the time.  It works great.  It took quite a while to arrive, but they did get here eventually.</li>
            <li> The Tweeze simply works. It does what it says. I ordered this one to replace my old one which wore-out after a few years of use. This product has solved my life-long &amp;#34;uno&amp;#34; brow problem and has been a real solution for me. Yes it does hurt to pull the hairs out, but so do tweezers. This little machine does the same thing, but quickly without much effort. I will always have one of these on hand.</li>
            <li> This becomes hot so fast which surprises me because I used to own one of these before and that never happened. The motor will burn my hand one of these days. I&#x27;m just going to throw it out.</li>
            <li> I had one and it died after several years use. I love this. A razor results in stubbles  This gives a smooth face and gets rid of strong wiry white face hairs</li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to but then it works so good.  i can&#x27;t quit &amp;#34;Tweeze&amp;#34;ing.  I have recommended it to all my plucking friends.</li>
            <li> I had one of these and used it for years but it was a little different.  I threw it away when I received my new epilator.  I forgot how sensitive the skin is under my nose where the epilator couldn&#x27;t reach.  I broke down and bought what I thought was the same one.  The new Emjoi Tweeze while gentler and smaller for that delicate area, does not grab hair no matter how hard I try.  I am throwing it away because it is not worth returning.</li>
            <li> I wrote this review because I read many negative ones and I feel that some customers do not use Emjoi properly. This product is fantastic to remove hair in your upper lip, chin, upper neck, and corners of you face (I mean the area in your cheeks closer to your ears). Yes, I have hair in all these areas, and this product removes the hair beautifully. I have used everything from hair removing creams to wax, and this is by far the most effective and gentle method for my skin. I would not use Emjoi for other areas in my body, only for my face. These are some tricks to avoid problems, and they come from more than ten years of experience removing facial hair: 1. clean your face before using it and do it with soap and warm-hot water so your pores are open (the best time is after a shower). 2. Dry your skin and move the Emjoi in circles, you should feel a bit of pain because it is actually working. In the upper lip I normally remove the plastic cover because I feel that it works better this way (at least in this area). You should use it until you feel there is no more hair collected by the machine. 3.When you finish, check in a magnifying mirror because the machine may have missed some hairs. However, this should not take more than 3 or 4 minutes because the main job is done. 5. When you finish clean your face with soap and water. Start with warm wanter and finish with cold water so you are closing your pores. 4. Then, apply a toner (Dickinson´s pore perfecting toner with witch hazel or Lancome Tonique Radiance are my personal favorites), your regular moisturizer and a sunscreen (SPF 30). I have very delicate skin: sensitive to sun, acne-prone, and I may also have irritations and allergies. If you use the product in this way you will avoid 99 per cent of possible spots or irritations. I would also recommend to exfoliate your skin before using emjoy so all your pores are cleaned and open and your facial hair is out. In addition, please remember to clean the machine after you use it (remove hair, clean the detachable plastic cover with water and soap, and clean the metal area with a wet paper towel). Another trick, change your batteries whenever the machine is going slower. The machine needs to be in full speed, otherwise, at least in my case, it creates small pink spots. I hope this review was helpful. I am super happy with this product and will keep on using it for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> This small tool is very helpful! It doesn&#x27;t help take out every single hair though and hence the stars! I will say that it&#x27;s painful but not to an extent that you can&#x27;t bear it! It makes my skin red for a while and that goes away on its own! Worth having one!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taking off the hair well... hurts a bit, but so does tweezing.  A good product for the money.  No opinion on the durability yet.</li>
            <li> They are gifts. I have had one for years. I hope they like them</li>
            <li> Works just as advertised.  I would have given it 5 stars, but it was supposed to include 2 AA batteries (even said so on the package!) and they weren&#x27;t there.  It was also packaged in one of those gawd-awful hard plastic clamshell thingies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is this is a good product, but the packaging sucks!</li>
            <li> My mother wanted this so I got it for her.  For some reason she had always liked having her hair ripped out painfully and this does a good job of doing just that.  She says that it does not hurt her, But I tried it on my arm - ouch - and a bunch of Sailor language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does seem to use AAA batteries fairly fast and it would be nice to have AC power, but this is a heck of a lot cheaper so many AAA will have to sacrifice their lives before making up the price.</li>
            <li> Very useful tool for fastening bracelets with lobster claw clasps.</li>
            <li> Worked terribly did not cut</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a repeat customer...have always been satisfied with the way this neat little instrument performs.  Does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> When I turned it on was a strange burning smell &amp; It didn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> great product. easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product has malfunctioned several times and did not come with the batteries. I&#x27;m very disappointed and would like a refund.</li>
            <li> I sent in $27.68 for 2 Tweeze&#x27;s and I only received one in the mail more than a month ago! So please send me my second Tweeze in the mail so I can give it as a Christmas present as I planed..Or I will have to make the copies from my computer &amp; bank and send them in to you and who else is nessesary..</li>
            <li> I am ordering a second Tweeze not because I need aonther, my first one is going strong after over ten years of use but because I wanted a spare for traveling.  I have been reading the criticisms and I can&#x27;t argue with other people&#x27;s experiences but I don&#x27;t think many gave the device a chance or expected more than it is supposed to deliver.  First of all, it is not a permanent hair removal system. It acts like a tweezers/razor that removes hair like a tweezers but in quantity like a razor. The hair will grow back after a week or two or longer depending upon the individual&#x27;s rate of hair growth. Second the hair will be plucked from the root if you do it properly. You just have to learn how to position the Tweeze at the right angles of the area where the hair grows and they will all come out, root and all just like with a regular tweezers only a whole bunch at a time instead of just one at a time.  I have gotten to the point where I don&#x27;t even have to hold the skin taught in each area of my chin but for some I do. Third, yes, it does hurt a bit at first, just like tweeting but a little more because you are targeting a larger area.  Eventually I found that after time my skin became less sensitive and now I don&#x27;t feel it at all except for my upper lip. The coarser chin hairs are taken out easily with no pain at all.  Besides the fact this device is a real time saver; you don&#x27;t spend all your time plucking out individual hairs one at a time, it works well and is the next best thing to permanent hair removal. It&#x27;s much less expensive too.</li>
            <li> Arrived timely.  Although it doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful as my first one that lasted 6 years, it still serves the purpose just fine.</li>
            <li> I love this, bought one years ago, and was excited to find another . Thank you</li>
