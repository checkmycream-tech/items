            <li> gives moisture to hair without leaving it too greasy. smells good, not too strong and it doesnt have that &amp;#34;hair product&#x27; smell</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and damaged, but after I use this, it looks and feels much better.</li>
            <li> Seems to make my hair dry. I have naturally curly hair that can be dry enough on it own. I have used other products before without the dry feeling. Wont purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks, and I haven&#x27;t noticed dramatic differences, but I use it to untangle and help my hair in the heat of summer. I personally like the smell, but my husband hates it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update as time goes on when I&#x27;ve used it for longer, but right now it&#x27;s a good mist, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s helping a whole bunch.</li>
            <li> This products is amazing! It really help my over processed hair</li>
            <li> Bought this for my adopted Chinese granddaughters, and it is working very well for their thick, fly-away hair.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner.  Very large bottles so I though it is a great value.</li>
            <li> Love it.  I have very thick, course, dry and colored hair and this stuff is great.  I find this product works best for me throughout the day just spritzing it here and there and brushing it through.  What a nice pick me up for your hair.  The bottle is probably small enough (don&#x27;t let that scare you a little goes a long way) to fit in lockers and work desk drawers.  It smells real good too.  Real fresh and not a heavy perfume smell.  I use oils in my hair after washing but if I put oil in my hair everyday I would be a greasy hot mess.  This is what I love about this.  It&#x27;s for those in-between times. I hope you like it if you try it.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> I have this product and the conditioner. My hair is so much more manageble in the morning! I plan to try the shampoo too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen the difference in my hair; it looks better and the product has a great scent to it! My hair feels smoother.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product! The smell is very light. It helps make my hair easier to comb wet. Love the packaging!</li>
            <li> I received with bottle open. Package soaked. I have a quater of a bottle for 19.00. Guess what no returns and no refunds. Just want a new bottle. Paid for nothing</li>
            <li> I discovered Shiseido Tsubaki line for myself recently, and I can&#x27;t help telling everybody how much I love it. I&#x27;m half Asian, so I have this rough coarse type of hair, which is really hard to brush and style. Having moved to Florida, I encountered one more problem  - frizziness because of high humidity. When I&#x27;m using Tsubaki (the White line) everything is fine, my hair is easy to pull my fingers through even in shower before I put my conditioner. I couldn&#x27;t wait to see if they had some to leave-in treatment, so when I discovered this hair mist I ordered it right away. I have to admit it didn&#x27;t disappoint me. It&#x27;s very light and smells fantastic. I don&#x27;t feel it very much on my hair, but I didn&#x27;t shampoo my hair for 2 days and it doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all as it used to be when I applied other leave-in treatments.</li>
            <li> It arrived with half bottle. The bottle did not close well. it spilts out.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get to try it!! Receive package soaked!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I spray on my hands and apply to damp hair then blow dry, the scent is very floral but gets lighter as your hair dries, and my hair is definitely softer, easier to manage, and just feels overall healthier. :)</li>
            <li> Helps keep my daughter&#x27;s hair soft, sleek, and smelling wonderful!</li>
            <li> I have tried the Shiseido aquair spray and was interested to try this Tsubaki one. I have been using tsubaki oil and is curious to learn how the spray will be like. It works great! And my hair had a nice moisturizing without any oily feel. A little goes a long way. Just 2-3 sprays and I am good to go. Excellent shipping service from the seller!</li>
