    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I received this product in return for an honest opinion about the product. I liked the way this cream felt around my eyes which is a very sensitive area for most. You don&#x27;&#x27;t want to be tugging and pulling the skin around your eyes.  The product went on nice and creamy and felt very nice on the eyes. I have only used twice so i haven&#x27;t really noticed any dark circle dissapearing. I loved the fact the cream is vegan also which is a way i am trying to go. The only negative i would have to say about this product is the smell. It isn&#x27;t very pleasant. I wold rather have no smell than one that kinda stinks a bit. I will continue using this product since i do love the way it feels and cover my nose when i do it.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is nice it has a thick consistency but it also absorbs into the skin quickly. It does not irritate my skin but the smell is a little unpleasant.  It doesn&#x27;t have any artificial fragrances which is more important than smell when looking for a product that can work well on many people&#x27;s skin. I only use once a day but the directions state it can be used several times a day. I&#x27;ve only been using for a couple days so I haven&#x27;t seen significant changes yet but I am happy with the product and will continue using it. I received this product at a discount for my honest review and opinion.  The opinions stated are my own.</li>

I love the tingly sensation it left around my eyes. It had a slight scent to it, which I actually liked a lot. This left my skin around my eyes so soft and supple, no greasy or oily. I would definitely recommend this. I will definitely be buying this product in the future! haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in dark circles yet but I haven&#x27;t used the product that long yet.</li>

It does not irritate at all which is my primary concern! I love that it has a natural scent which is light and slightly herblike. I like the smell. I hate perfumey scents so this was refreshing. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and I can say that it does seem to diminish the puffiness I&#x27;ve been having. I also notice some diminishing of dark circles and will continue to use it to keep the skin around my eyes healthy. Very impressed.</li>

            <li> I really like this cream. It is light, and I feel my eyes have brightened since using it. I also like the delicate scent it has. I do wish it didn&#x27;t pump out so much at once,but that&#x27;s the only downside of this, if you cal that a downside. I look forward to using this as I feel my eyes will only look better and better!</li>
            <li> I received this Natural eye cream by Aya Natural. It is a product made in Israel which is near and dear to my heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the cream because it works miracles on my tired eyes. I have deep and dark circles from working so much and having so much at home to do (mom of teens and military wife).  It has all but completely diminished the darkness. My under eye skin almost matches the rest of my complexion and tone. Not only that, but the puffiness fades away when I use this. It is great because it can be used multiple times per day but only HAS to be used once. The cream feels great and has a very light, refreshing scent. It is quickly absorbed by my skin and leaves it feeling super soft and hydrated not sticky or greasy or gross. It helps smooth out skin with wrinkles or scars. It helps you not only look younger, but feel younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a quality cream. It is the perfect gift for family and friends. It would be perfect for bridesmaids or slumber/wine girl parties. It is great to send to our military gals overseas.</li>
            <li> My dark circles under the eyes have been vanishing after a week of use! Makes me feel and look younger. Love that this product is natural as it doesn&#x27;t harm or irritate my skin like other brands! Also, no greasy feeling on my skin. Can&#x27;t wait to see the results of my under eye dark circles after a longer time of use!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Aya Eye Contour cream over the past week and I have to say I absolutely LOVE it!!! In one use my eyes seems brighter the puffiness was diminished and darkness under my eyes seemed lighter it even helped with those fine lines &amp; wrinkles. I can&#x27;t wait to see what the effects will be 3 weeks from now.....The Aya Eye cream is not greasy and leaves your skin feeling moisturized.  I use the cream three times a day and I have to say I&#x27;m hooked and enjoy what the product has to offer!!! The product is made with natural ingredients and Vegan for those who live the lifestyle. It has a pleasant herbal scent that I really like.  Aya has made a customer for life and when you use the product you will be too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this at a discount to give an honest and unbiased review.  I have been using the Aya Eye Contour Cream and absolutely love it it really does deliver a great result.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product for review purpose. This product is great to get rid of unwanted dark circles/ baggy eyes. The texture is very creamy and applies smoothly. You only need one pump of this product for both eyes, a little goes a long way. I use this both in the morning and at night and have noticed a great difference in the way my eyes look.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product for review purposes. My reviews are my honest opinion. I love this eye cream and I LOVE the smell. I love that this creme is vegan. The smell reminds me of when I go to a spa and get a massage, like the essential oils. The creme isn&#x27;t oily at all. The bottle is actually larger than I was expecting so I will be able to use it longer than I figured I would.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day for about a week now and am starting to see results.  The dark circles under my eyes are lightening.  As soon as you put this on, you can tell the product is doing something.  It&#x27;s a slightly tingly, pleasant sensation.  I can&#x27;t pinpoint the scent of the product but it&#x27;s a very refreshing, herb like scent, I&#x27;m thinking rosemary maybe. It absorbs easily into my skin and I like the fact that it is made of all natural ingredients.  I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a week now and i have started to notice the darkness around my eyes have started to lighten up . Not only do i use it under my eyes but also on my eyelids as well all around my eyes. It is nice, not greasy , no perfume smell but its herb scents is a tad bit strong.  I will continue to use this to help reduce the darkness around my eyes. Also a little bit goes a long way , so minimal is best .</li>
            <li> I decided to let my 18 yr old granddaughter try this Aya Eye Cream product.  She was so excited to try it because she has always had dark circles and puffy eyes.  I told her unfortunately, it&#x27;s hereditary. She has been using it just under a week and loves it.  She said it smells good, feels tingly when it goes on and is easy to rub in with no greasiness.  She has already noticed  under her eyes lighting some and a little less puffiness.  She can&#x27;t wait to see how good they look in a month.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the smell and how much comes out at once. You definitely don&#x27;t need that much product. A little goes a long way. I have noticed a difference under my eyes especially if I don&#x27;t get enough sleep this stuff definitely hides that.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye cream ever.  I had dark circles around my eyes and I have been using this cream for two weeks.  I must say that I am really impressed with the dark color around my eyes disappearing.  I would definitely recommend adding this item to my purse to take everywhere I go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product for review purposes. My reviews are my honest opinion and I&#x27;m not financially compensated for them.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the products works or not, I&#x27;m allergic to lavender which is in it, so I broke out in a rash.</li>
            <li> Been using it for about a week and have yet to notice any difference.  Will finish the bottle, give it some time, and see if any difference becomes noticeable.  Update: After a couple months of use, NO change. Disappointed!</li>
