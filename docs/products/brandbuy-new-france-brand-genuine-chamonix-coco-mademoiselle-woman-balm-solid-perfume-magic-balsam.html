            <li>I am very pleased with this product and vendor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I purchased this fragrance!  </li>
            <li>good looking cannot ask for more.  </li>
            <li>It is really a nice size to carry around.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find both scents delicious, with the Coco being my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li>wanted to see if this would smell as nice on me as my friends before spending big bucks and this size is perfect for this.  </li>
            <li>should have paid more attention to the reviews.  </li>
            <li>It smells close enough to Coco Mademoiselle to make me very happy</li>
            <li>Love the size!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like Coco Mademoiselle, but still a nice fragrance!</li>
            <li>The scent is strong.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a smooth light smell like the&lt;br /&gt;original scent.</li>
            <li>love the convenience of solid perfume - easy to travel with</li>
            <li>Scent is soft and smells very nice but by time I left my home to go out, the scent was nonexistent.</li>
            <li>the scent was ok but didn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
            <li>It also arrived before expected date which was a nice surprise.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>(and it&#x27;s definitely not a \\&quot;baby powder\\&quot; scent which is fantastic to me, because I can&#x27;t stand that type of scent in a woman&#x27;s fragrance).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s soft and feminine and, in my opinion, well worth purchasing.  </li>
            <li>and very convenient  </li>
            <li>and I love the size for my purse and especially when I go on a trip and don&#x27;t want to bring a big bottle of perfume.</li>
            <li>The main reason to buy perfume is the scent and this is high end upscale perfume from France and CC.</li>
            <li>However,this scent is yummy, and I find it pretty similar to Coco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The biggest bonus is how easy it is to travel with the little tin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly soft and perhaps somewhat floral, but it&#x27;s not a crisp, clean scent.</li>
            <li>Great little gifts, a little something extra.  </li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s packaged sort of like the Pacifica tins, but this is a little larger and much easier to work with as far as removing the lid, yet the lid stays secure, always.)</li>

            <li> Smells wonderful! Smells just like I expected it to!</li>
            <li> going to buy again, this time for myself</li>
            <li> smells great and I love the size for my purse and especially when I go on a trip and don&#x27;t want to bring a big bottle of perfume.</li>
            <li> The main reason to buy perfume is the scent and this is high end upscale perfume from France and CC. The little tin fits in any size handbag or clutch. Instant on-the-go awesomeness.</li>
            <li> Bought as Christmas gift. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great little gifts, a little something extra.  Great price good looking cannot ask for more.  Thank you</li>
            <li> love the convenience of solid perfume - easy to travel with</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I purchased this fragrance!  I have the Coco Mademoiselle perfume as well and I&#x27;ve compared/contrasted them.  To me, they&#x27;re a similar scent, but not identical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find both scents delicious, with the Coco being my absolute favorite.  However,this scent is yummy, and I find it pretty similar to Coco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Chamonix isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;canned\\&quot; or \\&quot;contrived\\&quot; fragrance.  At least not to me.  It&#x27;s fairly soft and perhaps somewhat floral, but it&#x27;s not a crisp, clean scent. Perfect for an evening out.  (and it&#x27;s definitely not a \\&quot;baby powder\\&quot; scent which is fantastic to me, because I can&#x27;t stand that type of scent in a woman&#x27;s fragrance).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s soft and feminine and, in my opinion, well worth purchasing.  (It&#x27;s packaged sort of like the Pacifica tins, but this is a little larger and much easier to work with as far as removing the lid, yet the lid stays secure, always.)</li>
            <li> A must have for CoCo Chanel wearers.  I also will add pheromone oil with this.  I use the unscented pheromone oil by PheromoneOil.com.  It&#x27;s also sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not real Coco Channel!  It was a fake!</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with it. First, I had a terrible time getting the tin opened, and it is a very small tin, at that.. the smell isn&#x27;t what I expected, either. Very weak smell. Will not buy again...</li>
            <li> The tin is beautiful.  It is really a nice size to carry around.  The scent is strong.  It doesn&#x27;t have a smooth light smell like the&lt;br /&gt;original scent.</li>
            <li> bbeautiful&lt;br /&gt;beautiful and very convenient  would recommend added bonus they shipped to Australia  very happy</li>
            <li> Reminds me of the little pins you would wear as a kid that opened and it had perfume balm in there. I also had perfume balm in a little compact too as a kid. This does work and definitely smells like Coco Chanel Mademoiselle.</li>
            <li> not really what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> should have paid more attention to the reviews.  the container was almost impossible to open.  especially for someone over 60. my husband finally got it opened. the scent was ok but didn&#x27;t last at all. i also found it rather greasy. would not buy again.</li>
            <li> It smells close enough to Coco Mademoiselle to make me very happy every time I put it on. The biggest bonus is how easy it is to travel with the little tin. Great price, came when they said it would, smells wonderful, made me a happy camper.</li>
