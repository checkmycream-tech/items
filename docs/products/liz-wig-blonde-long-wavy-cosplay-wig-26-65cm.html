            <li>The &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; is of great quality very soft but doesn&#x27;t fall out when you brush it.</li>
            <li>beautiful plantium blonde wig.</li>
            <li>super cute.</li>
            <li>not as light at it was in the photo but still super duper cute.</li>
            <li>The color is rich beautiful platinum blonde like the picture.</li>
            <li>I know that the light blondes can be that way</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great quality, but not blonde.</li>
            <li>The bangs weren&#x27;t even, and I was not expecting it to be so light.</li>

            <li>Fun!</li>
            <li>Yes the bangs are long but works out great</li>
            <li>but this one was very costumey for lack of a better term.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to see that it is much fuller in person then the picture they display.</li>
            <li>Not bad quality for the price.</li>
            <li>im in love with how soft the wig is!!!</li>
            <li>quick delivery with Prime&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t brush it if you can get away with it, as it&#x27;s prone to lose the tightness of the curl quickly if you do.</li>
            <li>I love it and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Very cute cut and long curls.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re confident in your ability to trim the bangs or enjoy bangs that long go for it!</li>
            <li>I love how soft and real the hair feels.</li>
            <li>Was a lovely platinum blonde and fits right.</li>
            <li>Its super cute, and very long.</li>
            <li>I am overall satisfied with the purchase as this is going to be used to a costume anyway</li>
            <li>Its exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>but it is pretty</li>
            <li>exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>Overall I am decently satisfied with this wig.</li>
            <li>This wig is beautiful heavy soft</li>
            <li>very natural looking, easy to brush, straightened with a flat iron smoothly as well.</li>
            <li>you can side part them and play with them to cover your wig cap and natural hair line better or cute them a little and wear then straight across the forehead.  </li>
            <li>Came in super early, But as soon as I got it, it was already shedding.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I have not attempted curling it, so I can&#x27;t say if it is really &amp;#34;heat friendly&amp;#34; as the title claims but I hope it is.</li>
            <li>It really surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li>very ell packaged.</li>
            <li>It can be a little itchy, but most wigs are.</li>
            <li>i wore this to a convention outside and it was windy the entire time, got home and the wig still looks fantastic very</li>
            <li>Its curlier in person and the bangs are super long</li>
            <li>Wig is soft and not faux shiny.</li>
            <li>Hair is soft but not as curly as in the picture.</li>
            <li>The color is a little more yellow than shown, but it&#x27;s a platinum blonde color.</li>
            <li>For being such an inexpensive wig, this was fabulous, comfortable, and not shiny and overly fake looking.</li>
            <li>Bangs went down to my chin, not exactly as show, had to cut them, still adorable.</li>
            <li>Definitely for costume but fun none the less.</li>
            <li>Thick and true to Color.</li>

            <li> Thick and true to Color.</li>
            <li> Not for everyday use looks fake Very white blonde but very soft and doesn&#x27;t tangle easily</li>
            <li> Shipped earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> and bangs are not to long.</li>
            <li> I cannot wait to wear it for my drag performance definitely would purchase from Liz Wig again</li>
            <li> Came sooner then expected and</li>
            <li> The curls have held up through multiple brushings, it&#x27;s not too shiny, and it doesn&#x27;t matt or get fluffy like cheaper wigs.</li>
            <li> The only downside is the bangs are VERY long they came past my cheekbones.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind of thin if you wanted to keep the bangs long instead of cutting them (as pictured).</li>
            <li> I have naturally very thick hair, so maybe the thickness of the wig is normal for the average person.</li>
            <li> Also, the bangs are not blunt, they they are thick side bangs and they look a bit too thick to be real, but that just might be the way mine was styled before arriving, and I could probably trim/try and restyle them to get them blunt.</li>
            <li> I like the wig, it is just not very full looking.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have to cut the bangs like with my other wigs!</li>
            <li> The bangs were slightly longer than I wanted but it made it easier to style it to my look</li>
            <li> And since I have dark hair, the wig is thin enough where it shows through on some spots so you would end up having to wear a hat to hide it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a solid wig for the price, and it&#x27;s not too thin.</li>
            <li> it is hard to work with</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean to offend you.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about this wig is that it comes in a bit too curly, and when you straighten it, it fries it.</li>
            <li> I am so sorry</li>
            <li> For the price you will not be sorry,</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> but this wig looked very artificial.</li>

            <li> Wig is soft and not faux shiny. Feels natural and is beautiful. The curls are pretty and the color is gorgeous. The only downside is the bangs are VERY long they came past my cheekbones. If you&#x27;re confident in your ability to trim the bangs or enjoy bangs that long go for it! If not,skip it. All things considered a beautiful wig and for the price it&#x27;s spectacular.</li>

            <li> 1. quick delivery with Prime&lt;br /&gt;2. as soon as taken out of the packaging, it SHEDS&lt;br /&gt;3. cute curls, perfect length, had to trim the bangs&lt;br /&gt;4. unless you have a hat on to cover the seams you can totally tell it&#x27;s a wig&lt;br /&gt;5. I am overall satisfied with the purchase as this is going to be used to a costume anyway</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat this wig. The color is rich beautiful platinum blonde like the picture. The &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; is of great quality very soft but doesn&#x27;t fall out when you brush it. Very cute cut and long curls. TOO PERFECT! Yes the bangs are long but works out great you can side part them and play with them to cover your wig cap and natural hair line better or cute them a little and wear then straight across the forehead.  Shipped earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Not for everyday use looks fake Very white blonde but very soft and doesn&#x27;t tangle easily</li>
            <li> super cute. not as light at it was in the photo but still super duper cute. works for several different outfits (example: my&lt;br /&gt;photo collage)</li>
            <li> beautiful plantium blonde wig. Doesnt shed, curls are amazing, holds well. and bangs are not to long. i wore this to a convention outside and it was windy the entire time, got home and the wig still looks fantastic very</li>
            <li> Great wig! Didn&#x27;t have to cut the bangs like with my other wigs! I recommend if you&#x27;re cosplaying Alice! ♥</li>

I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful wig and it was perfect for my Miss Piggy Costume. The curls and color are perfect, everyone loved the wig! I have not attempted curling it, so I can&#x27;t say if it is really &amp;#34;heat friendly&amp;#34; as the title claims but I hope it is.

            <li> This wig is amazing! I have blonde hair already so the seams do not show. Its super cute, and very long. I recommend not brushing out the curls unless you don&#x27;t want perfect curls.Its curlier in person and the bangs are super long so I just did a side bang. Its exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This wig is beautiful heavy soft I LOVE IT came earlier than said and curls are beautiful long bangs. I cannot wait to wear it for my drag performance definitely would purchase from Liz Wig again</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about this wig is that it comes in a bit too curly, and when you straighten it, it fries it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great quality, but not blonde. Its a white wig.</li>
            <li> it is hard to work with but it is pretty</li>
            <li> just as described. exactly like the picture. im in love with how soft the wig is!!! very natural looking, easy to brush, straightened with a flat iron smoothly as well. has a comfy and adjustable cap. the only thing i could see improvement on would be the front where the bangs are. it&#x27;s kind of thin if you wanted to keep the bangs long instead of cutting them (as pictured). thank you. will order again!</li>
            <li> Was a lovely platinum blonde and fits right. awesome product.</li>
            <li> Came in super early, But as soon as I got it, it was already shedding. Hair is soft but not as curly as in the picture. The bangs weren&#x27;t even, and I was not expecting it to be so light. Overall I am decently satisfied with this wig.</li>
            <li> The wig came on time. The quality is good and I really liked it! There is an elastic adjustment band inside, so that you can fit the wig to your head. I used it for a cabaret show I was in and it was perfect!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wig. I am a cancer survivor and tend to wear wigs to make me feel as beautiful as I did before chemo. Came sooner then expected and very ell packaged. I love how soft and real the hair feels. My husband loves it too because it gives me my confidence. I love that it is heat friendly although I haven&#x27;t had to touch it up because the curls hold up beautifully. I was pleased to see that it is much fuller in person then the picture they display. I love it and would highly recommend. For the price you will not be sorry,</li>
            <li> Great wig! I&#x27;ve worn it twice now, and the quality is wonderful for the price. The color is a little more yellow than shown, but it&#x27;s a platinum blonde color. The curls have held up through multiple brushings, it&#x27;s not too shiny, and it doesn&#x27;t matt or get fluffy like cheaper wigs.</li>
