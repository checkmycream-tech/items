            <li> Best hair product I ever had!</li>
            <li> Genuine product that is used in my salon. Now I can use it more consistently.</li>
            <li> Kerastase is the product to buy for hair.  This deep conditioner truly relaxes my hair and makes for great styling.  I use it once to twice a week.  I&#x27;m 52, have my hair color treated regularly and have a combination of fine to thick wavy hair.  My biggest problem is getting a dull, frizz lackluster look.  This product along with the other Architecte products transform my hair.  I get lots of compliments and my stylist is a big reason and the Kerastase products.</li>
            <li> My hair was over processed and breaking off so I bought the kerastase Resistiance Masque Force Architecte and it stopped my hair breakage problem.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my girlfriend and she loved it. It should be a little cheaper. Her hair became stronger, soft and it is smelling so good.</li>
            <li> I had the same impression!!! The fragance and texture are pretty different!&lt;br /&gt;I think it´s FAKE!!!! I have been using karestase for years!!</li>
            <li> I bought it for a friend of mine from Brazil, they all love it there, I have used myself, it is amazing!</li>
            <li> This product is very good, your hair shine and feels silky, this is the third time I buy it, i really recommend this brand and all their products, the package arrived on time and with all the things i ordered.</li>
            <li> BEST hair mask I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> gross i hated it... im a hair dresser that has worked with kerastase produts for a long time. this was not a kerastase producct</li>
            <li> The product works fine. The delivery was not on time and froze and the container broke in the mailbox when we were out of town. As a result we lost half of the product</li>
            <li> Based on previous reviews I thought this was the best product out there - after I got it I tried it and I have to say that it is not what I expected AT ALL - my hair looks better with cheaper products :P</li>
            <li> The Product was not sealed and it does not look or smell like the usual kerastase Masque, I compared with the one I previously purchased.  I just sent it back! it is a fake...&lt;br /&gt;I should have read the reviews</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so good product!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using kerastase for 15 years. these products are really something different.  I have the small version of this product. scent and textures are different and the results too.</li>
            <li> I love this masque, it is the best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t seem to be authentic. I am an usual Kerastase costumer and I could clearly see that this is a different product. I mean really everything. Color, smell, the real effect you expect in your hair, etc. It definitely doesn&#x27;t work like a kerastase product. I honestly would like to return it and get my money back.</li>
