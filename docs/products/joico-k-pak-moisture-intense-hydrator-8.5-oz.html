            <li>Not the best conditioner I have used, but very moisurizing</li>
            <li>I am surprised at how this hair \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot; got perfect reviews here.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I used to purchase from beauty salons but from Amazon, I get a better price.</li>
            <li>I just did not like the way it was making my hair feel, so I tried this after seeing it rated in a magazine as a Top 10 Beauty Pick.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>i love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>patience is required though because you might have to use more than once to see a difference.</li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>It has really great slip and made de-tangling much easier.</li>
            <li>can anyone recommend a better moisturizing/hydrating conditioner than this please?</li>
            <li>Infact i think they appear to have more</li>
            <li>absolutely love this product</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>Works amazing, love this product and came very fast!</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair healthy and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Smells good and very moisturizing</li>
            <li>Biolage worked beautifully with the reconstructor and my hair was always super soft after.</li>
            <li>together.&lt;br /&gt;I styled it with my blow dryer the next day and it looked beautiful.</li>
            <li>This conditioner has helped my hair without weighing it down so this is great for me!</li>
            <li>what it&#x27;s worth, my hair is very, very fine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly a product that rivals hydratherapie, and may actually be better!</li>
            <li>when I ran my fingers through my hair, it felt super silky and healthy.</li>
            <li>One treatment of this product made a huge noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li>I could feel the huge difference it had made on the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li>The problem is that I could never get my hair to just look great even after flat ironing and products.</li>
            <li>Really good deep moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Ok I really really like this conditioner</li>
            <li>I recalled reading somewhere about Joico deep penetrating reconstructor which had some good reviews.</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly with  no problems.</li>
            <li>If you are on a search for the best deep conditioner, I would recommend macadamia oil deep repair mask.</li>
            <li>Eventually, I used it on its own after simply washing my hair, with far better results.</li>
            <li>Well worth every penny.</li>
            <li>this produce left my hair extensions so soft and smells great.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Now it looks and feels so soft and easy to style.</li>
            <li>So far it has been working well on my hair (fine hair,</li>
            <li>I sometimes use it by itself as a conditioner, and sometimes I use it on top of my regular conditioner.  </li>
            <li>any event, when used without the reconstructor before hand this worked very well!</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the first hydrators that delivered all it promised plus some.</li>
            <li>However, I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see great improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li>This is a nice addition to keeping your hair hydrated , even if your hair has had processing with perm or other drying treatments.</li>
            <li>but this is the first time I have used the Intense Hydrator Treatment.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, so much hair.</li>
            <li>it really works.  </li>
            <li>If your hair is really damaged; this is the stuff to use.</li>
            <li>My hair is now much stronger and silky.  </li>
            <li>and my hair is silky smooth the next day after rinsing.</li>
            <li>my hair responded really well</li>
            <li>Joico K-Pakistan intense Hydrator Treatment restores the life and shine my hair.  </li>
            <li>I wondered how much time it would be before I would go bald at that rate.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend it and I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li>I tried putting this on my hair straight out of the tube at night before going to bed.</li>
            <li>This really helped.</li>
            <li>any woman with grey hair will enjoy this product</li>
            <li>The huge doses of blood thinners given causes hair to dry and fall out.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to swimmers</li>
            <li>It really helps hydrates my super dry</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, but not heavy</li>
            <li>have recently colored my hair which have made my hair more brittle and dry.</li>
            <li>In fact, it actually left it more brittle due to the high amount of protein.</li>
            <li>They also dont look weighed down like fine hair do after conditioning.</li>
            <li>I definitely saw a difference, even after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I was willing to try anything to save my already short hair.</li>
            <li>After only the first use I could already feel and see a difference in the softness and smoothness of my hair.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your hair silky and soft.</li>
            <li>I was in the habit of using biolage hydratherapie following the k-pak reconstructor already when I decided to try joico&#x27;s intense hydrator.</li>
            <li>Within one use I had soft hair that regained natural movement with the wind, you know your hair is fried when even with wind it kinda clumped</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a quality product that is comparable to what our professional stylists use.</li>
            <li>It really helped when I was recently hospitalized with a DVT in the lower leg.</li>
            <li>I feel this was the only item that was fresh, not old product.</li>
            <li>It left my hair very soft!</li>
            <li>So, backstory- I was a little dumb even though I&#x27;m an experienced at home hair colorist.</li>
            <li>it really hydrates your hair for grey hair ladies</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that it will make it into my regular rotation of products, but I will more than likely buy it again.</li>
            <li>I am hoping after continued use that my long hair will once again be smooth and shiny everyday.  </li>
            <li>It stays soft and managable for several days.</li>
            <li>When I washed it out, I had springy, silky, soft hair that I haven&#x27;t felt since my last time at the salon.</li>
            <li>My hair instantly felt soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I have thick hard and it worked better than other brands like Kerastase Masquintese, Sebastian Deep Strenghtening and many others.</li>
            <li>I live in Houston and with the humidity, my hair is normally a frizzy mess.  </li>

            <li> I live in Houston and with the humidity, my hair is normally a frizzy mess.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be trying other K-Pak products in the near future.</li>
            <li> I am not the main user of this in our house, it makes my hair flat and heavy.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd tube I&#x27;ve bought as it is amazing what is does to badly damaged hair.</li>
            <li> This product is the only thing that has helped my dry hair!</li>
            <li> I am a blonde with very dry medium thickness hair.</li>
            <li> The stylist claimed it would be a bright red, well I left with black hair with a red base.</li>
            <li> Combing through my hair felt like a long lost experience-</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for long time</li>
            <li> I have long asian hair that is always rough and wavy.</li>
            <li> I tried every other product all the way to the super-expensive &#x27;celebrity&#x27; products that claimed to be good for my kinda hair- each time i was disappointed.</li>
            <li> My color treated  hair was dry, brittle and breaking off.  </li>
            <li> Tames frizzy, dry hair well</li>
            <li> Firstly, I hardly lost any hair in the shower (like a couple of strands which is suppposed to be normal).</li>
            <li> I have very dry, very damaged hair that is in need of serious TLC and this conditioner</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad at all, it&#x27;s very light, though it is a bit strange.</li>
            <li> The only advice I give is that a little goes a long way.....</li>
            <li> Before this, it was breaking off and very dry.  </li>
            <li> We have hard water where I live and even with a soft water treatment unit my hair still gets dry and is not as soft as it used to be, and it is also difficult to comb out.  </li>
            <li> I have long dark hair that have thinned down a lot over the years and lost both thickness and density.</li>
            <li> If you have a lot of hair though, this stuff can get pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also defiantly going to try their other products as well after this experience.</li>
            <li> usually I do a lot of research before buying any such thing but for this one I didnt, at all!</li>
            <li> I received this item along with 3 other items.</li>
            <li> I have used this for almost 3 months now, but in pase two weeks not so much due to build up..</li>
            <li> I then wash my hair as usual and use the conditioner I use daily.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with damage, dry, brittle and thinning hair due to medication.</li>
            <li> The other products was difficult to flow into the hair to lather up, I feel the others were OLD products or a generic version.</li>
            <li> Initially I gave this product only 2 stars after having used it behind the k-pak reconstructor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what went wrong exactly, but I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my hair wasn&#x27;t when I used this joico treatment behind the recontructor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair feels and looked well moisturized with less frizz.</li>
            <li> My hair became so weak and brittle that each time i ran the brush through my hair, a big lump of hair came with it :</li>
            <li> When I blow dried my hair</li>
            <li> My hair type is curly thin dry hair.  </li>
            <li> no more tangles.</li>
            <li> It is also very hard to apply due to the thickness of the balm.</li>
            <li> The thick haired one in the house swears by this stuff though, and it is very expensive at the salon.</li>

            <li> Great product espcecially if you get your hair done every six weeks!</li>
            <li> This product got a lot of great reviews, so i decided to try it.  My color treated  hair was dry, brittle and breaking off.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product.  I sometimes use it by itself as a conditioner, and sometimes I use it on top of my regular conditioner.  Plus, it smells really good!!  It makes my hair super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This product is the only thing that has helped my dry hair!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 4 years. It really helps hydrates my super dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
            <li> Works amazing, love this product and came very fast!</li>
            <li> Perfect combination with the reconstructor &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Really good deep moisturizer.  Joico KPak is my go-to for hair!!!</li>
            <li> I use this product once a week on my home spa day.  This product makes my hair healthy and smooth.  I used to purchase from beauty salons but from Amazon, I get a better price. It makes my hair smell good too.</li>
            <li> Smells good and very moisturizing</li>
            <li> I definitely saw a difference, even after the first time I used it. It brought some life and shine back. The smell isn&#x27;t bad at all, it&#x27;s very light, though it is a bit strange. Coconut-y, I&#x27;d say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it&#x27;s worth, my hair is very, very fine but I have a metric crapton of it. Seriously, so much hair.</li>
            <li> I was a former Kerastase (Oleo Relax Masque) user, for years. I just did not like the way it was making my hair feel, so I tried this after seeing it rated in a magazine as a Top 10 Beauty Pick. It has been great. Very moisturizing, but not heavy; you can rinse it all out if you want, or leave some in if not.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for years. You can never go wrong with Joico products!! It leaves your hair silky and soft.</li>
            <li> i love this conditioner.  it really works.  patience is required though because you might have to use more than once to see a difference.</li>
            <li> This is an updated review. Initially I gave this product only 2 stars after having used it behind the k-pak reconstructor. Eventually, I used it on its own after simply washing my hair, with far better results. I was in the habit of using biolage hydratherapie following the k-pak reconstructor already when I decided to try joico&#x27;s intense hydrator. Biolage worked beautifully with the reconstructor and my hair was always super soft after. I&#x27;m not sure what went wrong exactly, but I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my hair wasn&#x27;t when I used this joico treatment behind the recontructor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any event, when used without the reconstructor before hand this worked very well! It&#x27;s certainly a product that rivals hydratherapie, and may actually be better! It left my hair very soft! If you have a lot of hair though, this stuff can get pretty expensive. I&#x27;m not sure that it will make it into my regular rotation of products, but I will more than likely buy it again.</li>
            <li> The best hydrating treatment for my hair type. I have thick hard and it worked better than other brands like Kerastase Masquintese, Sebastian Deep Strenghtening and many others.</li>
            <li> This is just amazing. My hair feels like it feels like someone elses. It feels like I just stepped out of a salon. It stays soft and managable for several days. I have long asian hair that is always rough and wavy. The problem is that I could never get my hair to just look great even after flat ironing and products. Now it looks and feels so soft and easy to style.</li>
            <li> Saved my hair. So, backstory- I was a little dumb even though I&#x27;m an experienced at home hair colorist. I went to a salon and got my hair dyed since it was part of my coupon. The stylist claimed it would be a bright red, well I left with black hair with a red base. I&#x27;m naturally blonde and this looked terrible. So I used a color remover the next day. My mistake was using a &amp;#34;non damaging&amp;#34; bleach for an ombre look. I immediately fried my hair, badly. It was frizzy, dry and looked horrible. I tried every conditioner in my arsenal to no avail. So I started researching conditioners and came across this gem. I was willing to try anything to save my already short hair. Within one use I had soft hair that regained natural movement with the wind, you know your hair is fried when even with wind it kinda clumped together.&lt;br /&gt;I styled it with my blow dryer the next day and it looked beautiful. I am definitely keeping this for my routine.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying this product. So far it has been working well on my hair (fine hair, prone to dryness at the ends). I would order it again. The product arrived quickly with  no problems.</li>
            <li> I love this product... I think I may have finally found a conditioner that works well with my hair. It has really great slip and made de-tangling much easier. My hair feels and looked well moisturized with less frizz. I will definitely be trying other K-Pak products in the near future. If you are unsure about trying this product don&#x27;t be, your hair will thank you!  (works well on African American hair)</li>
            <li> If your hair is really damaged; this is the stuff to use. It saved my hair. Will always use it. Well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at the recommendation of my hairdresser.  This is the 2nd tube I&#x27;ve bought as it is amazing what is does to badly damaged hair. My hair is now much stronger and silky.  Before this, it was breaking off and very dry.  Definitely recommend this product.  Item was shipped from overseas. The package arrived open, which I assume was because of customs.</li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner that detangles my hair. I leave it on sometimes overnight and my hair is silky smooth the next day after rinsing.</li>
            <li> I am surprised at how this hair \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot; got perfect reviews here. it made my hair so dry, I was shocked of how frizzy/curly and volume-less it became after I used this!! can anyone recommend a better moisturizing/hydrating conditioner than this please? thank you.</li>
            <li> Definitely makes my hair feel healthier! I have very dry, very damaged hair that is in need of serious TLC and this conditioner does the trick! The only advice I give is that a little goes a long way.....don&#x27;t put too much in your hair (like over a dime size) or your hair will be extremely limp.</li>
            <li> I swim about 3 times a week with a swim cap but my hair was still getting damaged. One treatment of this product made a huge noticeable improvement. After using for a week, all hair damage is gone. Highly recommend this to swimmers</li>
            <li> I am a blonde with very dry medium thickness hair. This conditioner did not leave my hair moist at all. In fact, it actually left it more brittle due to the high amount of protein. It is also very hard to apply due to the thickness of the balm. If you are on a search for the best deep conditioner, I would recommend macadamia oil deep repair mask.</li>
            <li> Ok I really really like this conditioner any woman with grey hair will enjoy this product it really hydrates your hair for grey hair ladies you know we need lots of moisture my hair responded really well I will continue to buy this product it&#x27;s great for hair that is damage will restore your hair</li>
            <li> I have my hair dyed and highlighted every night weeks.  My hair type is curly thin dry hair.  Joico K-Pakistan intense Hydrator Treatment restores the life and shine my hair.  I use the K pack once a month to condition my hair.</li>
            <li> I am not the main user of this in our house, it makes my hair flat and heavy. The thick haired one in the house swears by this stuff though, and it is very expensive at the salon. Great price.</li>
            <li> This Joico product is simply unbeatable. It&#x27;s one of the first hydrators that delivered all it promised plus some. I left in in my hair for 30 minutes under a plastic cap. When I washed it out, I had springy, silky, soft hair that I haven&#x27;t felt since my last time at the salon. It&#x27;s a quality product that is comparable to what our professional stylists use. I will repurchase again and again. I&#x27;m also defiantly going to try their other products as well after this experience.</li>
            <li> Not the best conditioner I have used, but very moisurizing</li>
            <li> Best conditioner on the market for dry/overprocessed hair. Leave it on for 5 minutes and its like a makeover for your folicles.</li>
            <li> I have long dark hair that have thinned down a lot over the years and lost both thickness and density. Each time I shampooed a big ball of hair would form at the drain which broke my heart. I wondered how much time it would be before I would go bald at that rate. I tried every other product all the way to the super-expensive &#x27;celebrity&#x27; products that claimed to be good for my kinda hair- each time i was disappointed. My hair became so weak and brittle that each time i ran the brush through my hair, a big lump of hair came with it :(&lt;br /&gt;And then I found this one- usually I do a lot of research before buying any such thing but for this one I didnt, at all! I saw it at TJ Maxx- had been seeing it for a year almost but never bothered to try then. I recalled reading somewhere about Joico deep penetrating reconstructor which had some good reviews. So I thought what the hell I have used everything on my hair, why not this.&lt;br /&gt;I have recently colored my hair which have made my hair more brittle and dry. I used this product after shampooing my hair left it on for like 5 mins and rinsed. My hair instantly felt soft and silky. When I blow dried my hair I could feel the huge difference it had made on the texture of my hair. Firstly, I hardly lost any hair in the shower (like a couple of strands which is suppposed to be normal). Combing through my hair felt like a long lost experience- and again, no hair loss. when I ran my fingers through my hair, it felt super silky and healthy. They have a healthy shine, they look happy and bouncy. They also dont look weighed down like fine hair do after conditioning. Infact i think they appear to have more volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this product and I think my hair have finally found their soulmate!</li>
            <li> Very good! Recommend.</li>
            <li> Tames frizzy, dry hair well</li>
            <li> I received this item along with 3 other items. I feel this was the only item that was fresh, not old product. The other products was difficult to flow into the hair to lather up, I feel the others were OLD products or a generic version. This product glided in my hair and I do like it a lot. However, I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see great improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li> We have hard water where I live and even with a soft water treatment unit my hair still gets dry and is not as soft as it used to be, and it is also difficult to comb out.  I have used Joico products for years but this is the first time I have used the Intense Hydrator Treatment.  This stuff is amazing.  After only the first use I could already feel and see a difference in the softness and smoothness of my hair.  I am hoping after continued use that my long hair will once again be smooth and shiny everyday.  I absolutely recommend it and I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I use this treatment as a conditioner.  I live in Houston and with the humidity, my hair is normally a frizzy mess.  This combined with Living Proofs No Frizz shampoo has been a life saver for me!  It smooths everything out.</li>
            <li> I have used this for almost 3 months now, but in pase two weeks not so much due to build up..This is a great moisturizing conditioner! Great for brittle and damaged hair, try it</li>
            <li> This is a nice addition to keeping your hair hydrated , even if your hair has had processing with perm or other drying treatments.</li>
            <li> I tried putting this on my hair straight out of the tube at night before going to bed. It&#x27;s not greasy so  I haven&#x27;t had any problem with it staining my pillow cover. I apply it generously then rinse my hair in the shower the next morning. I then wash my hair as usual and use the conditioner I use daily. It really helped when I was recently hospitalized with a DVT in the lower leg. The huge doses of blood thinners given causes hair to dry and fall out. By the time I came home I could see what the drugs were doing to my hair. I began applying this product at night and after 2 nights my hair began to recover. I still need to apply it about every 3 nights but this product saved my hair.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with damage, dry, brittle and thinning hair due to medication. This conditioner has helped my hair without weighing it down so this is great for me!</li>
            <li> this produce left my hair extensions so soft and smells great. no more tangles. only wish it gave it a shine but nothing a gloss cant do. I need the shampoo in this brand asap</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for long time and I love it. I have curly hair and it feels great. I leave it for about 30 minutes. Love the way it smells. Will buy again definitely.</li>
            <li> Works good. My hair was fried from over-processing! This really helped. Will be buying the corresponding shampoo &amp; conditioner next!!!</li>
