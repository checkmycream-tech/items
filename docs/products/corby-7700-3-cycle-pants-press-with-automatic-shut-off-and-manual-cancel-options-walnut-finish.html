            <li>You can&#x27;t expect the Corby to press around pockets and zippers, but the legs beneath this are come out great.</li>

            <li>, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great way to look a bit better every day.  </li>
            <li>I first tried this press in London; I found that all the best hotels had a Corby pants press tucked into their clothes closets.</li>
            <li>Give it a try, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>My pants look great and its so easy to use.</li>
            <li>It was easy to set up, is attractive, and works well.</li>
            <li>and I guess everyone has their own thing.</li>

            <li>It presses his pants perfectly and he&#x27;s happy he doesn&#x27;t have to go to the dry cleaners as often now.</li>
            <li>Tropical wool comes out very nicely after 30 minutes, and you must go a full 45 for cotton.  </li>
            <li>I am hoping to receive the products within time and also good packaging as it is huge investment for me.</li>
            <li>The first two were great and this one is better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It looks nice and assembles easily.</li>
            <li>This sure beats ironing.</li>
            <li>If they made it bigger and put a USB recharger on it, that would be awesome.  </li>
            <li>The company should invest in better electronics.</li>
            <li>we love it...  </li>
            <li>Excellent product; this is my second.  </li>
            <li>Meets minimum expectations and nothing more.</li>
            <li>I would be satisfied with parts but</li>
            <li>you could have ironed and got better results.</li>
            <li>This item has already more than paid for itself in my time</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t misunderstand me, Corby was great and they really tried to help.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>sure what the remedies for this will be.</li>
            <li>I love the results.</li>
            <li>A friend suggested that I go online to find a similar item at an excellent price.</li>
            <li>the Corby is a much more substantial unit.</li>
            <li>At most it takes 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>This has saved many trips to the cleaners for pressing or standing over the ironing board while rushing to get out of the house.  </li>
            <li>We love this product.</li>
            <li>and I love this one also.</li>
            <li>The heat settings may be made from warm a very hot and I am able to press even jeans.</li>
            <li>Overall a very good unit that performs as advertised.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly, well designed, careful construction</li>
            <li>x 43-3/10\\&quot; H, Walnut]]This is an easy to wall mount product or assemble as a stand alone.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Nicely packed, minimal assembly (wall mounting fairly easy), works great on a variety of materials.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy they were to use and how well they worked.</li>
            <li>Arrived almost fully assembled (you just attach the legs and the coat hanger--very easy.)</li>
            <li>It takes some practice to get it work right, but way more efficient than ironing:)</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>It arrived well packaged, was very easy to assemble and works very well!  </li>
            <li>but the screw holes are precisely 25 centimeters apart if you&#x27;re going to hang it on the wall.</li>
            <li>Great to find same press on Amazon.</li>
            <li>A phone call to their US service number basically said that no one was available -- leave a message.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Corby&#x27;s home office email support sent an automated reply to the effect that parts to fix this problem wouldn&#x27;t be available.  </li>
            <li>I previously sent a very positive review about the Corby 770 pant press - my husband is very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I was familiar with product.  </li>
            <li>My first thought was there was some magic override button I needed to turn</li>
            <li>Had my original for over 30 years but this replacement was a dud from day one.</li>
            <li>It only ever got mildly warm and I could do more by sitting on my pants than using this.</li>
            <li>Finally its reach in good conditions.</li>
            <li>They use cheap electronics and the heater stops working after about 9 months and then it is not as useful.</li>
            <li>AND IT STARTED ON THE VERY FIRST DAY.</li>
            <li>The new press uses a serrated hinged piece at the top of the front panel that does help with positioning somewhat.  </li>
            <li>Once your pants press is ready for use, it is as easy as hanging up a pair of pants.</li>
            <li>This was easy to assemble and works on any weight of fabric, doesn&#x27;t take up much room and does the job with a touch of a button.  </li>
            <li>Would have liked a bit bigger storage tray and a place to place belt (hook for instance).</li>
            <li>I liked this a lot as I always lay out my suit, shirt, tie, and shoes for the next day to save time in the morning.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have freshly pressed pants without having to press them.</li>
            <li>so there are no wrinkles, other wise the wrinkle gets pressed.</li>
            <li>My new one works just the same and my trousers look a great deal better than they did last week.</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>The Corby 7700 is a very gentle pants press.</li>
            <li>make sure to check the fabric of your suits before getting such a machine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It never gets so hot that it sets a stain.</li>
            <li>It will not power on and it has a quality control sticker, so you would think someone would have made sure it worked before it left the factory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am changing this to 3 stars because Amazon, replaced the unit.  </li>
            <li>I first contacted Jerdon at 1-800-223-3571</li>
            <li>This press does exactly what it says it will do....  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>freshly pressed anytime; using while getting ready for work is plenty of time to freshen them just before wearing.  </li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s easy to steam out the wrinkles in pants, it&#x27;s hard to get a nice crease -</li>
            <li>I have had several other pant presses, this one by far is the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very capable product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Too small to fit most things.  </li>
            <li>The Corby restores them smartly.</li>
            <li>But all wool and nylon dress pants press very well.</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>It does not use much electricity either or take up much room.</li>
            <li>We couldn&#x27;t assembled it straight away as we had travel commitments, and didn&#x27;t realize that the seller had a 30 days return policy.</li>
            <li>I got mine straight from the manufacturer with no shipping cost.</li>
            <li>Device is made in England and very sturdy and well-built.</li>
            <li>Using the Press at the end of the day when you take off the pants ensures they are ready to pull out of the closet</li>
            <li>My complaint is about Chisupply, the reseller in the US, who has NO IDEA of what good customer service is.</li>
            <li>Not exactly: \\&quot;Your Corby press is safe to use on any material (...)</li>
            <li>Firstly if you don&#x27;t take the time to make sure you get your creases right on, which can take a few minutes, you get a double crease.</li>
            <li>I had one [another brand] previously for many years.  </li>
            <li>This company should find a way to make it last 5 years or more for than price since it is a pain to send back.</li>
            <li>It never reaches a high temperature and therefore it does require about 30 minutes to press my wool pants.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>When he started a new position that required more formal business wear than previously, I decided to surprise him with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I even was careful before heating to be sure that pants were straight as possible.</li>
            <li>I read on a forum that this is normal with trousers made out of mid-light fabric.</li>
            <li>If you iron the Khakis normally then you can keep them pressed between washes.  </li>
            <li>have wasted all this money for a product that I have never been able to even switch on.</li>
            <li>I updated this from a one star review; because at least the UK office managed to respond with a nice \\&quot;buy another if after 3 years\\&quot; form letter.  </li>
            <li>Good but not great.</li>
            <li>It takes up much less \\&quot;real estate\\&quot; this way, and eliminates the cheap feeling plastc feet and the jacket hanger, but as it&#x27;s in my closet with my jackets that doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li>The new model is slightly deeper, does a great job, and will pay for itself in dry cleaning expense savings in short order.</li>
            <li>Great product just hope it last a long time since is not cheap.</li>
            <li>I wanted to repair it if I could, but I gave up and decided to purchase a new one.  </li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a gift for my husband and now wonder how we would live without it.  </li>
            <li>So I replaced the cheap plywood board with a solid one cut to the same size.</li>
            <li>You could get the same thing if you had a good outsized iron and 5 minutes, and probably get better results too, but the pants press takes up a lot less room and face it, I&#x27;m too lazy to make the effort to pick up an iron daily.  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted for 15 years, under constant use.  </li>
            <li>We tried to inquire about a new pad for our old one and tried to replace the pad but that proved to be an unacceptable result.</li>
            <li>Assembly was easy, but this product arrived dead on arrival</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this unit nearly 5 years</li>
            <li>A larger \\&quot;cubby\\&quot; for keys, wallet and change wouldn&#x27;t have been amiss, but perhaps I cram too much  into my pockets.</li>
            <li>My old pants press died on me after years (20+)of faithful service.</li>
            <li>15 minute setting on each side and your pants look professionally pressed...  </li>
            <li>My old press had a locking handle that extended the width of the press which I prefer over this unit&#x27;s design which does not.  </li>
            <li>We noted that in the old one that the heating panel was real wavy and this unit in giving us the same result as my old one that we sent to the trash heap    </li>
            <li>We really like the 3 time possibilities, which enables jeans to be pressed for 45 minutes as needed while dress pants may need only 15 or 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>When they&#x27;re done, I pull them out and they look like they&#x27;ve been professionally pressed.  </li>
            <li>We contacted the manufacture directly and they insisted that the seller should apply the 1 year warranty.</li>
            <li>The seller refused ,even after he was asked by Amazon directly to honor the manufacture warranty, they have refused to help.</li>
            <li>Pants come out looking nearly pressed.</li>
            <li>My order came the next day, much to my delight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a time saver and helps me maintain a professional and neatly pressed appearance.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s particlarly useful in the rainy season when my pant&#x27;s lower leg, below the bottom of my trench coat, get wet and lose their crease.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned one of the earlier Corby presses for several years and found it moderately useful (3 or 4 star).</li>
            <li>Perhaps the delay was due to an unexpectedly heavy Christmas rush but an email would have been nice.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband, who wanted a nice sharp crease without the trouble of ironing.</li>
            <li>This not only does not have that but also does not get hot enough.</li>
            <li>My advice is to avoid having the pants legs too far towards the bottom of the press, and also to make sure that the material on the inner leg is flat, which you can tell by smoothing out the seams and pulling it tight towards the creases.    </li>
            <li>I have had two of these over the past 20 years and they are fantastic.</li>
            <li>Secondly it simply does not work with certain materials such as a heavier material pair of chinos ( see photo below after 1-45 minute  and 1-30 minute cycle)  </li>
            <li>major limitation is the heating elements life span; for me, they burn out in two to three years.</li>
            <li>Useful, that is, right up to the point the foam backing (just behind the fabric liner) turned to a combination of dust and sticky goo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll once again  have crisp pants without shelling out extra money to dry cleaners.  </li>
            <li>It was my fault for putting in too thick a pair of pants, but if they&#x27;d used a piece of hardwood and more screws, it wouldn&#x27;t have broken so easily.</li>
            <li>Somewhat difficult to smooth out legs so as to not get wrinkles pressed in, expect that a little more practice will improve this.</li>
            <li>They are very visible too, even though I put my trousers carefully in the press as described in the manual.</li>
            <li>Do be careful of the pant placement and once the cuff is grabbed as you close the bottom hinged door pull gently on the waist band to pull out any wrinkles before pressing.</li>
            <li>So far, the new one has performed as expected.</li>
            <li>have had this unit for 15+ years - works flawlessly - have saved big $$$ by cutting dry cleaning bills well below half - also my suits last much longer as dry cleaning takes its toll and the wool when cleaned too frequently.</li>
            <li>If the new models use the same foam, they&#x27;re likely to suffer the same problem as the foam ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While everything else is fine, this unit arrived with a broken tie bar.</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t misunderstand me, Corby was great and they really tried to help.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> sure what the remedies for this will be.</li>
            <li> I love the results.</li>
            <li> A friend suggested that I go online to find a similar item at an excellent price.</li>
            <li> the Corby is a much more substantial unit.</li>
            <li> At most it takes 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> This has saved many trips to the cleaners for pressing or standing over the ironing board while rushing to get out of the house.  </li>
            <li> We love this product.</li>
            <li> and I love this one also.</li>
            <li> The heat settings may be made from warm a very hot and I am able to press even jeans.</li>
            <li> Overall a very good unit that performs as advertised.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, well designed, careful construction</li>
            <li> x 43-3/10\\&quot; H, Walnut]]This is an easy to wall mount product or assemble as a stand alone.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Nicely packed, minimal assembly (wall mounting fairly easy), works great on a variety of materials.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy they were to use and how well they worked.</li>
            <li> Arrived almost fully assembled (you just attach the legs and the coat hanger--very easy.)</li>
            <li> It takes some practice to get it work right, but way more efficient than ironing:)</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> It arrived well packaged, was very easy to assemble and works very well!  </li>
            <li> but the screw holes are precisely 25 centimeters apart if you&#x27;re going to hang it on the wall.</li>
            <li> Great to find same press on Amazon.</li>
            <li> A phone call to their US service number basically said that no one was available -- leave a message.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Corby&#x27;s home office email support sent an automated reply to the effect that parts to fix this problem wouldn&#x27;t be available.  </li>
            <li> I previously sent a very positive review about the Corby 770 pant press - my husband is very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I was familiar with product.  </li>
            <li> My first thought was there was some magic override button I needed to turn</li>
            <li> Had my original for over 30 years but this replacement was a dud from day one.</li>
            <li> It only ever got mildly warm and I could do more by sitting on my pants than using this.</li>
            <li> Finally its reach in good conditions.</li>
            <li> They use cheap electronics and the heater stops working after about 9 months and then it is not as useful.</li>
            <li> AND IT STARTED ON THE VERY FIRST DAY.</li>
            <li> The new press uses a serrated hinged piece at the top of the front panel that does help with positioning somewhat.  </li>
            <li> Once your pants press is ready for use, it is as easy as hanging up a pair of pants.</li>
            <li> This was easy to assemble and works on any weight of fabric, doesn&#x27;t take up much room and does the job with a touch of a button.  </li>
            <li> Would have liked a bit bigger storage tray and a place to place belt (hook for instance).</li>
            <li> I liked this a lot as I always lay out my suit, shirt, tie, and shoes for the next day to save time in the morning.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have freshly pressed pants without having to press them.</li>
            <li> so there are no wrinkles, other wise the wrinkle gets pressed.</li>
            <li> My new one works just the same and my trousers look a great deal better than they did last week.</li>
            <li> just right</li>
            <li> The Corby 7700 is a very gentle pants press.</li>
            <li> make sure to check the fabric of your suits before getting such a machine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It never gets so hot that it sets a stain.</li>
            <li> It will not power on and it has a quality control sticker, so you would think someone would have made sure it worked before it left the factory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am changing this to 3 stars because Amazon, replaced the unit.  </li>
            <li> I first contacted Jerdon at 1-800-223-3571</li>
            <li> This press does exactly what it says it will do....  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> freshly pressed anytime; using while getting ready for work is plenty of time to freshen them just before wearing.  </li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s easy to steam out the wrinkles in pants, it&#x27;s hard to get a nice crease -</li>
            <li> I have had several other pant presses, this one by far is the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very capable product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Too small to fit most things.  </li>
            <li> The Corby restores them smartly.</li>
            <li> But all wool and nylon dress pants press very well.</li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> It does not use much electricity either or take up much room.</li>
            <li> We couldn&#x27;t assembled it straight away as we had travel commitments, and didn&#x27;t realize that the seller had a 30 days return policy.</li>
            <li> I got mine straight from the manufacturer with no shipping cost.</li>
            <li> Device is made in England and very sturdy and well-built.</li>
            <li> Using the Press at the end of the day when you take off the pants ensures they are ready to pull out of the closet</li>
            <li> My complaint is about Chisupply, the reseller in the US, who has NO IDEA of what good customer service is.</li>
            <li> Not exactly: \\&quot;Your Corby press is safe to use on any material (...)</li>
            <li> Firstly if you don&#x27;t take the time to make sure you get your creases right on, which can take a few minutes, you get a double crease.</li>
            <li> I had one [another brand] previously for many years.  </li>
            <li> This company should find a way to make it last 5 years or more for than price since it is a pain to send back.</li>
            <li> It never reaches a high temperature and therefore it does require about 30 minutes to press my wool pants.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> When he started a new position that required more formal business wear than previously, I decided to surprise him with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I even was careful before heating to be sure that pants were straight as possible.</li>
            <li> I read on a forum that this is normal with trousers made out of mid-light fabric.</li>
            <li> If you iron the Khakis normally then you can keep them pressed between washes.  </li>
            <li> have wasted all this money for a product that I have never been able to even switch on.</li>
            <li> I updated this from a one star review; because at least the UK office managed to respond with a nice \\&quot;buy another if after 3 years\\&quot; form letter.  </li>
            <li> Good but not great.</li>
            <li> It takes up much less \\&quot;real estate\\&quot; this way, and eliminates the cheap feeling plastc feet and the jacket hanger, but as it&#x27;s in my closet with my jackets that doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> The new model is slightly deeper, does a great job, and will pay for itself in dry cleaning expense savings in short order.</li>
            <li> Great product just hope it last a long time since is not cheap.</li>
            <li> I wanted to repair it if I could, but I gave up and decided to purchase a new one.  </li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my husband and now wonder how we would live without it.  </li>
            <li> So I replaced the cheap plywood board with a solid one cut to the same size.</li>
            <li> You could get the same thing if you had a good outsized iron and 5 minutes, and probably get better results too, but the pants press takes up a lot less room and face it, I&#x27;m too lazy to make the effort to pick up an iron daily.  </li>
            <li> The first one lasted for 15 years, under constant use.  </li>
            <li> We tried to inquire about a new pad for our old one and tried to replace the pad but that proved to be an unacceptable result.</li>
            <li> Assembly was easy, but this product arrived dead on arrival</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this unit nearly 5 years</li>
            <li> A larger \\&quot;cubby\\&quot; for keys, wallet and change wouldn&#x27;t have been amiss, but perhaps I cram too much  into my pockets.</li>
            <li> My old pants press died on me after years (20+)of faithful service.</li>
            <li> 15 minute setting on each side and your pants look professionally pressed...  </li>
            <li> My old press had a locking handle that extended the width of the press which I prefer over this unit&#x27;s design which does not.  </li>
            <li> We noted that in the old one that the heating panel was real wavy and this unit in giving us the same result as my old one that we sent to the trash heap    </li>
            <li> We really like the 3 time possibilities, which enables jeans to be pressed for 45 minutes as needed while dress pants may need only 15 or 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> When they&#x27;re done, I pull them out and they look like they&#x27;ve been professionally pressed.  </li>
            <li> We contacted the manufacture directly and they insisted that the seller should apply the 1 year warranty.</li>
            <li> The seller refused ,even after he was asked by Amazon directly to honor the manufacture warranty, they have refused to help.</li>
            <li> Pants come out looking nearly pressed.</li>
            <li> My order came the next day, much to my delight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a time saver and helps me maintain a professional and neatly pressed appearance.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s particlarly useful in the rainy season when my pant&#x27;s lower leg, below the bottom of my trench coat, get wet and lose their crease.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned one of the earlier Corby presses for several years and found it moderately useful (3 or 4 star).</li>
            <li> Perhaps the delay was due to an unexpectedly heavy Christmas rush but an email would have been nice.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband, who wanted a nice sharp crease without the trouble of ironing.</li>
            <li> This not only does not have that but also does not get hot enough.</li>
            <li> My advice is to avoid having the pants legs too far towards the bottom of the press, and also to make sure that the material on the inner leg is flat, which you can tell by smoothing out the seams and pulling it tight towards the creases.    </li>
            <li> I have had two of these over the past 20 years and they are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Secondly it simply does not work with certain materials such as a heavier material pair of chinos ( see photo below after 1-45 minute  and 1-30 minute cycle)  </li>
            <li> major limitation is the heating elements life span; for me, they burn out in two to three years.</li>
            <li> Useful, that is, right up to the point the foam backing (just behind the fabric liner) turned to a combination of dust and sticky goo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll once again  have crisp pants without shelling out extra money to dry cleaners.  </li>
            <li> It was my fault for putting in too thick a pair of pants, but if they&#x27;d used a piece of hardwood and more screws, it wouldn&#x27;t have broken so easily.</li>
            <li> Somewhat difficult to smooth out legs so as to not get wrinkles pressed in, expect that a little more practice will improve this.</li>
            <li> They are very visible too, even though I put my trousers carefully in the press as described in the manual.</li>
            <li> Do be careful of the pant placement and once the cuff is grabbed as you close the bottom hinged door pull gently on the waist band to pull out any wrinkles before pressing.</li>
            <li> So far, the new one has performed as expected.</li>
            <li> have had this unit for 15+ years - works flawlessly - have saved big $$$ by cutting dry cleaning bills well below half - also my suits last much longer as dry cleaning takes its toll and the wool when cleaned too frequently.</li>
            <li> If the new models use the same foam, they&#x27;re likely to suffer the same problem as the foam ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While everything else is fine, this unit arrived with a broken tie bar.</li>
            <li> It definitely takes some practice to get pants completely flat.  </li>
            <li> Dear Sir     We have used the previous Corby that we bought but the padding deteriorated so we bought this new one.     </li>
            <li> It is unfortunate that the electronics that Corby uses do not have a better long term working life.</li>
            <li> The small footprint works well in our not overly large bedroom, and allows him to have neatly pressed trousers every day.</li>
            <li> For all the money I spend on suits and shirts and dry cleaning and laundry, if this thing lasts for at least a year it will have been well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut back on that and saved my suits from a lot of uneeded dry cleaning.</li>
            <li> Start with minimal timer settings then ramp up as needed for more difficult fabrics.</li>
            <li> Like its predecessors, it not only keeps your pants pressed, it extends the time between visits to the dry cleaner.</li>
            <li> I was initially concerned that the new unit only has a single temperature setting, but it works well with the fabric types that I have tried during the past couple of months.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shame -- this was a decent product, with a materials choice flaw (the disintegrating foam pad)that lead to an early demise, and disappointingly poor support.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s almost closed (maybe a couple inches open)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t understand what was REALLY flat inside the press, and what just looked flat), but now it takes less than 30 seconds to get a pair of pants aligned properly and in place for pressing.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s saving me a ton of money in dry cleaning.</li>
            <li> I am still annoyed the first one was defective and that the company did not respond.  </li>
            <li> It is not a processional steam press that will create razor-sharp creases, but the pants will be winkle-free as long as you are careful in terms of how you place the pants in the presser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading a lot of positive reviews, I finally got myself one.&lt;br /&gt;The linings are well made, but the Corby keeps leaving weird wavy wrinkles on the side of my trousers.</li>
            <li> You have to be carefull to place the pants carefully  </li>
            <li> You do need to insert your pants in it carefully, it takes some practice.</li>
            <li> However, when I ordered it I was told the expected delivery was between Dec 27th and Jan 5th.  </li>
            <li> It took me a few tries to understand how to lay the pants completely flat (I would have pressed-in wrinkles in the beginning b/c</li>
            <li> Before you close it pull up just a bit  (maybe half an inch) on the middle of the pants and while holding it up that little bit, close the press.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Threw out the other one, this one is a keeper.  </li>
            <li> Gets rid of small wrinkles, but leaves giant ones.  </li>
            <li> It works extremely well and saves cleaning bills.</li>
            <li> Not as sharply pressed as if you took an iron to it, but it&#x27;s a lot less effort</li>
            <li> They only press the legs, so you won&#x27;t get creases out of the seat of the pants, but that&#x27;s hardly a concern with a pair of pants off of a suit.    </li>
            <li> Not worth it.  </li>
            <li> Previous press lasted about 8 years.  </li>
            <li> Had a previous one for thirty years, and from the look of this one I will have it forever.  </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t believe you could buy these for less than $300.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an expensive bulky machine that removes wrinkles but adds new ones.</li>
            <li> it just takes a little learning to do the pressing correctly.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money which I will unload on eBay to some unfortunate at a fraction of what I paid.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Anything with pockets is a waste of time.</li>
            <li> The product arrived dead.  </li>
            <li> So after a few months of use, the bottom screw came out of the plywood board.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a cubby for you to put your keys and wallet on, but it&#x27;s a bit small for a smartphone too.</li>
            <li> Silly me: I only have suits with mid-light fabrics.</li>
            <li> The product works well enough, however I have been unable to find a way to get it repaired.  </li>
            <li> This past year is discontinued functioning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Corby in the past when travelling to England.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the one I received is defective or if the quality of the product has just deteriorated.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is that in 20 years, I have had two of these Corby Presses fail to work (I guess they wore out) and was forced to buy another one.</li>
            <li> I think the hanger should have been made out of wood at least for this price point.  </li>
            <li> My husband grew up with these as something common to have.</li>
            <li> Not meant for thick cotton slacks.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I read some reviews of some other models but he loves it!</li>
            <li> I am not sure why I am having such a terrible experience with this product as opposed to other reviews.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointing and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I made my slacks worse than wrinkled.  </li>
            <li> The pants press leaves wrinkles on the trousers that are difficult to iron out.  </li>
            <li> I could have done without the fake wood veneer because it&#x27;s not the 1970&#x27;s anymore, but functionally, it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a neat touch, too bad</li>
            <li> Too bad!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my third one in 20 years. The first two were great and this one is better.</li>
            <li> return item not that great</li>
            <li> I didnt like this at all. It only ever got mildly warm and I could do more by sitting on my pants than using this. I returned it and got my money back</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002B9G14M Corby 7700 Pants Press w/ 15/30/45 Min Timer, 17-7/10\\&quot; W x 5-1/2\\&quot; D x 43-3/10\\&quot; H, Walnut]]This is an easy to wall mount product or assemble as a stand alone. Once your pants press is ready for use, it is as easy as hanging up a pair of pants. Press the timer button for minutes you want, and get up in the morning with perfectly pressed trousers. This sure beats ironing.</li>
            <li> received the Corby 7700 pants presser promptly. It is easy to use and does what it is supposed to do. You have to be carefull to place the pants carefully  so there are no wrinkles, other wise the wrinkle gets pressed. it just takes a little learning to do the pressing correctly.</li>
            <li> The Corby pants press does what&#x27;s advertised, it relaxes the wrinkles of your trousers and imprints the crease. You do need to insert your pants in it carefully, it takes some practice. What I do is hold up my pants, fold them crosswise as if I was going to put them in a drawer, and use my fingertips to roll the creases so they line up. Then I dip them into the machine, smoothing it out by hand before closing. I don&#x27;t understand the &#x27;pull up while closing&#x27; bit the instructions mention, but my technique works well and I guess everyone has their own thing. Pants comes out nicely pressed and toasty warm, a welcome thing in the winter months. Not as sharply pressed as if you took an iron to it, but it&#x27;s a lot less effort and you can think of it as a touch-up between ironings.  I didn&#x27;t realize this but there is a rod that slides out from the left of the unit so you can hang your tie on it. That&#x27;s a neat touch, too bad I found it after I&#x27;d mounted it to the wall 3 inches from a windowstill, so I can&#x27;t extract the rod fully. Oh well. There&#x27;s a cubby for you to put your keys and wallet on, but it&#x27;s a bit small for a smartphone too. If they made it bigger and put a USB recharger on it, that would be awesome.  Plastic hanger and feet are a bit flimsy for the cost of the unit. I think the hanger should have been made out of wood at least for this price point.  The instructions don&#x27;t mention this but the screw holes are precisely 25 centimeters apart if you&#x27;re going to hang it on the wall. That&#x27;ll save you some aggravation if you know this.  Giving 4 stars because even if it works nicely it&#x27;s a bit spendy for what you get. You could get the same thing if you had a good outsized iron and 5 minutes, and probably get better results too, but the pants press takes up a lot less room and face it, I&#x27;m too lazy to make the effort to pick up an iron daily.  -Derrick</li>
            <li> Received as advertised. I have used one of these Corby Press&#x27;s (this is my third one in 20 years) daily. It work&#x27;s quite well.     The only negative is that in 20 years, I have had two of these Corby Presses fail to work (I guess they wore out) and was forced to buy another one. It is unfortunate that the electronics that Corby uses do not have a better long term working life. The company should invest in better electronics.</li>
            <li> After reading a lot of positive reviews, I finally got myself one.&lt;br /&gt;The linings are well made, but the Corby keeps leaving weird wavy wrinkles on the side of my trousers. They are very visible too, even though I put my trousers carefully in the press as described in the manual. I read on a forum that this is normal with trousers made out of mid-light fabric. Heavier fabrics supposedly don&#x27;t get such wrinkles. Silly me: I only have suits with mid-light fabrics. Does Corby mention this on their website? Not exactly: \\&quot;Your Corby press is safe to use on any material (...) Using your Corby press daily will add to the life and appearance of your trousers.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So make sure to check the fabric of your suits before getting such a machine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, to me it&#x27;s an expensive bulky machine that removes wrinkles but adds new ones.</li>
            <li> I previously sent a very positive review about the Corby 770 pant press - my husband is very happy with it.  However, when I ordered it I was told the expected delivery was between Dec 27th and Jan 5th.  It didn&#x27;t arrive until the middle of January.  There was no indication that delivery would be delayed.  Perhaps the delay was due to an unexpectedly heavy Christmas rush but an email would have been nice.</li>
            <li> I am hoping to receive the products within time and also good packaging as it is huge investment for me. Finally its reach in good conditions. Cheers!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this unit nearly 5 years and it&#x27;s performed flawlessly. It&#x27;s particlarly useful in the rainy season when my pant&#x27;s lower leg, below the bottom of my trench coat, get wet and lose their crease. The Corby restores them smartly. Do be careful of the pant placement and once the cuff is grabbed as you close the bottom hinged door pull gently on the waist band to pull out any wrinkles before pressing. I was having my pants cleaned to often simply to restore the press. I&#x27;ve cut back on that and saved my suits from a lot of uneeded dry cleaning. The Corby 7700 is a very gentle pants press. It never reaches a high temperature and therefore it does require about 30 minutes to press my wool pants. It never gets so hot that it sets a stain. I have installed mine onto my closet wall with the included mounting kit. It takes up much less \\&quot;real estate\\&quot; this way, and eliminates the cheap feeling plastc feet and the jacket hanger, but as it&#x27;s in my closet with my jackets that doesn&#x27;t matter. The unit is made in England and seems well thought out and well constructed. A larger \\&quot;cubby\\&quot; for keys, wallet and change wouldn&#x27;t have been amiss, but perhaps I cram too much  into my pockets. It&#x27;s a very capable product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Works well on all dress pants.  On Khakis which are thicker cotton it does not work that well.  If you iron the Khakis normally then you can keep them pressed between washes.  But all wool and nylon dress pants press very well.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement.  Previous press lasted about 8 years.  Great to find same press on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was familiar with product.  It works very well.  It is used every day. It does a nice a job</li>
            <li> Nicely packed, minimal assembly (wall mounting fairly easy), works great on a variety of materials.  Start with minimal timer settings then ramp up as needed for more difficult fabrics.</li>
            <li> I have used this same pant&#x27;s presser for years. Then it finally \\&quot;died,\\&quot; and  I have been looking for it in catalogs. Then, Eureka, I thought enough to look on Amazon.com and low and behold they carried it. I&#x27;ll once again  have crisp pants without shelling out extra money to dry cleaners.  T. Powell, Florida</li>
            <li> My boyfriend saw one of these in a catalogue and he wanted one for his birthday. I was skeptical when I read some reviews of some other models but he loves it! It presses his pants perfectly and he&#x27;s happy he doesn&#x27;t have to go to the dry cleaners as often now. Delivered promptly as well.</li>
            <li> Assembly was easy, but this product arrived dead on arrival - attempts to contact the company or the US agent in Texas have been fruitless - so I am left with a $300 coat hanger.  It will not power on and it has a quality control sticker, so you would think someone would have made sure it worked before it left the factory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am changing this to 3 stars because Amazon, replaced the unit.  I am still annoyed the first one was defective and that the company did not respond.  My first thought was there was some magic override button I needed to turn on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a good job of releasing winkles.  It is not a processional steam press that will create razor-sharp creases, but the pants will be winkle-free as long as you are careful in terms of how you place the pants in the presser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks nice and assembles easily.</li>
            <li> It quit working after a year. was outside of the amazon return window and Corby wasn&#x27;t that helpful. don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I had the same product in England over 30 years ago.  It is still wonderful and I go to work with perfect pants every day.  It does not use much electricity either or take up much room.</li>
            <li> My old pants press died on me after years (20+)of faithful service. I wanted to repair it if I could, but I gave up and decided to purchase a new one.  So far, the new one has performed as expected. Talk to me in twenty years...</li>
            <li> My husband grew up with these as something common to have. When he started a new position that required more formal business wear than previously, I decided to surprise him with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has been thrilled with this product. The small footprint works well in our not overly large bedroom, and allows him to have neatly pressed trousers every day.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s saving me a ton of money in dry cleaning. My pants look great and its so easy to use.</li>
            <li> 15 minute setting on each side and your pants look professionally pressed...  we love it...  now if they would just invent a shirt/ blouse presser, I would be really happy...</li>
            <li> Excellent product; this is my second.  The first one lasted for 15 years, under constant use.  The new model is slightly deeper, does a great job, and will pay for itself in dry cleaning expense savings in short order.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.  If you don&#x27;t get the pants in just right you end up with messed up creases.  Returned it.</li>
            <li> Had a previous one for thirty years, and from the look of this one I will have it forever.  Works perfectly, well designed, careful construction, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> The Corby 7700 is the best presser on the market. We are on our third one as they last about ten years before dying out from daily use. While everything else is fine, this unit arrived with a broken tie bar. Hey Amazon, do you bother to check the items before you ship them?</li>
            <li> This replaces a press that I had used for about 8 years that quit working.  I was initially concerned that the new unit only has a single temperature setting, but it works well with the fabric types that I have tried during the past couple of months.  Tropical wool comes out very nicely after 30 minutes, and you must go a full 45 for cotton.  I have not yet tried linen but expect it will require a maximum time setting as well.  The only thing about the press that I do not like is the LED display that remains illuminated when the unit is off.  My old press had a locking handle that extended the width of the press which I prefer over this unit&#x27;s design which does not.  The full-width handle assisted with positioning the slacks in the press.  The new press uses a serrated hinged piece at the top of the front panel that does help with positioning somewhat.  Overall a very good unit that performs as advertised.</li>
            <li> Good but not great. Meets minimum expectations and nothing more.</li>
            <li> The product works well enough, however I have been unable to find a way to get it repaired.  I would be satisfied with parts but appearently replacement parts are also unavailable. I first contacted Jerdon at 1-800-223-3571 they are the USA distributers, no help. I then contacted the factory customer service in England, they also said there was no way they could get it repaired nor do they have access to parts. Too bad! I will never buy a Corby product again</li>
            <li> This is my third Corby. Like its predecessors, it not only keeps your pants pressed, it extends the time between visits to the dry cleaner. The only difficulty I&#x27;ve encountered is that&#x27;s wife has started using the Corby to press her scarves and pants. So we now compete for use of the unit. I recommend the Corby.</li>
            <li> Nice looking. Somewhat difficult to smooth out legs so as to not get wrinkles pressed in, expect that a little more practice will improve this. Would have liked a bit bigger storage tray and a place to place belt (hook for instance).</li>
            <li> I am not sure why I am having such a terrible experience with this product as opposed to other reviews. Firstly if you don&#x27;t take the time to make sure you get your creases right on, which can take a few minutes, you get a double crease. By the time you do this  you could have ironed and got better results. Secondly it simply does not work with certain materials such as a heavier material pair of chinos ( see photo below after 1-45 minute  and 1-30 minute cycle)  In my opinion proper pressing needs a steam component to work. This not only does not have that but also does not get hot enough. Do not buy!!</li>
            <li> It takes some practice to get it work right, but way more efficient than ironing:)</li>
            <li> Dear Sir     We have used the previous Corby that we bought but the padding deteriorated so we bought this new one.     It appears to be defective in that it is putting a WRINKLED PATTERN ON ALL OF MY PANTS AND IT STARTED ON THE VERY FIRST DAY. We tried to inquire about a new pad for our old one and tried to replace the pad but that proved to be an unacceptable result. We noted that in the old one that the heating panel was real wavy and this unit in giving us the same result as my old one that we sent to the trash heap    Would greatly appreciate your help with this problem as I believe the pants press is defective    Please advise,    Douglas J. Fox, DDS, MS</li>
            <li> This press does exactly what it says it will do....  press pants!   We really like the 3 time possibilities, which enables jeans to be pressed for 45 minutes as needed while dress pants may need only 15 or 30 minutes.  Yay, Corby!!</li>
            <li> Does what is to do perfectly!  Great machine!!  Threw out the other one, this one is a keeper.  Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> This product works great.  I had one before and used it every morning for 10 years until I wore it out.</li>
            <li> Had my original for over 30 years but this replacement was a dud from day one. The manufacturers cannot service them in Australia as the have no agent. A complete waste of money which I will unload on eBay to some unfortunate at a fraction of what I paid. Save your money</li>
            <li> Nice to have! Not so good quality!</li>
            <li> Too small to fit most things.  Because of this, it ends up wrinkling everything that I put in it.  Gets rid of small wrinkles, but leaves giant ones.  Anything with pockets is a waste of time.</li>
            <li> I have had several other pant presses, this one by far is the best. The heat settings may be made from warm a very hot and I am able to press even jeans. Great product just hope it last a long time since is not cheap.</li>
            <li> This item has already more than paid for itself in my time and/or cleaning bills.  In the morning, I can drop a pair of pants into the press and then set it for 15, 30, or 45 minutes.  When they&#x27;re done, I pull them out and they look like they&#x27;ve been professionally pressed.  They only press the legs, so you won&#x27;t get creases out of the seat of the pants, but that&#x27;s hardly a concern with a pair of pants off of a suit.    It took me a few tries to understand how to lay the pants completely flat (I would have pressed-in wrinkles in the beginning b/c I didn&#x27;t understand what was REALLY flat inside the press, and what just looked flat), but now it takes less than 30 seconds to get a pair of pants aligned properly and in place for pressing.  My advice is to avoid having the pants legs too far towards the bottom of the press, and also to make sure that the material on the inner leg is flat, which you can tell by smoothing out the seams and pulling it tight towards the creases.    Great item and I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The product arrived dead.  We couldn&#x27;t assembled it straight away as we had travel commitments, and didn&#x27;t realize that the seller had a 30 days return policy. We contacted the manufacture directly and they insisted that the seller should apply the 1 year warranty. The seller refused ,even after he was asked by Amazon directly to honor the manufacture warranty, they have refused to help. Warranties are put in place by manufactures for a reason and should not be ignored by resellers.&lt;br /&gt;I have wasted all this money for a product that I have never been able to even switch on. Don&#x27;t misunderstand me, Corby was great and they really tried to help. My complaint is about Chisupply, the reseller in the US, who has NO IDEA of what good customer service is.</li>
            <li> The pants press leaves wrinkles on the trousers that are difficult to iron out.  Extremely disappointing and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It works extremely well and saves cleaning bills. Pants come out looking nearly pressed. I love it. Wouldn&#x27;t be without it</li>
            <li> I first tried this press in London; I found that all the best hotels had a Corby pants press tucked into their clothes closets. I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy they were to use and how well they worked. While it&#x27;s easy to steam out the wrinkles in pants, it&#x27;s hard to get a nice crease - especially if you don&#x27;t want to have your pants looking shiny! I thought this was going to cost a fortune and I couldn&#x27;t believe you could buy these for less than $300. I got mine straight from the manufacturer with no shipping cost. Works great. Always does a great job. Now I can&#x27;t live without it. After all, why look like a schlepp when you could look like a million bucks?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned one of the earlier Corby presses for several years and found it moderately useful (3 or 4 star). Useful, that is, right up to the point the foam backing (just behind the fabric liner) turned to a combination of dust and sticky goo. If the new models use the same foam, they&#x27;re likely to suffer the same problem as the foam ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what the remedies for this will be. The Corby web site doesn&#x27;t show a parts replacement. A phone call to their US service number basically said that no one was available -- leave a message.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If/when that message is returned, I&#x27;ll update the review. Hopefully, a repair option will be provided. Meanwhile potential buyers might want to know that the Corby press may or may not prove a long-lasting purchase -- and to judge its value accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To update:  US support never answered.  Corby&#x27;s home office email support sent an automated reply to the effect that parts to fix this problem wouldn&#x27;t be available.  I updated this from a one star review; because at least the UK office managed to respond with a nice \\&quot;buy another if after 3 years\\&quot; form letter.  Not even this courtesy from the US phone support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame -- this was a decent product, with a materials choice flaw (the disintegrating foam pad)that lead to an early demise, and disappointingly poor support.</li>
            <li> The press went together in a snap. Works well. I love the results. I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it.</li>
            <li> have had this unit for 15+ years - works flawlessly - have saved big $$$ by cutting dry cleaning bills well below half - also my suits last much longer as dry cleaning takes its toll and the wool when cleaned too frequently.</li>
            <li> I made my slacks worse than wrinkled.  I presses wrinlkes in the seam and I even was careful before heating to be sure that pants were straight as possible.</li>
            <li> I had one [another brand] previously for many years.  This past year is discontinued functioning.  I tried to get parts to fix it to no avail.  I was delighted when I found it in a catalog.  A friend suggested that I go online to find a similar item at an excellent price. I had a choice of  models and prices.  My order came the next day, much to my delight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has [is] lived up to all of my expectations and the Corby is a much more substantial unit.</li>
            <li> I liked this a lot as I always lay out my suit, shirt, tie, and shoes for the next day to save time in the morning. If you have a Rowenta steam iron you can shoot steam into the jacket to get wrinkles, but ironing pants takes time and the heat hurts the wool.They use cheap electronics and the heater stops working after about 9 months and then it is not as useful. This company should find a way to make it last 5 years or more for than price since it is a pain to send back.</li>
            <li> Have had the Pants Press for about a month now.  It arrived well packaged, was very easy to assemble and works very well!  I used the free-standing set-up but it also came with hardware to mount the unit to the wall.  For a guy who likes to look neat and pressed, but hates to iron this is the way to go.  Save money on drycleaning bills as well.  Over time I believe this product will pay for itself!  Give it a try, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Has my been made easier. I set my pants every night and viola...i have nicely pressed pants in the morning. At most it takes 45 minutes. Not meant for thick cotton slacks.</li>
            <li> Very good performance, exeds my expectations</li>
            <li> The Corby Pant Presses definitely work.&lt;br /&gt;The major limitation is the heating elements life span; for me, they burn out in two to three years.</li>
            <li> The valet is a great addition to my closet.  It is a time saver and helps me maintain a professional and neatly pressed appearance.  I should have purchased one years ago.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband, who wanted a nice sharp crease without the trouble of ironing. It was easy to set up, is attractive, and works well. The variable time options are a plus.</li>
            <li> Might look like a gimmick, but it is not. I have had two of these over the past 20 years and they are fantastic. I put my pants in the press when undressing at night, remove them in the morning to hang and they look great. You can&#x27;t expect the Corby to press around pockets and zippers, but the legs beneath this are come out great. You&#x27;ll have freshly pressed pants without having to press them. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I had one of these when I lived in Asia. It was very good and never a problem. My new one works just the same and my trousers look a great deal better than they did last week.</li>
            <li> Perfect crease every time! Device is made in England and very sturdy and well-built. Arrived almost fully assembled (you just attach the legs and the coat hanger--very easy.) I could have done without the fake wood veneer because it&#x27;s not the 1970&#x27;s anymore, but functionally, it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: So after a few months of use, the bottom screw came out of the plywood board. It was my fault for putting in too thick a pair of pants, but if they&#x27;d used a piece of hardwood and more screws, it wouldn&#x27;t have broken so easily. So I replaced the cheap plywood board with a solid one cut to the same size. Works fine.</li>
            <li> The best purchase.  Your satisfaction is guaranteed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my husband and now wonder how we would live without it.  The Pants Press gets used every day by one (or two) of us.  Using the Press at the end of the day when you take off the pants ensures they are ready to pull out of the closet freshly pressed anytime; using while getting ready for work is plenty of time to freshen them just before wearing.  This has saved many trips to the cleaners for pressing or standing over the ironing board while rushing to get out of the house.  This was easy to assemble and works on any weight of fabric, doesn&#x27;t take up much room and does the job with a touch of a button.  We love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Corby in the past when travelling to England.  Finally bought one.  I&#x27;m not sure if the one I received is defective or if the quality of the product has just deteriorated.  Pressed about 25 different times and evey time a pattern was left on the pants.  The wrinkles were gone but a pattern formed on the pants.  I even pressed a couple times, switched sides, different pant materials, etc.  I wish I could upload a picture.  Just finished returning it.</li>
            <li> This is the one that replaced the one I had for years. I loved that one  and I love this one also. My slacks and my wife&#x27;s slacks always look neat.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  It definitely takes some practice to get pants completely flat.  The trick is to lay them in, flatten out any wrinkles with your hand, then start closing it.  When it&#x27;s almost closed (maybe a couple inches open) the cuffs will be caught since it closes from the bottom up.  Before you close it pull up just a bit  (maybe half an inch) on the middle of the pants and while holding it up that little bit, close the press.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great way to look a bit better every day.  For all the money I spend on suits and shirts and dry cleaning and laundry, if this thing lasts for at least a year it will have been well worth it.</li>
