            <li>Love this color.  </li>
            <li>Apply it myself w/ the Vinylux Top Coat.</li>
            <li>Want to get many more colors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would be great for your nails too, especially if you are better are polishing them than I am!</li>
            <li>I mainly use it for doing my own pedicures and try to go to the salon for my manicures (just because I&#x27;m not that accurate at doing my own nails).</li>
            <li>Stays on forever, and comes off easily with polish remover.  </li>
            <li>Dries very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Easy to put on and easy to take off.</li>

            <li>Had my manicurist apply the polish and all the girls there were excited about it.</li>
            <li>best, very few cracks</li>
            <li>Very close to Cajun Shrimp, which is my absolute favorite of all!  </li>
            <li>I love Vinylux, and it really does last longer than most polishes.</li>
            <li>Color is pretty.</li>
            <li>Using it with the top coat didn&#x27;t produce a manicure that lasted any longer than regular nail polish.</li>
            <li>This is my first time to try vinyl polish</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The only problem is that nails aren&#x27;t quite as strong with the lighter Vinylux.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a pink than shown here....</li>
            <li>Drys fast and lasts real well.</li>
            <li>This color is more pink than it shows up on my monitor.  </li>
            <li>I interchange both, depending on how much time I have.</li>
            <li>Stays on for the whole week, even when I had a week of holiday cooking and was doing dishes and preparing food.  </li>
            <li>Great wearability with such little effort!</li>
            <li>My new fave color.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The color is a lot pinker than the picture, which has a more orangey look.  : /.</li>
            <li>Goes on and is removed like any other nail polish but lasts a full two weeks  without chipping.</li>
            <li>The nailpolish itself is ok but the color is not good for me.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a red orange color as the picture shows, but i got a hot pink color.</li>
            <li>not dry out nails.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>

            <li> not exactly hot red like I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t last me as long as the other CND polishes I use, not sure</li>
            <li> It last at least a week.</li>
            <li> Vinylux is so much less time-consuming than Shellac nail polish.  </li>
            <li> but I was looking forward to something a little brighter</li>
            <li> A little disappointed in the color.</li>

            <li> The nailpolish itself is ok but the color is not good for me.  Would maybe try brand again though.  Hope another color would work out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a pink than shown here....not exactly hot red like I was hoping for.  Still a great color, just not what I was in search of.</li>
            <li> I love Vinylux, and it really does last longer than most polishes. This is a great bright reddish orange color, perfect for summer!</li>

            <li> Love this polish!  Stays on forever, and comes off easily with polish remover.  Plan to buy in lots of colors!</li>
            <li> This is my first time to try vinyl polish and I do love this polish. The color is great!  Very close to Cajun Shrimp, which is my absolute favorite of all!  I purchased 2 colors and I am happy with both. I will not purchase what I call &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; polish again.  I mainly use it for doing my own pedicures and try to go to the salon for my manicures (just because I&#x27;m not that accurate at doing my own nails). I&#x27;m sure it would be great for your nails too, especially if you are better are polishing them than I am! The color lasts for 2-3 weeks and does not chip. It does work best if you use a top coat. After placing my order, it took about 1 week to arrive.  I am very pleased with this seller and would purchase from them again. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Keeps shine like glass.&lt;br /&gt;Resists chipping up to 6-7 days or longer if you are just hanging out at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;Comes off with acetone.&lt;br /&gt;Does not dry out nails.&lt;br /&gt;Great alternative to Shellac</li>
            <li> Super! Thanks! The colour pinker, not that red as on a picture! Colour like lobster :)</li>
            <li> Unique color. But it didn&#x27;t last me as long as the other CND polishes I use, not sure if it&#x27;s the color though.</li>
            <li> Good product!&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;My favorite color in this line)</li>
            <li> Flourecent like color that is bright and looks like photo.  Not quite as orange as I imagined but looks like description and arrived in perfect condition, fast and as described.</li>
            <li> This polish last for 2 wks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best, very few cracks,  I enjoy this product. The color doesn&#x27;t fade over time.</li>
            <li> This color is more pink than it shows up on my monitor.  Nice color but I was looking forward to something a little brighter</li>
            <li> Vinylux is so much less time-consuming than Shellac nail polish.  Love this color.  Dries very quickly.  The only problem is that nails aren&#x27;t quite as strong with the lighter Vinylux.  I interchange both, depending on how much time I have.</li>
            <li> Does what is meant to do! Apply it myself w/ the Vinylux Top Coat.</li>
            <li> great Nail polish! Love the color and durablity! Lasts a full week with 2 coats and 2 top coats!&lt;br /&gt;Need 100% acatone to easily remove!</li>
            <li> love this product - a manicure lasts all week and the color stays bright.  I would purchase this again in the future.</li>

            <li> Amaziing polish. Stays on for the whole week, even when I had a week of holiday cooking and was doing dishes and preparing food.  Had my manicurist apply the polish and all the girls there were excited about it. Easy to put on and easy to take off.</li>
            <li> Lasted over two weeks.  The only reason I needed to change my polish was because of growth.  Almost as good as gel polish without having your hands go under the dryer.  Been using for over six months.  Want to get many more colors.</li>
            <li> Color isn&#x27;t as bright as pictured. A little disappointed in the color.</li>
