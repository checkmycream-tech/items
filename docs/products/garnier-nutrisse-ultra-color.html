    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>the color of my hair after coloring depends on the time I apply this haircolor to my hair, and becomes lighter after 3-4 washes.&lt;br /&gt;The best for me is to apply it for about 10 min.</li>

            <li>This is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to be able to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I am a hair color commitment phobe so this is perfect for me, it leaves my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>so easy!</li>
            <li>Fabulous product--I am always getting compliments!  </li>
            <li>Love Garnier Herbashine hair color.  </li>
            <li>so I am glad to be able to purchase it on line.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I bought 3  boxes I still use this haircolor between visits to my hair stylist just to freshen up the front strands where the gray shows most.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite temporary haircolor.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t my favorite color, but it&#x27;s close.</li>
            <li>LOVE that it&#x27;s made from bamboo, a sustainable, non-toxic ingredient.</li>
            <li>Lasts longer, more natual color.</li>
            <li>Have been using it for years now and love it</li>
            <li>And it is ammonia free!</li>
            <li>I thought the outcome would be just a smidge lighter, but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>and it was okay.</li>
            <li>which was good timing for a new application anyway.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on the hair and has beautiful and professional results.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s quick ten minutes, great color, no ammonia</li>
            <li>Nice color--leaves my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I have super curly hair.</li>
            <li>I know that is normally to be expected, but I don&#x27;t remember feeling that way when I used Nice &#x27;n&#x27; Easy.</li>
            <li>Once it was rinsed and dried my hair feels much more healthy, smooth and shiny -</li>
            <li>This product works for me as one of the more natural hair dyes.  </li>
            <li>I like this formulation much better than Natural Instincts since they changed their formulation.  </li>
            <li>I have used Nice &#x27;n&#x27; Easy in the past.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle.</li>
            <li>leaving out a star because I find when I first shake the bottle and start to apply it on my scalp the hair tends to not be even.</li>
            <li>this is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I also purchased two boxes, but one was more than enough.</li>
            <li>My sister applied it pretty quickly and I left it on for the full 10 minutes and rinsed it in the shower.</li>
            <li>Love it, really covers grays and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find in stores, so I&#x27;m glad to see it&#x27;s available online.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t budged much with 15 washes - including dish detergent.  </li>
            <li>I really like the fact that it covers the gray but doesn&#x27;t dye your whole head that color, and there isn&#x27;t a distinctive line as it grows out.  </li>
            <li>Recommend this to someone who wants gray coverage and not be bothered by the ammonia.</li>
            <li>so it makes hair extremely shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I should have purchased more months ago when it was half off.</li>
            <li>It covered my old hair color very well and didn&#x27;t damage my hair at all.</li>
            <li>It covers gray well, and best of all, I don&#x27;t have the ugly roots that I have with permanent color.</li>
            <li>However, I did not want to do a permanent color or use heavy chemicals (ammonia) on my hair because I want it to remain healthy.</li>
            <li>I also think it gives a natural look.  </li>
            <li>The color I am getting is darker than my natural one</li>
            <li>My head is fairly sensitive and this did not bother me at all.  </li>
            <li>I left the conditioner on for about 5 minutes and it really does nourish your hair.</li>
            <li>the first strand will be completely developed while the  last one would need another 10 minutes to develop and eventually all your hair will be different color.  </li>
            <li>This color is very pretty, and if you have very dark but not black hair, give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I just wanted to color my hair to look as natural as possible, nothing frilly</li>
            <li>I typically have to recolor about every 3 1/2 weeks because my hair grows very fast, not becquse it washes out.  </li>
            <li>I have had no hair damage using this product and have been growing my hair out for a good year and half and have managed to get it from a shoulder length to half way down my back wavy!</li>
            <li>The color was almost black the first day.  </li>
            <li>Now it looks uneven and patchy, even though I applied a protein filler first.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> No ammonia means little or no skin irritation for my very sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li> Pros:Easy to use, takes only 10 minutes, covers grey, does not break hair&lt;br</li>
            <li> : Does not last as long as advertised</li>
            <li> And when it fades, it fades naturally and blends without making a streaky mess.</li>
            <li> If you leave it on too long it will tend to look redder.  </li>
            <li> The other brands actually fade with each wash.  </li>
            <li> That was my only other pet peeve.</li>
            <li> Your scalp does not burn like other products and the color is very long lasting.  </li>
            <li> I like that this product is not rough on your hair and doesn&#x27;t damage it with harsh chemicals because it is a temporary color.</li>
            <li> I am writing only because I saw the previous review.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I hate the amazon word requirement, but love this product!</li>
            <li> The shade turned out almost black in some places, and a dark brown in others - it is definitely darker than the box.</li>
            <li> wash my hair every other day and apply this haircolor every 30-40 days.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;m not married to either brand.</li>
            <li> Way too dark.  </li>
            <li> If I keep it for 20min, than I blame myself because my hair comes out quite dark and not natural.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Who can cover all your hair for less than 10 minutes?</li>
            <li> My hair feels slightly drier than it did before I colored.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that it is no longer available in retail outlets.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, I have hair that is somewhat thick, but only a few inches below my shoulder - and I ran out of the dye 3/4 of the way through the process!</li>
            <li> this dye dried my hair out and even caused breakage.</li>
            <li> But now I just shake the dye in the bottle, wait a few minutes for it to all mix then apply it.</li>
            <li> -- there are so few nonpermanent options anymore.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally a dark shade of dirty blonde with lots of highlights.</li>
            <li> Well, I have to say there is hardly any smell</li>
            <li> It is disappointing that it was not enough.</li>
            <li> This product will not wash out of your hair, at least not mine after forty washings.  </li>
            <li> My hair is colored now, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about that for at least another month or so...</li>
            <li> Covers the grey completely and doesn&#x27;t have that awful smell.  </li>
            <li> It is hard or impossible to find in local stores in my neighborhood</li>
            <li> I absolutely am obsessed with this hair dye.</li>
            <li> Too bad they discontinued this product!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Fabulous product--I am always getting compliments!  Thank you for the prompt delivery also!</li>
            <li> very satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> Great product.  Disappointed that it is no longer available in retail outlets.</li>
            <li> Love Garnier Herbashine hair color.  Covers the grey completely and doesn&#x27;t have that awful smell.  Very easy and pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> This product works for me as one of the more natural hair dyes.  It is hard or impossible to find in local stores in my neighborhood so I am glad to be able to purchase it on line.</li>
            <li> It covered my old hair color very well and didn&#x27;t damage my hair at all. It didn&#x27;t start fading away until a month later which was good timing for a new application anyway. It smells great for days too.</li>
            <li> The color is the shade I have been looking for. The conditioner smells good! Too bad they discontinued this product!</li>
            <li> Who can cover all your hair for less than 10 minutes? And even if you can, when you finish covering,I st the first strand will be completely developed while the  last one would need another 10 minutes to develop and eventually all your hair will be different color.  I wish I though about it before buying.&lt;br /&gt;Since I bought 3  boxes I still use this haircolor between visits to my hair stylist just to freshen up the front strands where the gray shows most.  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> It has no ammonia so it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> this dye dried my hair out and even caused breakage. It has my hair feeling yucky. I do not recommend. I have super curly hair. Even after messing up my hair I don&#x27;t even see the color! Uh!</li>
            <li> Fabulous product!!!  Why has it been discontinued???</li>
            <li> This is very easy to use.  You can do it in 15 minutes.  It is very gentle. Your scalp does not burn like other products and the color is very long lasting.  I can go 3 months on one coloring but it fades nicely so no lines when your hair grows out, then you just do it again.  I have no idea why it is not on CVS and Walgreens shelves anymore.  Great for someone who has never colored their hair before.  so easy!</li>
            <li> I was so upset when I could no longer find Herbashine in my local stores. This is my favorite temporary haircolor. I can&#x27;t imagine why they took it off the shelves. I was thrilled to be able to find it on Amazon. This isn&#x27;t my favorite color, but it&#x27;s close. It lasts well. It covers gray well, and best of all, I don&#x27;t have the ugly roots that I have with permanent color.</li>
            <li> Well, I have to say there is hardly any smell and it did not bother my skin or eyes at all. Meanwhile, I have hair that is somewhat thick, but only a few inches below my shoulder - and I ran out of the dye 3/4 of the way through the process! Now it looks uneven and patchy, even though I applied a protein filler first. It is disappointing that it was not enough. The shade turned out almost black in some places, and a dark brown in others - it is definitely darker than the box. Once it was rinsed and dried my hair feels much more healthy, smooth and shiny - so that is a plus.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Terrific color. Only leave in for 10-15 minutes. Doesn&#x27;t burn my scalp.  LOVE that it&#x27;s made from bamboo, a sustainable, non-toxic ingredient.</li>
            <li> Nice color--leaves my hair soft and shiny.  I like this formulation much better than Natural Instincts since they changed their formulation.  Lasts longer, more natual color.</li>
            <li> Good colors, great shine and durable non-amonia product.</li>
            <li> Great product. It&#x27;s gentle on the hair and has beautiful and professional results.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m leaving out a star because I find when I first shake the bottle and start to apply it on my scalp the hair tends to not be even. But now I just shake the dye in the bottle, wait a few minutes for it to all mix then apply it.</li>
            <li> I tend to like this product because the color stays with you for 4-5 wks and this is a plus!</li>
            <li> Have been using it for years now and love it</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s ammonia-free.  I also think it gives a natural look.  It&#x27;s a shame that Garnier discontinued this line.</li>
            <li> Love it, really covers grays and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The color was almost black the first day.  Way too dark.  It hasn&#x27;t budged much with 15 washes - including dish detergent.  Will never use this brand again.  The other brands actually fade with each wash.  This does not.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect brown color, and it&#x27;s so easy to use. It&#x27;s hard to find in stores, so I&#x27;m glad to see it&#x27;s available online. I should have purchased more months ago when it was half off.</li>
            <li> Pros:Easy to use, takes only 10 minutes, covers grey, does not break hair&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Does not last as long as advertised</li>

The color I am getting is darker than my natural one but I like it. If I keep it for 20min, than I blame myself because my hair comes out quite dark and not natural.&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair every other day and apply this haircolor every 30-40 days.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about three years.  It contains no ammonia so it makes hair extremely shiny and healthy.  I really like the fact that it covers the gray but doesn&#x27;t dye your whole head that color, and there isn&#x27;t a distinctive line as it grows out.  If you leave it on too long it will tend to look redder.  I wish Garnier hadn&#x27;t discontinued this line -- there are so few nonpermanent options anymore. This color is very pretty, and if you have very dark but not black hair, give it a try.  I typically have to recolor about every 3 1/2 weeks because my hair grows very fast, not becquse it washes out.  People often say they can&#x27;t tell I dye it at all.</li>
            <li> this is exactly what I wanted. It covers my grays and washes out after 28 shampoos. I am a hair color commitment phobe so this is perfect for me, it leaves my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I bought it because of it having no ammonia in it.  My head is fairly sensitive and this did not bother me at all.  Recommend this to someone who wants gray coverage and not be bothered by the ammonia.</li>
            <li> This product will not wash out of your hair, at least not mine after forty washings.  I used Dawn mixed with powdered vitamin C, etc. nothing worked.</li>
            <li> Great seller, wonderful product, Thank you</li>
            <li> I absolutely am obsessed with this hair dye. Although, I do not think that they make the HerbaShine line as a part of garnier anymore. That&#x27;s why I started buying from amazon. This color is so perfect too. It has the bamboo extracts that are good for the hair that I like. And it is ammonia free! I like that this product is not rough on your hair and doesn&#x27;t damage it with harsh chemicals because it is a temporary color. However, this is the longest lasting temp dye I have ever purchased before. And when it fades, it fades naturally and blends without making a streaky mess. I have had no hair damage using this product and have been growing my hair out for a good year and half and have managed to get it from a shoulder length to half way down my back wavy!</li>
            <li> Works well, it&#x27;s quick ten minutes, great color, no ammonia</li>
            <li> I had virgin hair before I used this product. My hair is naturally a dark shade of dirty blonde with lots of highlights. I loved my color but I wanted a change. However, I did not want to do a permanent color or use heavy chemicals (ammonia) on my hair because I want it to remain healthy. I thought that this would be perfect... and it was! My hair is not damaged at all. My sister applied it pretty quickly and I left it on for the full 10 minutes and rinsed it in the shower. I left the conditioner on for about 5 minutes and it really does nourish your hair. It&#x27;s softer than I thought it would be. I the color has a lot of dimension on my hair because I had highlights to begin with. I&#x27;m probably going to stock up on this color while it&#x27;s on sale!</li>
            <li> I thought the outcome would be just a smidge lighter, but it&#x27;s okay. It did what I wanted it to do. I just wanted to update my color. I also purchased two boxes, but one was more than enough. I like that it really only took 10 minutes. I have used Nice &#x27;n&#x27; Easy in the past. I thought because this had no ammonia that my hair would come out softer than it did. I even double conditioned after I colored. That was my only other pet peeve. My hair feels slightly drier than it did before I colored. I know that is normally to be expected, but I don&#x27;t remember feeling that way when I used Nice &#x27;n&#x27; Easy. Anyway, I&#x27;m not married to either brand. I just wanted to color my hair to look as natural as possible, nothing frilly and it was okay. My hair is colored now, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about that for at least another month or so...</li>
            <li> No ammonia means little or no skin irritation for my very sensitive skin!  I hate the amazon word requirement, but love this product!</li>
