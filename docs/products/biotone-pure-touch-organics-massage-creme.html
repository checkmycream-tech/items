            <li>This is a great massage cream.  </li>
            <li>Great ingredients, good value considering it is organic, hypo-allergenic.  </li>

            <li>No scent so good for those who have allergies.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve bounced from one product to another trying to find the one that I&#x27;d fall in love with, and this is it!</li>

            <li>I love the fact that it is all organic, so I know it is actually good for my clients&#x27; skin, too.</li>
            <li>The Biotone website says it&#x27;s not pumpable but a good jar pump works just fine.</li>
            <li>Best massage cream that I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>It is also unscented, allowing me to personalize my clients experience with aromatherapy oils myself and perfect for the sensitive noses and skins of expecting mothers.</li>
            <li>Awesome product - been using this product for years - so far, no one has had allergic response, it is not greasy, does not stain.  </li>
            <li>but it is the absolute best for all modalities and best for male clients with substantial body hair.</li>
            <li>I received my product in super fast time with great shipping cost!</li>
            <li>I love all Biotone products.   </li>

            <li>I massage my body with this product and i love it.</li>
            <li>Love this, slides in and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>and I am able to work the muscles with ease.</li>
            <li>Love the glide and feel.</li>
            <li>Great glide and also good for deep tissue.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>My clients love it too.</li>
            <li>My clients love the non greasy feel of the creme</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I feel confident using this product, there is no guessing.</li>
            <li>I am really glad they came out with the organic unscented blend.</li>
            <li>I use this product for massage, having tried many others.</li>
            <li>It is an excellent moisturizing body cream and allows for the perfect amount of glide and access to deep pressure without slipping.</li>
            <li>and I love the fact it is unscented and good for sensitive skin (like my own).</li>
            <li>New to this product, very nice</li>
            <li>Overall the cream is very good.</li>
            <li>love how smooth it is.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other Biotone creams and I think I like this one the best.</li>
            <li>My speciality is sports massage and deep tissue and the creme has a good consistency for great glide and friction, depending on how much you use.</li>
            <li>I think I will go through it much more quickly because of it.  </li>
            <li>My clients never have any problems with it and the creme is great for light to deep tissue massage!</li>
            <li>fantastic for massages.</li>
            <li>The Biotone organics creme is a great product that provides the glide and friction required by deep tissue massage work.</li>
            <li>I just wish the Gel Gallon was available on amazon because it would allow me to apply it on my body faster as opposed to the heaviness of the Creme.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and I use it in my practice daily.</li>
            <li>Great for swedish and deep tissue!</li>
            <li>It is a good heavy creme with good grip and glide.  </li>
            <li>best massage cream around shipping slow</li>
            <li>good for deep tissue</li>
            <li>But this one actually heals my hands, and it makes it stay nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Certainly a worthy product.</li>
            <li>though this does not replace it exactly - different glide - I will be able to use it in many situations.</li>
            <li>It is pure to the touch, glides on easily, and lasts during massage.</li>
            <li>This cream does not mix well with essential oils like I would have liked.</li>
            <li>It is a rare find.</li>
            <li>It spreads nicely and you do not have to cake it on the client to get a proper glide.</li>
            <li>useful tool and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>they delivered it very fast.</li>
            <li>First person used this cream also got rush on his skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product not only for its application but Aldo for the safety of no parabins.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for convenience and value!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long lasting, refillable, and is great for your skin.</li>
            <li>You can never know what allergies the client has if it&#x27;s the first appointment.  </li>
            <li>It is one of the more pure and organic of their line, the most expensive but worth it to me.</li>
            <li>being fragrance free a big plus.</li>
            <li>The consistency of the cream is much thinner and not what I am use to.  </li>
            <li>I like the organics formula and my clients have commented they really like it too.</li>
            <li>Products always arrive super fast and quality generally exceeds my expectations!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly rich with a lasting glide.</li>
            <li>The creams are not too greasy and do really well here in the desert of New Mexico!</li>
            <li>This one is thick enough to not ooze out on it&#x27;s own, but it easy to fill.</li>
            <li>I am a practicing LMT for over two years and after using several different lotions, oils and cremes, I prefer Biotone Pure touch Organics the most.</li>
            <li>I have to use a lot more of it during massages than when I previously used FX.</li>
            <li>We always use different Biotone massage cream for more than ten years.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Have used this for years and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to smells and there is no issue with this, the tack is great and it gives me enough drag to glide but still work deep.  </li>
            <li>I actually love this for everyday moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Hardly scented at all, really moisturizing and my clients love it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much - ordered for use at Masterpiece Medical Massage in Albuquerque, NM</li>
            <li>Slippy at first but sinks in for a nice slow drag/deeper work.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more dense than the regular biotone massage cream.</li>
            <li>I prefer this cream to anyone who has sensitive skin, it works 100%.</li>
            <li>My hands are sensitive</li>
            <li>I have been using Biotone pure touch organics for a very long time and this gallon is not like the others.  </li>
            <li>It warms up quickly and isn&#x27;t messy or greasy.</li>
            <li>a little goes a long way; easily washes of my linens.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I replaced my duel-purpose creme with this in my practice and have no regrets!</li>
            <li>I love it, the very thick consistency is what I like.  </li>
            <li>This was a little cheaper than buying direct from Biotone and the product arrived very promptly.</li>
            <li>It is really thick going on, but is well absorbed!</li>
            <li>Unlike other massage lotions, this one doesn&#x27;t require a large amount to achieve proper lubrication for theraputic massage.  </li>
            <li>I use much less of this product than others during a massage, so it appears it will last much longer.</li>

            <li> like that it gets dry pretty fast when you fail to close the lid  </li>
            <li> I am not sure I will even finish this gallon before I replace it with the Muscle and Joint creme I normally use.</li>
            <li> My personal massage therapist uses this product on me and other clients.</li>
            <li> Goes a long way due to the thickness of the creme.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It covers &amp;#34;furry&amp;#34; skin quite well and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have been using biotone for the past two years and do mostly deep tissue and have NO complaints from my clients.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like to use lotion because I felt it was too watered down</li>
            <li> Whatever cream I received it&#x27;s not original biotone organic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding I need to resupply the bottle often between just a few clients.</li>
            <li> and this one is too much trouble to work with.</li>
            <li> (overnight) and dried up</li>
            <li> It is less greasy then other lotions as well, which I really appreciate since I personally hate lotion.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product, and they recently made this paraban-free.</li>
            <li> The consistency or ingredients in the product seem to have changed from the past.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not too slick or too sticky--perfect.</li>
            <li> This is a very heavy and non-pumpable massage cream.  </li>
            <li> Product seems watery and not as thick as in the past</li>
            <li> It the way too thick for massage use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick so it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> This creme is too thick it has the consistency of lard.  </li>
            <li> Too thick.</li>
            <li> When it gets low it is almost impossible to squeeze out of the tube during a treatment.  </li>
            <li> I  seriously buy everything on amazon now.</li>
            <li> this is expensive stuff -</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Bad batch</li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> This is the worst we have.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 years and it is the best product. Slippy at first but sinks in for a nice slow drag/deeper work.  Hardly scented at all, really moisturizing and my clients love it.  GREAT STUFF.</li>
            <li> love how smooth it is. you do not need to use alot either. fantastic for massages.</li>
            <li> It the way too thick for massage use. First person used this cream also got rush on his skin. We always use different Biotone massage cream for more than ten years. This is the worst we have.</li>
            <li> best all around creme around.  use on all dry skin daily, especially, on hands, arms, feet, neck and face.  being fragrance free a big plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Biotone dual purpose for over 10 years and recently switched to the organic creme. Great stuff! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I actually love this for everyday moisturizing.  It has virtually no odor and doesn&#x27;t have alcohol in it either.  It is really thick going on, but is well absorbed!</li>
            <li> The Biotone organics creme is a great product that provides the glide and friction required by deep tissue massage work. The peace of mind that comes with an organic product is an extra benefit.</li>
            <li> It seems pricey to me but the product is great. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product, and they recently made this paraban-free.</li>
            <li> best massage cream around shipping slow</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.  Works well for our weekly massages.</li>
            <li> I am a massage therapist for 20 years.  I love all Biotone products.   The creams are not too greasy and do really well here in the desert of New Mexico!</li>
            <li> Whatever cream I received it&#x27;s not original biotone organic. Disappointed</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! So do my clients.  We all appreciate the organic, junk-free purity of it, as well as the non greasy feel.  It absorbs well and has good grab so your hands aren&#x27;t sliding off the area you are working.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Love this product! My clients never have any problems with it and the creme is great for light to deep tissue massage! I won&#x27;t use anything else now!</li>
            <li> I am a Licensed Massage Therapist and when it comes to massage this is the only cream I buy to use in my business.</li>
            <li> Best massage cream that I&#x27;ve found so far. It&#x27;s thick so it lasts longer. It&#x27;s organic so there&#x27;s almost no smell and clients/ patients never have allergic reactions to it.</li>
            <li> This cream does not mix well with essential oils like I would have liked. Overall the cream is very good.</li>
            <li> I love this product not only for its application but Aldo for the safety of no parabins.  Customers also approve.</li>
            <li> Unlike other massage lotions, this one doesn&#x27;t require a large amount to achieve proper lubrication for theraputic massage.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to separate in storage.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of the smell or the glide. A client commented on the smell as well. I have to use a lot more of it during massages than when I previously used FX. I will go back to using FX when I am through with the gallon of biotone.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much - ordered for use at Masterpiece Medical Massage in Albuquerque, NM</li>
            <li> they delivered it very fast. I LOVE my lotion. Great for giving massages. I have eczema and some lotions and creams I can not even use. But this one actually heals my hands, and it makes it stay nice and smooth. I prefer this cream to anyone who has sensitive skin, it works 100%.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It&#x27;s a little more dense than the regular biotone massage cream.</li>
            <li> This is a very heavy and non-pumpable massage cream.  I love it, the very thick consistency is what I like.  but beware sometimes the &#x27;consistency&#x27; is not what it is intended.  Bad batch I don&#x27;t know?  It is one of the more pure and organic of their line, the most expensive but worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Great ingredients, good value considering it is organic, hypo-allergenic.  It is a good heavy creme with good grip and glide.  Goes a long way due to the thickness of the creme.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The consistency or ingredients in the product seem to have changed from the past. Product seems watery and not as thick as in the past</li>
            <li> As a LMT with an autoimmune disorder and allergies to ALL nuts, tree nuts and peanuts this product is perfect. It is a rare find.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. It is nice. My hands are sensitive it didnt break me out at all...thnx for making this stuff</li>
            <li> I massage my body with this product and i love it.I just wish the Gel Gallon was available on amazon because it would allow me to apply it on my body faster as opposed to the heaviness of the Creme.Excellent product though.</li>
            <li> Love this, slides in and isn&#x27;t greasy. I use it in my practice and at home as an all over body lotion it&#x27;s so nice.</li>
            <li> This stuff is just the best there is. It&#x27;s hypo-allergenic which means the client won&#x27;t develop a rash. It&#x27;s non-greasy so it&#x27;s not too slick or too sticky--perfect. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue. It&#x27;s odor is neither fragrant nor medicinal.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It goes on well and I am able to work the muscles with ease. Never gets gummy, no scent, no nut oils, perfect for people with allergies. Prompt delivery</li>
            <li> My husband and I like this product (both of us are M.T.&#x27;s). It spreads nicely and you do not have to cake it on the client to get a proper glide. It is less greasy then other lotions as well, which I really appreciate since I personally hate lotion. Certainly a worthy product.</li>
            <li> Love this cream! It is so versatile and my clients love it! It warms up quickly and isn&#x27;t messy or greasy. I love the fact that it is all organic, so I know it is actually good for my clients&#x27; skin, too. It is also unscented, allowing me to personalize my clients experience with aromatherapy oils myself and perfect for the sensitive noses and skins of expecting mothers. Great product!</li>
            <li> I prefer using cremes in most cases and was happy to have found a product that is organic.  I&#x27;ve used Biotone Dual Purpose for years and though this does not replace it exactly - different glide - I will be able to use it in many situations.</li>
            <li> Love the glide and feel. However I have been experiencing difficulty getting it to come out of pump well.</li>
            <li> I have been using Biotone pure touch organics for a very long time and this gallon is not like the others.  The consistency of the cream is much thinner and not what I am use to.  I think I will go through it much more quickly because of it.  Did Biotone change their formula or could something have happened to this batch?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Biotone creams and I think I like this one the best. I buy refillable squeeze tubes, like used for camping and fill them w/my massage cream. This one is thick enough to not ooze out on it&#x27;s own, but it easy to fill. I like the organics formula and my clients have commented they really like it too.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I haven&#x27;t found anything as good as this cream!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful creme to use on my skin - great moisture and less greasy - very good price</li>
            <li> This creme is too thick it has the consistency of lard.  This needs to be put into a squeeze container from Biotone which I have been using.  I&#x27;m finding I need to resupply the bottle often between just a few clients. When it gets low it is almost impossible to squeeze out of the tube during a treatment.  I have exclusively used Biotone products since 2004. I give around 20 massages a week and this one is too much trouble to work with. I am not sure I will even finish this gallon before I replace it with the Muscle and Joint creme I normally use.</li>
            <li> I  seriously buy everything on amazon now. Products always arrive super fast and quality generally exceeds my expectations! Thanks for convenience and value!</li>
            <li> I used to use Biotone Oil Gel for a while until my clients started complaining about the oil. I didn&#x27;t like to use lotion because I felt it was too watered down so I decided to try the cream. My clients are big on organic as well as I am so I tried this. I am glad I did! I love it! This is my second gallon from this seller and both times I received my product in super fast time with great shipping cost!</li>
            <li> Beeen using this in my practice for years.  Great glide and also good for deep tissue.  No scent so good for those who have allergies.  Organic makes it superior!</li>
            <li> New to this product, very nice</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I use it in my practice daily. It&#x27;s the perfect balance between lotion and oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bounced from one product to another trying to find the one that I&#x27;d fall in love with, and this is it! It&#x27;s incredibly rich with a lasting glide. It makes the skin feel extra moisturized and doesn&#x27;t leave people feeling greasy.  The Biotone website says it&#x27;s not pumpable but a good jar pump works just fine.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Use it every morning and every evening as a body moisturizer.  No greasy feel but does  its job</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and I highly recommend. Great glide, no fragrance.  My clients love it too.</li>
            <li> Too thick. I have had to mix this with thinner lotion to get a workable consistency. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Awesome product - been using this product for years - so far, no one has had allergic response, it is not greasy, does not stain.  It is an excellent moisturizing body cream and allows for the perfect amount of glide and access to deep pressure without slipping.</li>
            <li> I have been using biotone for the past two years and do mostly deep tissue and have NO complaints from my clients.  No plans to change!</li>
            <li> My personal massage therapist uses this product on me and other clients. It&#x27;s long lasting, refillable, and is great for your skin. I listen to my therapist, so I choose Biotone.</li>
            <li> I prefer using tube before pump. Reason? The hiolster belt does not twist over time when you use tube. Glides good, you don&#x27;t have to reach for it as often as woth lotion, although Lavender Therapeutic Lotion Biioton is as good as cream.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way; easily washes of my linens.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t like that it gets dry pretty fast when you fail to close the lid  (overnight) and dried up</li>
            <li> I am a practicing LMT for over two years and after using several different lotions, oils and cremes, I prefer Biotone Pure touch Organics the most. My clients love the non greasy feel of the creme and I love the fact it is unscented and good for sensitive skin (like my own). My speciality is sports massage and deep tissue and the creme has a good consistency for great glide and friction, depending on how much you use.</li>
            <li> this is expensive stuff - but it is the absolute best for all modalities and best for male clients with substantial body hair. useful tool and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have used like 10 different things in between using this and I had to come back. Great for swedish and deep tissue! This was a little cheaper than buying direct from Biotone and the product arrived very promptly.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever used.... good for deep tissue</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and am very happy with it.  It allows me to work deeply an specifically on the neck.</li>
            <li> You can never know what allergies the client has if it&#x27;s the first appointment.  I feel confident using this product, there is no guessing. It&#x27;s organic and my clients constantly ask what I  am using and if they can purchase it.</li>
            <li> The only massage cream I use.</li>
            <li> This is a great massage cream.  I am sensitive to smells and there is no issue with this, the tack is great and it gives me enough drag to glide but still work deep.  No complaints of skin sensitivity, either.</li>
            <li> I have been using biotone products since 1991. I am really glad they came out with the organic unscented blend. It covers &amp;#34;furry&amp;#34; skin quite well and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I replaced my duel-purpose creme with this in my practice and have no regrets! Great feel and allows me to have a good grip.</li>
            <li> I use this product for massage, having tried many others. It is pure to the touch, glides on easily, and lasts during massage. I use much less of this product than others during a massage, so it appears it will last much longer. The glide is wonderful. I am extremely impressed.</li>
