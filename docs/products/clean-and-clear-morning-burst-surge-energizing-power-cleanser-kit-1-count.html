            <li>I bought for myself and it does awesome for the price</li>
            <li>What a great buy for $10 including shipping and handling...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t  think that it would be any good</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good kit I would continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I liked this because it&#x27;s use and go, she isn&#x27;t messing with batteries, which she&#x27;s happy about too.</li>
            <li>feels good on my face</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchased this item!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love that fresh-tingle sensation on my face!</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>and I just can&#x27;t seem to find anything that works well for me without drying my skin out or making me have some kind of allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>perfectly working and new in package with pads and battery.</li>
            <li>The cleansing pads smell great and the power cleanser itself is very gentle on your skin</li>
            <li>Amazing to help my 2 sons learn easy face cleansing habits.</li>
            <li>nice size easy to hold does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not so sure it make me feel more awake.  </li>
            <li>and I just love it</li>
            <li>Love this product for myself even.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>since i was ordering the morning burst face cleanser ( i love that stuff)</li>
            <li>Has spawned purchase of more for and by others.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>When I tried it for the first time, I was excited about how great it smelled and also that you could adjust the speed.  </li>
            <li>it leaves a slight menthol tingle on your face and the smell is a wonderful tangerine smell.</li>
            <li>The guy who created this must have had a good laugh, and certainly doesn&#x27;t care about women&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>A great buy to introduce the habit of facial cleansing to a tween.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m unsure the reason they discontinued this, but if this was a reason, i see the light.</li>
            <li>I was considering purchasing the clarisonic and decided to purchase this product instead since it was significantly cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I use the higher speed around the more oily areas.  </li>
            <li>Honestly I don&#x27;t think this product does anything more than a regular face wash would do.</li>
            <li>but when I tried it it made my face feel super clean.</li>
            <li>I wanted to find something somewhat similar that would be good to travel with, so I purchased this.  </li>
            <li>and you definitely have that nice clean feeling after using it.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I have VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Let me first say that I love Clean &amp; Clear washes etc.  </li>
            <li>When I bought this, I thought I was getting some kind of facial scrub brush.</li>
            <li>this is why I love using clan &amp; clear products</li>
            <li>My face was extremely smooth after using the Clean &amp; Clear power cleaner.</li>
            <li>came right on time and is cheaper than buying in the stores, it works well.</li>
            <li>This really wakes you up and makes you feel clean.</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s an ok alternative to a regular face wash.</li>
            <li>I love Clean and Clear facial items</li>
            <li>I knew immediately she had used it on her own, when she came down stairs fresh faced and near sparkling!</li>
            <li>Although I like the design - compact and easy to hold - the actual utility amounts to about zero.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that the Clean &amp; Clear has 14 disposable cleaning pads (purchased 3 boxes of 30 from a close out store), gentle vibrating action only, and comes with 1 AA battery to start immediate use.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so super soft after using it and it really helps me to wake up and keeps me energized throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I  really recommend this thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This device just vibrates, so it doesn&#x27;t accomplish much.</li>
            <li>I was very hopeful that this would work for me, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The power behind the scrub is great and it does make my skin feel smoother.</li>
            <li>It comes with a package of circular pads that have a foaming cleaner you wet to activate and use to wash your face while being able to add vibration from 2 speeds.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and cleaned my face well.</li>
            <li>I must admit her skin looks much cleaner and fresh since using this clean and clear facial apparatus.</li>
            <li>That said, it is perfect for my 10 year old&#x27;s young sensitive skin, and cheap enough that I don&#x27;t have to worry as much about it getting broken.</li>
            <li>I tried this product just for the simple fact that I wanted a super gentle exfoliator.  </li>
            <li>This has soft cottony replacement pads and vibrates pretty softly while the Clarisonic obviously has a brush and oscillates very quickly.</li>
            <li>Such an amazing product!!my skin has defenitaley changed for the better,this closed up</li>
            <li>The fact that the pads are disposable is also good for someone with active acne, since with a reusable brush you&#x27;d have to be very careful to clean it well or risk spreading bacteria from one wash to the next, while with this you just toss the pad each time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that would &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; a little more than my Olay towels.</li>
            <li>It really makes your skin feel soft afterwards</li>
            <li>This is nothing more than a buzzing piece o plastic onto which you put the round overly soaped cleanser pad.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item and was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked!</li>
            <li>I use the power cleaner only at night to deep clean the make up off my face.  </li>
            <li>the little cleanser was nice to have 2 different speeds but you can only use the cleaning pads that came with it.</li>
            <li>I am not a big fan of the scrub pads though, the pads are smooth and I guess I was expected some exfoliating pads with ridges.</li>
            <li>I by no means have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My face is so soft from only two days of use and my pores are visibly smaller.  </li>
            <li>My 10 year old daughter has started to get some blackheads and minor pimples</li>

            <li> I was considering purchasing the clarisonic and decided to purchase this product instead since it was significantly cheaper.  My face is so soft from only two days of use and my pores are visibly smaller.  Absolutely love this product and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product. I needed something to exfoliate with and all this does is vibrate. The entire thing is awkwardly shaped and it&#x27;s really difficult to get the crevices of your face. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I tried this product just for the simple fact that I wanted a super gentle exfoliator.  When I tried it for the first time, I was excited about how great it smelled and also that you could adjust the speed.  I use the higher speed around the more oily areas.  It really makes your skin feel soft afterwards but I&#x27;m not so sure it make me feel more awake.  I would definitely recommend as a cheaper alternative of similar more expensive products.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I have VERY sensitive skin and I just can&#x27;t seem to find anything that works well for me without drying my skin out or making me have some kind of allergic reaction. I purchased this item and was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked! The cleansing pads smell great and the power cleanser itself is very gentle on your skin and you definitely have that nice clean feeling after using it. I think I&#x27;ve finally found a skin cleanser I can stick with! My skin didn&#x27;t dry out and I didn&#x27;t have an allergic reaction! I am so glad I purchased this item!</li>
            <li> This really wakes you up and makes you feel clean. I  really recommend this thing.&lt;br /&gt;so it does not irritate your skin and I just love it</li>
            <li> I see this device has been reintroduced in all the drugstores. When I ordered it I thought it had been discontinued. This device just vibrates, so it doesn&#x27;t accomplish much.</li>
            <li> Love it! I bought for myself and it does awesome for the price so bought another one for my sister too!</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful that this would work for me, but it didn&#x27;t. I have hormonal break outs and this didn&#x27;t help at all. the little cleanser was nice to have 2 different speeds but you can only use the cleaning pads that came with it.</li>
            <li> I must admit her skin looks much cleaner and fresh since using this clean and clear facial apparatus. I placed it on her bathroom counter and was going to explain it to her. She beat me to it and figured it out. I knew immediately she had used it on her own, when she came down stairs fresh faced and near sparkling! A great buy to introduce the habit of facial cleansing to a tween.</li>
            <li> Just what i wanted. perfectly working and new in package with pads and battery. was only expecting it to be bigger</li>
            <li> My 10 year old daughter has started to get some blackheads and minor pimples and I bought this for her. I have a Clarisonic Mia and I can tell any of you looking for an equivalent to it that this is NOT it. It doesn&#x27;t work nearly same nor does it work the same way. This has soft cottony replacement pads and vibrates pretty softly while the Clarisonic obviously has a brush and oscillates very quickly.That said, it is perfect for my 10 year old&#x27;s young sensitive skin, and cheap enough that I don&#x27;t have to worry as much about it getting broken. I also feel like having something &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; to use to wash her face will help to remind her to wash it. The fact that the pads are disposable is also good for someone with active acne, since with a reusable brush you&#x27;d have to be very careful to clean it well or risk spreading bacteria from one wash to the next, while with this you just toss the pad each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have heard that these have been discontinued and I haven&#x27;t seen them anywhere else for a while, but for the time being the replacement pads are still being sold on Amazon. A friend did tell me that the pads for the Neutragena Wave were interchangeable with these, but I haven&#x27;t tried it myself yet.</li>
            <li> When I bought this, I thought I was getting some kind of facial scrub brush. Au Contrair! This is nothing more than a buzzing piece o plastic onto which you put the round overly soaped cleanser pad. There is no brush; there is no movement. The guy who created this must have had a good laugh, and certainly doesn&#x27;t care about women&#x27;s skin. THREW IT AWAY!</li>
            <li> If I could give it no stars I would I received the product and I will admit in a surprisingly short amount of time but when I opened the pachale I was digusted I had to throw away the product because the batteries in the package wel old to the point they had built up some white type of powder around them that managed to get all over the place and plus the pads were all completely dry !!! Do not but save your money !!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; a little more than my Olay towels. This BURNED! Whew did it burn. I by no means have sensitive skin but dang! I&#x27;m unsure the reason they discontinued this, but if this was a reason, i see the light. My skin is read an blotchy now...i hope it goes away soon.</li>
            <li> Amazing to help my 2 sons learn easy face cleansing habits. Love this product for myself even.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t  think that it would be any good but when I tried it it made my face feel super clean. :) this is why I love using clan &amp; clear products</li>
            <li> i seen the morning burst surge cleanser being advertised on tv. i wanted to try it out. since i was ordering the morning burst face cleanser ( i love that stuff), i thought that i should give this a try. when i used it, i noticed that it wasn&#x27;t as bubbly as they advertised on tv. although im a little disappointed, its still good to use. i just take some of the face cleanser and put it on the energizing cleanser i don&#x27;t have to waste anymore sugar and olive oil making an exfoliater.</li>
            <li> I tried the Olay brush but after a week the bristles started to irritate my skin. The Olay brush has a rotating head which proved not only to irritate my skin, but to spread my acne. I don&#x27;t think it is sanitary to use the same brush daily on acne prone skin even though I sprayed the Olay brush bristles with alcohol daily. I love the fact that the Clean &amp; Clear has 14 disposable cleaning pads (purchased 3 boxes of 30 from a close out store), gentle vibrating action only, and comes with 1 AA battery to start immediate use. My face was extremely smooth after using the Clean &amp; Clear power cleaner. It removed the dry patches on my cheeks and the flakes around my eyebrows, and my pimples looked smaller the next day. The solution that is on the pads once it does start to foam it leaves a slight menthol tingle on your face and the smell is a wonderful tangerine smell. Love that fresh-tingle sensation on my face! I use the power cleaner only at night to deep clean the make up off my face.  What a great buy for $10 including shipping and handling...so sad this product is discontinued in stores!&lt;br /&gt;*Would never spend the money for the Clariasonic Mia, but I wonder how the Clariasonic Mia&#x27;s vibration/cleaning power compares to this one?</li>
            <li> I love Clean and Clear facial items and I decided to give the energizing cleanser kit a try. The power behind the scrub is great and it does make my skin feel smoother. I am not a big fan of the scrub pads though, the pads are smooth and I guess I was expected some exfoliating pads with ridges. All in all it&#x27;s a good kit I would continue to use it.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this.  I have gotten her cleansing kits in the past, and she&#x27;s not good at using them.  I liked this because it&#x27;s use and go, she isn&#x27;t messing with batteries, which she&#x27;s happy about too.</li>
            <li> Such an amazing product!!my skin has defenitaley changed for the better,this closed up my pores reduced the amount of breakouts and kept my skin from getting oily plus it comes with like 20 refill pads so this will defentialy last quite a while!!!</li>
            <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t think this product does anything more than a regular face wash would do. It comes with a package of circular pads that have a foaming cleaner you wet to activate and use to wash your face while being able to add vibration from 2 speeds. After using it for a little while I didn&#x27;t notice any change. For the price it&#x27;s an ok alternative to a regular face wash.</li>
            <li> Was a gift. Has spawned purchase of more for and by others. nice size easy to hold does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My skin feels so super soft after using it and it really helps me to wake up and keeps me energized throughout the day.</li>
            <li> came right on time and is cheaper than buying in the stores, it works well. don&#x27;t forget to buy refills if you plan on using it alot.</li>
            <li> Bought this product to help reduce the swelling on my chin after surgery. Very soothing and cleaned my face well.</li>
            <li> Let me first say that I love Clean &amp; Clear washes etc.  This review is specifically geared to the Morning Burst device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Mom just gave me a Clarisonic for Christmas and I love it!  I wanted to find something somewhat similar that would be good to travel with, so I purchased this.  Unless you&#x27;re giving a gift to a pre-teen who wants to wash her face like Mommy with her Clarisonic, this is a waste of money.  Although I like the design - compact and easy to hold - the actual utility amounts to about zero.  It vibrated my hand, but the vibrations weren&#x27;t actually between the pad and my skin.  If the cleaning pad were attached in a different way to allow the pad to move instead of being stationary on the device,  it might work.  As is, there&#x27;s no point.</li>
            <li> feels good on my face</li>
