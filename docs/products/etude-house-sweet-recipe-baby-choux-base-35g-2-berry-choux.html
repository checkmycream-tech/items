    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It does a wonderful job of brightening my skin before makeup application.</li>
            <li>This is wonderful in the winter for under your BB cream.</li>
            <li>Great Product!</li>
            <li>scent is freakin&#x27; awesome.</li>
            <li>Delicious aroma and non-heavy feeling in the skin.</li>
            <li>The quality is amazing!</li>
            <li>I can use a bb cream with light coverage afterwards and it would look perfect.</li>
            <li>Combined with a good BB cream  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased! :)</li>
            <li>(my favorite is Holika Holika Moisture), this creates a perfect smooth look.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the scent of this product!</li>
            <li>I think this product does what it says and more!</li>
            <li>It smells good and the packaging is cute.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I do love it and will purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I personally like this berry choux the best.</li>
            <li>I love this tube packaging as well.</li>
            <li>I chose five star for this item because I received a trial size and wasnt entirely sure how to use it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s in really cute packaging</li>
            <li>This is my favorite thing to wear alone or underneath bb cream.:)</li>
            <li>+there&#x27;s sbf 20 in it.:)</li>
            <li>This blends in with my skin very well and smells very nice</li>
            <li>so I was very excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>Honestly, my skin looks so good after just applying this product that I sometimes forget I have more steps left in the morning!</li>
            <li>Smells great, the tone is extremely light, but blends in nice after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>but I genuinely don&#x27;t know anybody who would enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The texture&#x27;s whipped and creamy; it applies really smoothly and feels weightless on, not greasy at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also it is travel friendly.</li>
            <li>Beautiful pink color that makes the skin looks brighter and clearer.</li>
            <li>I got super sun burned before I received it</li>
            <li>and my cheeks are prone to mild eczema</li>
            <li>It is not thick and I can pat it easily across my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d imagine this would be more suited for perking up light and medium skin tones and possibly neutralizing yellow undertones as it made me more cool-toned</li>
            <li>Really hides discolorations super well.</li>
            <li>If your skin is naturally pale pink it will give it the most beautiful porcelain glow.</li>
            <li>Overall, I could not be more excited about this new find.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and gives me a definite healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>It actually makes your pores more visible.</li>
            <li>It enhances white skin color giving it a healthy look.</li>
            <li>If you have fairly pale skin with cool undertones, this is an amazing primer.</li>
            <li>highlights, brightens, makes you look younger,, improves texture, makes make up go over much smoother - does need a light moisturizer underneath.</li>
            <li>However, when I put the product on my skin it had a fabulous glow and looked physically different.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for NC-15, NC-10, NW-15, NW-10 and lighter!</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s the real reason I keep using it.</li>
            <li>For those who like to look pale but not overly made up or dead this is perfect.</li>
            <li>The other two choux came in jars and I would use the spoon it came with to pick up the appropriate amount.</li>
            <li>This works very well as a primer...if you have normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It does go away after a short amount of time and leaves your skin looking fresh.</li>
            <li>If your skin is pale but lifeless or with a sallow tone it will liven up your complexion in a glowing and healthy way.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s really the only thing I like.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m super pale in the winter and olive in the summer.</li>
            <li>and when I tried it for the first time afterwards it toned down the red in my face rather than making it look darker as with store bough beige.</li>
            <li>I have pale skin with very light rosy cheeks and this base gives me radiant healthy looking skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I absolutely love the scent of this product! I have been using it for several weeks, now. It does a wonderful job of brightening my skin before makeup application. I always wait about 10 minutes after applying this base before putting on my BB cream, so I can&#x27;t say how well it would work otherwise. Honestly, my skin looks so good after just applying this product that I sometimes forget I have more steps left in the morning! Be sure your skin is well-exfoliated and moisturized if you plan on using this base, because it will highlight any dry skin on your face. Overall, I could not be more excited about this new find. I plan on trying out the Mint Choux base next.</li>
            <li> The quality is amazing! Perfect for my sensitive skin! I was looking for a foundation or base and this is more like a tinted sunscreen. I do love it and will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding the right foundation for my skin tone. I&#x27;m German and Turkish so I&#x27;m super pale in the winter and olive in the summer. So store brand beige is just not for me. Covers my troubled spots with a thin  natural light pinkish tone rather than a heavy brown tone that doesn&#x27;t match at all. I got super sun burned before I received it and when I tried it for the first time afterwards it toned down the red in my face rather than making it look darker as with store bough beige. Plus it has sun screen in it.</li>
            <li> I have all three of the Etude House Sweet Recipe Baby Choux Base. I personally like this berry choux the best. I have pale skin with very light rosy cheeks and this base gives me radiant healthy looking skin. I can use a bb cream with light coverage afterwards and it would look perfect. The peach choux gives me an overall brighten look but makes my naturally pink cheeks disappear while the mint choux makes me look ghostly so I can only use it on red areas. I normally apply the mint choux after the berry or peach choux if I have trouble areas I need to cover up. I love this tube packaging as well. The other two choux came in jars and I would use the spoon it came with to pick up the appropriate amount. With the tube, I can just squeeze the product out, without cleaning the spoon afterwards. Also it is travel friendly.</li>
            <li> I chose five star for this item because I received a trial size and wasnt entirely sure how to use it.  However, when I put the product on my skin it had a fabulous glow and looked physically different.  I immediately ordered the larger size and loooooove this.  Delivery came within 2 days and was well packaged.  I can use this as a base on its own or just use under the Etude BB Cream.  It lasts all day and gives me a definite healthy glow.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff thinking that it would cancel out some of the blue undertones in my skin and give me an overall glowy look and it doesn&#x27;t. It has a very strange consistency and there are little tiny rough . . balls or  undisolved powder or something in it that makes it look really really bad on the skin. It&#x27;s in really cute packaging but that&#x27;s really the only thing I like. I&#x27;m really disappointed. Would not repurchase or recommend to anyone. I never right bad reviews but I genuinely don&#x27;t know anybody who would enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful in the winter for under your BB cream. If your skin is naturally pale pink it will give it the most beautiful porcelain glow. If your skin is pale but lifeless or with a sallow tone it will liven up your complexion in a glowing and healthy way. For those who like to look pale but not overly made up or dead this is perfect. I highly recommend it for NC-15, NC-10, NW-15, NW-10 and lighter!</li>
            <li> highlights, brightens, makes you look younger,, improves texture, makes make up go over much smoother - does need a light moisturizer underneath.</li>
            <li> This was something I was so looking forward to trying based on all kinds of reviews. I finally got it, and I am not happy at all. It actually makes your pores more visible.</li>
            <li> Loves how it feels on my face and doesn&#x27;t make my face feel dry!!! This is  a must buy. It smells good and the packaging is cute.</li>
            <li> Smells great, the tone is extremely light, but blends in nice after a few minutes. My only issue is it feels...like there&#x27;s tiny chunks in it...I have no idea what is going on with that. I doubt I&#x27;ll be buying this again for a while, but I don&#x27;t 100% regret trying it out.</li>
            <li> I have porcelain white skin so I was very excited to try this product. Immediately upon application it leaves my skin softer and brighter. I have moderate acne and had heard other people complain that it worsened the appearance of acne marks but I disagree. It lightened the appearance of my acne and made my skin look healthier. Upon removing it, I even noticed that my skin was softer and my makeup had irritated my skin much less than usual. I think this product does what it says and more! I am very pleased! :)</li>
            <li> Great Product! I expected more coverage like a base or foundation. I use it as a tinted moisturizer and will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This works very well as a primer...if you have normal to oily skin. I have dry skin and my cheeks are prone to mild eczema so unfortunately any tiny patch of dryness gets magnified when I apply it (and I&#x27;m using only a bit). When I put BB cream on after this, those dry patches were further exacerbated.&lt;br /&gt;The texture&#x27;s whipped and creamy; it applies really smoothly and feels weightless on, not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m truly pale, as in paler than NW10 in MAC foundation and this, even when used sparingly gives my face an even whiter cast instead of &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34;. However, If you&#x27;re going for a china doll effect, berry choux can help you achieve that. I&#x27;d imagine this would be more suited for perking up light and medium skin tones and possibly neutralizing yellow undertones as it made me more cool-toned than I already was.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also useful on the undereye area for subtle coverage of dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is freakin&#x27; awesome. Like the Strawberry Shortcake dolls I had as a kid and that&#x27;s the real reason I keep using it. That, and the SPF 25 are enough for me to eventually finish the tube.</li>
            <li> Beautiful pink color that makes the skin looks brighter and clearer. It enhances white skin color giving it a healthy look. Delicious aroma and non-heavy feeling in the skin.</li>
            <li> If you have fairly pale skin with cool undertones, this is an amazing primer. Really hides discolorations super well. Combined with a good BB cream  (my favorite is Holika Holika Moisture), this creates a perfect smooth look.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite thing to wear alone or underneath bb cream.:) This blends in with my skin very well and smells very nice +there&#x27;s sbf 20 in it.:)</li>
            <li> I use this makeup base with my Etude House Mineral BB cream and it makes my skin soft and lively. It has a baby pink color that helps brighten your skin and the texture is similar to that of a moisturizer or foundation. It is not thick and I can pat it easily across my face. Upon application it can look like you have a weird pale pink cast. It does go away after a short amount of time and leaves your skin looking fresh. Because of that effect I sometimes just wear the base when I don&#x27;t feel like wearing BB cream or foundation.</li>
