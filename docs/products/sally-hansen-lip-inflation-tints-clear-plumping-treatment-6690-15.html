            <li>Great lip gloss</li>
            <li>But it is a good product, it makes my lips shiny and smells great.</li>
            <li>my number one favorite lip gloss plumper is from Lancome and cost 39$ but for a cheaper alternative this is the best I have tried on the market that I know of....</li>
            <li>definately a good transaction and a great product.</li>
            <li>This peppermint on is the best lip inflation one Sally Hansen has.. way better than their others</li>
            <li>I love this lip gloss because the shine and moisture is great.</li>
            <li>Love the shine and fullness this gives my lips and has great staying power.</li>
            <li>But I would buy it again, for sure!</li>
            <li>When it comes to big beautiful lips,I certainly am loving it because GORGEOUS is my name!!</li>
            <li>as i said in a previoius statement i had already used this makeup lip infusion before and love</li>
            <li>Of course it doesn&#x27;t actually plump the lips, but it&#x27;s the best lip gloss I&#x27;ve ever used.   </li>
            <li>Nothing more</li>
            <li>AND I LOVE It.</li>
            <li>My favorite gloss of all time.</li>
            <li>Works better than others I have tried.</li>
            <li>My wife is well pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I love the tingling feeling that I get from it</li>
            <li>I love this product and I am glad that it is available to order.</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for the fun time I am having to write my review,because I want to convince you girls to get plump sexy lips!</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed because I really loved that lip gloss and how it looked.</li>
            <li>--they were great and this is the only place I can easily find them (for the time being!).</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this because I have not been able to find it in the stores like I used to...</li>
            <li>It stays on, easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>It is fine, just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>This lip inflation doesn&#x27;t work to instantly plump up the lips, but it is a great lip gloss for the lips.</li>
            <li>None of them stay on worth a damn, but this one feels the most tingly, which I like.</li>
            <li>Nice size bottle and clear.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find this in the normal retail stores any more for some reason.  </li>
            <li>REALLY?!!</li>
            <li>But i do like how fresh my lips feel with this Sally Hansen Lip thing.</li>
            <li>The packaging, marketing.. false advertising at its best.</li>
            <li>And just know it went right into the trash</li>
            <li>I even sent a very polite email to Sally Hansen at first, thinking it was me, but they do not care one bit and never responded.</li>
            <li>Great stuff...don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so hard to find!</li>
            <li>I give this item a 3 because it didnt really work like i wanted for it to.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply but doesn&#x27;t last as long as others.</li>
            <li>Seems less potent than last time ordered</li>
            <li>I used to be a professional makeup artist and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as good as the expensive lip plumpers out there, only a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money, and if someone gives it to you for free, don&#x27;t waste the time it takes to put it on every 1/2 hour (or less), since it dissipates so quickly.. and does not do a thing.</li>

            <li> but I am not sure that it does much for plumping.  </li>
            <li> Makes my lips look a little fuller, but so does regular lip gloss.  </li>
            <li> Sally Hansen&#x27;s PM Lip Plumper is the same... waste.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give this stuff a shot, and I usually wear regular lip gloss for shine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad thicker than ordinary lip gloss, and tends to last longer on your lips.  </li>
            <li> but I have used other products that provide faster results.  </li>
            <li> Thumbs down to the seller.</li>
            <li> i was not happy with one of the companies very expensive shipping and handling for a cheap lip plumper</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores now for some reason.</li>
            <li> and I just looked at it and thought how terrible that a person would send that and think that I would use it!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> as i said in a previoius statement i had already used this makeup lip infusion before and love it cannot find it here..i was not happy with one of the companies very expensive shipping and handling for a cheap lip plumper</li>
            <li> The packaging, marketing.. false advertising at its best. Don&#x27;t waste your money, and if someone gives it to you for free, don&#x27;t waste the time it takes to put it on every 1/2 hour (or less), since it dissipates so quickly.. and does not do a thing. Sally Hansen&#x27;s PM Lip Plumper is the same... waste. I even sent a very polite email to Sally Hansen at first, thinking it was me, but they do not care one bit and never responded. Why? They already got their money and scammed another unsuspecting customer, so they&#x27;re happy.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give this stuff a shot, and I usually wear regular lip gloss for shine.  I like it alot.  It&#x27;s a tad thicker than ordinary lip gloss, and tends to last longer on your lips.  Makes my lips look a little fuller, but so does regular lip gloss.  But I would buy it again, for sure!</li>
            <li> I love this lip gloss because the shine and moisture is great. Now my husband do not like the tingling feeling but it works for me. I love this gloss!!!</li>
            <li> Hi the reason one cannot find it in any store is because Sally Hensen has discontinued the product. I was very dissapointed because I really loved that lip gloss and how it looked. I sudggested they bring the product back. Lest see what happens!!! 😊</li>
            <li> Of course it doesn&#x27;t actually plump the lips, but it&#x27;s the best lip gloss I&#x27;ve ever used.   It stays on, easy to apply.  Hard to find in stores now for some reason.</li>
            <li> Always gives me just enough shine and plumping that I need.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I am glad that it is available to order.</li>
            <li> This lip inflation doesn&#x27;t work to instantly plump up the lips, but it is a great lip gloss for the lips.</li>
            <li> Love the shine and fullness this gives my lips and has great staying power. And can&#x27;t beat the affordable price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years no.  It&#x27;s just as good as the expensive lip plumpers out there, only a fraction of the price.  I can&#x27;t find this in the normal retail stores any more for some reason.  I hope Sally Hansen is still making it.</li>
            <li> Just a lip gloss.  Nothing more</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years AND I LOVE It. I was so excited to get this because I have not been able to find it in the stores like I used to...But what I received was an unpackaged, unsealed tube and I just looked at it and thought how terrible that a person would send that and think that I would use it! REALLY?!! Thumbs down to the seller. And just know it went right into the trash and I will never buy anything from this seller again. I assumed since it showed a packaged lip gloss like you buy in the stores that I was going to get it that way.</li>
            <li> I give this item a 3 because it didnt really work like i wanted for it to. I never see no difference on my lips. But i do like how fresh my lips feel with this Sally Hansen Lip thing.</li>
            <li> Great stuff...don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so hard to find!</li>
            <li> I like this product but I am not sure that it does much for plumping.  It has a great scent and feels like it is medicated in a way that would plump your lips but I have used other products that provide faster results.  I do not use this product every day, and this may be why it is taking longer to produce results.  But it is a good product, it makes my lips shiny and smells great.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply but doesn&#x27;t last as long as others.</li>
            <li> I used to be a professional makeup artist and my number one favorite lip gloss plumper is from Lancome and cost 39$ but for a cheaper alternative this is the best I have tried on the market that I know of....I cant find them in the stores anymore so I buy them online....definately a good transaction and a great product.</li>
            <li> It is fine, just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Bestest Lip Plumper around &amp; I&#x27;ve tried them ALL!  Have no idea WHY Sally Hansen got rid of their lip products--they were great and this is the only place I can easily find them (for the time being!).</li>
            <li> Excellent , She Loves It , Can&#x27;t Find It At Walgreens Anymore , So I Have To Go To The Internet now</li>
            <li> My favorite gloss of all time. Tingles and is addictive yum. Guts get it too if they kiss you.</li>
            <li> Shipped to expectations. Straightfoward, no complications. Product arrived as advertised.</li>
            <li> Works better than others I have tried.</li>
            <li> CVS stopped carrying this. I&#x27;ve tried every lip gloss on the market. None of them stay on worth a damn, but this one feels the most tingly, which I like. Nice size bottle and clear.</li>
            <li> Stopped selling in store whete I normallp purchased it. Great lip gloss</li>
            <li> This peppermint on is the best lip inflation one Sally Hansen has.. way better than their others</li>
            <li> ES MUY BUENO LO RECOMIENDO EN REALIDAD ES LO QUE ESPERABA LOS LABIOS SE VEN MUY SENSUALES&lt;br /&gt;EXCELENTE PRODUCTO LO RECOMIENDO</li>
            <li> I was buying this at Walgreens, however, they no longer carry the product. I really like this product. The best gloss and makes my lips look good.</li>
            <li> My wife is well pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Seems less potent than last time ordered</li>
            <li> Big lips rock! That is my personal opinion.I have the lip balm,can&#x27;tget to ALL of them,but still I know that they are good! I love the tingling feeling that I get from it-it plump my lips a bit-hey-it&#x27;s all good whether you believe it or not! When it comes to big beautiful lips,I certainly am loving it because GORGEOUS is my name!! Thank you Amazon for the fun time I am having to write my review,because I want to convince you girls to get plump sexy lips! Check with ya!!</li>
