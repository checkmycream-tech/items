            <li> Wow, great peppermint flavor, cool and refreshing, no sugar or harmful ingredients, xylitol is good for the teeth.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It is especially good to put around 4 of them in your mouth after eating something that has acid in it like coffee.  These give you good breath and it takes care of the acid by neutralizing it.  This is good for your teeth.  Delivery of the mints was prompt and packaged well.  I love ordering things from Amazon.  They have everything!</li>
            <li> I usually buy the fruit flavored ones that have a mild flavor to them. These Cool Mints are a lot stronger on flavor. It took some getting used to, but now I appreciate the strong mint for freshening breath. If you&#x27;re not a mint lover, this is not the flavor for you. Stick with the fruit flavored mints Zellies has.</li>
            <li> These taste good and are supposed to help your teeth.</li>
            <li> I keep them by my bed, and if I wake up with serious dry mouth problems, I can pop one or two mints in my mouth, stimulate saliva flow, and know I&#x27;m combating cavities while I&#x27;m at it.</li>
            <li> I am currently testing this product to determine it&#x27;s effective for my purpose.  So far, it seems to be working well.</li>

            <li> Tasty and works well after a meal.</li>
            <li> Zelies are part of my daily oral hygiene regimen and help me keep progression of my gum disease and bone degeneration at bay. They are part of the system dentists don&#x27;t want you to know about. Thanks to Merritt Wellness Group in Austin, TX, I&#x27;m ahead of my dental professionals in the daily routine that keeps my mouth healthy and feeling great.</li>
            <li> They were exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I love these mints!  Used to use Altoids but this is far better and according to my sources, better for you.</li>

            <li> These taste great and as far as I&#x27;ve been able to research, are super healthy and prevent lots of dental problems. It&#x27;s expensive to get xylitol this way though and probably much better to buy the powder.</li>
            <li> These mints are really refreshing for the mouth and I really like the no sugar in them.  Will order again!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re minty, help with dry mouth, and don&#x27;t have sugar and are actually good for your teeth.  Help satisfy my addiction for peppermints.</li>
            <li> I keep a bottle handy and have several daily.  My last dental cleaning was much better.  It also is a good breath freshener.</li>
