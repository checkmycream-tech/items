            <li>Fekkai is a great product if you want to help keeping your highlights in.</li>
            <li>Well, I did until I used this great product.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner are good but the styling cream is &amp;#34;excellent&amp;#34; for a nice and beautiful shine to your hair.  </li>

            <li>All shimmery and nice?</li>
            <li>This product is awesome - it really does all it promises.  </li>
            <li>I think the Brilliant Glossing Hair Crème is still a great value, because it it&#x27;s the only product I have to use.  </li>
            <li>Great smell and my hair is super shiny.</li>
            <li>has super-duper fine glitter in it almost that makes your hair shiny!  </li>
            <li>It has a very light scent that to me, smells like olive oil and herbs.  </li>
            <li>It is very light and any added scent, like perfume, would not clash with this haircare routine.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>really love the shine cream.</li>

            <li>Many compliments on my hair since using this.  </li>
            <li>I am a faithful user of top products but Fekkai is # 1.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to make much of a difference and am so happy that it did.</li>
            <li>I can not be sure if the glossy shine of my hair had anything to do with the shampoo or conditioner because I used all 3 products each of the 2 days</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was interesting.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>Again, i LOVE the scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>Again, i LOVE the scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>The conditioner was a big surprise for me - I was worried that it wasn&#x27;t going to be very good when it seemed thinner than the shampoo, but that seems to not be an issue.</li>
            <li>Yet this was very helpful, make my hair look good and shiny,  </li>
            <li>I love to put the Brilliant Glossing Hair Crème in wet-damp hair and let air dry.  </li>
            <li>The smell lasts most of the day and keeps my frizzy fine hair smooth.</li>
            <li>I could have easily used each sample in one use.  </li>
            <li>The collection has olive oil in the products, which creates such a nourishing element and creates a beautiful sheen to the hair.</li>
            <li>little package was perfect for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I am a huge fan of how it helps my blow out hold up on a rainy / snowy day.</li>
            <li>It felt light and didn&#x27;t require too much product to be effective.  </li>
            <li>- I personally didn&#x27;t notice a difference with the addition of the shampoo/conditioner, but it may be great for others.</li>
            <li>Fekkai leaves hair glossy and smooth.</li>
            <li>I paid an ungodly amount of money to have fantastic hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very nice, especially the styling cream.</li>
            <li>It works great leaving my short hair very soft and amazingly shiny.  </li>
            <li>This is also a very economical way to buy these products, and my pkg had a $10 coupon included for a full size of these.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to get to try these products, as I know that they are salon-quality (and salon priced) products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is very damaged, I think I need something more substantial.  </li>
            <li>Had the sample when that was gone, I ordered the full size.  </li>
            <li>I find my color stays true for weeks longer</li>
            <li>I feel as though I didn&#x27;t get a true feel of the difference the shampoo and conditioner could have made in my hair after longer use</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s super</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to give you a quick run-down of</li>
            <li>It smells like somebody&#x27;s going to get pregnant</li>
            <li>sure looks glossy&amp;#34; or anything, but these products made enough of a difference for my hair that that many people noticed something was different---and that says something!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>my other Fekkai favorite is the Ironless Straightening balm that&#x27;s amazing as well</li>
            <li>I get the most gorgeous curls with very little flyaways.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use too much and have greasy hair.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>I received the Glossing shampoo, conditioner, &amp; creme  complimentary, for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>Just a natural, healthy shine.</li>
            <li>I love this product just a dab makes my hair soft and shine like silk</li>
            <li>/&gt;Was it worth it?</li>
            <li>I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.  </li>
            <li>For others with fine hair just put on the ends or the frizzy sections and don&#x27;t go near your roots with it.</li>
            <li>Okay - didn&#x27;t find any difference in my hair after using this kit several times.....</li>
            <li>I prefer the travel size container and figured I&#x27;d try the shampoo and conditioner as well, but I&#x27;m pretty neutral on those two products</li>
            <li>Leaves hair very shiny!</li>
            <li>I used it exactly according to the directions - except that I alternated with non-Fekkai shampoos in between uses.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the price and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>My hair felt super soft and STRAIGHT!  </li>
            <li>My hair felt super soft and STRAIGHT!  </li>
            <li>When I first got this, my hair was so damaged from too much coloring.</li>
            <li>Like, this product actually has super-duper fine glitter in it</li>
            <li>Left my fine curly hair oily.</li>
            <li>Great for thin straight hair.</li>
            <li>This really makes my hair shiny.  </li>
            <li>Really helps to keep my hair softer and shinier.</li>
            <li>I feel like it really coated my hair.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner was much &amp;#34;runnier&amp;#34; than the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference in this than the Tresemme conditioner I was using before I tried these out.  </li>
            <li>I thought the shampoo was great--the smell wasn&#x27;t too cloying (sometimes floral scents can be too much), and the shampoo felt very cleansing.  </li>
            <li>I will now purchase the larger size bottles and keep the travel sizes filled for trips.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these three products!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, I guess I shouldn&#x27;t complain about a free sample, but, like I said, I find it difficult to give a great review of the products when I got barely anything to try.  </li>
            <li>After one week of using this product (every other day), my hair already feels and looks better.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner work as promised on my fine, long hair.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair looking healthier and more like a professional blow dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Normally, my hair looks like I lost a fight with a weed whacker, but since I got this stuff, I went from a train wreck to having decent hair</li>
            <li>My expectations weren&#x27;t high.</li>
            <li>Highly Reccommend.</li>
            <li>Now, this does NOT mean that it looks like you are putting glitter in your hair or anything, but it is just what makes it look shinier.  </li>

            <li>I love fekkai, have been using it on those especially rough hair/weather days for years.</li>
            <li>Also, I live in south Florida and humidity can be a issue -</li>
            <li>I seriously use, like, a pencil eraser (the kind on the end of the pencil) sized amount….maybe</li>

            <li>This winter with all the cold weather and heat indoors, my hair was most static.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>Pretty fragrance and left my hair shiny, as promised.  </li>
            <li>However, I did think the conditioner&#x27;s scent was a little too strong.  </li>
            <li>As far as the glossing creme: I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiny without any frizzy ends.</li>
            <li>The combination gives me shiny, soft hair.</li>
            <li>and this is the only one that really helps to give my hair thickness and shine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be completely blunt here.</li>
            <li>I am a Hispanic woman with naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and tamed.</li>
            <li>(I would have liked to have had enough to use for at least a week or two.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this did not weigh it down - although go easy on the glossing cream because a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li>The styling creme was FANTASTIC, and I subbed it in in lieu of my usual detangler/leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>The glossing cream can be a bit much for finer hair, but if you only use a tiny bit on your ends, it helps with the daily frizz if you live in a humid environment.  </li>
            <li>blow dry my hair straight every time I wash it.)  </li>
            <li>blow dry my hair straight every time I wash it.)  </li>
            <li>The texture of my hair has changed dramatically over the last few years (autoimmune) and adding the creme prior to blow drying/styling has made a huge difference for me.</li>
            <li>But after using the trio on my daughter&#x27;s thick, curly, often dry mane, her hair was noticeably softer, easy to comb through &amp; as claimed...</li>
            <li>have super thick, coarse, long hair with natural curl.</li>

            <li> I thought the shampoo was great--the smell wasn&#x27;t too cloying (sometimes floral scents can be too much), and the shampoo felt very cleansing.  </li>
            <li> I will now purchase the larger size bottles and keep the travel sizes filled for trips.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these three products!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, I guess I shouldn&#x27;t complain about a free sample, but, like I said, I find it difficult to give a great review of the products when I got barely anything to try.  </li>
            <li> After one week of using this product (every other day), my hair already feels and looks better.</li>

            <li> It leaves my hair looking healthier and more like a professional blow dry.</li>

            <li> Highly Reccommend.</li>

            <li> I received the Glossing shampoo, conditioner, &amp; creme  complimentary, for testing purposes. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. My expectations weren&#x27;t high. But after using the trio on my daughter&#x27;s thick, curly, often dry mane, her hair was noticeably softer, easy to comb through &amp; as claimed... Shiny! It didn&#x27;t appear weighed down or oily. Just a natural, healthy shine. I&#x27;ll definitely keep this in our rotation! (Did I mention that I&#x27;m a bit of a product junkie?)</li>
            <li> Did not gloss my hair at all, not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great for thin straight hair. Get the glossing cream too (awsome detangler). Doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down. Ultra concentrated...only use.the size of a nickel (or less if you have short hair).</li>
            <li> Very good product.  My hair is very damaged, I think I need something more substantial.  Yet this was very helpful, make my hair look good and shiny,  I think I needed the repair kit.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing set. My hair is so soft and shiny. The smell lasts most of the day and keeps my frizzy fine hair smooth. I would definitely recommend this set. This also comes with a $ 10.00 coupon you can use at a brick and mortar retailer that sells this line.</li>
            <li> I love this product just a dab makes my hair soft and shine like silk</li>
            <li> these are my go to products at home and for travel when I don&#x27;t check luggage</li>
            <li> Easy to use too much and have greasy hair.  Not really better than less costly oil-based products.</li>
            <li> Wonderful productss.  I only  reordered the gloss due to the price</li>
            <li> Okay - didn&#x27;t find any difference in my hair after using this kit several times.....</li>
            <li> I love fekkai, have been using it on those especially rough hair/weather days for years. I got this kit to travel with and it&#x27;s exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> Great products and great price</li>
            <li> When I first got this, my hair was so damaged from too much coloring. I tried to use this every day...I KNOW it says to mix in days with other products, but by day three my hair was like silly putty when wet! I had to use a stripping shampoo and a protein treatment and then cut off a bunch of hair...</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Fekkai&#x27;s Glossing creme in my monthly Birchbox and now swear by it. The texture of my hair has changed dramatically over the last few years (autoimmune) and adding the creme prior to blow drying/styling has made a huge difference for me. It leaves my hair looking healthier and more like a professional blow dry. I prefer the travel size container and figured I&#x27;d try the shampoo and conditioner as well, but I&#x27;m pretty neutral on those two products - I personally didn&#x27;t notice a difference with the addition of the shampoo/conditioner, but it may be great for others. As far as the glossing creme: I can&#x27;t live without it. Also, I live in south Florida and humidity can be a issue - my other Fekkai favorite is the Ironless Straightening balm that&#x27;s amazing as well (http://www.amazon.com/Fekkai-Coiff-Perfecteur-Anti-Ounce/dp/B000Z61VKW/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1439482068&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;fekkai+ironless+straightening+balm)</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Had the sample when that was gone, I ordered the full size.  My hair is soft and shiny without any frizzy ends.</li>
            <li> Very good product for the money.  Tames the frizzies.</li>
            <li> Fekkai leaves hair glossy and smooth. Love the products!</li>
            <li> This really makes my hair shiny.  I read something somewhere that a man doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;remember the shoes you are wearing or the outfit but he will remember shiny hair.&lt;br /&gt;I really love the shine cream.</li>
            <li> Brilliant Glossing Styling Cream.... best product I&#x27;ve had that gives great shine to my hair.  The shampoo and conditioner are good but the styling cream is &amp;#34;excellent&amp;#34; for a nice and beautiful shine to your hair.  I wish the the styling cream came in a larger tube.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I bought this while watching &amp;#34;the Face&amp;#34; one night and shopping on Amazon.  Impulse, anyone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, it&#x27;s ok.  Not fantastic.  I&#x27;m not sure I love the scent.  No real complaints.  I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s super amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have super thick, coarse, long hair with natural curl.</li>
            <li> Fekkai is a well known hair product.&lt;br /&gt;This little package was perfect for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;I can refill the little bottles before the next trip.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo, conditioner, and leave in conditioner. The combination gives me shiny, soft hair. It does not strip the color from my hair.</li>
            <li> I decided that I wanted to try this smaller set of Shampoo, Conditioner and Styling Creme before I decided to buy the regular size. I&#x27;m happy to say that it wasn&#x27;t necessary because I&#x27;m so impressed with this product and I&#x27;ll definitely be getting the regular size bottles of all three. I have long, dry hair that has been colored many times, and I have been unhappy with the texture of my hair with the shampoos and conditioners I have been using. After one week of using this product (every other day), my hair already feels and looks better. The conditioner was a big surprise for me - I was worried that it wasn&#x27;t going to be very good when it seemed thinner than the shampoo, but that seems to not be an issue. Totally worth the price and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Fekkai is a great product if you want to help keeping your highlights in. I find my color stays true for weeks longer If I use the glossing cream. Would recommend for anyone who has dyed hair. It&#x27;s also great for moisturizing!</li>
            <li> great starter set! I have fine hair and this did not weigh it down - although go easy on the glossing cream because a little goes a very long way. For others with fine hair just put on the ends or the frizzy sections and don&#x27;t go near your roots with it.</li>
            <li> love this product. Really helps to keep my hair softer and shinier. This set is perfect for travel or the gym</li>
            <li> Leaves hair very shiny!</li>
            <li> I have tried hundreds of hair care products because my hair is so thin and this is the only one that really helps to give my hair thickness and shine.  Many compliments on my hair since using this.  Yes, it&#x27;s a little pricey but you only use a little bit so it does last a long time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be completely blunt here. My hair sucks. It&#x27;s frizzy, it looks like Helen Keller cut it, and there are a lot of split ends. I&#x27;m going to give you a quick run-down of this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want your hair to look like the stuff in the Pantene commercials? All shimmery and nice? This is your stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell? It smells like somebody&#x27;s going to get pregnant tonight-- THAT good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, my hair looks like I lost a fight with a weed whacker, but since I got this stuff, I went from a train wreck to having decent hair (I&#x27;m still no George Clooney, though). People ask if I&#x27;ve dyed my hair, cut it, or did something different. Yeah. I did do something different. I paid an ungodly amount of money to have fantastic hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was it a lot of money? Yup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was it worth it? Yes. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using another shampoo until the day I go bald from stress.</li>
            <li> I am a faithful user of top products but Fekkai is # 1.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my aging hair. 😁</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to make much of a difference and am so happy that it did. It made the process of blowing out my hair less painstaking. Hoping I will still say the same in the humidity of summer but I am a huge fan of how it helps my blow out hold up on a rainy / snowy day.</li>
            <li> Great smell and my hair is super shiny.</li>
            <li> Really dried out my hair</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.  My review and opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The items pictured above were in my Influenster Vox Box.  I was super excited to get to try these products, as I know that they are salon-quality (and salon priced) products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little disappointed in the size of the shampoo and conditioner samples.  I mean, I literally used as little as possible of both and barely squeezed enough out of there to last 2 shampoos and conditioners.  I could have easily used each sample in one use.  I feel as though I didn&#x27;t get a true feel of the difference the shampoo and conditioner could have made in my hair after longer use (I would have liked to have had enough to use for at least a week or two.  I wish that the shampoo and conditioner samples would have been the same size as the styler (2 oz bottle), but instead they were 0.3 oz packets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo and Conditioner:&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I guess I shouldn&#x27;t complain about a free sample, but, like I said, I find it difficult to give a great review of the products when I got barely anything to try.  What I did notice about the shampoo was that it was WAY thicker than any other shampoo that I have used.  I feel like it really coated my hair.  I loved the scent, and I like that fact that is was infused with olive oil.  The conditioner was much &amp;#34;runnier&amp;#34; than the shampoo.  I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference in this than the Tresemme conditioner I was using before I tried these out.  Again, i really loved the scent of this.  I did notice that my hair was &amp;#34;glossier&amp;#34;, but that may be due to the styler (which I will review next).  I can not be sure if the glossy shine of my hair had anything to do with the shampoo or conditioner because I used all 3 products each of the 2 days I used the shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Styler:&lt;br /&gt;This was interesting.  After putting it in my hair, my hands were sparkly.  Like, this product actually has super-duper fine glitter in it almost that makes your hair shiny!  Now, this does NOT mean that it looks like you are putting glitter in your hair or anything, but it is just what makes it look shinier.  I LOVE this product.  I will continue to use it until I have squeezed every last bit out of the bottle!  My hair felt super soft and STRAIGHT!  (This is the look I want….I blow dry my hair straight every time I wash it.)  Again, i LOVE the scent.&lt;br /&gt;It says right on the bottle that a little goes a long way, so this product will last you a very long time.  I seriously use, like, a pencil eraser (the kind on the end of the pencil) sized amount….maybe even less) each day.  By the end of the day, my hair does feel a little greasy, but no more so than when I use any other styler out there…..and I have used about a bazillion different kinds, ranging from the cheapo brands to the salon-priced/quality ones!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the two days that I used all 3 of the above products I had not 1 but 4 people ask me if I got a haircut or did something different with my hair!  No one said &amp;#34;Wow, your hair sure looks glossy&amp;#34; or anything, but these products made enough of a difference for my hair that that many people noticed something was different---and that says something!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish that I would have saved the shampoo and conditioner for school picture day (which is coming up--I am a teacher!)ctually has super-duper fine glitter in it almost that makes your hair shiny!

            <li> I received this set courtesy of Influenster for testing purposes, though the amount of conditioner &amp; shampoo were smaller than this set!  I thought the shampoo was great--the smell wasn&#x27;t too cloying (sometimes floral scents can be too much), and the shampoo felt very cleansing.  However, I did think the conditioner&#x27;s scent was a little too strong.  I thought the choice of olive oil was odd, but it turned out to be well paired with the floral scent.  The styling creme was FANTASTIC, and I subbed it in in lieu of my usual detangler/leave-in conditioner.  It felt light and didn&#x27;t require too much product to be effective.  I&#x27;d definitely buy that again.  However, I think the cost of the shampoo and the too-strong scent of the conditioner may be too prohibitive for me to personally use them regularly.</li>
            <li> Left my fine curly hair oily.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome - it really does all it promises.  I used it exactly according to the directions - except that I alternated with non-Fekkai shampoos in between uses.  I will now purchase the larger size bottles and keep the travel sizes filled for trips.  I highly recommend these three products!</li>
            <li> I think they are so luxurious for a drug store brand.  I would way rather use Fekkai on my hair than Paul Mitchell, Tigi, or Aveda.  I tried the Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Shampoo and Conditioner and a travel size of the Brilliant Glossing Hair Crème.  The collection has olive oil in the products, which creates such a nourishing element and creates a beautiful sheen to the hair. I am a Hispanic woman with naturally curly hair.  I love to put the Brilliant Glossing Hair Crème in wet-damp hair and let air dry.  I get the most gorgeous curls with very little flyaways.  The products are on the pricier side of drug store brand products.  You will find this with the Toni and Guy, Nexxus, and Pantene Hair expert.  I think the Brilliant Glossing Hair Crème is still a great value, because it it&#x27;s the only product I have to use.  When I use less expensive products, I typically have to use both mousse and styling crème.  It has a very light scent that to me, smells like olive oil and herbs.  I do not care for aromatherapy-like smells and this is not like that.  It is very light and any added scent, like perfume, would not clash with this haircare routine.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted at half the price!!</li>
            <li> Pretty fragrance and left my hair shiny, as promised.  The included coupon was generous to boot!</li>
            <li> I like all of the Fekkai products</li>
            <li> Very nice, especially the styling cream. This winter with all the cold weather and heat indoors, my hair was most static. But the styling cream works on me!</li>
            <li> I have dry frizzie thick wavy hair. Well, I did until I used this great product. It&#x27;s so soft and tamed. Highly Reccommend.</li>
            <li> Wonderful addition to my Fekkai line!  The shampoo and conditioner work as promised on my fine, long hair.  The glossing cream can be a bit much for finer hair, but if you only use a tiny bit on your ends, it helps with the daily frizz if you live in a humid environment.  The only negative is the smell.  I will compare it to the smell of a dish rag that&#x27;s been used for a week and then dampened with water.  It&#x27;s a little off-putting.  The Fekkai Volume Shampoo/Conditioner smells MUCH better!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff. It works great leaving my short hair very soft and amazingly shiny.  This is also a very economical way to buy these products, and my pkg had a $10 coupon included for a full size of these.</li>
