            <li>Vitamin C 21% is excellent!!!</li>
            <li>did notice an immediate change in my skin once using the Beta Glucan, which is wonderful!</li>
            <li>and this product is a perfect combination for me!</li>
            <li>This, along with my morning retinol routine has given me the best skin of my life.  </li>

            <li>and I heard that it Vitamin C is good for healing sun damage, so I went ahead an purchased a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the texture of this serum is very nice, not tacky, just hydrating and smoothing on the skin.</li>
            <li>My face is never oily, just bright and even skin.</li>
            <li>I came across this at work which I work at amazon and went home and looked it up and saw it was a good price, so I thought I would try it.</li>
            <li>so I thought something with Vitamin C would be good for her skin.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels smooth and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I sent this product to my mom because she&#x27;s been complaining about not being able to find a really good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>she liked them.</li>
            <li>I now have beautiful skin, which looks much healthier and radiant.</li>
            <li>I am confident about this serum.</li>

            <li>I can feel the difference and will for sure order this again and again.</li>
            <li>My skin was gorgeous, smooth, pimple free skin until I used this.</li>
            <li>and I also get a lot more in the jar.</li>
            <li>The level of moisture was so much better</li>
            <li>I will try and leave a review once I see more progress there.</li>
            <li>but I was not expecting this, this fast.!!!!</li>
            <li>It did burn pretty good, but I tolerated it.</li>
            <li>I am sure the fine lines are lessened.</li>
            <li>This serum is uniquely charged by nitrogen, leaving you with more youthful skin.</li>
            <li>The product is strong and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my pores.</li>
            <li>Seems to work just fine</li>
            <li>She also wanted help with age spots and fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li>She is now very interested in trying more IMAX brand products.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t say enough great things about them.</li>
            <li>Like I try to tell them you don&#x27;t need but just a dab in 4 places on your face and it spreads as smooth as silk.</li>
            <li>did run out of my branded cream quite quickly</li>
            <li>Love this product it is highly concentrated and</li>
            <li>The combination of these two products has left my skin feeling amazing.</li>
            <li>I love that its all natural, I don&#x27;t have to wonder if I&#x27;m putting harmful chemicals into my skin.</li>
            <li>From the results so far, I can tell that my skin will probably react better to the Vitamin C 21% lightening properties.</li>
            <li>And It hydrates my skin all day long, which is wonderful because my skin is pretty dry.</li>
            <li>it helps control my acne and mild discoloration that I have, and you can see results in a short period which I love.</li>
            <li>They moisturize very very well</li>
            <li>First, I never write reviews on anything.</li>
            <li>I bought the test bottle first.</li>
            <li>The first time she applied both to her face</li>
            <li>However, I recently decided to take more care of my appearance, and myself</li>
            <li>Skin feels smooth and soft</li>
            <li>Better than similar brands.</li>
            <li>like I did with my other cream and the results were even better than before!</li>
            <li>I deal with adult acne far more than I should, but this product helps me keep it under control.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many lotions and creams, high dollar and low dollar and nothing ever worked.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Price point is certainly right.&lt;br /&gt;Try it.</li>
            <li>There not as large since using the product.</li>
            <li>My skin got much smoother and brighter after using this serum.</li>
            <li>But I must admit, these two products really did make me realize that my skin wasn&#x27;t as nourished as it could have been before.</li>
            <li>But I also had a problem of dry skin, which has been an issue for many years, I just learned to live with it.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s been through so many brands of moisturizers and other skin care products, I don&#x27;t think there is anything she hasn&#x27;t tried.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C serum is the new fountain of youth, its done wonders for my skin!</li>
            <li>and she says her skin is more hydrated and her wrinkles are much less</li>
            <li>I use this product with my regular moisturizer and it renders my skin soft, smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She now says that these products are better than more expensive brands she used to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After looking at the other products this company offers, I came across Beta Glucan and ordered it, as I have been happy with other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought I would end up with them the rest of my life unless I wanted to pay for a high end procedure at a spa.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I got the opportunity to feel my skin more hydrated, clear and tight.</li>
            <li>I also have some dark spots on my face, either from the sun or age, but regardless, the serum is working terrifically to brighten my skin and keep it smooth.</li>
            <li>A complete win-win situation for me!</li>
            <li>The extra plus point is that I am actually spending less money than before and my skin looks even better!</li>
            <li>Clearly price doesn&#x27;t equate to performance!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>The next morning I didn&#x27;t really look at my skin because I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything to change overnight.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t  completely gone</li>
            <li>It seems to work well, but I am not too young anymore</li>
            <li>For her to say that this less expensive product is better still amazes me just because I figured she would have found something that she loved a long time ago which she hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife because she was about to spend a whole lot more on an expensive Botox surgery to get rid of aging wrinkles in her face.</li>
            <li>After I realized my skin is not clean and neat any more but dull and dark, I was looking for something to help my skin clean and clear</li>
            <li>My skin is also a lot cleaner and clearer now, with an extra soft feeling from Beta Glucan’s</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really expect this, seeing as the Beta Glucan was a lot cheaper than my previous cream.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other products from this company and I have no regrets or complaints.</li>
            <li> so I wanted to tackle my dry skin problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My loose, dry skin began to lift which I wasn&#x27;t expecting to happen.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that a small scar, near my elbow, is also benefitting and improving.</li>
            <li> and my skin is kinda rough.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;Remember the tv commercial about the moisturizer graveyard?&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Only after a few weeks I have noticed a change in my skin.</li>
            <li> Add a few drops of this to the facial mask and you will see the different in a few days.</li>
            <li> After only a few weeks I can see some improvement of my skin.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough for sun damage.</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way with each application.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s diluted when you buy the regular size??</li>
            <li> dark spots haven’t fully faded out yet, but they are gradually going.</li>
            <li> After noticing dull and dark tones to my face, which seem to be from sun damage, I decided that I needed to use something to help with this problem as it began to bother me.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the deal is</li>
            <li> I’ve used Vitamin C lotions and creams in the past and have seen slow progress and improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> not magic, but it&#x27;s ok!&lt;br /&gt;the serum helps, but don&#x27;t expect radical changes in the aspect of your skin!</li>
            <li> Stands behind their products.</li>
            <li> but you have to look real hard to find them.</li>
            <li> I also use an expensive branded face cream, so I thought mixing them together would be ultra hydrating on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought 2 bottles three weeks ago and my daughter and wife are crazy about the results.</li>
            <li> smellled bad and didnt do nothing for my skin</li>
            <li> I also use it on the backs of my hands, and I have noticed some of those ugly sun spots are going away.</li>
            <li> So buy it you will not be disappointed!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I broke out into terrible cystic pimples from using this product.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very nice company.  Stands behind their products.</li>
            <li> After I realized my skin is not clean and neat any more but dull and dark, I was looking for something to help my skin clean and clear but my wife recommended this serum on Amazon. I didn’t notice anything until 2 months use of it. But after 2 months, I was so happy to see my skin brighter, lighter and firmer. I am sure the fine lines are lessened. I am confident about this serum.</li>
            <li> Gave me a lot of red pimples! Not for me./</li>
            <li> Love this product it is highly concentrated and it helps control my acne and mild discoloration that I have, and you can see results in a short period which I love.</li>
            <li> First, I never write reviews on anything. But this is different. I have sun spots on my forehead from sun and tanning and my skin is kinda rough. I have tried so many lotions and creams, high dollar and low dollar and nothing ever worked. I came across this at work which I work at amazon and went home and looked it up and saw it was a good price, so I thought I would try it. I bought the test bottle first. I put it on my face that night before bed and I left it on all night. It did burn pretty good, but I tolerated it. The next morning I didn&#x27;t really look at my skin because I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything to change overnight. The day after I was looking in the mirror putting my makeup on and I noticed, OMG my sun spots are gone. No way!!! They aren&#x27;t  completely gone but you have to look real hard to find them. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I thought I would end up with them the rest of my life unless I wanted to pay for a high end procedure at a spa. But nope I found it. I&#x27;m so happy I did. So buy it you will not be disappointed!!!!!! I wish I had a ac before and after photo but I was not expecting this, this fast.!!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;Remember the tv commercial about the moisturizer graveyard?&lt;br /&gt;If you buy this product make room  in your &amp;#34;moisturizer graveyard&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Not sure what the deal is but I found that the product in the sample bottle was substantially different from the product that came in regular size. I&#x27;m giving this product 3 stars because the contents of the SAMPLE bottle were amazing! The sample bottle&#x27;s product practically renewed my skin, i.e acted like a chemical peel without the flaky skin, and I could feel the tingly effect when I applied it on my skin (which to me means it&#x27;s working). Not sure if it&#x27;s diluted when you buy the regular size?? Does anyone else agree??</li>
            <li> not magic, but it&#x27;s ok!&lt;br /&gt;the serum helps, but don&#x27;t expect radical changes in the aspect of your skin!</li>
            <li> I bought the Vitamin C 21% Serum- to use with the Beta Glucan moisturizing cream. The combination of these two products has left my skin feeling amazing. Only after a few weeks I have noticed a change in my skin. My skin looks and feels smooth and beautiful. I would recommend the Vitamin C Serum and also suggest you get the moisturizing cream to go with it.</li>
            <li> Seems to work just fine but mine smells like bacon. Yes, bacon.</li>
            <li> Have stopped using after couple weeks use, felt this was drying my skin out.</li>
            <li> Not working at all .. No changes</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serum is the new fountain of youth, its done wonders for my skin! I deal with adult acne far more than I should, but this product helps me keep it under control. I also have some dark spots on my face, either from the sun or age, but regardless, the serum is working terrifically to brighten my skin and keep it smooth. I love that its all natural, I don&#x27;t have to wonder if I&#x27;m putting harmful chemicals into my skin. My face is never oily, just bright and even skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best Vitamin C serum that I have tried. I’ve used Vitamin C lotions and creams in the past and have seen slow progress and improvement in my skin. MaxLife’s serum is quite fortified and after regular daily use, my skin looks brighter. I have also noticed that a small scar, near my elbow, is also benefitting and improving. I use this product with my regular moisturizer and it renders my skin soft, smooth and hydrated. I’m very happy and ecstatic to recommend it!</li>
            <li> I sent this product to my mom because she&#x27;s been complaining about not being able to find a really good moisturizer. She also wanted help with age spots and fine lines and wrinkles so I thought something with Vitamin C would be good for her skin. I also sent her the Beta Glucan with it. I use Beta Glucan myself and I just love it so I figured she would too. The first time she applied both to her face she liked them. They moisturize very very well and she says her skin is more hydrated and her wrinkles are much less pronounced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She now says that these products are better than more expensive brands she used to use. She&#x27;s been through so many brands of moisturizers and other skin care products, I don&#x27;t think there is anything she hasn&#x27;t tried. For her to say that this less expensive product is better still amazes me just because I figured she would have found something that she loved a long time ago which she hasn&#x27;t. She is now very interested in trying more IMAX brand products. I&#x27;m sure she will like anything she buys because I have quite a lot of their products and I can&#x27;t say enough great things about them.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C 21% is excellent!!! I&#x27;ve bought other products from this company and I have no regrets or complaints. They&#x27;ve won a customer for life!</li>
            <li> My skin got much smoother and brighter after using this serum. And It hydrates my skin all day long, which is wonderful because my skin is pretty dry. Gonna order again. Add a few drops of this to the facial mask and you will see the different in a few days.</li>
            <li> I started using the Vitamin C 21% Serum from this company in order to lighten my skin and it has been working gradually. But I also had a problem of dry skin, which has been an issue for many years, I just learned to live with it. However, I recently decided to take more care of my appearance, and myself so I wanted to tackle my dry skin problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After looking at the other products this company offers, I came across Beta Glucan and ordered it, as I have been happy with other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice an immediate change in my skin once using the Beta Glucan, which is wonderful! My loose, dry skin began to lift which I wasn&#x27;t expecting to happen. My skin is also a lot cleaner and clearer now, with an extra soft feeling from Beta Glucan’s moisturizing properties!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the Vitamin C 21% and this product is a perfect combination for me! From the results so far, I can tell that my skin will probably react better to the Vitamin C 21% lightening properties.</li>
            <li> After only a few weeks I can see some improvement of my skin. Age spots have been diminished and deeper lines are filling in.&lt;br /&gt;I use the product morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;Price point is certainly right.&lt;br /&gt;Try it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife because she was about to spend a whole lot more on an expensive Botox surgery to get rid of aging wrinkles in her face. I bought 2 bottles three weeks ago and my daughter and wife are crazy about the results. I even tried it and could tell a difference in two days. I got the opportunity to feel my skin more hydrated, clear and tight. Like I try to tell them you don&#x27;t need but just a dab in 4 places on your face and it spreads as smooth as silk. For the money this is a great product including the results.</li>
            <li> The product is strong and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my pores. There not as large since using the product.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the IMAX line. I bought this product along with Wrinkle Reducing cream and Antioxidant Serum.  I apply this serum before using my wrinkle cream.  For those of you who may not know, Vitamin C is essential to the skin’s health and beauty.  Oxidation, especially with regards to Vitamin C, can be damaging to your skin. This serum is uniquely charged by nitrogen, leaving you with more youthful skin. Just a little goes a long way with each application.  I can feel the difference and will for sure order this again and again.</li>
            <li> Great, use with rinle cream and another serum. Skin feels smooth and soft</li>
            <li> After one week of use, I noticed my face feels tighter. I also use it on the backs of my hands, and I have noticed some of those ugly sun spots are going away. I add it to my facial moisturizer at night as well.</li>
            <li> I mix three drops in with my nightly moisturizer.  This, along with my morning retinol routine has given me the best skin of my life.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> smellled bad and didnt do nothing for my skin</li>
            <li> I used this every day.  It seems to work well, but I am not too young anymore so I will need to keep ordering it.</li>
            <li> I broke out into terrible cystic pimples from using this product. My skin was gorgeous, smooth, pimple free skin until I used this. I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Better than similar brands.</li>
            <li> Very effective in couple of days..,</li>
            <li> After noticing dull and dark tones to my face, which seem to be from sun damage, I decided that I needed to use something to help with this problem as it began to bother me. I found Vitamin C 21% serum which claimed to lighten skin tone and I heard that it Vitamin C is good for healing sun damage, so I went ahead an purchased a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the texture of this serum is very nice, not tacky, just hydrating and smoothing on the skin. I also use an expensive branded face cream, so I thought mixing them together would be ultra hydrating on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I did run out of my branded cream quite quickly and I ended up buying Beta Glucan, which is by the same company as the Vitamin C Serum. It was around a third of what my branded cream cost and I also get a lot more in the jar. I continued to mix the Beta Glucan with the Vitamin C Serum like I did with my other cream and the results were even better than before! The level of moisture was so much better and my skin was a lot smoother. I didn&#x27;t really expect this, seeing as the Beta Glucan was a lot cheaper than my previous cream. Clearly price doesn&#x27;t equate to performance!&lt;br /&gt;My dark spots haven’t fully faded out yet, but they are gradually going. I will try and leave a review once I see more progress there. But I must admit, these two products really did make me realize that my skin wasn&#x27;t as nourished as it could have been before. I now have beautiful skin, which looks much healthier and radiant. The extra plus point is that I am actually spending less money than before and my skin looks even better! A complete win-win situation for me!</li>
            <li> Not strong enough for sun damage. I need 70%.</li>
