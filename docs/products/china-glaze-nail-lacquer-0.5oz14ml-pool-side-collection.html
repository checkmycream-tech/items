    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s UV reactive and glows under backlights, which is definitely awesome.</li>
            <li>Perfect!</li>
            <li>Great buy!</li>
            <li>But either way it&#x27;s awesome</li>
            <li>and I received it in perfect conditions.</li>
            <li>I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been warned that CG wasn&#x27;t the best polish, but the color!</li>
            <li>Great price, product, and shipping arrival timing!</li>
            <li>China glaze nail polish are excellent in color and texture, the shipping and price are very good.</li>

            <li>I fell in love &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 i just bought it a week ago</li>
            <li>I saw this color and thought it was awesome because it was so bright.     </li>
            <li>the color is great, but after buying two colors of China Glaze, I do not like the finish.  </li>
            <li>This color is great, but you&#x27;re going to need a lot of coats, because this is sheeeeer.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy with the way it goes on.</li>
            <li>Once done though, it looks AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so bright</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s that bright</li>
            <li>The downside to this nail polish is that you need to either use a million coats to get a good look, or you have to use it over another color.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good look on nails &amp; toes</li>
            <li>When I seen this color I loved it.</li>
            <li>I loved the nail polish I purchased from this seller.</li>

            <li>Its verrrrrrry bright which I love</li>

            <li>, i could see the part where my nails grow but all in all i liked the color</li>
            <li>Even at the nail salon they had to do four coats to get the China Glaze color to look nice.</li>
            <li>I am loving this polish.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a nice color</li>
            <li>Super bright and cute nail polish!</li>
            <li>Just add a top coat</li>
            <li>love  love love love  </li>
            <li>but once you put it on it takes 3 coats to reach the color most like the one in the bottle... even with three coats though</li>
            <li>The formula is okay</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments on this color.</li>
            <li>water bulls eye nail art and this neon yellow polish did a great job!</li>

            <li>Awesome color, but can only get it with about 4 coats.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this color.</li>
            <li>I cannot express how much I love this polish.</li>
            <li>I love this color.</li>
            <li>but I love it :)</li>
            <li>I love the color</li>
            <li>Love the color</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy again :) :)</li>
            <li>so I thought it was one of the better ones.</li>
            <li>I love the color of this nail polish.</li>
            <li>It stayed sticking on the edges, though, so I was able to keep wearing it.</li>
            <li>I expect better of my polishes.</li>
            <li>but you need the right topcoat to make it look good and stand out.</li>
            <li>This is a good nail polish, but it doesn&#x27;t show very much.</li>
            <li>The color looks really funky and bright in the bottle which i love</li>
            <li>cute cute cute right?</li>
            <li>This nail polish is super fast drying which is great if you&#x27;re in a hurry</li>
            <li>I had high hopes because this color is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>It does take about 4 good coats but it is well worth it because it does dry fast and looks great!</li>
            <li>I used it with bright yellow and royal blue and it turned out perfect!</li>
            <li>Definitely an accent color or if you&#x27;ve got a great tan, a fantastic showing off color.</li>
            <li>Takes about two coats for it to look smooth and even.</li>
            <li>This color was even more colorful</li>
            <li>The price is great and it got to my house almost the next day.</li>
            <li>Need a very shiny topcoat and all mistakes show!!!</li>
            <li>Works even better if you put a clear gloss on top of it.</li>
            <li>Some people mentioned a problem with the color itself, not being true to the bottle color and having to use a million coats.  </li>
            <li>It looks just as good on the nail as in the bottle, which earned it the second star.</li>
            <li>It is kind of clear.</li>
            <li>The Sinful Colors brand that they used last time only took 3 coats and I kind of liked it better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite formula, but it&#x27;s still a decent neon nail polish.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s exactly how I want it!</li>
            <li>China Glaze is by far my favorite brand when it comes to nail polish and this color was no exception.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>But like I said, it&#x27;s fun and funky.</li>
            <li>After the first full day, it was already chipped.</li>
            <li>It also dries pretty matte so if you want a shiny finish you will have to use a clear top coat.     </li>
            <li>Although I think this color looks better on more dark tone people it is still pretty.</li>
            <li>The color was SO bright that I had to cover it with a crackle teal in order to tone it down.</li>
            <li>Then later I coated it with another layer of this color and it came out a lot better.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, this color is really funky and summery, it&#x27;s like I painted my nails with a highlighter!</li>
            <li>and then I would agree that at first glance it seems that way.  </li>
            <li>I love China Glaze nail polishes, so when I found this neon yellow color, I could not resist.  </li>
            <li>Great but had to apply at least three coats for the color to pop.</li>
            <li>The product looked exactly like the pictures</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really runny and streaky, it just looks junky!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen a better yellow in three decades of wearing nail polish.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even get through the first day on this before I could see it peeling away, bubbling in places.</li>
            <li>OK, it&#x27;s not my favorite color; but it is fun and funky!&lt;br /&gt;There is NOT good color saturation, I had to use no less than 3 coats to get a good blazing yellow.</li>
            <li>Yes, the color is striking and it looks incredible on the nails, but it&#x27;ll only last you a few hours.</li>
            <li>bought a neon for a $1 at a store, and if I had to pick I&#x27;d honestly choose the other though!</li>
            <li>It comes out very matte looking, you definitely need a shiny top coat to make it look decent.</li>
            <li>but it builds really well</li>
            <li>This really helped bring out the vibrancy of the color.</li>
            <li>but I wish it didn&#x27;t chip so fast.</li>
            <li>Dries fast, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>*Don&#x27;t* apply this nail polish without first applying a coat of white polish to the nail first.</li>
            <li>I had to do multiple coats (more than 2) for getting a solid color w/o streaking.</li>
            <li>It is a fun color to wear along in the summer time OR you can wear it with a black shatter (crackle) polish on top and bring out your inner reptile (reptile from mortal kombat).</li>
            <li>At first, i was concerned on how vibrant the color would be ( I am going for a highlighter yellow/ neon yellow color) as well as the quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m okay with this, though, because it dries fast even with 3 or 4 coats and doesn&#x27;t feel thick or tacky.</li>
            <li>I would give 5 stars if you did not have to do the white coats first.</li>
            <li>The color is pretty and it is definitely neon</li>
            <li>The color to describe it exactly is highlighter yellow.</li>
            <li>but it seriously takes 3-4 coats to get the color on your fingernail and then after going over it that many times its really streaky.</li>
            <li>this color, its kind of thin but as long as you put multiple coats your fine</li>
            <li>It is a perfect neon yellow color, I am sad that summer is almost over, because I want to wear this all year long!</li>
            <li>By the third day it was chipping in large sections and I was doing hurried spot repair, trying to get five days out of it.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the brightest yellow polish i&#x27;ve ever seen it reminds you of a highlighter</li>
            <li>Its a nightmare as far as shade and streaking.</li>
            <li>B0080P3EBE Sinful Colors Professional Nail Polish Enamel 56 Neon Melon]]</li>
            <li>real problem, however, showed up not twelve hours later.</li>
            <li>When I got it it was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>It looked pretty rough on the fifth day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very translucent, so I put a coat of white nail polish underneath, and then two coats of Yellow Polka Dot Bikini.</li>
            <li>and i knew that yellow would really  complement my skin tone, so i bought this Yellow Polka Dot Bikini nail polish.</li>
            <li>its very watery and not thick at all causing uneven application</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better if you apply a white base to let the yellow stand out, otherwise it takes five or more coats to hide your nailbed color.</li>
            <li>Very watered down.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to young colored girls who want a little summery yellow glow on their nails!</li>
            <li>Now I was a little skeptical when I first came across this color due to some of the reviews but in the end I am thrilled with this purchase.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m okay with this, though, because it dries fast even with 3 or 4 coats and doesn&#x27;t feel thick or tacky.</li>
            <li> I would give 5 stars if you did not have to do the white coats first.</li>
            <li> The color is pretty and it is definitely neon</li>
            <li> The color to describe it exactly is highlighter yellow.</li>
            <li> but it seriously takes 3-4 coats to get the color on your fingernail and then after going over it that many times its really streaky.</li>
            <li> this color, its kind of thin but as long as you put multiple coats your fine</li>
            <li> It is a perfect neon yellow color, I am sad that summer is almost over, because I want to wear this all year long!</li>
            <li> By the third day it was chipping in large sections and I was doing hurried spot repair, trying to get five days out of it.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the brightest yellow polish i&#x27;ve ever seen it reminds you of a highlighter</li>
            <li> Its a nightmare as far as shade and streaking.</li>
            <li> B0080P3EBE Sinful Colors Professional Nail Polish Enamel 56 Neon Melon]]</li>
            <li> real problem, however, showed up not twelve hours later.</li>
            <li> When I got it it was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> It looked pretty rough on the fifth day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very translucent, so I put a coat of white nail polish underneath, and then two coats of Yellow Polka Dot Bikini.</li>
            <li> and i knew that yellow would really  complement my skin tone, so i bought this Yellow Polka Dot Bikini nail polish.</li>
            <li> its very watery and not thick at all causing uneven application</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better if you apply a white base to let the yellow stand out, otherwise it takes five or more coats to hide your nailbed color.</li>
            <li> Very watered down.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to young colored girls who want a little summery yellow glow on their nails!</li>
            <li> Now I was a little skeptical when I first came across this color due to some of the reviews but in the end I am thrilled with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> I got this color in hopes of it being as opaque and bright neon as it is in the bottle, but was disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very streaky, I either have to carefully apply many thin coats, or just do one THICK coat that takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> Is much product for very few manicure</li>
            <li> I was doing my toes in this color, did about 5 coats, then got frustrated and covered it with a layer of a more opaque, general yellow color.</li>
            <li> When I first got it and painted it on my bare nails I found myself to be disappointed but after playing around a little I found that if you put a single coat of white nail polish on BEFORE using this nail polish the color will be true to the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Base and topcoats are a must, as well, because it&#x27;s a little chippy, but with them, lasts great.</li>
            <li> It actually took less than a week for me to receive it.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that it is a bit thinner than other China Glaze polishes and requires a few extra coats for maximum opacity and color payoff.</li>
            <li> Well first I must say that person was a little dramatic</li>
            <li> but you will need around 4 coats to make it look true to the color in the bottle or you will need to use a white base color to make the color pop.</li>
            <li> I use a top and base coat also.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for the other colors, but Yellow Polka Dot Bikini is not a good polish.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I had it on my toes for a few weeks and would always get comments on it, and lots of &amp;#34;Do</li>
            <li> The color in the pic is neon green</li>
            <li> Wanted the neon green color.</li>
            <li> It was streaky and uneven in some parts.</li>
            <li> At least at first, then I thought about using a white nail polish as a base coat.</li>
            <li> I used a sticky base coat that usually makes all polish stay with only minor chipping after a few days of wear.</li>
            <li> I found it necessary to have a white base coat to make the color pop.</li>
            <li> but you need to put on at least 3 coats and it still seems thin in areas</li>
            <li> The matte formula makes it look really weird and dull without one.</li>
            <li> Seems acetone was added to thin it out.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really thin</li>
            <li> It makes the color seriously neon!</li>
            <li> and i ended up having to wipe it all off and use a different color because it looked horrible.</li>
            <li> It is weird.  </li>
            <li> poor quality!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very thin..</li>
            <li> When it was dry it looked horrible.</li>
            <li> But the problem is when you layer so thick it still looks horrible at the end :(</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> bought this as a present for my boyfriend&#x27;s sister&#x27;s graduation from beauty school. Hasn&#x27;t gotten it yet but I can&#x27;t wait to give it to her. hope she likes it</li>
            <li> Very watered down. Seems acetone was added to thin it out.</li>
            <li> I saw this color and thought it was awesome because it was so bright.     The downside to this nail polish is that you need to either use a million coats to get a good look, or you have to use it over another color. I was doing my toes in this color, did about 5 coats, then got frustrated and covered it with a layer of a more opaque, general yellow color. Then later I coated it with another layer of this color and it came out a lot better. It also dries pretty matte so if you want a shiny finish you will have to use a clear top coat.     Otherwise, this color is really funky and summery, it&#x27;s like I painted my nails with a highlighter!</li>
            <li> China Glaze is by far my favorite brand when it comes to nail polish and this color was no exception.  Now I was a little skeptical when I first came across this color due to some of the reviews but in the end I am thrilled with this purchase.  Some people mentioned a problem with the color itself, not being true to the bottle color and having to use a million coats.  Well first I must say that person was a little dramatic and then I would agree that at first glance it seems that way.  When I first got it and painted it on my bare nails I found myself to be disappointed but after playing around a little I found that if you put a single coat of white nail polish on BEFORE using this nail polish the color will be true to the bottle.  You&#x27;ll still need to use about three coats of this but trust me it&#x27;s worth it.  This nail polish is super fast drying which is great if you&#x27;re in a hurry but I will mention that it has a matte like finish, if you&#x27;re not into that don&#x27;t let that stop you from buying this!  Just add a top coat and you&#x27;ll be good to go. :)</li>
            <li> To get the desired color, I did two coats of a white polish and then two coats of this yellow.  Once done though, it looks AMAZING!  Highlighter yellow!  I would give 5 stars if you did not have to do the white coats first.</li>
            <li> This color is VERY sheer, after about 5 coats you will finally get an opaque color and then it peels off in about a day. Definitely avoid this nail polish.</li>
            <li> The description for the item gives the correct details 100%</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really thin but it builds really well</li>
            <li> OK, it&#x27;s not my favorite color; but it is fun and funky!&lt;br /&gt;There is NOT good color saturation, I had to use no less than 3 coats to get a good blazing yellow. The color was SO bright that I had to cover it with a crackle teal in order to tone it down. And even then, it looks like HULK SMASH all over my fingers. But like I said, it&#x27;s fun and funky. Definitely an accent color or if you&#x27;ve got a great tan, a fantastic showing off color.</li>
            <li> I had to put on 5 coats to make it so you couldn&#x27;t see my nails through the color, then it chipped the next day!</li>
            <li> love  love love love  this color, its kind of thin but as long as you put multiple coats your fine</li>
            <li> I found it necessary to have a white base coat to make the color pop. The matte formula makes it look really weird and dull without one. It&#x27;s very streaky, I either have to carefully apply many thin coats, or just do one THICK coat that takes forever to dry. It&#x27;s not my favorite formula, but it&#x27;s still a decent neon nail polish.</li>
            <li> I love China Glaze nail polishes, so when I found this neon yellow color, I could not resist.  It is so incredibly neon, I couldn&#x27;t stop staring at my toes after they were painted.  I would definitely recommend this for purchase.</li>
            <li> The color looks really funky and bright in the bottle which i love but once you put it on it takes 3 coats to reach the color most like the one in the bottle... even with three coats though, i could see the part where my nails grow but all in all i liked the color</li>
            <li> I got this color in hopes of it being as opaque and bright neon as it is in the bottle, but was disappointed. At least at first, then I thought about using a white nail polish as a base coat. This really helped bring out the vibrancy of the color. The formula is okay, it took several coats to get me the opacity I wanted, but it didn&#x27;t clump or peel.</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many compliments on this color. It is very translucent, so I put a coat of white nail polish underneath, and then two coats of Yellow Polka Dot Bikini. It is a perfect neon yellow color, I am sad that summer is almost over, because I want to wear this all year long!</li>
            <li> cute cute cute right? but it seriously takes 3-4 coats to get the color on your fingernail and then after going over it that many times its really streaky. its very watery and not thick at all causing uneven application and like i said streaking. I used this for a manicure once and i ended up having to wipe it all off and use a different color because it looked horrible.</li>
            <li> The color is pretty and it is definitely neon but you will need around 4 coats to make it look true to the color in the bottle or you will need to use a white base color to make the color pop. I gave it a 3 because it is a bit sheer and you have to layer it on to get it to look opaque.</li>
            <li> I just learned how to make water bulls eye nail art and this neon yellow polish did a great job! It&#x27;s so bright and that&#x27;s exactly how I want it! I used it with bright yellow and royal blue and it turned out perfect!</li>
            <li> the color is great, but after buying two colors of China Glaze, I do not like the finish.  It is weird.  Not recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this color polish. It is the best neon yellow I&#x27;ve come across and it definitely makes a statement. I have noticed that it is a bit thinner than other China Glaze polishes and requires a few extra coats for maximum opacity and color payoff. I&#x27;m okay with this, though, because it dries fast even with 3 or 4 coats and doesn&#x27;t feel thick or tacky. Also, it&#x27;s UV reactive and glows under backlights, which is definitely awesome.</li>
            <li> For once here on Amazon, it actually looks and comes on as it looks in the picture!&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s very thin.. I needed about 4 coats and i could still see the white under my nail, and it comes on streaky.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a neon for a $1 at a store, and if I had to pick I&#x27;d honestly choose the other though!</li>
            <li> I like it a lot but you need to put on at least 3 coats and it still seems thin in areas but I love bright colors so im glad its been added to my collection.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this polish. This is the only  neon polish that I used that actually comes out looking neon. It does take about 4 good coats but it is well worth it because it does dry fast and looks great!</li>
            <li> Perfect! Actually what it looks like online. Great buy!</li>
            <li> bought this for my daughter who loves nail polish and does her nails daily, she chose this and she likes it.</li>
            <li> Super bright and cute nail polish! Takes about two coats for it to look smooth and even. Love the color and the brightness.</li>
            <li> poor quality! took 10 coats to show the color!</li>
            <li> China glaze nail polish are excellent in color and texture, the shipping and price are very good. Is much product for very few manicure</li>
            <li> This color was even more colorful then i thought. I love it.Works even better if you put a clear gloss on top of it.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the brightest yellow polish i&#x27;ve ever seen it reminds you of a highlighter it&#x27;s that bright it&#x27;s a good look on nails &amp; toes I love china glaze nail polish try it you&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
            <li> Awesome color, but can only get it with about 4 coats. Its a nightmare as far as shade and streaking.</li>
            <li> At first, i was concerned on how vibrant the color would be ( I am going for a highlighter yellow/ neon yellow color) as well as the quality. But with 2 coats of this color and my worries were all washed way. I am so pleased with this color. If you are considering this neon yellow color than look no further. I cannot express how much I love this polish.</li>
            <li> I love this color. After getting a manicure with [[ASIN:B0080P3EBE Sinful Colors Professional Nail Polish Enamel 56 Neon Melon]] I bought this China Glaze polish to try to replicate it. Even at the nail salon they had to do four coats to get the China Glaze color to look nice. That&#x27;s a lot of work. The Sinful Colors brand that they used last time only took 3 coats and I kind of liked it better. But either way it&#x27;s awesome and I get tons of compliments on it!</li>
            <li> It is a bit translucent and you will need like 3-4 layers if you dont&#x27; wanna see your nail beneath it. Its verrrrrrry bright which I love and I get a lot of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible!!!!! The color to describe it exactly is highlighter yellow. It doesn&#x27;t cover evenly. Even with 3 coats it&#x27;s blotchy. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I&#x27;m sticking to opi or essie</li>
            <li> This nail color is outstanding! Im a teen of color and i knew that yellow would really  complement my skin tone, so i bought this Yellow Polka Dot Bikini nail polish. I fell in love &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 i just bought it a week ago and i&#x27;ve recieved so mamy complements about it. I highly recommend it to young colored girls who want a little summery yellow glow on their nails!</li>
            <li> *Don&#x27;t* apply this nail polish without first applying a coat of white polish to the nail first. It makes the color seriously neon! I had it on my toes for a few weeks and would always get comments on it, and lots of &amp;#34;Do they glow in the dark?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Love this polish.</li>
            <li> Great but had to apply at least three coats for the color to pop. I am definitely using this for the rest of the summer</li>
            <li> The color in the pic is neon green and it&#x27;s yellow in the bottle when I received it. Wanted the neon green color.</li>
            <li> When I seen this color I loved it. When I got it it was exactly what I expected. I did have to apply several coats but I love it :)</li>
            <li> I love the color but I wish it didn&#x27;t chip so fast. I use a top and base coat also.</li>
            <li> Although I think this color looks better on more dark tone people it is still pretty. Basically anything china glaze is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> Love the color but you need the right topcoat to make it look good and stand out. Need a very shiny topcoat and all mistakes show!!!</li>
            <li> I loved the nail polish I purchased from this seller. It came the very next week. It actually took less than a week for me to receive it. The product looked exactly like the pictures and I received it in perfect conditions. I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE!!! I&#x27;m going to buy again :) :)</li>
            <li> I bought this brand of nail polish because it&#x27;s used at my nail salon so I thought it was one of the better ones. I can&#x27;t speak for the other colors, but Yellow Polka Dot Bikini is not a good polish. It comes out very matte looking, you definitely need a shiny top coat to make it look decent. It&#x27;s really runny and streaky, it just looks junky!</li>
            <li> I had to do multiple coats (more than 2) for getting a solid color w/o streaking. But the problem is when you layer so thick it still looks horrible at the end :( Too bad. I had high hopes because this color is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I love the color of this nail polish. It is a fun color to wear along in the summer time OR you can wear it with a black shatter (crackle) polish on top and bring out your inner reptile (reptile from mortal kombat). The price is great and it got to my house almost the next day. Thank you.</li>
            <li> not like they say it does crack and chip\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been warned that CG wasn&#x27;t the best polish, but the color! I&#x27;ve never seen a better yellow in three decades of wearing nail polish. It looks just as good on the nail as in the bottle, which earned it the second star. It&#x27;s better if you apply a white base to let the yellow stand out, otherwise it takes five or more coats to hide your nailbed color. Dries fast, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real problem, however, showed up not twelve hours later. I used a sticky base coat that usually makes all polish stay with only minor chipping after a few days of wear. I didn&#x27;t even get through the first day on this before I could see it peeling away, bubbling in places. It stayed sticking on the edges, though, so I was able to keep wearing it. After the first full day, it was already chipped. By the third day it was chipping in large sections and I was doing hurried spot repair, trying to get five days out of it. It looked pretty rough on the fifth day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just can&#x27;t recommend this one. Yes, the color is striking and it looks incredible on the nails, but it&#x27;ll only last you a few hours. I expect better of my polishes.</li>
            <li> This color is great, but you&#x27;re going to need a lot of coats, because this is sheeeeer. Base and topcoats are a must, as well, because it&#x27;s a little chippy, but with them, lasts great. I am loving this polish.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with the way it goes on. It was streaky and uneven in some parts. I thought it was sucky. When it was dry it looked horrible.</li>
            <li> This is a good nail polish, but it doesn&#x27;t show very much. It is kind of clear. I have to put 3 layers for it to show. but it&#x27;s a nice color</li>
            <li> Great price, product, and shipping arrival timing!</li>
