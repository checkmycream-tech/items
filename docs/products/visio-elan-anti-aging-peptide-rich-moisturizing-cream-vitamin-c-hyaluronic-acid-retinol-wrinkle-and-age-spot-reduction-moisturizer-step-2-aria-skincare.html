            <li>Someone else wrote “powerhouse” and that’s an apt description because of all the peptides.</li>
            <li>I was offered this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>and they were honestly concerned</li>
            <li>Great company, fast service with great packaging.</li>
            <li>As in another review I wrote, this product feels nice on skin</li>
            <li>so I can’t say how it works on its own.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using both the serum and moisturizer that my daughter was so kind to purchase for me.</li>
            <li>and they do seem to be quite effective.</li>
            <li>After seeing Dr. Oz&#x27;s program talking about peptides, I researched to find a good product with the most peptides.  </li>
            <li>I give it 3 stars because of the nice customer service and delivery on time.</li>
            <li>Great product, item as described, very useful.</li>
            <li>Very nice and smooth cream.</li>
            <li>The service is more than exceptional.</li>
            <li>Pleasant  scent and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>and I love that is contains many leaf juices and extracts on the ingredient label!  </li>
            <li>Customer service is far and away the best I&#x27;ve encountered..</li>
            <li>So far this product is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 75 yrs old &amp; I have tried all of the creams the industry ever made &amp; this is the best.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a reduction in fine lines but almost immediately noticed my eyes looked more refreshed!</li>
            <li>The moisturizer is very light and soothing.  </li>
            <li>How many companies do you know that do that?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all Visio Elan products for several months and very happy with how my skin looks.</li>
            <li>My skin is looking better and better each day.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Use it at night and my skin looks better already</li>
            <li>This is my favorite moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I love how it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks healthy and radiant.  </li>
            <li>Love this on top of the Firming Serum.  </li>
            <li>She was on top of the latest research and then some.</li>
            <li>I love that the products are freash as well with their expiration dates stamped on the bottom.</li>
            <li>How REFRESHING is that idea?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hope more products are made for the rest of my body and hair</li>
            <li>BUT after using for 3 weeks I LOVE this and will reorder.</li>
            <li>This was OK, but I didnt notice any improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>so I anticipate more results.</li>
            <li>Phew, learned more about peptides, wrinkles and skincare than any man would care to know.  </li>
            <li>If “peptides” are this magical ingredient to removing lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li>Love it :)</li>
            <li>I feel the effectiveness of this products since I used it more that a month ago.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>You’ll be glad you have both.</li>
            <li>I am using both the serum and cream and pleased with results.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The skin on my face also looks and feels better.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more firmer</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>I got lucky purchasing this and the serum for my wife who is thrilled.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m seeing tightening is becoming permanent</li>
            <li>It goes in easily and makes my skin immediately softer.</li>
            <li>so the decision was easy.</li>
            <li>It feels feels satiny and covers easily.</li>
            <li>Good product, works as described, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>, then it stood to reason the more peptides the better, right?  </li>
            <li>Both arrived on time nicely wrapped in a pretty box.  </li>
            <li>The serum is fine</li>
            <li>I see a decrease in fine lines and wrinkles both</li>
            <li>I can visibly see skin tightening making pores and fine lines diminish.</li>
            <li>The fine lines are almost gone.  </li>
            <li>So far this is an excellent moisturizer for the price and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Wrinkles around my eyes and mouth have disappeared and my skin is silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>Smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>Paraben free appealed to me, too.</li>
            <li>It has a clean scent, goes on easy</li>
            <li>I wrote more under the peptide serum that goes with this peptide moisturizer but just want to say this system combination is really a powerful one that works wonders.</li>
            <li>It has only been 10 days, yet I feel something great is happening.</li>
            <li>Nice product with all the &amp;#34;good stuff&amp;#34; for a reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>Makeup goes on over it smoothly.</li>
            <li>My skin felt smooth and a bit firmer to the touch too.</li>
            <li>It is light, soothing, and just glides on.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>company has been very diligent with follow-up to make sure I am using product correctly and that I am completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I’ve tried many skincare products for at 50 years old, the lines are becoming more pronounced.  </li>
            <li>This was a first for me, for sure.  </li>
            <li>After using this product for two weeks, my skin has brightened significantly.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer is light and absorbs quickly as does the serum.  </li>
            <li>My friends, whom I have not seen in many months, noticed how nice my skin looked recently.  </li>
            <li>The cream is light and absorbs quickly with no stickiness or residue after it dries.  </li>
            <li>Makes my dry skin feel amazing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been just a couple of weeks, and I see tremendous</li>
            <li>I apply the serum which absorbs quickly and then add the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>No face plumping and the fine wrinkles around my mouth are still very visible.</li>
            <li>I am getting great results without having to slather heavy night creams on.</li>
            <li>I am 61 years old and have many flaws in my skin.</li>
            <li>This duo is well worth your time and money, so try it.</li>
            <li>The cost is a splurge for me, but I know it is worth it from my results.</li>
            <li>and so far I am pleased.</li>
            <li>combination of hyaluronic acid with 3 peptides in the serum and 2 in the moisturizer makes this a powerful combo.</li>
            <li>but now I do still smile a lot</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products from this brand while on my hunt for a good anti-aging skin care line for myself.</li>
            <li>Just the right thickness.</li>
            <li>apply my makeup right after the cream</li>
            <li>I really liked their other stuff, so I was excited to try this as well.</li>
            <li>I actually talked to the head of the company ( very easy to do as she answers each and every customer inquiry)</li>
            <li>After using both the Aria &#x27;regenerating cream&#x27; and &#x27;firming serum,&#x27; my skin is significantly smoother and softer and I am pleased that, even after 2 heatwaves, my skin is &amp;#34;comfortable&amp;#34; rather than oily, which it has been most of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any skin breakouts from applying either of these two products - especially a moisturizer - to my entire face.  </li>
            <li>Both dry quickly, feel very light and are easily absorbed.  </li>
            <li>The dispensing pump is tight which is good as it prevents wasting the cream.  </li>
            <li>I really likebit ,plan on recording soon!</li>
            <li>Makes my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Most people think I am 10 to 12 years younger</li>
            <li>At first I have to say for the money</li>
            <li>The best part was when I emailed my initial disappointment I was kindly greeted by Lois in CS at Aria</li>
            <li>I was expecting the same result except when I looked in the mirror and my skin cells looked plump, moisturized and a bit more energized.</li>
            <li>and it goes on smoothly, leaving my skin with a soft glow.</li>
            <li>After using the facial scrub, cream and serum for 6 weeks more, I still didn&#x27;t see any improvements.  </li>
            <li>Same results, but price much better.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and the product even came with a nice little velour draw-string bag.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>I will have re-order frequently, which will be too costly to maintain over a significant period of time</li>
            <li>The moisturizer is really good and didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling oily but after about 4 hours, my face looked like an oil slick.  </li>
            <li>I was definitely excited by what I saw in only the first use.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much Aria.</li>
            <li>It really seems to improve my skin..</li>
            <li>Returned the moisturizer and received credit very promptly.  </li>
            <li>The cream makes my face feel very moist.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a change in the size of some of my pores, but the biggest thing is that my face looks all-around brighter.</li>
            <li>In my opinion this product works very well in combination with the serum.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to any body who really want to take beter care of the skin they are in</li>
            <li>It Really firms, tightens your skin.</li>
            <li>I did not see much improvement</li>
            <li>I think I was just expecting way too much on results from using this product.  </li>
            <li>This item has changed my skin so much that my customers can really see the change my skin is getting firmer to me</li>
            <li>I will recommend this product my skin really glows.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>Not only that, but the president of the company  takes her own personal time to see how I was doing with the products.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more in the near future.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that in combination so far with the Aria Tri-Peptide Collagen Serum product (sold separately), from the first morning after application, I woke up with my skin feeling more moisturized than it has in a long time.</li>
            <li>Wow, what  a glorioys sensation!!!</li>
            <li>Notice positive difference in skin, but price too high.  </li>
            <li>A lot of peptides, collagen and hyualronic acid with natural botanicals is rare to find and I am a skincare junkie who’s always looking at new products.</li>
            <li>I have always looked 20 years younger than my true age</li>
            <li>“the skin color of my face has drastically become more uniform, reducing dark spots.</li>
            <li>Maybe for some it will work better, but I went by the recommendations of the usage hoping for better results over the months and honestly, IF there were improvements, they were so tiny that I just remained disappointed.</li>
            <li>Copper works well in older skin and a thicker cream</li>
            <li>I am getting older</li>
            <li>, goes beyond normal customer service and truly believes in what they sell get these products.  </li>
            <li>I had really deep laugh lines</li>
            <li>Last but not least, the products are very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>so this was really new to me.  </li>
            <li>Sent new pictures so show no improvements, but have not heard from anyone.  </li>
            <li>has slowed the signs on my face down tremendously!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many anti aging moisturing creams in the past but none compares to this.  </li>
            <li>I was anxious to try the Visio Elan Anti Aging Peptide moisturizer because I was already using the Visio Elan firming serum which I love.  </li>
            <li>First time I used it , it felt like all my face was getting smaller</li>
            <li>Makeup helps a lot, but bare face really shows the problems.</li>
            <li>It is a 1oz bottle, but seems like it will last a good amount of time since you only need a small pea-sized amount.  </li>
            <li>Like it very much so far.  </li>
            <li>I am 73 years old and my crows feet are gone.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and firmer with this.</li>
            <li>Visio Elan helped me find a solution that will help to restore the natural oils in my skin and  allow me to use the Aria skin care line going forward.  </li>
            <li>So far I can tell no difference in skin, wrinkles, or age spots.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft all over</li>
            <li>The moisturizer leaves my skin soft and glowing.</li>
            <li>but I had to write a review so far.</li>
            <li>Yes my skin felt soft, but no improvements on the wrinkles/lines or sun spots.  </li>
            <li>Sticking with NCN Professional.  </li>
            <li>I am hoping for gradual, albeit probably more slow that what I would really like (instant, actually!).&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The cream has a very rich silky texture so It took only a few days to see a noticeable difference in the peeling and smoothness of my forehead and face.</li>
            <li>I apply Aria Serum first and let that dry for 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li>With the first application, I knew this cream would help heal my dry, sun-damaged skin.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a surprise and historically not typical for my complexion.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone starting to see signs of aging.</li>
            <li>I have seen a major improvement in the over all tone in my skin and the lines around my mouth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not a heavy cream but moisturizes just the same.</li>
            <li>I normally wake up with dry skin even after I&#x27;ve cleaned and applied a bunch of &#x27;greasy&#x27; product on it the night before.</li>
            <li>So I started using it every other day, but I think that was still too much for my skin.  </li>
            <li>does absorb well and is not oily, ordered a second bottle because it does not last long enough to give reasonable time to see results.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I purchased the Aria Peptide Moisturizer and Serum because I heard that peptides do wonderful things for your skin.</li>

            <li> I use the Visio Elan serum and this Anti Aging Face Cream and they are wonderful.</li>

            <li> The serum is amazing in that you feel your skin tighten immediately.</li>
            <li> Amazing company amazing products.  </li>
            <li> and I gotta tell you about the amazing results.</li>
            <li> Someone else wrote “powerhouse” and that’s an apt description because of all the peptides.</li>
            <li> I was offered this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> and they were honestly concerned</li>
            <li> Great company, fast service with great packaging.</li>
            <li> As in another review I wrote, this product feels nice on skin</li>
            <li> so I can’t say how it works on its own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using both the serum and moisturizer that my daughter was so kind to purchase for me.</li>
            <li> and they do seem to be quite effective.</li>
            <li> After seeing Dr. Oz&#x27;s program talking about peptides, I researched to find a good product with the most peptides.  </li>
            <li> I give it 3 stars because of the nice customer service and delivery on time.</li>
            <li> Great product, item as described, very useful.</li>
            <li> Very nice and smooth cream.</li>
            <li> The service is more than exceptional.</li>
            <li> Pleasant  scent and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> and I love that is contains many leaf juices and extracts on the ingredient label!  </li>
            <li> Customer service is far and away the best I&#x27;ve encountered..</li>
            <li> So far this product is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 75 yrs old &amp; I have tried all of the creams the industry ever made &amp; this is the best.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a reduction in fine lines but almost immediately noticed my eyes looked more refreshed!</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is very light and soothing.  </li>
            <li> How many companies do you know that do that?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all Visio Elan products for several months and very happy with how my skin looks.</li>
            <li> My skin is looking better and better each day.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Use it at night and my skin looks better already</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I love how it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks healthy and radiant.  </li>
            <li> Love this on top of the Firming Serum.  </li>
            <li> She was on top of the latest research and then some.</li>
            <li> I love that the products are freash as well with their expiration dates stamped on the bottom.</li>
            <li> How REFRESHING is that idea?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope more products are made for the rest of my body and hair</li>
            <li> BUT after using for 3 weeks I LOVE this and will reorder.</li>
            <li> This was OK, but I didnt notice any improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> so I anticipate more results.</li>
            <li> Phew, learned more about peptides, wrinkles and skincare than any man would care to know.  </li>
            <li> If “peptides” are this magical ingredient to removing lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li> Love it :)</li>
            <li> I feel the effectiveness of this products since I used it more that a month ago.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> You’ll be glad you have both.</li>
            <li> I am using both the serum and cream and pleased with results.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> The skin on my face also looks and feels better.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s more firmer</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> I got lucky purchasing this and the serum for my wife who is thrilled.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m seeing tightening is becoming permanent</li>
            <li> It goes in easily and makes my skin immediately softer.</li>
            <li> so the decision was easy.</li>
            <li> It feels feels satiny and covers easily.</li>
            <li> Good product, works as described, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> , then it stood to reason the more peptides the better, right?  </li>
            <li> Both arrived on time nicely wrapped in a pretty box.  </li>
            <li> The serum is fine</li>
            <li> I see a decrease in fine lines and wrinkles both</li>
            <li> I can visibly see skin tightening making pores and fine lines diminish.</li>
            <li> The fine lines are almost gone.  </li>
            <li> So far this is an excellent moisturizer for the price and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Wrinkles around my eyes and mouth have disappeared and my skin is silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> Smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Paraben free appealed to me, too.</li>
            <li> It has a clean scent, goes on easy</li>
            <li> I wrote more under the peptide serum that goes with this peptide moisturizer but just want to say this system combination is really a powerful one that works wonders.</li>
            <li> It has only been 10 days, yet I feel something great is happening.</li>
            <li> Nice product with all the &amp;#34;good stuff&amp;#34; for a reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> Makeup goes on over it smoothly.</li>
            <li> My skin felt smooth and a bit firmer to the touch too.</li>
            <li> It is light, soothing, and just glides on.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> company has been very diligent with follow-up to make sure I am using product correctly and that I am completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I’ve tried many skincare products for at 50 years old, the lines are becoming more pronounced.  </li>
            <li> This was a first for me, for sure.  </li>
            <li> After using this product for two weeks, my skin has brightened significantly.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is light and absorbs quickly as does the serum.  </li>
            <li> My friends, whom I have not seen in many months, noticed how nice my skin looked recently.  </li>
            <li> The cream is light and absorbs quickly with no stickiness or residue after it dries.  </li>
            <li> Makes my dry skin feel amazing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been just a couple of weeks, and I see tremendous</li>
            <li> I apply the serum which absorbs quickly and then add the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> No face plumping and the fine wrinkles around my mouth are still very visible.</li>
            <li> I am getting great results without having to slather heavy night creams on.</li>
            <li> I am 61 years old and have many flaws in my skin.</li>
            <li> This duo is well worth your time and money, so try it.</li>
            <li> The cost is a splurge for me, but I know it is worth it from my results.</li>
            <li> and so far I am pleased.</li>
            <li> combination of hyaluronic acid with 3 peptides in the serum and 2 in the moisturizer makes this a powerful combo.</li>
            <li> but now I do still smile a lot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products from this brand while on my hunt for a good anti-aging skin care line for myself.</li>
            <li> Just the right thickness.</li>
            <li> apply my makeup right after the cream</li>
            <li> I really liked their other stuff, so I was excited to try this as well.</li>
            <li> I actually talked to the head of the company ( very easy to do as she answers each and every customer inquiry)</li>
            <li> After using both the Aria &#x27;regenerating cream&#x27; and &#x27;firming serum,&#x27; my skin is significantly smoother and softer and I am pleased that, even after 2 heatwaves, my skin is &amp;#34;comfortable&amp;#34; rather than oily, which it has been most of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any skin breakouts from applying either of these two products - especially a moisturizer - to my entire face.  </li>
            <li> Both dry quickly, feel very light and are easily absorbed.  </li>
            <li> The dispensing pump is tight which is good as it prevents wasting the cream.  </li>
            <li> I really likebit ,plan on recording soon!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Most people think I am 10 to 12 years younger</li>
            <li> At first I have to say for the money</li>
            <li> The best part was when I emailed my initial disappointment I was kindly greeted by Lois in CS at Aria</li>
            <li> I was expecting the same result except when I looked in the mirror and my skin cells looked plump, moisturized and a bit more energized.</li>
            <li> and it goes on smoothly, leaving my skin with a soft glow.</li>
            <li> After using the facial scrub, cream and serum for 6 weeks more, I still didn&#x27;t see any improvements.  </li>
            <li> Same results, but price much better.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and the product even came with a nice little velour draw-string bag.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!!</li>
            <li> I will have re-order frequently, which will be too costly to maintain over a significant period of time</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is really good and didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling oily but after about 4 hours, my face looked like an oil slick.  </li>
            <li> I was definitely excited by what I saw in only the first use.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much Aria.</li>
            <li> It really seems to improve my skin..</li>
            <li> Returned the moisturizer and received credit very promptly.  </li>
            <li> The cream makes my face feel very moist.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a change in the size of some of my pores, but the biggest thing is that my face looks all-around brighter.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this product works very well in combination with the serum.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to any body who really want to take beter care of the skin they are in</li>
            <li> It Really firms, tightens your skin.</li>
            <li> I did not see much improvement</li>
            <li> I think I was just expecting way too much on results from using this product.  </li>
            <li> This item has changed my skin so much that my customers can really see the change my skin is getting firmer to me</li>
            <li> I will recommend this product my skin really glows.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> Not only that, but the president of the company  takes her own personal time to see how I was doing with the products.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more in the near future.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that in combination so far with the Aria Tri-Peptide Collagen Serum product (sold separately), from the first morning after application, I woke up with my skin feeling more moisturized than it has in a long time.</li>
            <li> Wow, what  a glorioys sensation!!!</li>
            <li> Notice positive difference in skin, but price too high.  </li>
            <li> A lot of peptides, collagen and hyualronic acid with natural botanicals is rare to find and I am a skincare junkie who’s always looking at new products.</li>
            <li> I have always looked 20 years younger than my true age</li>
            <li> “the skin color of my face has drastically become more uniform, reducing dark spots.</li>
            <li> Maybe for some it will work better, but I went by the recommendations of the usage hoping for better results over the months and honestly, IF there were improvements, they were so tiny that I just remained disappointed.</li>
            <li> Copper works well in older skin and a thicker cream</li>
            <li> I am getting older</li>
            <li> , goes beyond normal customer service and truly believes in what they sell get these products.  </li>
            <li> I had really deep laugh lines</li>
            <li> Last but not least, the products are very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> so this was really new to me.  </li>
            <li> Sent new pictures so show no improvements, but have not heard from anyone.  </li>
            <li> has slowed the signs on my face down tremendously!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many anti aging moisturing creams in the past but none compares to this.  </li>
            <li> I was anxious to try the Visio Elan Anti Aging Peptide moisturizer because I was already using the Visio Elan firming serum which I love.  </li>
            <li> First time I used it , it felt like all my face was getting smaller</li>
            <li> Makeup helps a lot, but bare face really shows the problems.</li>
            <li> It is a 1oz bottle, but seems like it will last a good amount of time since you only need a small pea-sized amount.  </li>
            <li> Like it very much so far.  </li>
            <li> I am 73 years old and my crows feet are gone.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and firmer with this.</li>
            <li> Visio Elan helped me find a solution that will help to restore the natural oils in my skin and  allow me to use the Aria skin care line going forward.  </li>
            <li> So far I can tell no difference in skin, wrinkles, or age spots.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft all over</li>
            <li> The moisturizer leaves my skin soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> but I had to write a review so far.</li>
            <li> Yes my skin felt soft, but no improvements on the wrinkles/lines or sun spots.  </li>
            <li> Sticking with NCN Professional.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping for gradual, albeit probably more slow that what I would really like (instant, actually!).&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The cream has a very rich silky texture so It took only a few days to see a noticeable difference in the peeling and smoothness of my forehead and face.</li>
            <li> I apply Aria Serum first and let that dry for 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> With the first application, I knew this cream would help heal my dry, sun-damaged skin.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a surprise and historically not typical for my complexion.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone starting to see signs of aging.</li>
            <li> I have seen a major improvement in the over all tone in my skin and the lines around my mouth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not a heavy cream but moisturizes just the same.</li>
            <li> I normally wake up with dry skin even after I&#x27;ve cleaned and applied a bunch of &#x27;greasy&#x27; product on it the night before.</li>
            <li> So I started using it every other day, but I think that was still too much for my skin.  </li>
            <li> does absorb well and is not oily, ordered a second bottle because it does not last long enough to give reasonable time to see results.  </li>
            <li> Can usually get discount if ordering directly from NCN Professional.</li>
            <li> A tiny amount covered my entire forehead where my skin was all dry and peeling.</li>
            <li> I have a long face and one drop is not enough to cover my face, so it does not last as long as I would like.</li>
            <li> Plus, &amp;#34;Anew&amp;#34; products by AVON are far less</li>
            <li> With these type of creams, its always hard to really know if they are working.</li>
            <li> but as an adult I have always battled with facial skin problems I never had as a child or teen such as varying degrees and areas of dryness to excessive oil, dark spots from acne and sun damage splotches.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 12 days, long with the Visio Elan serum</li>
            <li> I have been following the directions for use carefully.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them very long, so I look forward to the progress they will continue to make.</li>
            <li> my skin does not look dry but glowy.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of the dry skin issue I had after getting a sunburn in Florida in March.</li>
            <li> and I no longer have an issue with dry peeling skin.</li>
            <li> It is not drying and I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Relief my dry skin!</li>
            <li> My only complaint about both products is that they don&#x27;t last as long as they say they do.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I can think of is I wish the serum came in a larger size.</li>
            <li> This product is too expensive for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> but I was noticing white heads from the heavy creams.</li>
            <li> this moisturizer is amazing,after 6 days used with the serum the lines around my mouth are noticeably softer!be careful</li>
            <li> I do not have bad wrinkles yet, but it surely works for my dark spots.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> My skin is dry due to use of a previous product.  </li>
            <li> The results after using &#x27;Visio Elan&#x27; for several weeks was no better than &amp;#34;Anew products (Genics-Treatment Concentrate/Pro Line Eraser/Eye Treatments/Moisturizers/Day Force lifting, etc.) by AVON.  </li>
            <li> The radiance and skin tone has definitely improved and I&#x27;m anxious to see the difference in my skin with continued use.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Well, Dr. Oz says Peptides work for wrinkles and dark spots.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This stuff is good. I am 61 years old and have many flaws in my skin. I have tried everything on the market to try to reduce the looks of my lines and sun spots from the my younger years of sun bathing. I am very impressed with the results I have achieved by using these products. Not only that, but the president of the company  takes her own personal time to see how I was doing with the products. How many companies do you know that do that? This was a first for me, for sure.  The service is more than exceptional. The only negative thing I can think of is I wish the serum came in a larger size. I have a long face and one drop is not enough to cover my face, so it does not last as long as I would like. The moisturizer does and it out lasted my serum. This duo is well worth your time and money, so try it. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone would be disappointed in the results. I have seen a major improvement in the over all tone in my skin and the lines around my mouth. I hope by continuing to use it, I will continue to see a younger me. I just placed my second order. I raise my three grand-daughters and would like to look like their Mom instead of their grandma. The cost is a splurge for me, but I know it is worth it from my results. Thank you so much Aria. I have already ask them to come out with a heavier night cream with copper. Copper works well in older skin and a thicker cream would be a triple bonus. I am looking forward to more great products from this company who sincerely cares about their customers!  I highly recommend this to anyone starting to see signs of aging. I wished I had started this regime years ago! Thank you, thank you, thank you!</li>
            <li> I really likebit ,plan on recording soon!</li>
            <li> Love it feels wonderful on my ski</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mis 60&#x27;s and have tried just about every product.. including $, $$$ and prescription.. I&#x27;m amazed by this.. It really seems to improve my skin.. Four girlfriends have asked what I&#x27;m using.. Customer service is far and away the best I&#x27;ve encountered.. Check with me in 6 months.. I just may start lying about my age!</li>
            <li> I have use this product 2 weeks. This serum is moisture can keep my face and neck softer. Love it!</li>
            <li> The serum is fine but I was allergic to the moisturizer. Returned the moisturizer and received credit very promptly.  Sorry about my allergies.</li>
            <li> Loves the way it makes skin feel</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:9c23d421c2be037b5a08c658a20ddcfc]]This is my video review for Aria Complex Peptide Cream.  I love this line of skincare and very happy with how youthful my skin looks.  Wrinkles around my eyes and mouth have disappeared and my skin is silky smooth.  Like Aria Serum, you need a pearl size drop of the cream. Spread that evenly over your face, eyes and neck. I apply Aria Serum first and let that dry for 30 seconds.  Then apply Aria Cream. Sunblock goes over great as does makeup.  I&#x27;ve used all Visio Elan products for several months and very happy with how my skin looks. Smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> So far this product is wonderful.  I use it after using the serum.  My skin is looking better and better each day.</li>
            <li> Like peaches and cream.&lt;br /&gt;It feels splendud. I love it. It leaves my skin like silk! Wow, what  a glorioys sensation!!!</li>
            <li> Been using this for about 3 weeks now.  Like it very much so far.  As with any anti aging cream you have to give it time to work.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed when I received this moisturizer to see that the first ingredient is, Water! I now know not to buy unless the ingredient side of the bottle is shown.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Visio Elan moisturizer for over a month and definitely see a difference in my skin.  It looks and feels firmer and is younger looking.&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered and have received the anti aging Serum to use before the moisturizer and can&#x27;t wait to try it.  Dr Oz on his show said peptide stimulates collagen and both of these products contain peptide.  You&#x27;ll see results using Visio Elan products.  Last but not least, the products are very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. Makes my skin smooth and soft. It has exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Amazing change in my skin texture and visible signs of health and vitality in my skin, used along with  Aria Triple Peptide Serum.</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizer! Relief my dry skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many anti aging moisturing creams in the past but none compares to this.  I am 73 years old and my crows feet are gone. The cream makes my face feel very moist.  I will be purchasing more in the near future.  I use the serum also and it makes it doubly effective.&lt;br /&gt;I use both products every day and feel that they are the best for my skin.</li>
            <li> This is truly one of the best mosturizers I have ever had. It goes in easily and makes my skin immediately softer. My skin feels tighter and it works well under makeup. This is a GREAT addition to any skin care program. I have always looked 20 years younger than my true age but this has brought even more compliments on my skin- even from my own sons! Definitely a must try!</li>
            <li> Very happy with product.  Use it at night and my skin looks better already</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer.  I love how it makes my skin feel.  I also like the pump dispenser.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and firmer with this. It works great under makeup.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry due to use of a previous product.  Visio Elan helped me find a solution that will help to restore the natural oils in my skin and  allow me to use the Aria skin care line going forward.  Pricing is good and products are good.</li>
            <li> Good product, works as described, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This feels very nice on your skin and has a pleasant smell. I have noticed a reduction in fine lines but almost immediately noticed my eyes looked more refreshed!</li>
            <li> I’ve paid a lot of money over the years for products that did very little. I bought both the serum and moisturizer and after a few weeks, there’s a noticeable improvement in decreasing sagging and wrinkles. The moisturizer is light and absorbs quickly as does the serum.  My skin looks healthy and radiant.  Someone else wrote “powerhouse” and that’s an apt description because of all the peptides. Paraben free appealed to me, too. Several friends have purchased after seeing my results.</li>
            <li> “the skin color of my face has drastically become more uniform, reducing dark spots. It’s a great product.”</li>
            <li> Not greasy. Pleasant  scent and easy to apply.  Fast delivery. Anti-aging,? Will have to monitor longer.&lt;br /&gt;Plan on reordering soon.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 12 days, long with the Visio Elan serum and so far I am pleased. I have noticed a change in the size of some of my pores, but the biggest thing is that my face looks all-around brighter. I have been following the directions for use carefully. I am hoping for gradual, albeit probably more slow that what I would really like (instant, actually!).&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The results after using &#x27;Visio Elan&#x27; for several weeks was no better than &amp;#34;Anew products (Genics-Treatment Concentrate/Pro Line Eraser/Eye Treatments/Moisturizers/Day Force lifting, etc.) by AVON.  Plus, &amp;#34;Anew&amp;#34; products by AVON are far less expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UNLIKE &amp;#34;Visio Elan&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> After using both the Aria &#x27;regenerating cream&#x27; and &#x27;firming serum,&#x27; my skin is significantly smoother and softer and I am pleased that, even after 2 heatwaves, my skin is &amp;#34;comfortable&amp;#34; rather than oily, which it has been most of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any skin breakouts from applying either of these two products - especially a moisturizer - to my entire face.  That&#x27;s a surprise and historically not typical for my complexion.  Both products, which I do use together, are very nice under make-up -- I use a power foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is the only product that I would expect to reorder sooner because the cream comes in a larger container.  Yes, I would buy both products again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company has been very diligent with follow-up to make sure I am using product correctly and that I am completely satisfied.  Nice!</li>
            <li> This is so lightweight and velvety. The scent is very pleasant.  Love this on top of the Firming Serum.  So far this is an excellent moisturizer for the price and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the anti-aging cream, as well as the anti-aging serum for 3 weeks now.  The radiance and skin tone has definitely improved and I&#x27;m anxious to see the difference in my skin with continued use.  I&#x27;d like to commend this company on their awesome customer service.  They truly seem to care about their products and their customers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products from this brand while on my hunt for a good anti-aging skin care line for myself. I really liked their other stuff, so I was excited to try this as well. It has a clean scent, goes on easy (its a lotion) and I love that is contains many leaf juices and extracts on the ingredient label!  My skin feels softer, and smoother without being oily or greasy. I can&#x27;t wait to see even more results as I continue using! It is a 1oz bottle, but seems like it will last a good amount of time since you only need a small pea-sized amount.  I was offered this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this product works very well in combination with the serum. You can definitely notice a change in the texture of the skin. My only complaint about both products is that they don&#x27;t last as long as they say they do. I have very dry skin, and the indicated dosage recommended on both doesn&#x27;t even cover a small area of my face. In order to achieve the results I desire I will have re-order frequently, which will be too costly to maintain over a significant period of time</li>
            <li> This product is too expensive for what it&#x27;s worth. The bottle way too small and doesn&#x27;t work for me. Sorry, but can I have money back? Margie</li>
            <li> Great product, item as described, very useful.</li>
            <li> Finally, a product that someone has done their research (and I mean RESEARCH) on! I actually talked to the head of the company ( very easy to do as she answers each and every customer inquiry) and I thought I was the knowledgeable one! I come from a chemistry and also makeup artistry background (weird mix--but it works) and I had a lot of questions about the products ( this one and its companion serum). She was on top of the latest research and then some. I love that the products are freash as well with their expiration dates stamped on the bottom. No need for preservatives or added chemicals! Just make it &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;....How REFRESHING is that idea?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a heavy cream but moisturizes just the same. I am getting great results without having to slather heavy night creams on. I am 41 and thought it was time for them but I was noticing white heads from the heavy creams. I missed the oily feel at night for like, two nights, then I noticed how beautiful my skin was looking and how nicely my makeup went on! I am getting older but I feel like Aria has slowed the signs on my face down tremendously!</li>
            <li> Just the right thickness. With these type of creams, its always hard to really know if they are working. But I just seem to be smoother and maybe tighter. I&#x27;m a fan. UPDATE - I USE THE SERUM AND CREAM EVERY DAY. SERUM MORNING AND NIGHT&amp;#60; CREAM AT NIGHT. THESE PRODUCTS WORK!! Most people think I am 10 to 12 years younger then I am (I&#x27;m 67!). Never give up. This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the results of this products.  My friends, whom I have not seen in many months, noticed how nice my skin looked recently.  I hope more products are made for the rest of my body and hair</li>
            <li> This is the icing on the cake. Put this on after using the serum and miracles happen. Order the serum and the crème and you will not be sorry</li>
            <li> great stuff just ordered this product again. I recommend this product to any body who really want to take beter care of the skin they are in</li>
            <li> I use this along with the Triple Peptide Collagen Firming Serum and have noticed a difference in less than a month with some of my deeper wrinkles. I&#x27;m only in my mid thirties and hope to combat getting additional wrinkles with the use of these products!</li>
            <li> I was anxious to try the Visio Elan Anti Aging Peptide moisturizer because I was already using the Visio Elan firming serum which I love.  The moisturizer is really good and didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling oily but after about 4 hours, my face looked like an oil slick.  So I started using it every other day, but I think that was still too much for my skin.  I ordinarily have very dry skin so this was really new to me.  I am in my 60&#x27;s and have never been a sun goddess, so perhaps I should use this product only once a week...  I will continue to work with it and see how it goes.  I honestly believe this is a great moisturizer so I don&#x27;t fault the product at all.  I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING. It Really firms, tightens your skin. First time I used it , it felt like all my face was getting smaller&lt;br /&gt;and tighter. It felt wonderful. I will buy this again, and again!! the service was awesome, wonderful company and the prompt delivery. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with Amazon also. It&#x27;s been just a couple of weeks, and I see tremendous&lt;br /&gt;results on my face and neck</li>
            <li> does absorb well and is not oily, ordered a second bottle because it does not last long enough to give reasonable time to see results.  So far I can tell no difference in skin, wrinkles, or age spots.</li>
            <li> At first I have to say for the money I did not see much improvement BUT after using for 3 weeks I LOVE this and will reorder. The best part was when I emailed my initial disappointment I was kindly greeted by Lois in CS at Aria and they were honestly concerned so their customer service is top notch in my eyes!!!</li>
            <li> Not sure yet...seems to be just a moisturizer</li>
            <li> This was OK, but I didnt notice any improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> Works great as a moisturizer but the serum works better in my opinion</li>
            <li> I purchased Aria peptide serum and peptide moisturizer about 3 weeks ago. I am happy with results. I see a decrease in fine lines and wrinkles both and I&#x27;m only using it once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guide that comes with it says allow 30-45 days for best results so I anticipate more results. I apply the serum which absorbs quickly and then add the moisturizer. I can visibly see skin tightening making pores and fine lines diminish. Now I&#x27;m seeing tightening is becoming permanent which is a sign collagen is filling in wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination of hyaluronic acid with 3 peptides in the serum and 2 in the moisturizer makes this a powerful combo. I priced a serum with 3 peptides at a plastic surgeon&#x27;s site and the serum alone was $120. Great company, fast service with great packaging.</li>
            <li> I got lucky purchasing this and the serum for my wife who is thrilled. Phew, learned more about peptides, wrinkles and skincare than any man would care to know.  If “peptides” are this magical ingredient to removing lines and wrinkles she’s so worried about, then it stood to reason the more peptides the better, right?  Well, there’s 5 peptides in these 2 products and no others had that so the decision was easy. She’s ecstatic with results, looks gorgeous and very happy with me! I called Visio Elan and spoke to a very nice woman who helped a great deal. Great company and service. My wife and I thank you!</li>
            <li> I think I was just expecting way too much on results from using this product.  Maybe for some it will work better, but I went by the recommendations of the usage hoping for better results over the months and honestly, IF there were improvements, they were so tiny that I just remained disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best I have ever used. I&#x27;m 75 yrs old &amp; I have tried all of the creams the industry ever made &amp; this is the best.</li>
            <li> Coupled with vitamin C serum</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  The fine lines are almost gone.  I use this with the serum.  I have&lt;br /&gt;recommended this to several people....strangers that comment on my skin.  Everyone comments&lt;br /&gt;that my skin does not look dry but glowy.  Love it :)</li>
            <li> I would 100% recommend this to everyone. I feel the effectiveness of this products since I used it more that a month ago. Very good products for me that&#x27;s why I rate 5 stars</li>
            <li> As in another review I wrote, this product feels nice on skin but I see no visable difference.  Similar packaging presentation makes me wonder if all similarly bottled products are the same.</li>
            <li> Great product shipped as promised.</li>
            <li> I used this in combination with Aria peptide serum so I can’t say how it works on its own. The two together have made a big difference in my skin tone, texture and disappearing wrinkles. I’ve tried many skincare products for at 50 years old, the lines are becoming more pronounced.  The moisturizer is very light and soothing.  Add the serum, wait a moment and add the moisturizer.  Both dry quickly, feel very light and are easily absorbed.  My skin is soft all over and I now have an even color tone which I haven’t seen in years. I’m sold on this combination. Great company – nice packaging and they include an awesome anti-aging tips book.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of the dry skin issue I had after getting a sunburn in Florida in March. None of my creams were working until I tried this anti-aging cream by Visio Elan. A tiny amount covered my entire forehead where my skin was all dry and peeling. With the first application, I knew this cream would help heal my dry, sun-damaged skin. The cream has a very rich silky texture so It took only a few days to see a noticeable difference in the peeling and smoothness of my forehead and face. I have used it faithfully since the day it arrived and I no longer have an issue with dry peeling skin. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with my purchase. I love the way my skin feels and looks! This will definitely be the only cream I use on my face from now on.</li>
            <li> this moisturizer is amazing,after 6 days used with the serum the lines around my mouth are noticeably softer!be careful a little goes a long way,the company  will send you how to use email</li>
            <li> I wrote more under the peptide serum that goes with this peptide moisturizer but just want to say this system combination is really a powerful one that works wonders. The moisturizer leaves my skin soft and glowing. A lot of peptides, collagen and hyualronic acid with natural botanicals is rare to find and I am a skincare junkie who’s always looking at new products. Go all the way and buy the peptide serum, too. You’ll be glad you have both.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Aria Peptide Moisturizer and Serum because I heard that peptides do wonderful things for your skin. I am well over 60 and am not easily impressed with skin products. These products impress me. I have received compliments on my skin as a result and will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using both the serum and moisturizer that my daughter was so kind to purchase for me. The serum is amazing in that you feel your skin tighten immediately. I like the feel of the moisturizer and they do seem to be quite effective. It has only been 10 days, yet I feel something great is happening. I&#x27;ve been disappointed before, so I&#x27;ll come back in 30 days and update my review. The company has a VIP program that I joined too.</li>
            <li> I purchased the serum and moisturizer that’s recommended about 3 weeks ago.  Both arrived on time nicely wrapped in a pretty box.  The dispensing pump is tight which is good as it prevents wasting the cream.  The cream is light and absorbs quickly with no stickiness or residue after it dries.  Very nice and smooth cream. I see lines diminishing as well as wrinkles. I am using both the serum and cream and pleased with results.  I will continue to buy this peptide system!</li>
            <li> Nice product with all the &amp;#34;good stuff&amp;#34; for a reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;and I would consider reordering it again in the future.</li>
            <li> After using this product for two weeks, my skin has brightened significantly. It feels feels satiny and covers easily. Makeup goes on over it smoothly.</li>
            <li> It has only been a couple days that I&#x27;ve been using this product but I had to write a review so far. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet (knock-wood) but as an adult I have always battled with facial skin problems I never had as a child or teen such as varying degrees and areas of dryness to excessive oil, dark spots from acne and sun damage splotches. I have tried creams such as skin whiteners, greasy moisturizers, retinol, vitamin E oil, etc with no real or lasting effects. I have to say that in combination so far with the Aria Tri-Peptide Collagen Serum product (sold separately), from the first morning after application, I woke up with my skin feeling more moisturized than it has in a long time. I normally wake up with dry skin even after I&#x27;ve cleaned and applied a bunch of &#x27;greasy&#x27; product on it the night before. I was expecting the same result except when I looked in the mirror and my skin cells looked plump, moisturized and a bit more energized. My skin felt smooth and a bit firmer to the touch too. I was definitely excited by what I saw in only the first use. I&#x27;m looking forward to continuing with this line of skin care to see what the next 30 day effects are and I&#x27;ll make an update.  You can buy these two separately but I think you&#x27;ll get the best results faster combined. So far, so good! I love it. Shipping was quick and the product even came with a nice little velour draw-string bag.</li>
            <li> I use this cream after using the Aria firming serum. It is light, soothing, and just glides on.&lt;br /&gt;Just a small amount of the cream is needed.&lt;br /&gt;I apply my makeup right after the cream and it goes on smoothly, leaving my skin with a soft glow.</li>
            <li> I use the Visio Elan serum and this Anti Aging Face Cream and they are wonderful. Together they do a wonderful job and it looks like I have fewer wrinkles. The skin on my face also looks and feels better. I haven&#x27;t used them very long, so I look forward to the progress they will continue to make.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Well, Dr. Oz says Peptides work for wrinkles and dark spots. I do not have bad wrinkles yet, but it surely works for my dark spots. It is not drying and I have dry skin. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> After seeing Dr. Oz&#x27;s program talking about peptides, I researched to find a good product with the most peptides.  I purchased both the anti aging cream and firming serum.  I didn&#x27;t see any improvements and contacted the company.  I was asked to send pictures of my face so they could see what I needed.  Was told I probably needed to try the microdermabrasion cream facial scrub because I had a lot of sun damage and needed to get rid of that.  They sold that to me for $1.  I had to buy another round of both the cream and serum.  They did give me a discount on the serum.  After using the facial scrub, cream and serum for 6 weeks more, I still didn&#x27;t see any improvements.  Yes my skin felt soft, but no improvements on the wrinkles/lines or sun spots.  Customer service was very good up until now.  Sent new pictures so show no improvements, but have not heard from anyone.  I am 58 but look younger than my age.  Makeup helps a lot, but bare face really shows the problems.</li>
            <li> Notice positive difference in skin, but price too high.  Sticking with NCN Professional.  Same results, but price much better.  Can usually get discount if ordering directly from NCN Professional.</li>
            <li> Amazing company amazing products.  If you want a company that backs up what they sell&lt;br /&gt;, goes beyond normal customer service and truly believes in what they sell get these products.  The serum and the moisturizer together WOW!!!! Amazing!!!!! Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy and use!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product! Makes my dry skin feel amazing!</li>
            <li> I have been using your product for a few weeks now and I gotta tell you about the amazing results. This item has changed my skin so much that my customers can really see the change my skin is getting firmer to me I had really deep laugh lines and I didn&#x27;t like it but now I do still smile a lot but it&#x27;s more firmer like I had injections or something I get a compliment everyday about my skin I will recommend this product my skin really glows. I&#x27;m not big on leaving comments but I just had to do this one. Thank you so much and I will continue to order. Kim</li>
            <li> Cream does work but takes while to notice.</li>
            <li> I took a picture today and here are the results!  i was amazed after using about 2-3 weeks  before and after. P.S. I was not wearing any make up except for lipstick</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell and feels good on the skin. But after a month of continued use, I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement. No face plumping and the fine wrinkles around my mouth are still very visible. I give it 3 stars because of the nice customer service and delivery on time.</li>
            <li> GLIDES ON EASILY VERY GOOD, LIKE THE PEPTIDES</li>
