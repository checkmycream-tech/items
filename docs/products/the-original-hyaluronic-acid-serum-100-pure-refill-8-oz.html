            <li>Hyaluronic acid is awesome to use before applying self-tanner to help ensure an even application over your skin...</li>

            <li>Purchase this and add it to any of your own products for just a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>but I can honestly say this acid is making an improvement.  </li>
            <li>bought the OZ Natural - The BEST Vitaminc C Serum</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is cost effective and nice and clean without any added chemicals that are  toxic.</li>
            <li>It does not cause any irritation, and keeps the skins very smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is still my all time favorite skin care item.</li>
            <li>Just to keep it interesting.</li>
            <li>I love the pump on this.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t agree more.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;H.A. Serum will reduce the wrinkles on your face in a great deal and it works almost as good as Botox except the frozen facial movement side</li>
            <li>and you will have a better result</li>
            <li>but I am so glad that I found out and learned about H.A. Acid</li>

            <li>Most girls thought I am 19 to 24 because the wrinkles of my forehead has been fading away a lot.  </li>
            <li>Just OK.</li>
            <li>I liked this very much, but I will be making my own with Distilled Water and Hyaluronic Acid Powder</li>
            <li>Their Moisturizers are great, they leave skin moist and supple for over 24 hours, specially the Night Moisturizer, they&#x27;re pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>Really good product and very reasonable price point.  </li>
            <li>and wow.. it&#x27;s made a great difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I was really excited and looking forward to use this product, however, this product is not at all as advertised.  </li>
            <li>It is actually mostly water as water is the first ingredient listed on the bottle is water.  </li>
            <li>Full of alcohol.</li>
            <li>I have been using plain serums for my face and wanted a pure hyaluronic acid (HA) for a great price - and this is it!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m am on my third bottle of this amazing serum, and I have recommended it to all my friends.</li>

            <li>product looks a lot better and professional in person and the image of this product does not do any justice for its quality.  </li>

            <li>so I have more control of my facial products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been told many times that I am a fastidious individual</li>
            <li>Serums like this go on as first layer for skincare.</li>
            <li>My legs feel super soft and silky without feeling greesy.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been so dry and actually more wrinkled.</li>
            <li>Comes in a big 8oz bottle with a pump for easy use and control of amount.</li>
            <li>I think the name Pure s a bit deceptive.  </li>
            <li>I also have issues with lotions containing too much fragrance</li>
            <li>if you really need Vitamin C Serum for your face you can always make it yourself for 10,000 times cheaper just</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to pay an arm or a legal by purchasing OZ Naturals product.  </li>
            <li>It will last quite a while and they even included a free gift.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad that Timeless Skin Care offers this 8oz for such affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I do have some new things that I am switching up with.</li>
            <li>It goes directly to the garbage can.</li>
            <li>Meet my expectations completely.</li>
            <li>This is a lot of HA and considering its not wrapped up in cream makes it a greater value as well - a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I am so good at pointing out the little flaws in life all because I was once punished brutally as a child for not being a honest person and ever since, I tell nothing but the truth.  </li>
            <li>Upon receipt of this arrived empty, and nobody is held responsible for these tell that you were not and transporters that were not therefore lost product</li>
            <li>I have had better and worse.</li>
            <li>I have kept it and used it for my newer bottles as the new pumps pump a little too much.</li>
            <li>This product goes a LONG LONG way, and for the use which I just detailed I only use a single drop.</li>
            <li>I lost a lot of friends and gained very few true friends because of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>works as good as other expensive product such as OZ Naturals and it</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great price for this quantity</li>
            <li> This product works. I know, because I made the mistake of putting it all over my face at night before my night cream.  In about a week my face was \\&quot; puffy \\&quot; because the purpose of hyaluronic acid is to pull moisture into the cells.  Now I only use it on the nasal folds and corner of my eyes at night before applying night cream.  This product goes a LONG LONG way, and for the use which I just detailed I only use a single drop. The acid is very silky and glides on with ease and then is absorbed into the skin quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also made the mistake of putting some on my hands at night and then putting hand cream on.  My rings would be tight in the morning as the moisture was driven deep into the cell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this product in the right locations and you will notice a difference without a doubt.  I would say a bottle could last up to a year. That is because of the minimal amount that you need to use.</li>
            <li> Did not like this product and returned it. I&#x27;m sticking with HYLUNIA.com products. Their Moisturizers are great, they leave skin moist and supple for over 24 hours, specially the Night Moisturizer, they&#x27;re pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff is working to keep my oily skin hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the advice of another reviewer and after applying this hyluronic acid, I spray my face with an organic essential oil hydrosol.&lt;br /&gt;I use rose and or lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is cost effective and nice and clean without any added chemicals that are  toxic.</li>
            <li> I think the name Pure s a bit deceptive.  It&#x27;s not pure and the alcohol used can be drying to some skin.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use this after I shave my legs and on my face after I get out of the shower. My legs feel super soft and silky without feeling greesy. I also have issues with lotions containing too much fragrance and it aggrivates my allergies or makes my skin irritated. Hylauronic acid has no fragrance and dries without any residue. Once it&#x27;s dry, you can&#x27;t even tell anything was applied. Your skin is nice and evenly moistuirized. Hyaluronic acid is awesome to use before applying self-tanner to help ensure an even application over your skin...</li>
            <li> I liked this very much, but I will be making my own with Distilled Water and Hyaluronic Acid Powder I bought on Amazon.  I can make 80 oz for around $12.00.  I mix the serum with my body and face lotions...really amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> Love it! This has become a part of my daily routine, I usually add argon oil to it or I add this to my other face lotion.  I&#x27;m am on my third bottle of this amazing serum, and I have recommended it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> One thing that I will always keep on my shelf. I use this daily....actually a couple times a day. I love it and my skin looks great. I look 10-15 years younger than I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited 7-22-15.....This is still my all time favorite skin care item. I use this almost daily now. I do have some new things that I am switching up with. Just to keep it interesting. I love the pump on this. It&#x27;s from an older bottle that I received....I have kept it and used it for my newer bottles as the new pumps pump a little too much.</li>
            <li> Works well with the Derma Micro Needle Roller (540 needles) 1.5 mm Black Titanium for wrinkles.  Used it liberally on any place on my body.</li>
            <li> I used it every night and waited before writing a review. My skin has never been so dry and actually more wrinkled. I&#x27;m stopping immediately using this product. It goes directly to the garbage can.</li>
            <li> I have been using plain serums for my face and wanted a pure hyaluronic acid (HA) for a great price - and this is it!!!  I layer my serums (Vit C, Matryxl 3000, CoQ-10, HA) and then use a cream after so I have more control of my facial products. This is a lot of HA and considering its not wrapped up in cream makes it a greater value as well - a little goes a long way. I am going to be 60 this year and the HA has made a big difference in my face and neck and on my chest and arms too. Keeps my skin moist and added to my other serums makes my skin glow. Comes in a big 8oz bottle with a pump for easy use and control of amount. I definitely will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told many times that I am a fastidious individual and I couldn&#x27;t agree more.  In a nut shell, I am a difficult son of a gun which explains why I am still single.  I am so good at pointing out the little flaws in life all because I was once punished brutally as a child for not being a honest person and ever since, I tell nothing but the truth.  I lost a lot of friends and gained very few true friends because of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recently discovered Hyaluronic Acid and I&#x27;ve a long period of research and study I&#x27;ve decided to call it the Holy Grail of youth reproduction, which induces YOUTHFUL SKIN.  For those of you who find theword &amp;#34;Hyaluronic&amp;#34; difficult to pronounce, you may then call this product the Liquid Gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;H.A. Serum will reduce the wrinkles on your face in a great deal and it works almost as good as Botox except the frozen facial movement side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the OZ Natural - The BEST Vitaminc C Serum For Your Frace - Organic Vitamin C + ..... H.A. Serum and I was very happy with it but I finished the 1Oz bottle in less than 3 weeks.  It has tighten my skin and reduce the wrinkles on my face but it&#x27;s just too expensive.  I then discovered the The Original Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure Refill 8 oz, and it has the same effects as the OZ Natural product, now make no Mistake here.  This product does not have Vitamin C in it but you get 8OZ of H.A serum which is something that will help you to reduce the wrinkles and if you really need Vitamin C Serum for your face you can always make it yourself for 10,000 times cheaper just but NOW Foods Vitamin C Crystals, Ascorbic Acid, 1 Pound and mix with filtered water and you will have a better result and you don&#x27;t have to pay an arm or a legal by purchasing OZ Naturals product.  In case you missed it, YES 1 POUND!!! of Vitamin C!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was just one step away to get some Botox which will cost me between $300 to $500 but I am so glad that I found out and learned about H.A. Acid and I am so glad that Timeless Skin Care offers this 8oz for such affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product looks a lot better and professional in person and the image of this product does not do any justice for its quality.  It&#x27;s made of glass not plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works as good as other expensive product such as OZ Naturals and it last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used get girls in their late 20s hitting on me or talk to me but I now talk to girls that are 18 to 22.  Most girls thought I am 19 to 24 because the wrinkles of my forehead has been fading away a lot.  The lines are still there but it&#x27;s not noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros about this product..&lt;br /&gt;-CHEAP&lt;br /&gt;-It works&lt;br /&gt;-bang for your bucks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no con about this product.

            <li> no  difference  at all better off with a  retinol moisturizer  too expensive</li>
            <li> I was really excited and looking forward to use this product, however, this product is not at all as advertised.  It is actually mostly water as water is the first ingredient listed on the bottle is water.  Other ingredients are Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzyl Alcohol and Dehydroacetic Acid.  I am greatly disappointed and as a result would not trust this seller, nor order from this seller again.  It is money wasted.</li>
            <li> The product was poorly packed and this is glass. Upon receipt of this arrived empty, and nobody is held responsible for these tell that you were not and transporters that were not therefore lost product</li>
            <li> The worst product ever !!!!! Full of alcohol. Watery substance when is supposed to have a thicker consistency.Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Great buy.  You can really kick your usual face creams up a notch by adding this serum to your own product.  It will turn your everyday product into a high end product costing way more.  The serum is smooth and really makes your skin glow.  It tingles when it goes on, letting you know it is &amp;#34;doing it&#x27;s job&amp;#34;.  My skin looks smoother and tiny lines are far less noticeable.  Price other products with hyaluronic acid in them and you will be shocked at the price.  Purchase this and add it to any of your own products for just a fraction of the cost.  I am extremely happy with this purchase.  It will last quite a while and they even included a free gift.</li>
            <li> Meet my expectations completely.Very happy with quality of this serum.Very silky and absorbs quickly.Highly recommend this product. A dime size amount is all you need to cover your entire face. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Excellent  value and excellent product, love the  glass bottle, very impressive.  Deliver of product was very fast.  Impressed.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I will never go back to paying a fortune for face creams again.  The Hyaluronic acid has made improvement in my skin in just a couple do weeks.  I love it!  I am 75 years young and have relative good skin that has age spots and age lines as to be expected but I can honestly say this acid is making an improvement.  It feels great and is not oily.  My bank account and I thank you!</li>
            <li> Great value for the money. Really good product and very reasonable price point.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with this. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> fabulous really hold in and adds and retains mo[sture</li>
            <li> I am using this in conjunction with a dermal roller and wow.. it&#x27;s made a great difference in my skin. I  did take a break from a couple times and I noticed a difference each time I started using it again. Also I did use the C+E Ferric solution as well .&lt;br /&gt;worth doing the pair together. Serums like this go on as first layer for skincare.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while.  It does not cause any irritation, and keeps the skins very smooth.  I don&#x27;t need to use any additional scrubs to ex foliate with this product.</li>
            <li> Just OK. I have had better and worse. Great price for the quantity, which usually effects the quality. Probably will not order again.</li>
            <li> I have used hyaluronic acid serum for many years made by skinceuticals, this is terrible, appears to be thickened water, you get what you pay for, the customer service is non existent with this company, don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money, after they have your money forget about any customer service.</li>
            <li> This product makes me disappointed. After put it on my face my face, I can feel like some concrete is on it and it approaches to break.&lt;br /&gt;I will never order it again.</li>
