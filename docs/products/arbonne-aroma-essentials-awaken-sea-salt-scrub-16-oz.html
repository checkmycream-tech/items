            <li>My husband and I both use this and love it</li>
            <li>Was very pleased how quickly it arrived</li>
            <li>It is a very clean refreshing smell.</li>
            <li>VERY MILD AND APPEALING.  </li>
            <li>I bought this the first time from an Arbonne seller and fell in love with it!</li>
            <li>Perfect for my eczema (gets rid of dead skin, oil moisturizes, and I&#x27;m sure the salt has an anti-bacterial effect as well).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got the best, clean smell, and it&#x27;s oils just refresh and moisturize my extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It has a great oil to salt ratio so that while it is sloughing skin it deeply moisturizes.  </li>
            <li>The smell is the only great thing.</li>
            <li>Fabulous, I use it on my hands twice a day.  </li>
            <li>being said, it is amazingly moisturizing, and small salt crystals means it does a really great job of exfoliating.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel so fresh!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend treating yourself to this scrub, it&#x27;s worth it!!!</li>
            <li>Convenient scoop makes it easy to get salt and oil in right combination.</li>
            <li>GOOD FOR A SPECIAL, OCCASIONAL TREAT.</li>
            <li>Lovely scent but very oily</li>
            <li>I love that it leaves my skin very soft and smooth after I rinse and smells amazingly fresh.</li>
            <li>and I will definitely be buying more despite the steep price!</li>
            <li>If you want soft hands, this is a wonderful product...used every two weeks and found my dry hands improving to be soft and smooth, younger looking too.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin so soft &amp; smooth.  </li>
            <li>i feel like my skin is soooo soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It last all day and more.</li>
            <li>It makes my old skin feel smooth and gives it a youthful glow.</li>
            <li>It came leaking first of all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also has more liquid tan actual sea salt scrub</li>
            <li>This leaves me feeling soft, silky smooth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of certain Arbonne body products, but this one tops them all.</li>
            <li>There is little need for body lotion, because the sea salt leaves an amazing moisturiser on my body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for removing dead skin and moisturizing deeply.</li>
            <li>But it is very oily and causes a lot of work cleaning my shower afterwards.  </li>
            <li>It makes the tub really really slippery.</li>
            <li>This product is the only thing I have used that totally eradicates the dryness and keeps my legs soft and smooth throughout the day (and they look so much better, too).</li>
            <li>For me, this is a welcome change from the dry, tight feeling of before, but for some it might be too much.</li>
            <li>Rinse of lightly and pat dry to leave the oil in place after shower.</li>
            <li>Not only do I feel &amp;#34;scrubbed&amp;#34; after applying it, but my skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>this product is much to harsh for fair skin,the company should warn people about the harshness, it make you all red and chapped.</li>
            <li>Not impressed with this product after all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>Have used Dead Sea salt scrubs that was better.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 of the Awaken Sea Salt Scrub from a new seller.</li>
            <li>It came earlier than expected and my daughter will love it for her birthday gift.</li>
            <li>Skin is very soft when done.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend even comments your skin is soo soft!</li>
            <li>My hands get soo soft!</li>
            <li>It is only the stuff I have found that IF I use it regularly really helps clear them up.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff for the tiny white bumps that I get on the back of my upper arms!</li>
            <li>The oils replenish my very dry skin better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>first had this product as a gift from my sister-in-law and since I have a very dry skin, this product helped my skin become smoother and softer.</li>
            <li>and it truly works like no other!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several Arbonne products, this is the only one I really appreciate.</li>
            <li>Living in the great Northeast, my skin can shrivel up like a raisin during the cold, dry months of winter.</li>
            <li>They go from having a whitish dry tinge to them, to looking soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Also, it leaves a very slippery, oily mess in the tub.</li>

            <li> Yes, it might be more expensive than other store brands</li>
            <li> The Awaken Sea Salt Scrub was ordered as a birthday gift, and while I ordered it in plenty of time, it was delivered even earlier than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I use it in the shower and pat it dry.</li>
            <li> I use it all year round but especially in the winter as a total body moisturizer,  with the dry air inside.</li>
            <li> In the winter, the skin on my thighs and calves gets very dry and scaly.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub; wish is were a little less expensive.  </li>
            <li> The only caveat I would issue is that your legs will feel a little oily to the touch afterwards.</li>
            <li> Great aroma and doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty residue on your bathtub/shower floor.</li>
            <li> Exfoliates rough hands.  </li>
            <li> Be careful when using this in the shower!</li>
            <li> I use it ALL over and give myself a thorough scrub down, let it sit for a minute, and rinse.</li>
            <li> Product may make surfaces slick so something to be careful about.</li>
            <li> A mess.</li>
            <li> And i also observed that the small bumps or roughness on my skin goes away when I use this.</li>
            <li> I usually have to use lotion a couple times a day but the data I use this I don&#x27;t need lotion at all.</li>
            <li> I get tired of all the multilevel sales people and their pressure.  </li>
            <li> so not ideal to use as a foot scrub.  </li>
            <li> (I think I spelled this wrong).  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It came earlier than expected and my daughter will love it for her birthday gift.</li>
            <li> Love seasalts....VERY healthy for your body.</li>
            <li> I am a product junkie but the Arbonne Awaken sea salt scrub is by far the best there is.  It has a great fragrance and is a wonderful moisturizer, exfoliator and is awesome to shave with!  It leaves your skin so soft &amp; smooth.  Yes, it might be more expensive than other store brands but this doesn&#x27;t contain any harmful ingredients and it truly works like no other!  I highly recommend treating yourself to this scrub, it&#x27;s worth it!!!</li>
            <li> I love the smell. But it is very oily and causes a lot of work cleaning my shower afterwards.  will not buy again.</li>
            <li> first had this product as a gift from my sister-in-law and since I have a very dry skin, this product helped my skin become smoother and softer. i love it everytime i use it, i don&#x27;t need to put on lotion couple of times within the day. And i also observed that the small bumps or roughness on my skin goes away when I use this. i feel like my skin is soooo soft and smooth. if this aint too pricey i would always have it.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product! They have changed the formula since the last time I purchased it and as a result I am not getting the same results. I can&#x27;t imagine why they changed the formula because it used to work magic on my skin before.</li>
            <li> I use this to stop the tingling feeling I get from fibromalysia (I think I spelled this wrong).  I don&#x27;t know if it will work for you.  I stumbled across this by just trying it out one day.</li>
            <li> Wife says best thing since sliced bread.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of the Awaken Sea Salt Scrub from a new seller. Was very pleased how quickly it arrived and it was in great condition. Would definitely buy ti again.</li>
            <li> I love this Arbonne Scrub. You cannot beat the smell and how it makes your skin feel. It last all day and more. All the scents are wonderful especially this one! A must try!!</li>
            <li> Be careful when using this in the shower! It makes the tub really really slippery. I almost broke my neck while showering after my girlfriend used it on her legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it is amazingly moisturizing, and small salt crystals means it does a really great job of exfoliating. Perfect for my eczema (gets rid of dead skin, oil moisturizes, and I&#x27;m sure the salt has an anti-bacterial effect as well).</li>
            <li> SO DIVINE!  I love it!  It&#x27;s got the best, clean smell, and it&#x27;s oils just refresh and moisturize my extremely dry skin.  Love this Arbonne product and so glad I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love this product for how it feels after use and helping my hands from drying out. I give it 5 stars but would like to mention that one has to stir it each time before use as the oil and sea salt separate (nature of the product)</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> Lovely scent but very oily so not ideal to use as a foot scrub.  Also, it leaves a very slippery, oily mess in the tub. I wish it had some coconut oil in it to give it some substance so it wouldn&#x27;t drip all over the place when you try to apply it. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is the most sensational bath salts I&#x27;ve ever used. Not only do I feel &amp;#34;scrubbed&amp;#34; after applying it, but my skin is soft and smooth. There is little need for body lotion, because the sea salt leaves an amazing moisturiser on my body. Treat yourself to the ultimate bath experience.</li>
            <li> I bought this the first time from an Arbonne seller and fell in love with it! The smell, the oils, everything! I bought this because I am not a girl who remembers to put on moisturizer but with this you don&#x27;t have to. This will do it all when used in the bath or shower! Product may make surfaces slick so something to be careful about.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. Its amazing..</li>
            <li> I love this scrub; wish is were a little less expensive.  I only buy once a year and try to make it last!  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> The Awaken Sea Salt Scrub was ordered as a birthday gift, and while I ordered it in plenty of time, it was delivered even earlier than I expected.  The recipient loved the gift.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked on this product! It makes my old skin feel smooth and gives it a youthful glow. Recommend to all women.</li>
            <li> Wonderful effects with a wonderful fragrance.  Rinse of lightly and pat dry to leave the oil in place after shower.</li>
            <li> THE FRAGRANCE IS THE BEST.  VERY MILD AND APPEALING.  JUST A BIT PRICY FOR THE SIZE.  GOOD FOR A SPECIAL, OCCASIONAL TREAT.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I swear by it. I use it all year round but especially in the winter as a total body moisturizer,  with the dry air inside.</li>
            <li> Awesome, I love how this scrub smells &amp; makes my skin feel. I usually have to use lotion a couple times a day but the data I use this I don&#x27;t need lotion at all.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for the tiny white bumps that I get on the back of my upper arms! It is only the stuff I have found that IF I use it regularly really helps clear them up. It is perfect for the summer and whole body exfoliate. I love that it leaves my skin very soft and smooth after I rinse and smells amazingly fresh. My boyfriend even comments your skin is soo soft!</li>
            <li> this product is much to harsh for fair skin,the company should warn people about the harshness, it make you all red and chapped.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff. I&#x27;m a fan of certain Arbonne body products, but this one tops them all. I use it ALL over and give myself a thorough scrub down, let it sit for a minute, and rinse. It feels awesome and smells lovely. It&#x27;s great for removing dead skin and moisturizing deeply.</li>
            <li> I just LOVE the scent of thi... It makes me feel so fresh!  I need the oil to lubricate my skin after showers too.</li>
            <li> Exfoliates rough hands.  Leaves them smooth and has a great smell, almost like lemon.</li>
            <li> If you like a scrub that deep cleans and thoroughly moisturizes, this is for you.  It has a great oil to salt ratio so that while it is sloughing skin it deeply moisturizes.  Great aroma and doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty residue on your bathtub/shower floor.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this product after all the great reviews. It came leaking first of all. Too greasy. A mess. Have used Dead Sea salt scrubs that was better. Probably you need to buy the wash to get it off. Cuz towel everything gets greasy too when drying. The smell is the only great thing. It&#x27;s also has more liquid tan actual sea salt scrub</li>
            <li> Salt scrub has a wonderful aroma and feels nice when using. Skin is very soft when done. Convenient scoop makes it easy to get salt and oil in right combination.</li>
            <li> In the winter, the skin on my thighs and calves gets very dry and scaly. This product is the only thing I have used that totally eradicates the dryness and keeps my legs soft and smooth throughout the day (and they look so much better, too). They go from having a whitish dry tinge to them, to looking soft and supple. I use it in the shower and pat it dry. The only caveat I would issue is that your legs will feel a little oily to the touch afterwards. For me, this is a welcome change from the dry, tight feeling of before, but for some it might be too much.</li>
            <li> If you want soft hands, this is a wonderful product...used every two weeks and found my dry hands improving to be soft and smooth, younger looking too.</li>
            <li> Fabulous, I use it on my hands twice a day.  My hands are softer than ever and it is winter.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed Awaken for a number of years. It is a very clean refreshing smell. The oils replenish my very dry skin better than any other product I&#x27;ve used. I use it daily.</li>
            <li> Love this scrub! It smells so nice. I like to do it at night time before I go to bed. My hands get soo soft! Can only recommend it.</li>
            <li> I try to stock up for the winter. Living in the great Northeast, my skin can shrivel up like a raisin during the cold, dry months of winter. I use this a couple times a week and couldn&#x27;t be happier. It smells like summer and feels even better on my skin. I&#x27;ve used several Arbonne products, this is the only one I really appreciate.</li>
            <li> Best scrub out there my skin feels so good after using this</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use this and love it</li>
            <li> This product came to my house without the seal.  Its spilled into the box and on top of that the oil was NOT the sea salt oil it was suppose to be!!!!! It smelled my regular scentless oil. Definately not sea salt oil and I knowo because I have bought this product for years!!!</li>
            <li> Arbonne continues to impress me with their products.  This leaves me feeling soft, silky smooth and I will definitely be buying more despite the steep price!</li>
            <li> does a great job keeping my knees from getting callous&#x27;s from my job</li>
            <li> This is my favorite!  I use it twice a week.... and it&#x27;s the one thing I ask for EVERY year at Christmas.  Buying it on Amazon is a bonus!  I get tired of all the multilevel sales people and their pressure.  But I do love this product!</li>
