            <li>Also, Frankincense and Myrhh are amazing for your skin, nails, and even your hair</li>
            <li>It smells amazing ..</li>
            <li>Frankinsence and Myrrh have skin loving nutrients and are one of nature&#x27;s miracles for skin.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery,  Very wonderful quality.  </li>
            <li>I had hoped that it would help the nerve pain in my feet, but all it did was warm them up.</li>
            <li>nice oil, just needs a  bit more scent to it, otherwise is good.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast, product was well packaged and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>The oil is good for massage, but I was hoping that it would be more fragrant.</li>
            <li>Brother-in-law loved it, legs very tender and finds this soothing - sister likes it on her hands - good thing!</li>
            <li>Have used this before high quality great smell and is great on the body</li>
            <li>particular fragrance smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>It is very strong to the nose and takes my breath away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all about natural oils, and these are the best.</li>
            <li>If you can not take strong smelling perfumes DO NOT BUY THIS!  </li>
            <li>The soap was really supposed to be for display, but many people said it lathered beautifully</li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>love this after showers.</li>
            <li>we love it.</li>
            <li>The Zum products are an all time favorite of mine.  </li>
            <li>I use every night as a lotion for sunspots on my chest and they are getting better.  </li>
            <li>I love this scent.  </li>
            <li>I love walking into the room where I&#x27;ve been and smelling the lingering scent.</li>
            <li>surely does not disappoint.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes so well that I feel like Cleopatra must have felt with all of her pampering and love of oils.  </li>
            <li>Then, you have about 20 times more oil that you already had.  </li>
            <li>I am studying to become an herbalist, and have discovered that the ingredients in this oil are beneficial for your skin in so many ways.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t seem to need it all the time any more.</li>
            <li>The ladies seem to love it and it is unlike any cologne fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I  just love everything I have tried from this company.</li>
            <li>Get so many compliments when I wear the frankincense and myth.</li>
            <li>The aroma presented by this massage oil has both calming and exotic flavor to the senses.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>i used this oil for a mixture with shea butter to make it smell better and to make it&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>There is nothing more luxurious.  </li>
            <li>Tried this oil for peripheral neuropathy pain and it helped more than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>It is so, so very richly scented, and the scent is like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever smelled.  </li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and long lastiing for massage!</li>
            <li>The smell is too strong.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a light oil this is not it, but if you&#x27;re into rich oils you may love this product.</li>
            <li>and then it&#x27;s actually a huge bonus for you.  </li>
            <li>I did not so much enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>Fantastic scent when purchased in a retail outlet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The blend of oils used for Zum oil, is fantastic as well.</li>
            <li>Great (obviously) for massage...</li>
            <li>But same great oil</li>
            <li>well it is positively orgasmic! :)</li>
            <li>The fragrance is strong, suspended in sweet almond oil.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t strong but is fresh and light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;nothing special here....</li>
            <li>The fragrance is fabulous and pretty strong (which I love) and the oil is very moisturizing but not greasy.</li>
            <li>I love the Zum Oil F&amp;M fragrance for an intimate massage and will even wear it as a body fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This is good stuff but not packaged properly.</li>
            <li>The oil went EVERYWHERE &amp; while I love the smell, it is overpowering when there&#x27;s so much of it all over.  </li>
            <li>Not bad, just not what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>Some reviewers have noted that the scent is too strong and overpowering, which really may be accurate.  </li>
            <li>;) Free samples?</li>
            <li>I like the product but the pump was very challenging to get to open up.  </li>
            <li>It has a strong smell of lavender which was very relaxing to me.</li>
            <li>Use this product every night after my shower, love the combination of Frankinsense &amp; Myrrh not to mention how soft it leaves my skin!  </li>
            <li>For those that feel like this is too strong, just blend it into a carrier oil such as almond oil or whatever your favorite is</li>
            <li>and since she&#x27;s started using it, her customers come back more often because they love it so much.  </li>
            <li>Oil is long-lasting, with a distinct, clean/pine-y scent (the way that I like it).</li>
            <li>It was worth it.  </li>
            <li>This product is certainly my favorite oil I have ever used, as well as my fav product from Indigo Wild.</li>
            <li>Leaves such a nice aroma in the air after you bath or shower.</li>
            <li>I received the shipment super fast!  </li>
            <li>it smells great, feels great, does not get sticky, and last a good long time a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The oil is primarily almond oil and Shea butter, not thick or sticky.</li>
            <li>The Zum oil top was evidently not closed when it was packed.</li>
            <li>This fabulous oil is filled with other beautiful natural ingredients, such as meadowfoam oil.  </li>
            <li>F &amp; M is an ancient scent that has always been highly valued for it&#x27;s rich, enticing aroma.  </li>
            <li>This vendor however is very, very sketchy.</li>
            <li>Heavenly is my response and I highly recommend this for either personal massage or to bring to your own masseuse.</li>
            <li>One product is better than the next.</li>
            <li>the woman loves it and everybody says it smells great and has a long lasting smell when using it&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it in the tub for the first time and the aroma is out of this world.</li>
            <li>It starts out oily when you first put it on</li>
            <li>It also made my feet smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t mean though that it isn&#x27;t great for massages though.</li>
            <li>The oil itself is nice enough but the scent to me is like a pumped up version of Avon Skin so Soft bath oil.  </li>
            <li>although the scent may be a little strong for some,  it could easily be cut with additional unscented massage or almond oil.</li>
            <li>so I pretty much slather this oil all over.</li>
            <li>very fragrant oil.</li>
            <li>It was very well wrapped by the seller and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Very aromatic.  </li>
            <li>Really want to whole Frankincense and Myrrh collection now.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long well and even though I dislike some essential oil scents, this combination is wonderful.</li>
            <li>At this price, I hope the seller will send a new &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; bottle - with the top closed...  </li>
            <li>I use it sparingly on my skin to make it velvety smooth and silky soft and fragrant all evening, into the night, and if it weren&#x27;t for showering it off, I would smell it the next day as well.  </li>
            <li>It is rich and medium bodied and it is not full of additives.&lt;br /&gt;People comment on how fresh it smells and always ask what it is.&lt;br /&gt;Not too musky not to flowery.</li>
            <li>As being a present worthy of the King of Kings I had never smelled the two scents in combination...</li>
            <li>Though I use primary ingredients with success, this oil does trouble me</li>
            <li>leaves skin very soft!</li>
            <li>Sweet almond, meadowfoam seed, sunflower, avocado, coconut &amp; hemp oils make a great lube for the skin without being heavy or too thick.</li>
            <li>bottle didn&#x27;t have the right aroma as the one I had tried at Whole Foods, and it a oil all on the outside, was not sealed.</li>
            <li>all I highly reommend ALL of the ZUM Frankincense and  Myrhh products for their calming and healing properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is just what I was hoping for and high quality.</li>
            <li>Nice soft scent which actually compliments other perfumes (Marc Jacobs).</li>
            <li>Product has a very soothing &amp; lovely, lingering scent (albeit a little overpowering at this point!).&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it for the trueness of the scent.</li>
            <li>First purchased at a health food store but found larger quantity on here.</li>
            <li>Wow, I have already reordered this product.</li>
            <li>Hint Hint Indigo Wild</li>
            <li>I am 67 years old, garden, sew leather upholstery and care for pets</li>
            <li>MY FAVE SCENT FROM INDIGO WILD.  </li>
            <li>But surprised at the quality and fragrance.</li>
            <li>I almost returned it but instead got very aggressive with the top/pump to the point where I felt like I was going to break it when it finally popped up.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t, though that the smell itself is overpowering, it is that it is so richly scented that the oil goes a long LONG L-O-N-G way.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad that it&#x27;s also organic &amp; has no crappy mineral oil either, &#x27;cuz mineral SUCKS!!  </li>
            <li>The scent is very strong and the oil is very thick and takes a while to absorb.</li>
            <li>I love this oil, the scent is calming and subtle.</li>
            <li>When the 3 wisemen presented these to the baby Jesus at his birth, it was because it was such a costly gift and highly prized for it&#x27;s miraculous skin properties.  </li>
            <li>I can totally understand why F&amp;M continues to be a best selling product in much of the Zum line of products.&lt;br /&gt;After buying this oil direct from Indigo Wild for over 3 years, I have sadly found that shipping their products to me now is extremely expensive.</li>
            <li>It has an earthy, relaxing aroma, reminiscent of patchouli , although much more subtle.</li>
            <li>The plastic wrap it was in was covered in it, making it super slippery &amp; very difficult to open to get to the bottle to close the top.</li>
            <li>Darn it, probably 9 out of 10 can, but the carrier oil is way to harsh and I must get back in bath and get it off quickly.</li>
            <li>If you should find same problem, I suggest it well could be oil, not other ingredients.</li>
            <li>the scent is just enough to leave you feeling surrounded, but not so much that it chokes you out like some other brands I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon for carrying this product!</li>

            <li> I  just love everything I have tried from this company.</li>
            <li> Get so many compliments when I wear the frankincense and myth.</li>
            <li> The aroma presented by this massage oil has both calming and exotic flavor to the senses.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> i used this oil for a mixture with shea butter to make it smell better and to make it&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> There is nothing more luxurious.  </li>
            <li> Tried this oil for peripheral neuropathy pain and it helped more than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> It is so, so very richly scented, and the scent is like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever smelled.  </li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and long lastiing for massage!</li>
            <li> The smell is too strong.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a light oil this is not it, but if you&#x27;re into rich oils you may love this product.</li>
            <li> and then it&#x27;s actually a huge bonus for you.  </li>
            <li> I did not so much enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic scent when purchased in a retail outlet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blend of oils used for Zum oil, is fantastic as well.</li>
            <li> Great (obviously) for massage...</li>
            <li> But same great oil</li>
            <li> well it is positively orgasmic! :)</li>
            <li> The fragrance is strong, suspended in sweet almond oil.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t strong but is fresh and light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;nothing special here....</li>
            <li> The fragrance is fabulous and pretty strong (which I love) and the oil is very moisturizing but not greasy.</li>
            <li> I love the Zum Oil F&amp;M fragrance for an intimate massage and will even wear it as a body fragrance.  </li>
            <li> This is good stuff but not packaged properly.</li>
            <li> The oil went EVERYWHERE &amp; while I love the smell, it is overpowering when there&#x27;s so much of it all over.  </li>
            <li> Not bad, just not what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers have noted that the scent is too strong and overpowering, which really may be accurate.  </li>
            <li> ;) Free samples?</li>
            <li> I like the product but the pump was very challenging to get to open up.  </li>
            <li> It has a strong smell of lavender which was very relaxing to me.</li>
            <li> Use this product every night after my shower, love the combination of Frankinsense &amp; Myrrh not to mention how soft it leaves my skin!  </li>
            <li> For those that feel like this is too strong, just blend it into a carrier oil such as almond oil or whatever your favorite is</li>
            <li> and since she&#x27;s started using it, her customers come back more often because they love it so much.  </li>
            <li> Oil is long-lasting, with a distinct, clean/pine-y scent (the way that I like it).</li>
            <li> It was worth it.  </li>
            <li> This product is certainly my favorite oil I have ever used, as well as my fav product from Indigo Wild.</li>
            <li> Leaves such a nice aroma in the air after you bath or shower.</li>
            <li> I received the shipment super fast!  </li>
            <li> it smells great, feels great, does not get sticky, and last a good long time a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The oil is primarily almond oil and Shea butter, not thick or sticky.</li>
            <li> The Zum oil top was evidently not closed when it was packed.</li>
            <li> This fabulous oil is filled with other beautiful natural ingredients, such as meadowfoam oil.  </li>
            <li> F &amp; M is an ancient scent that has always been highly valued for it&#x27;s rich, enticing aroma.  </li>
            <li> This vendor however is very, very sketchy.</li>
            <li> Heavenly is my response and I highly recommend this for either personal massage or to bring to your own masseuse.</li>
            <li> One product is better than the next.</li>
            <li> the woman loves it and everybody says it smells great and has a long lasting smell when using it&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it in the tub for the first time and the aroma is out of this world.</li>
            <li> It starts out oily when you first put it on</li>
            <li> It also made my feet smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t mean though that it isn&#x27;t great for massages though.</li>
            <li> The oil itself is nice enough but the scent to me is like a pumped up version of Avon Skin so Soft bath oil.  </li>
            <li> although the scent may be a little strong for some,  it could easily be cut with additional unscented massage or almond oil.</li>
            <li> so I pretty much slather this oil all over.</li>
            <li> very fragrant oil.</li>
            <li> It was very well wrapped by the seller and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Very aromatic.  </li>
            <li> Really want to whole Frankincense and Myrrh collection now.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long well and even though I dislike some essential oil scents, this combination is wonderful.</li>
            <li> At this price, I hope the seller will send a new &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; bottle - with the top closed...  </li>
            <li> I use it sparingly on my skin to make it velvety smooth and silky soft and fragrant all evening, into the night, and if it weren&#x27;t for showering it off, I would smell it the next day as well.  </li>
            <li> It is rich and medium bodied and it is not full of additives.&lt;br /&gt;People comment on how fresh it smells and always ask what it is.&lt;br /&gt;Not too musky not to flowery.</li>
            <li> As being a present worthy of the King of Kings I had never smelled the two scents in combination...</li>
            <li> Though I use primary ingredients with success, this oil does trouble me</li>
            <li> leaves skin very soft!</li>
            <li> Sweet almond, meadowfoam seed, sunflower, avocado, coconut &amp; hemp oils make a great lube for the skin without being heavy or too thick.</li>
            <li> bottle didn&#x27;t have the right aroma as the one I had tried at Whole Foods, and it a oil all on the outside, was not sealed.</li>
            <li> all I highly reommend ALL of the ZUM Frankincense and  Myrhh products for their calming and healing properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is just what I was hoping for and high quality.</li>
            <li> Nice soft scent which actually compliments other perfumes (Marc Jacobs).</li>
            <li> Product has a very soothing &amp; lovely, lingering scent (albeit a little overpowering at this point!).&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it for the trueness of the scent.</li>
            <li> First purchased at a health food store but found larger quantity on here.</li>
            <li> Wow, I have already reordered this product.</li>
            <li> Hint Hint Indigo Wild</li>
            <li> I am 67 years old, garden, sew leather upholstery and care for pets</li>
            <li> MY FAVE SCENT FROM INDIGO WILD.  </li>
            <li> But surprised at the quality and fragrance.</li>
            <li> I almost returned it but instead got very aggressive with the top/pump to the point where I felt like I was going to break it when it finally popped up.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t, though that the smell itself is overpowering, it is that it is so richly scented that the oil goes a long LONG L-O-N-G way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad that it&#x27;s also organic &amp; has no crappy mineral oil either, &#x27;cuz mineral SUCKS!!  </li>
            <li> The scent is very strong and the oil is very thick and takes a while to absorb.</li>
            <li> I love this oil, the scent is calming and subtle.</li>
            <li> When the 3 wisemen presented these to the baby Jesus at his birth, it was because it was such a costly gift and highly prized for it&#x27;s miraculous skin properties.  </li>
            <li> I can totally understand why F&amp;M continues to be a best selling product in much of the Zum line of products.&lt;br /&gt;After buying this oil direct from Indigo Wild for over 3 years, I have sadly found that shipping their products to me now is extremely expensive.</li>
            <li> It has an earthy, relaxing aroma, reminiscent of patchouli , although much more subtle.</li>
            <li> The plastic wrap it was in was covered in it, making it super slippery &amp; very difficult to open to get to the bottle to close the top.</li>
            <li> Darn it, probably 9 out of 10 can, but the carrier oil is way to harsh and I must get back in bath and get it off quickly.</li>
            <li> If you should find same problem, I suggest it well could be oil, not other ingredients.</li>
            <li> the scent is just enough to leave you feeling surrounded, but not so much that it chokes you out like some other brands I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon for carrying this product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is long lasting in all forms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but after a few minutes the oil is absorbed so it doesn&#x27;t mess up the bed sheets.</li>
            <li> This smelled pretty unpleasant and the color is different than what I&#x27;m used to getting at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> A dab goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Lasts for a long time even though we use it every day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long been a fan of Zum oils, the frankincense and myrrh line.  </li>
            <li> The product will go a long ways!  </li>
            <li> Is not greasy after smoothing into skin, scent lasts, and does alleviate dry skin which is what I use it for.</li>
            <li> skin is dry and flaky from chemotherapy treatments</li>
            <li> If you have problems with dry skin, this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> You only need to use a little bit and the smell is heavenly.  </li>
            <li> You only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> The little &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; arrow wasn&#x27;t any help and didn&#x27;t have anything to do with the thing finally opening.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I put just a dab on my arms with my other lotion.  </li>
            <li> OTHER FAVES ARE ANISE-LAVENDER AND ORANGE-ALMOND.</li>
            <li> Smaller bottle than what I usually get.  </li>
            <li> Would like to try other zum products!</li>
            <li> Not sure if anyone read the label, this is NOT real frankincense and myrrh.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Those of you not familiar with Zum oil, let me give my two cents on why I&#x27;m sold on Zum for life!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for an everyday body oil</li>
            <li> :/  </li>
            <li> I used this product to make Gold, Frankencense and Myrrh soap to give as small gifts at Christmas.</li>
            <li> but this is too thick for everyday use, but</li>
            <li> (my hair is just past my shoulder blades and thick) and it conditions it and makes it so shiny.  </li>
            <li> The only negative, and it is quite annoying for me, is that the bottle always drips.  </li>
            <li> Returned to you wrong oil</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that it could have an effect, but within minutes the frankincense and myrrh gave me relief.</li>
            <li> So sadly I have had to go without Zum for quite a while until a friend told me I can buy it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I get painful injuries.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at the low&lt;br /&gt;price!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the smell and the way our skin feels when we use it!!</li>
            <li> very fragrant oil. leaves skin very soft!</li>
            <li> I love this oil. The fragrance is fabulous and pretty strong (which I love) and the oil is very moisturizing but not greasy.</li>
            <li> I did not so much enjoy this product. The scent is very strong and the oil is very thick and takes a while to absorb. If you&#x27;re looking for a light oil this is not it, but if you&#x27;re into rich oils you may love this product.</li>
            <li> Smells soooo good!! I mix a pump with my regular lotion and the scent lasts all day without the stickiness</li>
            <li> This is one of those oils I would buy again. It smells great, nice to put on after you shave your legs or just rub on to smell nice.</li>
            <li> Feels nice on my skin &amp; smells sooo good! I just wish it was in a much bigger bottle because I cannot get enough of this product! I&#x27;m very glad that it&#x27;s also organic &amp; has no crappy mineral oil either, &#x27;cuz mineral SUCKS!!  :/  I&#x27;ve recommended it to all the ladies in my family because it&#x27;s that good of a product! LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> bottle didn&#x27;t have the right aroma as the one I had tried at Whole Foods, and it a oil all on the outside, was not sealed.</li>
            <li> love this after showers.</li>
            <li> is massage oil is totally awesome. it smells great, feels great, does not get sticky, and last a good long time a little bit goes a long way. we love it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I received the shipment super fast!  The product will go a long ways!  You only need to use a little bit and the smell is heavenly.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> The Zum products are an all time favorite of mine.  This item is a good value.</li>
            <li> I use every night as a lotion for sunspots on my chest and they are getting better.  Tanks dr. Oz.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  Sometimes I put just a dab on my arms with my other lotion.  A dab goes a long way.  I love walking into the room where I&#x27;ve been and smelling the lingering scent.</li>
            <li> This oil is incredible.  The scent is out of this world.  I like the Zum products and this one surely does not disappoint.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL PRODUCT! Will purchase again and again. A little goes a long well and even though I dislike some essential oil scents, this combination is wonderful. Is not greasy after smoothing into skin, scent lasts, and does alleviate dry skin which is what I use it for. Would like to try other zum products!</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried this oil, get it today!  It is the BEST oil EVER!  And I&#x27;ve used a lot of oils.  It is so, so very richly scented, and the scent is like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever smelled.  It moisturizes so well that I feel like Cleopatra must have felt with all of her pampering and love of oils.  Some reviewers have noted that the scent is too strong and overpowering, which really may be accurate.  It isn&#x27;t, though that the smell itself is overpowering, it is that it is so richly scented that the oil goes a long LONG L-O-N-G way.  For those that feel like this is too strong, just blend it into a carrier oil such as almond oil or whatever your favorite is and then it&#x27;s actually a huge bonus for you.  Then, you have about 20 times more oil that you already had.  My daughter is a massage therapist and I told her about it and since she&#x27;s started using it, her customers come back more often because they love it so much.  I hope she never tells them they can buy this wonderful oil themselves, else she may lose quite a bit of business.  I noticed that one reviewer said that this does not contain Frankincense or Myrrh, and they showed the ingredient list.  The ingredient: &amp;#34;Essential Oils&amp;#34; is the Frankincense and the Myrrh, since those scents are derived by steam distilling Frankinsence and Myrrh and using the Essential Oils from that distillation.  Frankinsence and Myrrh have skin loving nutrients and are one of nature&#x27;s miracles for skin.  When the 3 wisemen presented these to the baby Jesus at his birth, it was because it was such a costly gift and highly prized for it&#x27;s miraculous skin properties.  This fabulous oil is filled with other beautiful natural ingredients, such as meadowfoam oil.  If you don&#x27;t know what that is, google it.  It&#x27;s a wonderful wonderful oil for your skin.  I am studying to become an herbalist, and have discovered that the ingredients in this oil are beneficial for your skin in so many ways.  but the scent is what keeps me hooked.  I use literally two drops, rub it between my hands, and apply to my pulse points and I smell divine all day.  I use it sparingly on my skin to make it velvety smooth and silky soft and fragrant all evening, into the night, and if it weren&#x27;t for showering it off, I would smell it the next day as well.  I use one or two drops the same way on my hair (my hair is just past my shoulder blades and thick) and it conditions it and makes it so shiny.  The only negative, and it is quite annoying for me, is that the bottle always drips.  I have to keep it on a glass dish with sides on it to keep from wasting the oil.  I have a bottle at my desk at my office and do the same thing, and I can smell it like a room fragrance during the day.  Sometimes people stop by and ask me what smells so good.</li>
            <li> Fantastic scent when purchased in a retail outlet. This vendor however is very, very sketchy. BUYER BEWARE: what I received is markedly different than what I&#x27;m used to. The UPC was lined thru by a marker. My theory is, they&#x27;ve swapped the good stuff with inferior oil. This smelled pretty unpleasant and the color is different than what I&#x27;m used to getting at Whole Foods. Will NEVER purchase from this vendor again!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and long lastiing for massage!</li>
            <li> I love this product. If you have problems with dry skin, this is the product for you! Nice soft scent which actually compliments other perfumes (Marc Jacobs). I jave been using this product for 2 years and over time made a hefty investment, no doubt! This is the best thing I could have discovered and I hope others will like it too.</li>
            <li> Brother-in-law loved it, legs very tender and finds this soothing - sister likes it on her hands - good thing!</li>
            <li> Have used this before high quality great smell and is great on the body im a big user of oils and this stuff is great</li>
            <li> I will reorder for what it has done foe me. I don&#x27;t seem to need it all the time any more.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery,  Very wonderful quality.  Wonderful scent.  I would purchase this again. I put this in a carrier oil to make a lotion bar.</li>
            <li> I love the Zum Oil F&amp;M fragrance for an intimate massage and will even wear it as a body fragrance.  The ladies seem to love it and it is unlike any cologne fragrance.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Smellas great.  We use it on our hair.</li>
            <li> I  just love everything I have tried from this company. One product is better than the next. Get so many compliments when I wear the frankincense and myth. Oil and body spray!!!  Literally people stop me on the street and ask what I have on... smells like u just stepped out of the spa!!</li>
            <li> This is good stuff but not packaged properly. A lot of my product leaked out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all about natural oils, and these are the best. The smell is delicious and it soaks right in. How good is that!</li>
            <li> I use this in place of lotion. The all-natural ingredients are wonderful and the F&amp;M scent is amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing. I mix a pump of this with my non scented body lotion after showering and find it does wonders for my skin. It is also a wonderful product on its own. It is rich and medium bodied and it is not full of additives.&lt;br /&gt;People comment on how fresh it smells and always ask what it is.&lt;br /&gt;Not too musky not to flowery.</li>
            <li> Returned to you wrong oil</li>
            <li> Wonderful massage oil. I had hoped that it would help the nerve pain in my feet, but all it did was warm them up. Doesn&#x27;t mean though that it isn&#x27;t great for massages though. I definitely recommend it for that and the smell is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I was just introduced to the Zum Oil after purchasing the EDT and Mist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great oil and calming to the soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is dry and flaky from chemotherapy treatments so I used the Zum Oil, Balm, Mist, Lotion and EDT as&lt;br /&gt;it makes me feel relaxed and peaceful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is long lasting in all forms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all I highly reommend ALL of the ZUM Frankincense and  Myrhh products for their calming and healing properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular fragrance smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> If you can not take strong smelling perfumes DO NOT BUY THIS!  It is very strong to the nose and takes my breath away. So I could not use it.</li>
            <li> Wow, I have already reordered this product. It is just what I was hoping for and high quality. Lasts for a long time even though we use it every day. I wish it came in a bigger size. It isn&#x27;t strong but is fresh and light.</li>
            <li> Product arrived promptly.  Oil is long-lasting, with a distinct, clean/pine-y scent (the way that I like it). You will like</li>
            <li> nice oil, just needs a  bit more scent to it, otherwise is good.</li>
            <li> I love the Zum soap in this scent, but this oil smells really weird, not at all like the soap. I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> The aroma presented by this massage oil has both calming and exotic flavor to the senses.  As being a present worthy of the King of Kings I had never smelled the two scents in combination...Heavenly is my response and I highly recommend this for either personal massage or to bring to your own masseuse.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re hoping for a church type incense fragrance, this isn&#x27;t it.  The oil itself is nice enough but the scent to me is like a pumped up version of Avon Skin so Soft bath oil.  Not bad, just not what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> the woman loves it and everybody says it smells great and has a long lasting smell when using it&lt;br /&gt;very nice&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> I used this product to make Gold, Frankencense and Myrrh soap to give as small gifts at Christmas. It worked great. Delivery was fast, product was well packaged and in perfect condition. Met and exceeded expectations.  The soap was really supposed to be for display, but many people said it lathered beautifully and they loved the fragrance and wanted more!! It has an earthy, relaxing aroma, reminiscent of patchouli , although much more subtle. Not a fruity or flowery smell. The oil is primarily almond oil and Shea butter, not thick or sticky. It has a very smooth feel and is good for massage or as a moisturizer.  although the scent may be a little strong for some,  it could easily be cut with additional unscented massage or almond oil. It was worth it.  I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Use this product every night after my shower, love the combination of Frankinsense &amp; Myrrh not to mention how soft it leaves my skin!  First purchased at a health food store but found larger quantity on here.</li>
            <li> Darn it, probably 9 out of 10 can, but the carrier oil is way to harsh and I must get back in bath and get it off quickly. Though I use primary ingredients with success, this oil does trouble me and so I cannot use it. If you should find same problem, I suggest it well could be oil, not other ingredients.</li>
            <li> After enjoying the sample of the oil from the Asst Zum Products, I immediately ordered the oil! I use it all over, even in my hair. Yes, two out of three Wise Men endorse this, and so do I.</li>
            <li> This is a lttle heavier oil and it smells soooooo gooooood.  You only need a little bit. Love it. It was very well wrapped by the seller and shipping was fast. I even got a sample of Zum soap.  It also smells imcreditble.  Very happy with the product and the seller.</li>
            <li> Zum oil is the best for massage and the senses.  I use it nightly to take away the days stress</li>
            <li> Thank you for zum good oil i used this oil for a mixture with shea butter to make it smell better and to make it&lt;br /&gt;more creamy when i melt the shea butter i out some Zum Oil in it then whip it up to some creamy butter that smellgood,Thank you from Brother Paul</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long been a fan of Zum oils, the frankincense and myrrh line.  But it&#x27;s a hassle trying to locate their products in smaller areas.  So I ordered this one and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  The fragrance is strong, suspended in sweet almond oil.  Very aromatic.  I use it as a body scent as well as a moisturizer on my neck and hands.  F &amp; M is an ancient scent that has always been highly valued for it&#x27;s rich, enticing aroma.  Great product.</li>
            <li> The oil is good for massage, but I was hoping that it would be more fragrant. If you are looking for a fragrant massage oil, this is not the one!</li>
            <li> I love it...even though it was in a bag and leaked all over the place lol :)</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves the smell and it goes on smooth and allows me to give a great massage!</li>
            <li> When I picked up the box I could smell the fragrance through the box...should have been a sign to watch out.  The Zum oil top was evidently not closed when it was packed. The oil went EVERYWHERE &amp; while I love the smell, it is overpowering when there&#x27;s so much of it all over.  The plastic wrap it was in was covered in it, making it super slippery &amp; very difficult to open to get to the bottle to close the top. At this price, I hope the seller will send a new &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; bottle - with the top closed...  Product has a very soothing &amp; lovely, lingering scent (albeit a little overpowering at this point!).&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it for the trueness of the scent.</li>
            <li> SMELLS SO GOOD. Also, Frankincense and Myrhh are amazing for your skin, nails, and even your hair so I pretty much slather this oil all over. A little goes a long way. Really want to whole Frankincense and Myrrh collection now. Hint Hint Indigo Wild ;) Free samples?</li>
            <li> The smell is too strong.</li>
            <li> I love this oil, the scent is calming and subtle. I use it as a winter skin moisturizer and to massage injured areas. I am 67 years old, garden, sew leather upholstery and care for pets so I get painful injuries.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I used it in the tub for the first time and the aroma is out of this world.</li>
            <li> This oil worked miracles on my tingly feet. I was skeptical that it could have an effect, but within minutes the frankincense and myrrh gave me relief. It smells great too! Very happy.</li>
            <li> There is nothing more luxurious.  I bought it for stocking stuffers.  If you want to get a friend something different this is it.</li>
            <li> This product is certainly my favorite oil I have ever used, as well as my fav product from Indigo Wild. F&amp;M is such a relaxing and rejuvenating scent to have as a body oil. I can totally understand why F&amp;M continues to be a best selling product in much of the Zum line of products.&lt;br /&gt;After buying this oil direct from Indigo Wild for over 3 years, I have sadly found that shipping their products to me now is extremely expensive. So sadly I have had to go without Zum for quite a while until a friend told me I can buy it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those of you not familiar with Zum oil, let me give my two cents on why I&#x27;m sold on Zum for life!&lt;br /&gt;The blend of oils used for Zum oil, is fantastic as well. Sweet almond, meadowfoam seed, sunflower, avocado, coconut &amp; hemp oils make a great lube for the skin without being heavy or too thick. Great (obviously) for massage...but my fav use is for after shaving my legs. Feeling something so soothing and luxurious on my skin after a shave...well it is positively orgasmic! :)&lt;br /&gt;Plus the scent is just enough to leave you feeling surrounded, but not so much that it chokes you out like some other brands I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon for carrying this product!</li>
            <li> Stimulating to the mind body and soul. Leaves such a nice aroma in the air after you bath or shower.</li>
            <li> MY FAVE SCENT FROM INDIGO WILD.  OTHER FAVES ARE ANISE-LAVENDER AND ORANGE-ALMOND.</li>
            <li> I love it and use it as cologne as well as anointing oil for ministry! It smells amazing ..I was shocked at the low&lt;br /&gt;price! But surprised at the quality and fragrance.LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Tried this oil for peripheral neuropathy pain and it helped more than anything else I have tried. It has a strong smell of lavender which was very relaxing to me. It starts out oily when you first put it on but after a few minutes the oil is absorbed so it doesn&#x27;t mess up the bed sheets. It also made my feet smooth and soft. I recommend it for neuropathy pain.</li>
            <li> I like the product but the pump was very challenging to get to open up.  I almost returned it but instead got very aggressive with the top/pump to the point where I felt like I was going to break it when it finally popped up.  There was no rhyme or reason to getting it open.  The little &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; arrow wasn&#x27;t any help and didn&#x27;t have anything to do with the thing finally opening.</li>
            <li> Smaller bottle than what I usually get.  But same great oil</li>
            <li> way to overpriced for what this product has to offer....&lt;br /&gt;nothing special here....</li>
            <li> I was looking for an everyday body oil but this is too thick for everyday use, but o.k. for massages.</li>
            <li> Not sure if anyone read the label, this is NOT real frankincense and myrrh.  Just incase you didn&#x27;t here&#x27;s it is;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Sweet almond oil, shea butter and meadow foam seed oil extract, certified organic sunflower oil, avocado, fractionated coconut and hemp oils, essential oils, fragrance oil, tocopherol (vitamin E), rosemary extract, frankincense and myrrh.</li>
