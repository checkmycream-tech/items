            <li>It&#x27;s a good face scrub</li>
            <li>It was a good price, but I&#x27;m underwhelmed and won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li>The best part though is that it was so gentle on my skin, and still did a great job of clearing it up.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best face scrubs overall and the best one offered by Burt&#x27;s Bees.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very refreshing.</li>

            <li>my face feels amazing afterwards.</li>
            <li>I liked using it as a novelty</li>
            <li>handy like we did</li>
            <li>well it smells so nice</li>
            <li>and well i honestly thought this worked for me</li>
            <li>It did a nice job of exfoliating, but I don&#x27;t know if I &#x27;d order it again.  </li>
            <li>The toner glided around my skin without effectively cleaning it.</li>
            <li>Smells yummy, kind of spicy.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S PRETTY GOOD!  </li>
            <li>Mix it on your hand, and you&#x27;ve got one of the best facial scrubs out there.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell - like figs or spiced cookies.</li>
            <li>Reputable brand.</li>
            <li>but it was so inexpensive that shipping will cost me more.  </li>
            <li>This is the best facial scrub I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>This face scrub is fantastic!</li>
            <li>so that makes it even better for your skin and it wont clog your pores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve tried, and trust me, I&#x27;ve spend hundreds of dollars on facial scrubs.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>There is no lather as it contains no sulfates, but it still cleans better than more chemically laden products.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the scrub, it has a spicy nutty scent (like a holiday candle).</li>
            <li>I decided to try this scrub because I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products</li>
            <li>:) I thought, this HAS to have nutmeg in it.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Love Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li>It arrived looking more like tar than orange cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I do LOVE this product though.</li>
            <li>but then I began to love it.</li>
            <li>because I wasn&#x27;t sure how it&#x27;d work</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I would like to thank Kandee Johnson for this purchase because she inspired me to buy it :)</li>
            <li>As for the scrub itself, it does not have a citrus smell but more of a pumpkin smell.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t love the smell and was hoping for a more refreshing, citrusy smell, but it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin nice and smooth and I love the way it smells too.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite things since 2002.</li>
            <li>I without a doubt love this product.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>an overall great product!!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure that doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty positive that this scrub will work wonderfully though :)</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Vegetable glycerin, sweet almond oil, almonds, oat flour, orange peel powder, rose petal powder, pecan shell powder, grapefruit seed extract, nutmeg powder, clove powder, orange oil, tocopherol (vitamin E), rosemary extract, fragrance.</li>
            <li>jar it comes in is adorable, and I feel great about all the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Most facial scrubs will leave you feeling smooth, but this was the best smooth feeling I have ever had.</li>
            <li>Actually, more than fine.</li>
            <li>This product smells great and leaves your skin soft and glowing.</li>
            <li>It smells great and makes my face feel so soft.</li>
            <li>I love it, leaves my face feeling incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to use and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>it makes my face soooo soft &amp; smooth!!!</li>
            <li>I love how it smells and the way it leaves my face feeling fresh and scrubbed, I am a fan for life!</li>
            <li>it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s excellent; very subtle, but pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Oh and the smell is definitely strong of cloves, not orange.</li>
            <li>Ingredients: glycerin, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) seed meal, avena sativa (oat) kernel flour, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) peel powder, rosa damascena (rose) flower oil, carya illinoensis (pecan) shell powder, citrus grandis (grapefruit) seed extract, myristica fragrans (nutmeg) fruit powder, eugenia caryophyllus (clove) flower powder, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) peel oil, tocopherol, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) extract, fragrance.    </li>
            <li>The first three days or so, I liked it.  </li>
            <li>I love how the grains in this one are very fine and the orange oil very moisturizing without being heavy/clogging pores.</li>
            <li>This facial scrub is great stuff.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin smooth &amp; radiant.</li>
            <li>Great facial scrub.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really enjoy the way you have to use it though.</li>
            <li>I found a better scrub with that St. Ives stuff, but I guess this is worth a try.  </li>
            <li>The smell was nice and the exfoliation was gently, but it did nothing for my combination skin.</li>
            <li>It did make the parts of my face that don&#x27;t have acne smooth.</li>
            <li>Fantastic scrub.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really great scrub that can be used daily.  </li>
            <li>This is just what I have been looking for--works great and skin is definitely smoother.</li>
            <li>i have very sensitive skin &amp; have never found a scrub that i can use more then like twice a week! ...</li>
            <li>Fresh scent as a bonus!</li>
            <li>Worth the cost!</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t find myself &#x27;excited&#x27; to use this product.</li>
            <li>I use it every night with warm water and my skin is super smooth and it&#x27;s light enough to use every day unlike most exfoliants.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best facial scrub I have ever used!</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it really cleans the pores.</li>
            <li>He actually gets a good scrub.</li>
            <li>and it feels so nice and soft</li>
            <li>and it smells good enough to eat.     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an overly sweet smell.</li>
            <li>There may be some citrus-y undertones, but really all I can pick up for sure is the nutmeg.</li>
            <li>Great aroma, smells of cloves and other spices, but is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I have to follow with a mild soap to remove it.</li>
            <li>I used this after my Burt&#x27;s Bees Soap Bark &amp; Camomile cleanser, and my skin was so SOFT and SMOOTH after :)</li>
            <li>I have combination skin with mild acne.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I saw results on how smooth it made my skin.</li>
            <li>I love burt&#x27;s bees products normally</li>
            <li>smell if this was a good product, but I will definitely be looking for a better natural exfoliator.  </li>
            <li>My face feels so clean, healthy and soft after using it.</li>
            <li>There was a noticeable difference in my very first use, my skin was fresh and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked great at removing any blackheads on my nose, but it was really harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t like this product as much as I thought I would as I am typically a huge fan of the Burt&#x27;s Bees family.  </li>
            <li>It definately leaves your skin fresh and dewy.</li>
            <li>I was using the sugar scrub by Fresh for years</li>
            <li>(Fresh is about $40)</li>
            <li>I rarely break out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how great it would be to remove make up and dirt from the day, but it is great to exfoliate a few times a week.</li>
            <li>I do agree that it leaves a bit of a film on your skin, but using the Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s toner after takes it right off</li>
            <li>so I bet a lot of people are dipping their germy fingers right into the jar.</li>
            <li>This has true grit-as it has large bits of exfoliating warriors.</li>
            <li>Then we apply to the face like a mask and walk around for 10-15 minutes smelling the yummy citrus spice bouquet and then either remove with a moist wash cloth or can be done right before a shower and can be scrubed off in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin smooth and soft and ready to soak up whatever fabulous moisturizer you have waiting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, make sure that you add a little water to the amount you are applying to your face, as it helps applying so much more.  </li>
            <li>You kind of have to dig it out of the jar and it is so dry it crumbles.</li>
            <li>So, to sum up what has been a slightly longer review than intended: Smells so good I might be at risk of eating it.</li>
            <li>seems kind of dry to me.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to start collecting all the products suitable for my skin because so far the few products I&#x27;ve used have been amazing.</li>
            <li>looks weird when you first see it but feels so good and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>This made my face feel smooth and extra clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft, smooth, and supple.</li>
            <li>I guess it just depends on your personal favorite smells...</li>
            <li>This facial scrub is quite refreshing at first.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any real skin afflictions like acne or breakouts, but I also rarely wear make up.  </li>
            <li>And your skin feels so smooth and soft after.</li>
            <li>I love the Citrus Facial Scrub.  </li>
            <li>At first I was worried about this because I have oily skin</li>
            <li>Skin feels smooth and soft after use.</li>
            <li>Pretty waxy.</li>
            <li>I love this facial scrub!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a great smell, and offers this strange mix of a light scrub yet moisturizing at the same time.</li>
            <li>It felt so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin silky soft and smooth with no irritation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this facial scrub.</li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t have acne I would use this daily :-)</li>
            <li>then my whole face broke out in a rash!</li>
            <li>It also left a filmy layer on top.</li>
            <li>I love the facial scrub affect on my face.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Gentle&amp;#34; scrub is right, I wouldn&#x27;t really consider it an exfoliant.  </li>
            <li>When I rinsed this product off my face, it left an oily residue, so much that I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough to use every day and smell yummy :)</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m actually not wild about the smell of cloves, but love this product&#x27;s aroma.)</li>
            <li>I thoroughly wet my face first, then take a bit of mixture - about a quarter sized amount - and put that in the palm of my hands with just a bit of water, adding more until I get a paste I can use to scrub my face with.  </li>
            <li>No rough housing is needed; gentle is the word  when this is used often, it works wonders and is chemical free.  </li>
            <li>I have used many different facial scrubs, and this product is nothing special.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend for oily skin, but its wonderful for dry dull skin.</li>
            <li>This product instantly made my skin softer and gave it an extra youthful dewyness, I love it!</li>
            <li>In my pursuit of using more natural (or green) products in my life, I have changed my wonderful clinique exfoliating scrub (no probs with that product whatsoever, other than it&#x27;s not natural) to this product as my once a week skin refresher.  </li>
            <li>To give the reader a bit more background, I have what you would call \\&quot;normal\\&quot; type skin, but if it went one way or the other, my skin would tend to be more dry than oily.  </li>
            <li>A gentle scrub on my combo dry/oily skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I did not dislike this product, but I don&#x27;t really care to use a scrub on my face.</li>
            <li>I am ready to throw this in the garbage.  </li>
            <li>but I really like it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s VERY spicey smelling...</li>
            <li>I really loves his scrub.</li>
            <li>I would give the creator a million high fives!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a very citrus smell or any odor that lingers.</li>
            <li>And there really isn&#x27;t much \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; to this scrub either</li>
            <li>It really does make your skin glow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle but seems to exfoliate well.</li>
            <li>Gently rub in circles around your face then rinse.</li>
            <li>The oils in the scrub don&#x27;t seem to make it worse and do a great job cleaning the area.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, natural and leaves your skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Your face will feel much tighter after using it.</li>
            <li>I then used their Acne Clarifying Toner and it became too much.</li>
            <li>I have purchased through the years more expensive facial cleansers and this works great for me</li>
            <li>but it is very crumbly.  </li>
            <li>I use it add the end of the day to really get my makeup off...</li>
            <li>You have to be careful and not use too much at one time and don&#x27;t use more than 3 times a week.</li>
            <li>I scoop up a bit with my finger and add a few drops of water to make a paste, gently exfoliate my face for about a minute and then rinse with warm water.</li>
            <li>Dont bother ordering this, words cant express how dissappointed I am with Burts for selling this since I LOVE all their other products.  </li>
            <li>OVERALL, a great GENTLE face scrub that delivers all the benefits without the harsh chemicals!    </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t expect it to deep clean.</li>
            <li>Just scoop out a small amount, really, about 1/2-1 tsp is plenty, and mix with some warm water.</li>
            <li>I use this product to keep my face clean and from getting BIG pores.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very soft and smooth, even when I&#x27;m mid break out.</li>
            <li>is the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried Burt&#x27;s Bees products, I&#x27;d always avoided them for the cost and thinking it was just part of the \\&quot;all natural hype\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I have tried st. Ives and every seemingly natural brand in between but this stuff is the real deal!</li>
            <li>and he cant live without it!</li>
            <li>laughed at the reviews that said it was too pasty or hard because although the jar is small it is filled with a more concentrated paste that, when some is scooped out and mixed with a few drops of water becomes a more spreadable product - AND THE DIRECTIONS TELL YOU THAT</li>
            <li>Even better, you only need a pea-sized amount mixed with a couple drops of water in your hand, so the 2 oz.</li>
            <li>For those who are used to runnier scrubs in a tube this might be a strange experience at first but one that will get easier with time, it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly care for the scent (it does NOT smell like cinnamon, orange peel or pumpkin pie</li>
            <li>I started using the Dermalogica Clean Start Kit for my acne and my face is starting to clear up!</li>
            <li>A highly recommended product to exfoliate without drying out.</li>
            <li>What I do is put a little of it in my palm, and put my cleansing lotion on top and mix it in and wash my face.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin pretty soft, although my face is extremely sensitive it doesn&#x27;t cause any side effects.</li>
            <li>but I am told this is normal.  </li>
            <li>I love this product so much I researched stores where I can purchase it when I moved (not many do).</li>
            <li>A thick, earthy feeling paste, like something ancient Aztecs could have made scented with ground almonds, pecans, rose petals, oats and orange oil.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly sensitive and acne prone skin, so I am VERY hesitant to try new products.</li>
            <li>The price is right and it really lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Just a very small amount is needed and my face feels so clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not super strong either.</li>
            <li>Two ounces is lot more than you&#x27;d think because you use very little at a time.</li>
            <li>I will give it a second star based on the fact that the product&#x27;s packaging is recyclable (jar is glass, lid is steel, and box is paperboard) and I will give it the \\&quot;benefit of the doubt\\&quot; star as it is the first \\&quot;natural\\&quot; exfoliating product that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I used it for the first time last night</li>
            <li>It is kind of a hassle trying to pick the right amount out of the little jar and adding some water and getting it on to your face in a timely/not so messy manner.</li>
            <li>But once I&#x27;ve toweled my face dry, my face is super soft and moisturized and has this glowy look.</li>
            <li>When my wife brought this little vial home, I looked at it and thought, This is only going to last two days at most!  </li>
            <li>It smells like Christmas, cinnamon and orange spice that knocks deep down my nose and gently yet thoroughly uncovers soft, smooth skin.</li>
            <li>since it&#x27;s citrus haha, but none the less it smells amazing, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about putting harsh or damaging chemicals on your face like</li>
            <li>I especially use it around my nose where my pores are large and prone to blackheads.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have said you only have to use a small amount, it smells great</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gentle enough to use every day but still exfoliates and leaves your skin feeling baby soft.</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping this would be the product that would clear my acne</li>
            <li>I think if you have sensitive skin, you might want to give this a try.  </li>
            <li>99.94% natural.</li>
            <li>Natural product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a natural product</li>
            <li>This is the only scrub I&#x27;ll use on my face, where my skin is very acne prone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural ingredients</li>
            <li>Truly all natural.</li>
            <li>I will stick with the Aveeno face scrubs as the grit is substantial, but not harsh.</li>
            <li>Combination , Sensitive</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product works well.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft and doesn&#x27;t give that damaged feeling some scrubs can do sometimes.</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the smell which smells EXACTLY like black licorice.</li>
            <li>But enough about the smell, that does not a good product make (though it sure helps!).</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t buy the single on Amazon since it&#x27;s slightly higher.</li>
            <li>After a recommendation from a youtube make up guru, and success with other Burt&#x27;s Bees products, I decided to take the risk.</li>
            <li>I shy away from scrubs &amp; exfoliants (even though I really need it) because most products -- even those labeled \\&quot;for sensitive skin\\&quot; -- make my sensitive skin sting and burn!</li>
            <li>What you&#x27;ll find is that the facial scrub is a highly concentrated paste.  </li>
            <li>only beef is that I prefer products do not come in jars due to a higher cross contamination potential but due to the thick paste it probably makes more sense, but then, probably most people do not have skin care spatulas</li>
            <li>This is a vastly different product than I have ever used, though, so I quit rinsing and dried my face, and then it felt fine.</li>
            <li>and it helped calm down the rash and exfoliated my skin.</li>
            <li>This is gentle enough to use daily.</li>
            <li>Helps exfoliate and gentle enough to use daily.</li>
            <li>If you do use this, I&#x27;d only scrub with it a few times a week and make sure you use another cleanser that has serious deep-cleaning properties, because this citrus scrub doesn&#x27;t deep clean.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly dry skin that doesn&#x27;t give me many problems, other than extreme dullness.  </li>
            <li>However, I began sprouting dark spots all over my face, especially near my nose.  </li>
            <li>What surprised me is how long this stuff lasts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To get the right effect, scoop a small amount with your fingers and mix it with a bit of water in your hand.</li>
            <li>The pot is a small thing that can fit in the palm of your hand with your fingers closed around it.</li>
            <li>Its tooooooooo thick, i am unable to use it, most of it i use to clean my bathroom floor, sink and tub.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also super thick</li>
            <li>I have used products like this before, but this scrub is much drier, denser, and more difficult to get out of the jar than other similar face scrubs.  </li>
            <li>I did rinse more than usual, since it still felt slick, which I don&#x27;t normally get from other cleansers.</li>
            <li>The smell is alright, but afterwards there always seems to be a little bit of a residue left on my face, no matter how much I rinse it off again.</li>

            <li> The best part though is that it was so gentle on my skin, and still did a great job of clearing it up.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best face scrubs overall and the best one offered by Burt&#x27;s Bees.&lt;br</li>

            <li> my face feels amazing afterwards.</li>
            <li> I liked using it as a novelty</li>
            <li> handy like we did</li>
            <li> well it smells so nice</li>
            <li> and well i honestly thought this worked for me</li>
            <li> It did a nice job of exfoliating, but I don&#x27;t know if I &#x27;d order it again.  </li>
            <li> The toner glided around my skin without effectively cleaning it.</li>
            <li> Smells yummy, kind of spicy.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S PRETTY GOOD!  </li>
            <li> Mix it on your hand, and you&#x27;ve got one of the best facial scrubs out there.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell - like figs or spiced cookies.</li>
            <li> Reputable brand.</li>
            <li> but it was so inexpensive that shipping will cost me more.  </li>
            <li> This is the best facial scrub I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> This face scrub is fantastic!</li>
            <li> so that makes it even better for your skin and it wont clog your pores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve tried, and trust me, I&#x27;ve spend hundreds of dollars on facial scrubs.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> There is no lather as it contains no sulfates, but it still cleans better than more chemically laden products.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the scrub, it has a spicy nutty scent (like a holiday candle).</li>
            <li> I decided to try this scrub because I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products</li>
            <li> :) I thought, this HAS to have nutmeg in it.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Love Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li> It arrived looking more like tar than orange cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I do LOVE this product though.</li>
            <li> but then I began to love it.</li>
            <li> because I wasn&#x27;t sure how it&#x27;d work</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I would like to thank Kandee Johnson for this purchase because she inspired me to buy it :)</li>
            <li> As for the scrub itself, it does not have a citrus smell but more of a pumpkin smell.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love the smell and was hoping for a more refreshing, citrusy smell, but it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin nice and smooth and I love the way it smells too.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite things since 2002.</li>
            <li> I without a doubt love this product.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> an overall great product!!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure that doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty positive that this scrub will work wonderfully though :)</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Vegetable glycerin, sweet almond oil, almonds, oat flour, orange peel powder, rose petal powder, pecan shell powder, grapefruit seed extract, nutmeg powder, clove powder, orange oil, tocopherol (vitamin E), rosemary extract, fragrance.</li>
            <li> jar it comes in is adorable, and I feel great about all the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Most facial scrubs will leave you feeling smooth, but this was the best smooth feeling I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Actually, more than fine.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and leaves your skin soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> It smells great and makes my face feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I love it, leaves my face feeling incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to use and smells nice.  </li>
            <li> it makes my face soooo soft &amp; smooth!!!</li>
            <li> I love how it smells and the way it leaves my face feeling fresh and scrubbed, I am a fan for life!</li>
            <li> it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s excellent; very subtle, but pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Oh and the smell is definitely strong of cloves, not orange.</li>
            <li> Ingredients: glycerin, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) seed meal, avena sativa (oat) kernel flour, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) peel powder, rosa damascena (rose) flower oil, carya illinoensis (pecan) shell powder, citrus grandis (grapefruit) seed extract, myristica fragrans (nutmeg) fruit powder, eugenia caryophyllus (clove) flower powder, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) peel oil, tocopherol, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) extract, fragrance.    </li>
            <li> The first three days or so, I liked it.  </li>
            <li> I love how the grains in this one are very fine and the orange oil very moisturizing without being heavy/clogging pores.</li>
            <li> This facial scrub is great stuff.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin smooth &amp; radiant.</li>
            <li> Great facial scrub.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really enjoy the way you have to use it though.</li>
            <li> I found a better scrub with that St. Ives stuff, but I guess this is worth a try.  </li>
            <li> The smell was nice and the exfoliation was gently, but it did nothing for my combination skin.</li>
            <li> It did make the parts of my face that don&#x27;t have acne smooth.</li>
            <li> Fantastic scrub.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really great scrub that can be used daily.  </li>
            <li> This is just what I have been looking for--works great and skin is definitely smoother.</li>
            <li> i have very sensitive skin &amp; have never found a scrub that i can use more then like twice a week! ...</li>
            <li> Fresh scent as a bonus!</li>
            <li> Worth the cost!</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t find myself &#x27;excited&#x27; to use this product.</li>
            <li> I use it every night with warm water and my skin is super smooth and it&#x27;s light enough to use every day unlike most exfoliants.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best facial scrub I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it really cleans the pores.</li>
            <li> He actually gets a good scrub.</li>
            <li> and it feels so nice and soft</li>
            <li> and it smells good enough to eat.     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an overly sweet smell.</li>
            <li> There may be some citrus-y undertones, but really all I can pick up for sure is the nutmeg.</li>
            <li> Great aroma, smells of cloves and other spices, but is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I have to follow with a mild soap to remove it.</li>
            <li> I used this after my Burt&#x27;s Bees Soap Bark &amp; Camomile cleanser, and my skin was so SOFT and SMOOTH after :)</li>
            <li> I have combination skin with mild acne.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I saw results on how smooth it made my skin.</li>
            <li> I love burt&#x27;s bees products normally</li>
            <li> smell if this was a good product, but I will definitely be looking for a better natural exfoliator.  </li>
            <li> My face feels so clean, healthy and soft after using it.</li>
            <li> There was a noticeable difference in my very first use, my skin was fresh and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked great at removing any blackheads on my nose, but it was really harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t like this product as much as I thought I would as I am typically a huge fan of the Burt&#x27;s Bees family.  </li>
            <li> It definately leaves your skin fresh and dewy.</li>
            <li> I was using the sugar scrub by Fresh for years</li>
            <li> (Fresh is about $40)</li>
            <li> I rarely break out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how great it would be to remove make up and dirt from the day, but it is great to exfoliate a few times a week.</li>
            <li> I do agree that it leaves a bit of a film on your skin, but using the Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s toner after takes it right off</li>
            <li> so I bet a lot of people are dipping their germy fingers right into the jar.</li>
            <li> This has true grit-as it has large bits of exfoliating warriors.</li>
            <li> Then we apply to the face like a mask and walk around for 10-15 minutes smelling the yummy citrus spice bouquet and then either remove with a moist wash cloth or can be done right before a shower and can be scrubed off in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin smooth and soft and ready to soak up whatever fabulous moisturizer you have waiting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, make sure that you add a little water to the amount you are applying to your face, as it helps applying so much more.  </li>
            <li> You kind of have to dig it out of the jar and it is so dry it crumbles.</li>
            <li> So, to sum up what has been a slightly longer review than intended: Smells so good I might be at risk of eating it.</li>
            <li> seems kind of dry to me.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to start collecting all the products suitable for my skin because so far the few products I&#x27;ve used have been amazing.</li>
            <li> looks weird when you first see it but feels so good and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This made my face feel smooth and extra clean.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft, smooth, and supple.</li>
            <li> I guess it just depends on your personal favorite smells...</li>
            <li> This facial scrub is quite refreshing at first.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any real skin afflictions like acne or breakouts, but I also rarely wear make up.  </li>
            <li> And your skin feels so smooth and soft after.</li>
            <li> I love the Citrus Facial Scrub.  </li>
            <li> At first I was worried about this because I have oily skin</li>
            <li> Skin feels smooth and soft after use.</li>
            <li> Pretty waxy.</li>
            <li> I love this facial scrub!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a great smell, and offers this strange mix of a light scrub yet moisturizing at the same time.</li>
            <li> It felt so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin silky soft and smooth with no irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this facial scrub.</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t have acne I would use this daily :-)</li>
            <li> then my whole face broke out in a rash!</li>
            <li> It also left a filmy layer on top.</li>
            <li> I love the facial scrub affect on my face.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Gentle&amp;#34; scrub is right, I wouldn&#x27;t really consider it an exfoliant.  </li>
            <li> When I rinsed this product off my face, it left an oily residue, so much that I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough to use every day and smell yummy :)</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m actually not wild about the smell of cloves, but love this product&#x27;s aroma.)</li>
            <li> I thoroughly wet my face first, then take a bit of mixture - about a quarter sized amount - and put that in the palm of my hands with just a bit of water, adding more until I get a paste I can use to scrub my face with.  </li>
            <li> No rough housing is needed; gentle is the word  when this is used often, it works wonders and is chemical free.  </li>
            <li> I have used many different facial scrubs, and this product is nothing special.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend for oily skin, but its wonderful for dry dull skin.</li>
            <li> This product instantly made my skin softer and gave it an extra youthful dewyness, I love it!</li>
            <li> In my pursuit of using more natural (or green) products in my life, I have changed my wonderful clinique exfoliating scrub (no probs with that product whatsoever, other than it&#x27;s not natural) to this product as my once a week skin refresher.  </li>
            <li> To give the reader a bit more background, I have what you would call \\&quot;normal\\&quot; type skin, but if it went one way or the other, my skin would tend to be more dry than oily.  </li>
            <li> A gentle scrub on my combo dry/oily skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I did not dislike this product, but I don&#x27;t really care to use a scrub on my face.</li>
            <li> I am ready to throw this in the garbage.  </li>
            <li> but I really like it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s VERY spicey smelling...</li>
            <li> I really loves his scrub.</li>
            <li> I would give the creator a million high fives!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a very citrus smell or any odor that lingers.</li>
            <li> And there really isn&#x27;t much \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; to this scrub either</li>
            <li> It really does make your skin glow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle but seems to exfoliate well.</li>
            <li> Gently rub in circles around your face then rinse.</li>
            <li> The oils in the scrub don&#x27;t seem to make it worse and do a great job cleaning the area.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, natural and leaves your skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Your face will feel much tighter after using it.</li>
            <li> I then used their Acne Clarifying Toner and it became too much.</li>
            <li> I have purchased through the years more expensive facial cleansers and this works great for me</li>
            <li> but it is very crumbly.  </li>
            <li> I use it add the end of the day to really get my makeup off...</li>
            <li> You have to be careful and not use too much at one time and don&#x27;t use more than 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> I scoop up a bit with my finger and add a few drops of water to make a paste, gently exfoliate my face for about a minute and then rinse with warm water.</li>
            <li> Dont bother ordering this, words cant express how dissappointed I am with Burts for selling this since I LOVE all their other products.  </li>
            <li> OVERALL, a great GENTLE face scrub that delivers all the benefits without the harsh chemicals!    </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t expect it to deep clean.</li>
            <li> Just scoop out a small amount, really, about 1/2-1 tsp is plenty, and mix with some warm water.</li>
            <li> I use this product to keep my face clean and from getting BIG pores.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel very soft and smooth, even when I&#x27;m mid break out.</li>
            <li> is the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried Burt&#x27;s Bees products, I&#x27;d always avoided them for the cost and thinking it was just part of the \\&quot;all natural hype\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have tried st. Ives and every seemingly natural brand in between but this stuff is the real deal!</li>
            <li> and he cant live without it!</li>
            <li> laughed at the reviews that said it was too pasty or hard because although the jar is small it is filled with a more concentrated paste that, when some is scooped out and mixed with a few drops of water becomes a more spreadable product - AND THE DIRECTIONS TELL YOU THAT</li>
            <li> Even better, you only need a pea-sized amount mixed with a couple drops of water in your hand, so the 2 oz.</li>
            <li> For those who are used to runnier scrubs in a tube this might be a strange experience at first but one that will get easier with time, it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly care for the scent (it does NOT smell like cinnamon, orange peel or pumpkin pie</li>
            <li> I started using the Dermalogica Clean Start Kit for my acne and my face is starting to clear up!</li>
            <li> A highly recommended product to exfoliate without drying out.</li>
            <li> What I do is put a little of it in my palm, and put my cleansing lotion on top and mix it in and wash my face.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin pretty soft, although my face is extremely sensitive it doesn&#x27;t cause any side effects.</li>
            <li> but I am told this is normal.  </li>
            <li> I love this product so much I researched stores where I can purchase it when I moved (not many do).</li>
            <li> A thick, earthy feeling paste, like something ancient Aztecs could have made scented with ground almonds, pecans, rose petals, oats and orange oil.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive and acne prone skin, so I am VERY hesitant to try new products.</li>
            <li> The price is right and it really lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Just a very small amount is needed and my face feels so clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not super strong either.</li>
            <li> Two ounces is lot more than you&#x27;d think because you use very little at a time.</li>
            <li> I will give it a second star based on the fact that the product&#x27;s packaging is recyclable (jar is glass, lid is steel, and box is paperboard) and I will give it the \\&quot;benefit of the doubt\\&quot; star as it is the first \\&quot;natural\\&quot; exfoliating product that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I used it for the first time last night</li>
            <li> It is kind of a hassle trying to pick the right amount out of the little jar and adding some water and getting it on to your face in a timely/not so messy manner.</li>
            <li> But once I&#x27;ve toweled my face dry, my face is super soft and moisturized and has this glowy look.</li>
            <li> When my wife brought this little vial home, I looked at it and thought, This is only going to last two days at most!  </li>
            <li> It smells like Christmas, cinnamon and orange spice that knocks deep down my nose and gently yet thoroughly uncovers soft, smooth skin.</li>
            <li> since it&#x27;s citrus haha, but none the less it smells amazing, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about putting harsh or damaging chemicals on your face like</li>
            <li> I especially use it around my nose where my pores are large and prone to blackheads.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said you only have to use a small amount, it smells great</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s gentle enough to use every day but still exfoliates and leaves your skin feeling baby soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping this would be the product that would clear my acne</li>
            <li> I think if you have sensitive skin, you might want to give this a try.  </li>
            <li> 99.94% natural.</li>
            <li> Natural product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a natural product</li>
            <li> This is the only scrub I&#x27;ll use on my face, where my skin is very acne prone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural ingredients</li>
            <li> Truly all natural.</li>
            <li> I will stick with the Aveeno face scrubs as the grit is substantial, but not harsh.</li>
            <li> Combination , Sensitive</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product works well.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft and doesn&#x27;t give that damaged feeling some scrubs can do sometimes.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the smell which smells EXACTLY like black licorice.</li>
            <li> But enough about the smell, that does not a good product make (though it sure helps!).</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy the single on Amazon since it&#x27;s slightly higher.</li>
            <li> After a recommendation from a youtube make up guru, and success with other Burt&#x27;s Bees products, I decided to take the risk.</li>
            <li> I shy away from scrubs &amp; exfoliants (even though I really need it) because most products -- even those labeled \\&quot;for sensitive skin\\&quot; -- make my sensitive skin sting and burn!</li>
            <li> What you&#x27;ll find is that the facial scrub is a highly concentrated paste.  </li>
            <li> only beef is that I prefer products do not come in jars due to a higher cross contamination potential but due to the thick paste it probably makes more sense, but then, probably most people do not have skin care spatulas</li>
            <li> This is a vastly different product than I have ever used, though, so I quit rinsing and dried my face, and then it felt fine.</li>
            <li> and it helped calm down the rash and exfoliated my skin.</li>
            <li> This is gentle enough to use daily.</li>
            <li> Helps exfoliate and gentle enough to use daily.</li>
            <li> If you do use this, I&#x27;d only scrub with it a few times a week and make sure you use another cleanser that has serious deep-cleaning properties, because this citrus scrub doesn&#x27;t deep clean.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly dry skin that doesn&#x27;t give me many problems, other than extreme dullness.  </li>
            <li> However, I began sprouting dark spots all over my face, especially near my nose.  </li>
            <li> What surprised me is how long this stuff lasts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To get the right effect, scoop a small amount with your fingers and mix it with a bit of water in your hand.</li>
            <li> The pot is a small thing that can fit in the palm of your hand with your fingers closed around it.</li>
            <li> Its tooooooooo thick, i am unable to use it, most of it i use to clean my bathroom floor, sink and tub.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also super thick</li>
            <li> I have used products like this before, but this scrub is much drier, denser, and more difficult to get out of the jar than other similar face scrubs.  </li>
            <li> I did rinse more than usual, since it still felt slick, which I don&#x27;t normally get from other cleansers.</li>
            <li> The smell is alright, but afterwards there always seems to be a little bit of a residue left on my face, no matter how much I rinse it off again.</li>
            <li> and it takes a few tries to get it right.  </li>
            <li> First, my jar of this citrus facial scrub was so concentrated that it had the consistency of play-doh, so it was hard to get this stuff out of the jar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new facial scrub, and had a few friends recommend this one.</li>
            <li> and I mean this in a good and bad way as while it is gentle to the skin, I feel like it may not be exfoliating enough.</li>
            <li> jar will last you for a REALLY long time.</li>
            <li> First off, the texture of this scrub is too thick.</li>
            <li> This is a strange product.  </li>
            <li> and it kinda forms a paste that smells deliscious and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Now this is all natural, so it may not have that harsh of effect, but I just don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I also think that there&#x27;s an odd oily feel afterwards, so I use my regular facial bar soap after.</li>
            <li> This little jar will last a long time but it&#x27;s an addictive pleasure, so I recommend stocking up.    </li>
            <li> Too thick, all clumpy and hard to smooth onto face.  </li>
            <li> Took very long for this product to get here</li>
            <li> It smells like a grandma&#x27;s kitchen at Christmas, but I found it a bit dry to use.</li>
            <li> so the texture is a bit dry</li>
            <li> I think this scrub would work well for people with dry skin too since it is moisturizing.</li>
            <li> but I do struggle with dry skin that lacks radiance.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s not meant for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Recommended for: Combination , Dry</li>
            <li> Your hands have to be dry before dipping them into the pot or it&#x27;ll muck up the rest of the content.</li>
            <li> Its not a cause for concern though, because with the amount of product you&#x27;ll be using each time, its bound to last you for a couple months at least, especially if you don&#x27;t plan on using it daily.</li>
            <li> It will produce a slight lather, and is very gritty, but again, neither of which bothers me.</li>
            <li> A little bit mixed with water, goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the people who gave this a poor rating--they certainly did not read the instructions--</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it leaves a little bit of residue on my face.</li>
            <li> If used correctly, this little container should last you months.  </li>
            <li> but you have to actually dillute it a little with water</li>
            <li> Much too tough for my skin.</li>
            <li> and I no longer have any patches of rough skin on my face.</li>
            <li> Also the pot is made of glass, so with all the fumbling around just be careful not to drop the pot.</li>
            <li> I have been using other products for the scarring in conjunction, so I can&#x27;t say that this scrub is what has helped my complexion, but it certainly hasn&#x27;t made things worse.</li>
            <li> I know everyone has different skin, but for me personally is caused small little skin colored bumps all over my forehead.  </li>
            <li> so it sounds and looks like such a small jar</li>
            <li> I was kinda worried about the smell because of some of the other reviews</li>
            <li> The scrub also works well on feet and other parts of the body.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to apply at first because it comes out in pieces.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too harsh to use everyday, for me anyway, and I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry and refreshes and scrubs off the dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li> However, in terms of visual... the product (when added with water) looks a bit like wet sand .. or something else, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick paste, you have to water it down to manage it, so the little jar will last a long time I think.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, a little goes a long way, just mix with a little water.</li>
            <li> simply place a small amt in palm of hand add a few drops of water and mix--</li>
            <li> This scrub actually left a thick layer of the product on my skin and felt like &#x27;Vaseline&#x27;.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it leaves your skin feeling slightly oily.</li>
            <li> It is a small jar, but a little goes a long way, and you do not have to use every day.</li>
            <li> almost very other face wash/cleanser/scrub does.</li>
            <li> It makes me a little uncomfortable, haha.</li>
            <li> but after like 10 days my face started to get black heads on my forhead and ckeeks</li>
            <li> have pale, almost see through skin, as well as rosacea &amp; extreme sensitivity.</li>
            <li> You must get a small amount on your finger tips and apply to a wet face to \\&quot;activate\\&quot; it.  </li>
            <li> It feels comparable to St. Ives, which I have been told actually tears the outer layer of your dermis- not good.</li>
            <li> Also, once you wash it off, it leaves this filmy moisture which I&#x27;m not too crazy about at first.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day, usually in the shower.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t underestimate this little jar of brown/orange stuff.</li>
            <li> You can use a little or a lot.  </li>
            <li> You are supposed to put a little bit in your hand and then add 2 drops of water.  </li>
            <li> Though this product looked like it would be too harsh for my skin type, I decided to give it a whirl.</li>
            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t use everyday, because the oily areas began to feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I had to pick up chunks that fell into my sink because I didn&#x27;t want to waste the product.</li>
            <li> All you have to do is scoop a small portion out and add a little bit of water.  </li>
            <li> The smell was really bad at first</li>
            <li> /&gt;We use a small plastic spatula to scoop into the palm of the hand and mix just a few drops in to form a spreadable paste.</li>
            <li> It is fairly dried out and thick in the jar</li>
            <li> If I have been wearing make up, I use my usual cleanser before the scrub.</li>
            <li> I can get past the baking cabinet hodge podge of spices</li>
            <li> A small plastic scooper added to the box would be a plus.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this facial scrub.</li>
            <li> I have a bit of a pumpkin pie obsession (bordering on unhealthy, seriously), so I  may be slightly biased due to the smell.</li>
            <li> The smell is very subtle and blends well with other products.  </li>
            <li> ; it&#x27;s kinda hard to apply to your face.  </li>
            <li> It was HARD to get the scrubbing part going.</li>
            <li> My daughter LOVES this product and it&#x27;s hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Burt&#x27;s Bees Acne Solutions Scrub too, and that one has too little beads in it to exfoliate well, it also leaves behind an oily residue I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the jar, I noticed how thick it was.</li>
            <li> I had to log on to review this terrible product right away!</li>
            <li> Tough to dig out and smells like dirt, but works well.</li>
            <li> It seems to always be out of stock at any of the stores we go to, so i started buying it on amazon and its also a few dollars cheaper here!!!</li>
            <li> Maybe I can try again to thin it out with water.  </li>
            <li> There could possibly be worse out there, but I am dubious of that.</li>
            <li> Like molasses or tar--very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this stuff-</li>
            <li> I like weird stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too crazy about the smell though.</li>
            <li> SO disappointed and annoyed!</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t taste bad either.</li>
            <li> And stinks!</li>
            <li> and I was a bit disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> but I HATE the smell</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Saw it on Kandee Johnson&#x27;s site. Tough to dig out and smells like dirt, but works well.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin pretty soft, although my face is extremely sensitive it doesn&#x27;t cause any side effects.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself but then my boyfriend started using it and he cant live without it! It seems to always be out of stock at any of the stores we go to, so i started buying it on amazon and its also a few dollars cheaper here!!!</li>
            <li> A gentle scrub on my combo dry/oily skin. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it leaves a little bit of residue on my face. I have to follow with a mild soap to remove it.</li>
            <li> Like molasses or tar--very difficult to use. And stinks!</li>
            <li> When my wife brought this little vial home, I looked at it and thought, This is only going to last two days at most!  What you&#x27;ll find is that the facial scrub is a highly concentrated paste.  All you have to do is scoop a small portion out and add a little bit of water.  Mix it on your hand, and you&#x27;ve got one of the best facial scrubs out there.  And the smell...it&#x27;s excellent; very subtle, but pleasant.  If used correctly, this little container should last you months.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I liked using it as a novelty but it made my skin break out!</li>
            <li> I think this stuff is edible. It smells like a grandma&#x27;s kitchen at Christmas, but I found it a bit dry to use. You kind of have to dig it out of the jar and it is so dry it crumbles. I did not dislike this product, but I don&#x27;t really care to use a scrub on my face. I think if you have sensitive skin, you might want to give this a try.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: &lt;br /&gt;Vegetable glycerin, sweet almond oil, almonds, oat flour, orange peel powder, rose petal powder, pecan shell powder, grapefruit seed extract, nutmeg powder, clove powder, orange oil, tocopherol (vitamin E), rosemary extract, fragrance. 99.94% natural. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I shy away from scrubs &amp; exfoliants (even though I really need it) because most products -- even those labeled \\&quot;for sensitive skin\\&quot; -- make my sensitive skin sting and burn! Not so with this scrub, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pale, almost see through skin, as well as rosacea &amp; extreme sensitivity. Though this product looked like it would be too harsh for my skin type, I decided to give it a whirl. I loved everything about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar it comes in is adorable, and I feel great about all the natural ingredients. I love the smell - like figs or spiced cookies. It&#x27;s a thick paste, you have to water it down to manage it, so the little jar will last a long time I think. The best part though is that it was so gentle on my skin, and still did a great job of clearing it up. There was a noticeable difference in my very first use, my skin was fresh and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried Burt&#x27;s Bees products, I&#x27;d always avoided them for the cost and thinking it was just part of the \\&quot;all natural hype\\&quot;. But I&#x27;m sold. I&#x27;m going to start collecting all the products suitable for my skin because so far the few products I&#x27;ve used have been amazing.</li>
            <li> I know everyone has different skin, but for me personally is caused small little skin colored bumps all over my forehead.  It worked great at removing any blackheads on my nose, but it was really harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and leaves your skin soft and glowing. I have combination skin so I couldn&#x27;t use everyday, because the oily areas began to feel greasy. I don&#x27;t recommend for oily skin, but its wonderful for dry dull skin.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00012NKGS Burt&#x27;s Bees Citrus Facial Scrub - 2 oz]]    This is by far the best facial scrub I have ever used! It is so soothing to your face and the smell is wonderful. The price is right and it really lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft, smooth, and supple. Moisturized yet exfoliated. Natural product. Reputable brand. A highly recommended product to exfoliate without drying out. Fresh scent as a bonus!</li>
            <li> This facial scrub is great stuff. I love the smell and it really cleans the pores. What surprised me is how long this stuff lasts. Two ounces is lot more than you&#x27;d think because you use very little at a time. Recommended.    (The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)</li>
            <li> I am ready to throw this in the garbage.  Its tooooooooo thick, i am unable to use it, most of it i use to clean my bathroom floor, sink and tub.  Maybe I can try again to thin it out with water.  I would definitly return it but it was so inexpensive that shipping will cost me more.  Dont bother ordering this, words cant express how dissappointed I am with Burts for selling this since I LOVE all their other products.  I will be contacting Amazon regarding this product and will keep you all updated.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial scrub I&#x27;ve ever used and I won&#x27;t use anything else from now on. My skin looks and feels incredible. I wish I started using this years ago.</li>
            <li> One of my &amp;#34;must haves&amp;#34;. Leaves your skin smooth &amp; radiant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a natural product so the texture is a bit dry and it takes a few tries to get it right.  I thoroughly wet my face first, then take a bit of mixture - about a quarter sized amount - and put that in the palm of my hands with just a bit of water, adding more until I get a paste I can use to scrub my face with.  It smells nice, has not nasty stuff in it and is wonderful for my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the only scrub I&#x27;ll use on my face, where my skin is very acne prone. Like others have said, a little goes a long way, just mix with a little water. I also think that there&#x27;s an odd oily feel afterwards, so I use my regular facial bar soap after. My skin still feels great with this combination. I&#x27;ve had the same bottle of scrub for years (I don&#x27;t use it on a very regular basis), and it is just running out now. I&#x27;m definitely planning on buying it again.</li>
            <li> This scrub is absolutely amazing! The first time I used it I saw results on how smooth it made my skin. I do agree that it leaves a bit of a film on your skin, but using the Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s toner after takes it right off and my skin is perfectly exfoliated! I use this morning and night and I no longer have any patches of rough skin on my face. This product will last months with just one jar. Amazing!</li>
            <li> I just received  this in the mail yesterday and jumped in the shower with it (I like to let the steam open up my pores and soften my skin - it makes it easier for my cleanser to grab all the dirt and oil). I used this after my Burt&#x27;s Bees Soap Bark &amp; Camomile cleanser, and my skin was so SOFT and SMOOTH after :) Even better, you only need a pea-sized amount mixed with a couple drops of water in your hand, so the 2 oz. jar will last you for a REALLY long time. It smells wonderful, too (like orange peels and nutmeg spices). I&#x27;ve tried the Burt&#x27;s Bees Acne Solutions Scrub too, and that one has too little beads in it to exfoliate well, it also leaves behind an oily residue I didn&#x27;t like. I love how the grains in this one are very fine and the orange oil very moisturizing without being heavy/clogging pores. OVERALL, a great GENTLE face scrub that delivers all the benefits without the harsh chemicals!    (The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.

            <li> This is a strange product.  You must get a small amount on your finger tips and apply to a wet face to \\&quot;activate\\&quot; it.  It is fairly dried out and thick in the jar but I am told this is normal.  It does however do wonders for your skin.  I use it every couple of days and it never  irritated me.  Excellent exfoliator and smells pleasant.</li>
            <li> This face scrub is fantastic! It definately leaves your skin fresh and dewy. It&#x27;s natural ingredients so that makes it even better for your skin and it wont clog your pores. It&#x27;s also super thick so it sounds and looks like such a small jar but you have to actually dillute it a little with water and it kinda forms a paste that smells deliscious and goes a long way. I was kinda worried about the smell because of some of the other reviews but I really like it. It&#x27;s like pumpkin spice and it&#x27;s not super strong either. This product instantly made my skin softer and gave it an extra youthful dewyness, I love it! I will probably use this stuff for the rest of my life lol! Thumbs up ;^D</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scrub!  It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve tried, and trust me, I&#x27;ve spend hundreds of dollars on facial scrubs.</li>
            <li> I tolerate this as an exfoliating cleanser every once in a while...but I HATE the smell, it&#x27;s VERY spicey smelling...like you reached in your spice rack and threw all the smells together...I guess it just depends on your personal favorite smells...this one I don&#x27;t like.  It is paste like and very gritty, it gets the job done, just wish it smelled different</li>
            <li> Great scrub. What I do is put a little of it in my palm, and put my cleansing lotion on top and mix it in and wash my face. It smells great and makes my face feel so soft.</li>
            <li> Great facial scrub. You have to be careful and not use too much at one time and don&#x27;t use more than 3 times a week.R</li>
            <li> I really loves his scrub. I am so glad I bought it. It makes my skin feel clean and fresh. There is no lather as it contains no sulfates, but it still cleans better than more chemically laden products. Get this. It is a very good use of your money. It is a small jar, but a little goes a long way, and you do not have to use every day.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go a day without this facial scrub! I have tried st. Ives and every seemingly natural brand in between but this stuff is the real deal! I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love it. it&#x27;s gentle enough to use every day but still exfoliates and leaves your skin feeling baby soft. not to mention it smells like pumpkin pie! I don&#x27;t know why though, since it&#x27;s citrus haha, but none the less it smells amazing, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about putting harsh or damaging chemicals on your face like almost very other face wash/cleanser/scrub does. I would give the creator a million high fives!</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff! It doesn&#x27;t have a very citrus smell or any odor that lingers. Just a very small amount is needed and my face feels so clean and fresh! Will order again, although this stuff has lasted quite some time already! Worth the cost!</li>
            <li> This facial scrub is quite refreshing at first. I don&#x27;t really enjoy the way you have to use it though. It is kind of a hassle trying to pick the right amount out of the little jar and adding some water and getting it on to your face in a timely/not so messy manner. The smell is alright, but afterwards there always seems to be a little bit of a residue left on my face, no matter how much I rinse it off again. Maybe it&#x27;s just me but I don&#x27;t find myself &#x27;excited&#x27; to use this product. I love burt&#x27;s bees products normally and I was a bit disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive and acne prone skin, so I am VERY hesitant to try new products. After a recommendation from a youtube make up guru, and success with other Burt&#x27;s Bees products, I decided to take the risk. I love the smell of the scrub, it has a spicy nutty scent (like a holiday candle). I scoop up a bit with my finger and add a few drops of water to make a paste, gently exfoliate my face for about a minute and then rinse with warm water. I use it every other day, usually in the shower. It makes my skin feel very soft and smooth, even when I&#x27;m mid break out. If I have been wearing make up, I use my usual cleanser before the scrub. I&#x27;m not sure how great it would be to remove make up and dirt from the day, but it is great to exfoliate a few times a week. I have some pigment scars from acne, and exfoliation is supposed to reduce the appearance. I have been using other products for the scarring in conjunction, so I can&#x27;t say that this scrub is what has helped my complexion, but it certainly hasn&#x27;t made things worse. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> In my pursuit of using more natural (or green) products in my life, I have changed my wonderful clinique exfoliating scrub (no probs with that product whatsoever, other than it&#x27;s not natural) to this product as my once a week skin refresher.  To give the reader a bit more background, I have what you would call \\&quot;normal\\&quot; type skin, but if it went one way or the other, my skin would tend to be more dry than oily.  I don&#x27;t have any real skin afflictions like acne or breakouts, but I also rarely wear make up.  Thus said, I only use an exfoliator once a week.  I was basically not used to this product.  First, my jar of this citrus facial scrub was so concentrated that it had the consistency of play-doh, so it was hard to get this stuff out of the jar. Also, make sure that you add a little water to the amount you are applying to your face, as it helps applying so much more.  However, when I spread it across my face, it seemed to pill up instead of coat evenly.  And there really isn&#x27;t much \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; to this scrub either (try none at all).  When I rinsed this product off my face, it left an oily residue, so much that I wasn&#x27;t sure if I needed to put on moisturizer after drying.  I can get past the baking cabinet hodge podge of spices smell if this was a good product, but I will definitely be looking for a better natural exfoliator.  This product is just so much different than my clinique or St. Ives apricot scrub, and I did not like it.  I will give it a second star based on the fact that the product&#x27;s packaging is recyclable (jar is glass, lid is steel, and box is paperboard) and I will give it the \\&quot;benefit of the doubt\\&quot; star as it is the first \\&quot;natural\\&quot; exfoliating product that I&#x27;ve tried.  There could possibly be worse out there, but I am dubious of that.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t underestimate this little jar of brown/orange stuff. It really does make your skin glow. I used it when after I clarisonic while I am still in the shower. And your skin feels so smooth and soft after. It&#x27;s amazing! I was using the sugar scrub by Fresh for years but this works just as great and it&#x27;s waaay cheaper! (Fresh is about $40)</li>
            <li> I love the Citrus Facial Scrub.  You can use a little or a lot.  Just mix it with water and mix to your desired consistancy.  The smell is very subtle and blends well with other products.  The scrub also works well on feet and other parts of the body.</li>
            <li> I think this scrub is great. It&#x27;s gentle but seems to exfoliate well. As other reviewers have said you only have to use a small amount, it smells great (something like carrot cake maybe?), and lasts forever. My only complaint is that it leaves your skin feeling slightly oily. At first I was worried about this because I have oily skin and I thought this product might clog my pores or cause a breakout... but I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now &amp; have not had any problems. I think this scrub would work well for people with dry skin too since it is moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best face scrubs overall and the best one offered by Burt&#x27;s Bees.&lt;br /&gt;It does smell like a blend of pumpkin pie spices and citrus but everyone in our family loves it!&lt;br /&gt;I laughed at the reviews that said it was too pasty or hard because although the jar is small it is filled with a more concentrated paste that, when some is scooped out and mixed with a few drops of water becomes a more spreadable product - AND THE DIRECTIONS TELL YOU THAT IF YOU READ THEM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use a small plastic spatula to scoop into the palm of the hand and mix just a few drops in to form a spreadable paste. Then we apply to the face like a mask and walk around for 10-15 minutes smelling the yummy citrus spice bouquet and then either remove with a moist wash cloth or can be done right before a shower and can be scrubed off in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin smooth and soft and ready to soak up whatever fabulous moisturizer you have waiting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only beef is that I prefer products do not come in jars due to a higher cross contamination potential but due to the thick paste it probably makes more sense, but then, probably most people do not have skin care spatulas handy like we did so I bet a lot of people are dipping their germy fingers right into the jar. A small plastic scooper added to the box would be a plus.</li>
            <li> I have used many different facial scrubs, and this product is nothing special. You can get the same results using St. Ives apricot scrub as you can using Berts Bee.</li>
            <li> Great aroma, smells of cloves and other spices, but is not overpowering. (I&#x27;m actually not wild about the smell of cloves, but love this product&#x27;s aroma.) Truly all natural. I look forward to using this each morning. Skin feels smooth and soft after use.</li>
            <li> Pretty waxy. Leaves a film. It isn&#x27;t a feeling you want on your face. I now use it only on my feet.</li>
            <li> This has true grit-as it has large bits of exfoliating warriors. Much too tough for my skin. It feels comparable to St. Ives, which I have been told actually tears the outer layer of your dermis- not good. Now this is all natural, so it may not have that harsh of effect, but I just don&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s perfect for my husband&#x27;s face however. He actually gets a good scrub. I will stick with the Aveeno face scrubs as the grit is substantial, but not harsh. Oh and the smell is definitely strong of cloves, not orange.</li>
            <li> I have fairly dry skin that doesn&#x27;t give me many problems, other than extreme dullness.  I rarely break out but I do struggle with dry skin that lacks radiance.  I decided to try this scrub because I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products and I figured a scrub would liven up my skin.  The first three days or so, I liked it.  It&#x27;s fun to use and smells nice.  But after a while, I noticed that I had a lot of dirt embedded in my pores.  My pores are normally very tiny and I don&#x27;t get blackheads.  However, I began sprouting dark spots all over my face, especially near my nose.  Once I quit using this, my skin cleared up again.  Maybe it&#x27;s not meant for dry skin.  If you do use this, I&#x27;d only scrub with it a few times a week and make sure you use another cleanser that has serious deep-cleaning properties, because this citrus scrub doesn&#x27;t deep clean.  I found a better scrub with that St. Ives stuff, but I guess this is worth a try.  Just don&#x27;t expect it to deep clean.</li>
            <li> I love this facial scrub! I use it every night and it&#x27;s made my skin amazing. It&#x27;s not too harsh to use everyday, for me anyway, and I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough.</li>
            <li> Too thick, all clumpy and hard to smooth onto face.  It wasn&#x27;t like this last time I bought this.</li>
            <li> well it smells so nice and it feels so nice and soft and well i honestly thought this worked for me but after like 10 days my face started to get black heads on my forhead and ckeeks so i stopped using its just breaking me out!!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT! It has become quite addicting. I actually look forward to washing my face with this scrub- looks weird when you first see it but feels so good and smells amazing. I cannot imagine every using anything else as a scrub. Nothing can compare. My face feels so clean, healthy and soft after using it.</li>
            <li> I am not knocking it as a product. The smell was nice and the exfoliation was gently, but it did nothing for my combination skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much I researched stores where I can purchase it when I moved (not many do). It&#x27;s got a great smell, and offers this strange mix of a light scrub yet moisturizing at the same time. Your face just glows afterwards.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To get the right effect, scoop a small amount with your fingers and mix it with a bit of water in your hand. Gently rub in circles around your face then rinse. I especially use it around my nose where my pores are large and prone to blackheads. The oils in the scrub don&#x27;t seem to make it worse and do a great job cleaning the area.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This scrub is simply wonderful. A thick, earthy feeling paste, like something ancient Aztecs could have made scented with ground almonds, pecans, rose petals, oats and orange oil. It smells like Christmas, cinnamon and orange spice that knocks deep down my nose and gently yet thoroughly uncovers soft, smooth skin. This little jar will last a long time but it&#x27;s an addictive pleasure, so I recommend stocking up.    I use this whenever my skin is acting up or it looses its glass like smoothness. No rough housing is needed; gentle is the word  when this is used often, it works wonders and is chemical free.  For those who are used to runnier scrubs in a tube this might be a strange experience at first but one that will get easier with time, it&#x27;s worth it and it smells good enough to eat.     Ingredients: glycerin, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) seed meal, avena sativa (oat) kernel flour, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) peel powder, rosa damascena (rose) flower oil, carya illinoensis (pecan) shell powder, citrus grandis (grapefruit) seed extract, myristica fragrans (nutmeg) fruit powder, eugenia caryophyllus (clove) flower powder, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) peel oil, tocopherol, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) extract, fragrance.    - Kasia S.</li>
            <li> Leaves a waxy residue, definitely won&#x27;t use it on my face again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new facial scrub, and had a few friends recommend this one. Upon opening the jar, I noticed how thick it was. That doesn&#x27;t bother me. Just scoop out a small amount, really, about 1/2-1 tsp is plenty, and mix with some warm water. It will produce a slight lather, and is very gritty, but again, neither of which bothers me. I noticed the smell immediately; like pumpkin pie! :) I thought, this HAS to have nutmeg in it. I checked the ingredients list, and yep, nutmeg powder! I have a bit of a pumpkin pie obsession (bordering on unhealthy, seriously), so I  may be slightly biased due to the smell. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, though. It&#x27;s not an overly sweet smell. If you have nutmeg or pumpkin pie spice in your cabinet, take a whiff, and that&#x27;s what this smells like. There may be some citrus-y undertones, but really all I can pick up for sure is the nutmeg. But enough about the smell, that does not a good product make (though it sure helps!). I gave my face a good scrub, and rinsed with warm water. I did rinse more than usual, since it still felt slick, which I don&#x27;t normally get from other cleansers. This is a vastly different product than I have ever used, though, so I quit rinsing and dried my face, and then it felt fine. Actually, more than fine. It felt so soft and smooth. Most facial scrubs will leave you feeling smooth, but this was the best smooth feeling I have ever had. I didn&#x27;t get that scrubbed-raw feeling, either, like some products will do. So, to sum up what has been a slightly longer review than intended: Smells so good I might be at risk of eating it. Leaves skin silky soft and smooth with no irritation. And a tip, the 2-pack on Amazon is the same price per jar as it is in my local Target. Wouldn&#x27;t buy the single on Amazon since it&#x27;s slightly higher. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Love Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li> seems kind of dry to me.....</li>
            <li> I love how it smells and the way it leaves my face feeling fresh and scrubbed, I am a fan for life!</li>
            <li> This must have been sitting on the shelf for over 2 years.  It arrived looking more like tar than orange cleanser.  Now I have to pay to ship it to Burts Bees at my cost to get a replacement.  I will never order from this company again.</li>
            <li> I use this product to keep my face clean and from getting BIG pores. I gotta say it helps a lot this item is a must try for yourself.</li>
            <li> Gift. Receiver loves the product. Feels it does the job well.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this facial scrub. I&#x27;ve been using it for years - I have not found it&#x27;s match. My skin is like a wee babe&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this facial scrub. It&#x27;s gentle, natural and leaves your skin smooth and soft. I&#x27;m not too crazy about the smell though.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and works great on my blackheads!! A little bit mixed with water, goes a long way! I looooooove the smell!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin with mild acne. I bought this hoping this would be the product that would clear my acne but it didnt. I do LOVE this product though. If you do not have acne and you are looking for a scrub this would be great for you. The smell was really bad at first but then I began to love it. It is difficult to apply at first because it comes out in pieces. When I used it I took some out with my finger and put it in the palm of my hand and then I put pieces on my face and started rubbing it in. This is gentle enough to use daily. It did make the parts of my face that don&#x27;t have acne smooth. If I didn&#x27;t have acne I would use this daily :-) Hope this helps. p.s I started using the Dermalogica Clean Start Kit for my acne and my face is starting to clear up!</li>
            <li> I read about this product in an online article about the best and worst of skin care.  I ordered the 2oz. because I wasn&#x27;t sure how it&#x27;d work and I couldn&#x27;t find it locally.  The verdict:  IT&#x27;S PRETTY GOOD!  My face is oily and I have rosacea, and it did a great job.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Helps exfoliate and gentle enough to use daily.</li>
            <li> I would like to thank Kandee Johnson for this purchase because she inspired me to buy it :) Took very long for this product to get here but once it did it was packaged well. I used it for the first time last night and I think it will take me awhile to get used to it.  You are supposed to put a little bit in your hand and then add 2 drops of water.  I did that and it just seems like you need to do something else; it&#x27;s kinda hard to apply to your face.  I&#x27;m pretty positive that this scrub will work wonderfully though :)</li>
            <li> Skin type: Combination , Sensitive&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for: Combination , Dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you see is what you get when it comes to the size of this facial scrub. The pot is a small thing that can fit in the palm of your hand with your fingers closed around it. Its not a cause for concern though, because with the amount of product you&#x27;ll be using each time, its bound to last you for a couple months at least, especially if you don&#x27;t plan on using it daily. In terms of usage, I find it a bit of a hassle as I&#x27;m one of those who washes my face in the shower and not over the sink. Your hands have to be dry before dipping them into the pot or it&#x27;ll muck up the rest of the content. Also the pot is made of glass, so with all the fumbling around just be careful not to drop the pot. As for the scrub itself, it does not have a citrus smell but more of a pumpkin smell. In a good way. However, in terms of visual... the product (when added with water) looks a bit like wet sand .. or something else, if you know what I mean. It makes me a little uncomfortable, haha. The scrub isn&#x27;t abrassive and I mean this in a good and bad way as while it is gentle to the skin, I feel like it may not be exfoliating enough. Also, once you wash it off, it leaves this filmy moisture which I&#x27;m not too crazy about at first. But once I&#x27;ve toweled my face dry, my face is super soft and moisturized and has this glowy look.</li>
            <li> Fantastic scrub. Your face will feel much tighter after using it.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the smell which smells EXACTLY like black licorice. However, another miracle recommendation from Kandee Johnson! I use it every night with warm water and my skin is super smooth and it&#x27;s light enough to use every day unlike most exfoliants. I love it, I know you will, too.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t like this product as much as I thought I would as I am typically a huge fan of the Burt&#x27;s Bees family.  I didn&#x27;t love the smell and was hoping for a more refreshing, citrusy smell, but it wasn&#x27;t.  It did a nice job of exfoliating, but I don&#x27;t know if I &#x27;d order it again.  I&#x27;d probably give it a 3.5 if that was a choice.</li>
            <li> SO disappointed and annoyed! I had to log on to review this terrible product right away! First off, the texture of this scrub is too thick. Even after adding water, chunks of the product kept falling off my skin! It was HARD to get the scrubbing part going. I had to pick up chunks that fell into my sink because I didn&#x27;t want to waste the product. It does not scrub well. Like in another review mentioned it feeling like Playdoh. Immediately after rinsing, I started feeling ITCHY around my neck then my whole face broke out in a rash! This scrub actually left a thick layer of the product on my skin and felt like &#x27;Vaseline&#x27;. It did not exfoliate my skin. I couldn&#x27;t actually FEEL my skin. I then used their Acne Clarifying Toner and it became too much. The toner glided around my skin without effectively cleaning it. It also left a filmy layer on top. I then used Alba Botanica Acnedote Face &amp; Body Scrub and it helped calm down the rash and exfoliated my skin. I will return the scrub &amp; toner!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really great scrub that can be used daily.  It doesn&#x27;t make me break out which is a big deal cause everything makes me break out. It leaves my skin nice and smooth and I love the way it smells too.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite things since 2002.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product works well. I love the facial scrub affect on my face. I have purchased through the years more expensive facial cleansers and this works great for me and I do not get break outs.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft and doesn&#x27;t give that damaged feeling some scrubs can do sometimes.</li>
            <li> once or twice a week on face and neck.  Doesn&#x27;t dry and refreshes and scrubs off the dead skin cells.  Very refreshing.</li>
            <li> I without a doubt love this product. Since buying this on Amazon a couple of months ago my skin feels great. I love it and this sounds silly but it doesn&#x27;t taste bad either. lol!! I will deffinetly be buying this again!</li>
            <li> absolutely LOVE this stuff!! i use it every morning &amp; doesnt over exfoliate! it makes my face soooo soft &amp; smooth!!! :) i have very sensitive skin &amp; have never found a scrub that i can use more then like twice a week! ...also smells amazing! :D an overall great product!! &lt;3</li>
            <li> This made my face feel smooth and extra clean. It&#x27;s gentle enough to use every day and smell yummy :)</li>
            <li> Ive used this product before.  It&#x27;s a good face scrub but it is very crumbly.  I always have to add water to it.  It almost has a homemade consistency to it.  Also the metal cover on the jar tends to rust after we while.  I leave it in the shower so I&#x27;m sure that doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t help my skin-would rather eat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this stuff- my face feels amazing afterwards. I use it add the end of the day to really get my makeup off... it does the trick!</li>
            <li> I understood that it was a paste in a jar when I bought the product.  I have used products like this before, but this scrub is much drier, denser, and more difficult to get out of the jar than other similar face scrubs.  I don&#x27;t particularly care for the scent (it does NOT smell like cinnamon, orange peel or pumpkin pie like I was expecting). It leaves a waxy residue on my face. &amp;#34;Gentle&amp;#34; scrub is right, I wouldn&#x27;t really consider it an exfoliant.  It was a good price, but I&#x27;m underwhelmed and won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> My daughter LOVES this product and it&#x27;s hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I like weird stuff and that&#x27;s why I wanted to try this. I love it, leaves my face feeling incredibly smooth. Smells yummy, kind of spicy.</li>
            <li> This is just what I have been looking for--works great and skin is definitely smoother. I can&#x27;t believe the people who gave this a poor rating--they certainly did not read the instructions--simply place a small amt in palm of hand add a few drops of water and mix--apply--so simple.&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff. I&#x27;d say give it a try again it is easy to use.</li>
