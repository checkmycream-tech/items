            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend, ever since she started wearing it in highschool. I have been in love with her &amp; the scent since  we met so i had to pick it up. Great smell i recommend it for anyone who wants their girl to smell great.</li>
            <li> Loved it...it&#x27;s actually almost gone and time for me to purchase it again.  I get compliments on it all the time. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> If you like a perfume that smells like you just got out the shower, it is perfect not over powering</li>
            <li> This is my personal fragrance. I love this perfume, its so light and refreshing and its lasts long on you. I always get complements on this fragrance. I will always buy atleast two bottles and keep it so i will never run out of it. You will definitely enjoy this scent.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PERFUME! .. it is not tooo strong like other perfumes, and you can use it for any occasion and smell \\&quot;beautiful\\&quot;..</li>
            <li> I been looking for this perfume for 8 years and I&#x27;m very happy to find it on Amozon. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Everytime I wear this perfume, someone tells me I smell great.  It&#x27;s not overbearing...soft and feminine...great!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  It arrived as promised.  She loves the scent.</li>
            <li> Portfolio has been my mothers favorite for a long time. She says the perfume is the only one she can wear that wont give her a headache. I am glad Amazon has it.</li>
            <li> its okay- this is my first time ever smelling it so should of got a sample first&lt;br /&gt;im all about smelling like you just got out of the shower and fruity too&lt;br /&gt;but this in no way has a crisp clean scent like you got out the shower&lt;br /&gt;its very strong and kinda gave me a headache&lt;br /&gt;if you like strong heavy perfume then youll like this&lt;br /&gt;its  not a floral smell nor a fruity smell, its hard to explain</li>
            <li> Excellent recommend 100 % Original</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite all through the year scent. Even though it proably is more of a winter/fall scent. I just use less during the summer. But i absolutely love this smell. Its not always the easiest to find in stores. Came package nicely and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> This is the favorite of my mother-in-law but is not carried in any stores. Not even those random shops that have numerous types of perfumes.</li>
            <li> Stars are base on the price and appearance of the product.&lt;br /&gt;My sistes likes it but doesnt love it&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I recommend this perfum to all girls...</li>
            <li> WOW...I always use it.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST PARFUM EVER LOVE IT VERY UNIQUE!! GOT AS A GIFT OVER 15 YEARS AGO AND STILL USE IT!!</li>
            <li> I bought this on blind faith. Had a gift card for Amazon and my usual scent was unavailable. Upon reading the reviews of Portfolio, I decided to try it out. I was not disappointed. It has become my default fragrance and I am hard pressed to decide between it and my old favorite now that it is running low! I got more compliments on the other, but the Portfolio has a very soft, sort of creamy fragrance that just makes me feel good when I put it on. I love it!</li>
            <li> I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon and I have never had a problem returning anything so here&#x27;s my advice to you; buy it and try it, if it doesn&#x27;t work; return it for a refund, even if it is open and has been used. No other web site allows you to do this!</li>
            <li> Toooooooo  strong perfume for me.i love my pefumes but this one is over doing it to much smell too loud and just.doing to much for.me</li>
            <li> Great, exactly as described!</li>
            <li> This is my signature scent.  I&#x27;m in my late 20s but I have been wearing it for years.  The scent is pleasant and very long lasting.  I get compliments all the time from men and women of all ages and backgrounds.  A little goes a long way since it&#x27;s the parfum, so a bottle should last you a long time.  I use 2-3 sprays and people still smell it on me 12 hours later.</li>
            <li> Product didn&#x27;t smell at all like the one I previously had that ran out.  The bottle shows a different manufacturer, so that is likely why it doesn&#x27;t smell the same.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> i had a classmate in highschool that wore this and remember how lovely she smelled in passing. now 7 years later i give it a shot. its very very powerful at first. a little goes a long long way with this fragrance. the dry down is magnificent! i adore it! thank you perry.</li>
            <li> It is not an overbearing scent. A lot of perfumes will give me a headache, but this one does not.  I have been wearing it for years...the scent is just so awesome..it is MY scent! (Old review)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(New Review). I am editing my original review to say they are no longer selling the original Portfolio.  It has been discontinued.  This is a fake.  I ordered 2 bottles and the packaging and scent are different. The bottle should not be hot pink!!</li>
            <li> It got on time, on perfect conditions, it was just what i expected! i love the fragance! the experience was great!!</li>
            <li> You ask why, this is a very seductive scent I could never do without it, I bought it for my sister, been years she been begging me for it... It was perfectly secured and was delivered on time....</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes and the price for this was one of the best I have ever gotten. I always get wonderful comments on my perfume and am frequently asked the name of the perfume I am wearing.  It has a soft yet sexy fragrance and has become my signature perfume.  I am very happy to have a place to get my perfume at a good price and fast delivery.  I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, i bought 3 as gift  for my mom n&#x27; aunts they love it too. Now it&#x27;s my mom&#x27;s favorite and where she goes she wears it, if you wanna smell good JUST IT.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume by far and can&#x27;t beat the price. Purchased one for myself and as a gift for my mother-in-law who also loves the scent.</li>
            <li> iit smell good just like the old days love it thanks. I get a lot of compliments on this fragrance.</li>
            <li> BOUGHT THIS FOR MY WIFE AND I LOVE THE WAY SHE SMELLS WHEN SHE USES IT. GOING TO BUY A FEW MORE</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for many years, and I&#x27;m sad that it is getting hard to find!</li>
