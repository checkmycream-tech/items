            <li> Great Product. full Coverage of Gray</li>
            <li> Perfect solution for in-between hair coloring!</li>
            <li> The spray works well and easy.  It completely covers up the root and last till your next hair wash.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product - so nice to have as a touch up between color treatments.  Also gives great body and texture to fine hair.  The spray tip is great too - no more messes - you point and spray directly where you need it.</li>
            <li> Love this product this is my fourth purchase better than bumblebee or any other product I&#x27;ve ever used can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> Easy to spray. covers my gray. washes out easily.Minus a star because it can stain towels and pillowcases.</li>
            <li> I really like this spray.  I only gave it 4 stars because this color is very black and not brown at all.  If you have dark brown hair maybe get the one that is one shade less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hides the grays well and looks pretty good between color visits.  It makes me feel better about going out when my hair is showing those roots.  Be careful not to spray too much or it has a slightly crunchy/helmet head look.  The sprayer takes a little practice, but overall I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Great gray hair coverage. Blend well. no smell to it</li>
            <li> Happy with color and results.</li>
            <li> This stuff works! I definitely get more time in between hair appointments. I am naturally dark blonde and when my roots start to come in it looks like I&#x27;m going bald! My only wish is that they would come out with a true black, not just a black/brown so it wouldn&#x27;t look like I have roots at all. But this definitely helps my roots not be nearly as noticeable.</li>
            <li> This product is great for in between hair appts. As others have said its brown though, not black.</li>
            <li> Hate having to get my hair colored but the root grow out always necessitated heading back into the salon.  This spray is so easy to use and a couple quick sprays to my roots and I&#x27;m good to go.  Can&#x27;t tell at all that it is spray on color and lasts until you shampoo it out.  Not permanent so no harm to your hair.</li>
            <li> Covered gray nicely without changing the hair texture like other products</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Does a great job hiding grays in my part. I have very dark brown hair which looks black. Easy to rub it off skin if you do it immediately. I use the black/dark brown color. It extends my color appt for a week or more.</li>
