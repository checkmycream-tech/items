            <li>MATERIAL TO CHEAP</li>
            <li>Just A Light Odds And</li>
            <li>It is a cheap bag and the straps started coming off within a week of having it.</li>
            <li>I thought it was cute, but as soon as I used it, the straps broke and the patch thingys came right off.</li>
            <li>This product was smaller than I thought it would be, but it did look very nice.</li>

            <li>The handle and straps ripped the first time I used it!</li>
            <li>its pretty!</li>
            <li>Then I got the backpack and on the first day of school the strap started ripping!</li>
            <li>but It broke the first time I used it!</li>
            <li>Its very plastic like and cheap.</li>
            <li>you get your moneys worth</li>
            <li>It is flimsy but for the price quote a fun bargain.</li>
            <li>Very attractive but extremely poor quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cute bag for sleep overs or light use, but not daily school use.</li>
            <li>so it took about 3 weeks to get it, but is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>One of the zipper pieces also broke almost immediately on the top, but luckily there are two zippers, so it is still barely functioning.</li>

            <li>I ordered this backpack for the first week of my sophomore year of college.</li>
            <li>The First Day The Zipper Pull Came Off</li>
            <li>However, on the first use the straps broke.</li>
            <li>broke within the first week.</li>
            <li>, I Didnt Even Get To Use It , The Straps Broke In The First Use .</li>
            <li>Broke strap and zippers within the first week.</li>
            <li>Such a cute little backpack, I love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, it is very cute, so if you&#x27;re not going to use it to carry anything heavy, I&#x27;m sure it would last much longer.</li>
            <li>She used it for about two weeks after it finally arrived from China, and the shoulder straps started to tear away from the main body of the bag at the top.</li>
            <li>This bag was super cute but broke in less than 2 weeks.</li>

            <li>Decent quality and pretty much for the pictures.  </li>
            <li>Extremely cheaply made; it didn&#x27;t even last a whole semester before I had to replace it.</li>
            <li>Very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this bag be purchased if a person actually wants to use it as a backpack.</li>
            <li>The zipper broke before I could even really use it.</li>
            <li>The straps are not held together very well.</li>
            <li>I was really disapointed</li>

            <li>After having the backpack for a week the strap on the left at the top came detached from the back pack.</li>

            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much because it is cheap, but definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t handle what a normal bag can.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not even worth ordering it started to rip and tear the next day.</li>
            <li>Price and Service It  was right , only on day use it  </li>

            <li> Very cute but has a very strong unpleasant odor</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute, but the straps broke in less than a year...</li>
            <li> After having the backpack for a week the strap on the left at the top came detached from the back pack.</li>
            <li> decent quality for price</li>
            <li> And by the end of the day the strap COMPLETELY ripped off and the zipper wouldn&#x27;t work!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much because it is cheap, but definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t handle what a normal bag can.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not even worth ordering it started to rip and tear the next day.</li>
            <li> Price and Service It  was right , only on day use it  </li>
            <li> the  material is plastic and it looks just plain cheap!</li>
            <li> The backpack is cute too bad they didn&#x27;t have better quality control and shipping!  </li>
            <li> ungly cheap not was I expected!  </li>
            <li> My daughter liked the look of the bag, but after one day with only a few books inside, the bag straps broke off one at a time.</li>
            <li> the sewing was really off,one of the straps tor off with only a 1 in.</li>
            <li> We fixed them but they just kept breaking and tearing at the stitching.  </li>
            <li> I really want my money back!!!</li>
            <li> I had no trouble with the product and it fits all of my school supplies</li>
            <li> this completely fell apart it sucked</li>

            <li> One of the straps completely broke off and the other one is half way ripped at the top.</li>
            <li> Too bad cuz its beautiful.</li>
            <li> If anything it could be used for small, light items that would not break the backpack materials.</li>
            <li> It is cute but not good for carrying things</li>
            <li> It is cute but not good quality at all.</li>
            <li> Very cute backpack, a little on the small side.</li>
            <li> This backpack is much smaller than expected and the straps broke the first week I had it.</li>
            <li> This bookbag is cute fabric, though thin.  </li>
            <li> The black color is a little more faded than I was expecting</li>
            <li> It did arrived several weeks earlier than expected and in time for the opening day of school.</li>
            <li> Took just as long to arrive as they said it would, the zipper sticks, yet my daughter loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very poor quality and cheaply made.</li>
            <li> The faux leather is actually thin, unbacked plastic,(and very orange in color) and the straps broke along the seam, the plastic actually breaking by the stitching.</li>
            <li> The bag obviously was not made for heavy books like students must carry on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> , friend got the same one a few weeks back and her strap came off and had holes</li>
            <li> It broke within the first two weeks of use, the &amp;#34;brown&amp;#34; was too orange, no space inside for things, just a really poorly made item.</li>
            <li> Another ten dollars down the drain.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that it ships from China</li>
            <li> The only down fall is that it is not that roomy.</li>
            <li> in less than three months I noticed the straps were starting to rip, so I tried sewing the straps bak on and reenforcing them.</li>
            <li> I had it for less than a week and the zipper broke and into the second week the straps broke off!!</li>
            <li> With one Binder, and a 35-75mm lens the straps broke off also the zippers got jammed</li>
            <li> Backpack only lasted a few months.  </li>
            <li> It took forever to receive, The zipper was broken and it had a whole in it.  </li>
            <li> if you get it you must be careful with it !</li>
            <li> but I have had no problems with rips or tears like other reviews</li>
            <li> Omg this bag  is not worth it.</li>
            <li> I hate this even though the flora print is cute but this backpack is not worth it.</li>
            <li> Broke after less than a month and took 6 weeks to receive.  </li>
            <li> Stamp and zipper broke after about a year and a half.</li>
            <li> The strap is tearing already and she has had it for about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> The faux leather is a little cheesy, but decent for the price.  </li>

            <li> I sent it to my roommate, she just use it for several days, and then it was broken!</li>
            <li> Idk if that&#x27;s due to poor quality of material or because I carry my thick heavy books in it to school.</li>
            <li> and so i took it to school with me monday (today) and it already has two holes on the side and a strap is half broken off</li>
            <li> I was a little confused as how to &amp;#34;attach&amp;#34;</li>

            <li> The straps are poorly made they ripped off at school</li>
            <li> The sides are wearing thin already.  </li>

            <li> Love it, Has lots of room, its comfortable and cute.</li>
            <li> While this backpack is cute and it arrived in a timely fashion (no pun intended)  the quality is horrible.  Do not buy this.  Within two weeks the strap on the back came off.  Its very plastic like and cheap. Another ten dollars down the drain.</li>
            <li> Horrible. Straps broke off first week I had it. Very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful backpack I really like it</li>
            <li> The back strap was ripped when I received it and there are a ton of hanging strings. Not a happy customer</li>
            <li> With one Binder, and a 35-75mm lens the straps broke off also the zippers got jammed you get your moneys worth</li>
            <li> Do not expect to be able to carry much in it. I had my school books in it and put it on and it ripped. Too bad cuz its beautiful.</li>
            <li> It took the bag 2 months to get to my home and then broke on the first day. It was really bad quality</li>
            <li> Omg this bag  is not worth it.In 3 days it ripped, if your planing  to use it for school Don&#x27;t buy it !</li>
            <li> The handle and straps ripped the first time I used it! It was very cheaply made, but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I thought it was really cute and adorable. So I brought it to school and used it. Everybody loved it. But then the zipper broke within two weeks and the straps were soon to follow.</li>
            <li> My Kids very Love This Bag&lt;br /&gt;Color is Beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Belt is Not Bad&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know this Bag is Waterproof</li>
            <li> it was good for a couple days but then on like the fourth day i added my history book and handle ripped off immediately and same with the straps. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to someone that carries something that weighs more than 1 pound</li>
            <li> It broke the first day I got it and is still continuing to break.</li>
            <li> the sewing was really off,one of the straps tor off with only a 1 in. binder in it with some paper.The bag is really cute but needs better sewing</li>
            <li> Its already ripping and I have only had it for about two weeks. It took forever to get to me.</li>
            <li> This backpack was ordered for my daughter to use in school. She used it for about two weeks after it finally arrived from China, and the shoulder straps started to tear away from the main body of the bag at the top. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this bag be purchased if a person actually wants to use it as a backpack.</li>
            <li> The back pack came earlier than i thought but its good to know that it is in good condition. Looks the same as the picture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and it breaks easily -.- the second day u went to school by the time I can home it was broken</li>
            <li> It is flimsy but for the price quote a fun bargain. Treat it gently!</li>
            <li> fell apart one week after my daughter began taking it to school straps or flimsy material and pull right out of the backpack</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super cute, but the zipper on the small pocket broke within the first week and on of the straps is about to break.  Idk if that&#x27;s due to poor quality of material or because I carry my thick heavy books in it to school.</li>
            <li> This backpack is much smaller than expected and the straps broke the first week I had it. I would not recommend using this for school or anything that involves heavy items. If anything it could be used for small, light items that would not break the backpack materials. Overall, I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> Very cute, but cheap quality. The zipper broke before I could even really use it. I didn&#x27;t expect much because it is cheap, but definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> The strap broke in one week! The bottom has wore marks on the material. Not made with quality fabric. Disappointed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute, but the straps broke in less than a year... in less than three months I noticed the straps were starting to rip, so I tried sewing the straps bak on and reenforcing them. It helped temporarily, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this backpack.</li>
            <li> its pretty! but i has already ripped the straps if you get it you must be careful with it ! but over all i loved it</li>
            <li> Had it for a day and the straps broke.</li>
            <li> This bookbag is cute fabric, though thin.  the straps broke the very first day of use.  I was able to sew new straps to use it.  The faux leather is actually thin, unbacked plastic,(and very orange in color) and the straps broke along the seam, the plastic actually breaking by the stitching.</li>
            <li> The straps are not held together very well. After having the backpack for a week the strap on the left at the top came detached from the back pack. The backpack itself is good but the way the straps are attached is not well at all. I resewed the straps back myself.</li>
            <li> Such a cute little backpack, I love it! I was a little confused as how to &amp;#34;attach&amp;#34; the straps when I got it, I assumed they would be attached at the bottom but I quickly figured it out! The black color is a little more faded than I was expecting but I have had no problems with rips or tears like other reviews have said! It arrived quickly and I love it!</li>
            <li> The handle started coming off after wearing It twice. . Not too good quality.. improve the quality of the sewing.</li>
            <li> I had it for less than a week and the zipper broke and into the second week the straps broke off!! On top of that it took a month to get in the mail!</li>
            <li> When I saw this backpack I was so excited because it looks so cute! Then I got the backpack and on the first day of school the strap started ripping! And by the end of the day the strap COMPLETELY ripped off and the zipper wouldn&#x27;t work!! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this backpack... I wish I hadn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This straps on this book bag broke the first week of school. Very attractive but extremely poor quality. Just wished I had realized not only was this made in China, it was shipped from China after my purchase.  It did arrived several weeks earlier than expected and in time for the opening day of school. Next time I&#x27;ll look for Made in USA.</li>
            <li> My daughter liked the look of the bag, but after one day with only a few books inside, the bag straps broke off one at a time.</li>
            <li> horrible quality. ripped 2nd day of use</li>
            <li> Within an hour of using the back pack, the straps tore from the backpack and the inside tore. It is very poor quality and cheaply made. I reported the item to Amazon and requested a full refund from the buyer. I have not gotten a response back yet.</li>
            <li> I ordered this backpack for the first week of my sophomore year of college. It barely fit my 15\\&quot; laptop, and it started tearing almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfectly fine as a purse, only to carry light, spiral bound notebooks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, DO NOT get it if you are thinking of carrying textbooks or a laptop. It hasn&#x27;t even lasted three weeks, and the straps are tearing away from the top, they plastic pulley pieces on the lower part of the shoulder straps broke within three days. One of the zipper pieces also broke almost immediately on the top, but luckily there are two zippers, so it is still barely functioning. Not good quality, I should have expected it for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it is very cute, so if you&#x27;re not going to use it to carry anything heavy, I&#x27;m sure it would last much longer.</li>
            <li> Material to cheap. Price and Service It  was right , only on day use it  I had to buy another one. MATERIAL TO CHEAP</li>
            <li> This backpack arrived promptly, and it appeared to look as we expected, but unfortunately the quality of the workmanship was not good. Therefore we returned the backpack.</li>
            <li> It Was Such A Disappointment. The First Day The Zipper Pull Came Off And In Two Weeks a Strap Broke. Paperbacks, Folders, RainbowLoom Kit And A Lunch Bag... It Couldn&#x27;t Hold The Weight.  Such A Shame... It Was Sooo Cute.  It May Work As  Just A Light Odds And Ends Bag, But Not A Bookbag. :-(</li>
            <li> This bag was super cute but broke in less than 2 weeks. One of the straps completely broke off and the other one is half way ripped at the top. The zippers always got stuck to the bag and I had one of them fall off. The bag itself is well made and looks great but the straps and zippers are cheap and break too easy.</li>
            <li> This backpack is so cute! I got it for my best friend for christmas. She loved it! But the strap broke after a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> It broke within the first two weeks of use, the &amp;#34;brown&amp;#34; was too orange, no space inside for things, just a really poorly made item.</li>
            <li> Straps broke a month into using it !! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this piece of crap. dns d d</li>
            <li> Wonderful bookbag, its cute but I&#x27;ve only used it for four days and one of the straps is already ripping off :/</li>
            <li> The straps are poorly made they ripped off at school so I had to carry it home. It is cute but not good for carrying things</li>
            <li> Cute bag, and the leather bottom makes it nice and sturdy. Hopefully it&#x27;ll stand up to whatever middle school can throw it&#x27;s way!  It&#x27;s not ONE MONTH into school and I&#x27;ve had to re-sew both straps on both ends!  The sides are wearing thin already.  My daughter doesn&#x27;t overload her bag, but it&#x27;s not holding up to middle school needs.  It&#x27;s a cute bag for sleep overs or light use, but not daily school use.</li>
            <li> This is cheep and brakes within 3 days of using it. As soon as you open it from the mail you can tell it will fall apart. DO NOT GET IT !</li>
            <li> This backpack broke within one week of my daughter taking it for school.  I would not recommend it! I wish I could get a refund.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cute bag for my little cousin (13yrs old) , and she absolutely loved it. The price was great is super affordable, quality is good as well.  The only down side is that it ships from China so it took about 3 weeks to get it, but is definitely worth it. I would recommend this product  specially for young girls:)that want to look stylish.</li>
            <li> I thought it was cute, but as soon as I used it, the straps broke and the patch thingys came right off. It can&#x27;t handle what a normal bag can. I was really disapointed cause I love the look of it.</li>
            <li> It is cute but not good quality at all. Waste of money too. Even though it was only $15 i shhhhould have just spent $15 more on a quality book bag. All of the zippers have came off. The thread comes out and gets stuck in my hair. Terrible quality for school. Adorable for sitting around never being used.</li>
            <li> I love this book bag but there were a lot of strings!</li>
            <li> This product was smaller than I thought it would be, but it did look very nice. However, on the first use the straps broke. This backpack lasted me three uses.</li>
            <li> Very cute backpack, a little on the small side. Extremely cheaply made; it didn&#x27;t even last a whole semester before I had to replace it. The straps began to detach from the top of the backpack. I would have loved if it lasted more than a few weeks.</li>
            <li> THIS BACKPACK IS HORRIBLE I THINK IT IS A JOKE I HATE THIS BACKPACK SO MUCH SO SMALL!  IT&#x27;S LIKE A LITTLE KIDS BACKPACK DO NOT!! I MEAN DO NOT BUY THIS BACKPACK WHATSOEVER!!</li>
            <li> the straps began to tear a bit already, and the zipper doesn&#x27;t work all the time... but a very cute backpack for a good price</li>
            <li> Decent quality and pretty much for the pictures.  The faux leather is a little cheesy, but decent for the price.  Took forever to arrive.</li>
            <li> Backpack only lasted a few months.  The straps broke a couple of times.  We fixed them but they just kept breaking and tearing at the stitching.  The bag obviously was not made for heavy books like students must carry on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Was very poorly made. broke within the first week. The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because They refunded my money and I got very good customer care!</li>
            <li> i read the reviews after i bought the backpack and i was kind of scared. but in all honesty i love it! it hasn&#x27;t given me any problems and I&#x27;ve had it for two weeks going on three! its super light and super cute! i love my bag thank you!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not even worth ordering it started to rip and tear the next day. I hate this even though the flora print is cute but this backpack is not worth it.</li>
            <li> The bag is cute and the right size but It broke the first time I used it! I really want my money back!!!</li>
            <li> I had no trouble with the product and it fits all of my school supplies it is amazing just like the title says.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fill it with heavy stuff if you don&#x27;t want it to break ???? Duh.</li>
            <li> Is very delicates the product</li>
            <li> Took just as long to arrive as they said it would, the zipper sticks, yet my daughter loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Neva Squires Rodriguez- Author of The Liliana Series&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read &amp;#34;Liliana&amp;#34; a Contemporary Suspense-Filled Romance that will send you on an emotional overload!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming Soon:&lt;br /&gt;Two phenomonel Christmas Stories with Co Author Tamara Philip (author of The Trouble With Playing Cupid), Title yet to be relased.

            <li> I love the bag design but the quality is terrible, I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend. I just got the bag sunday and so i took it to school with me monday (today) and it already has two holes on the side and a strap is half broken off, friend got the same one a few weeks back and her strap came off and had holes.. love the bag design but terrible quality. Not worth ordering great price and style but if it doesnt last there&#x27;s no point.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend so I guess I&#x27;m not best person to review it but for the price I think it was a great gift. She absolutely loves it, so far so good.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone. It is a cheap bag and the straps started coming off within a week of having it.</li>
            <li> Love this bookbag, it is so beautiful.  It is even prettier in person. The only down fall is that it is not that roomy. It is not an ideal bag if it is for a high school student that like to carry their text books in their bags. If they don&#x27;t mind holding their books in hand, then their ok. Love the bag. Fyi, my daughter don&#x27;t mind holding her books, b/c she love her bag.....too cute.</li>
