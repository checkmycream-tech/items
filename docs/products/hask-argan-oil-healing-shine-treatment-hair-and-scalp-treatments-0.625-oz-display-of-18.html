            <li> I have naturally curly hair that is dry and prone to breakage, and this product is helping me to grow my hair longer.  </li>
            <li> I have fine but thick hair and only apply to the bottom half of my mop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like it better than Moroccan Oil which I was stupid enough to drop way too much money on.  </li>
            <li> Usually there is so much build up</li>
            <li> Terrific product!!Great for detangling after washing long hair.</li>
            <li> Cheap alternatives for those expensive Moroccan oil</li>
            <li> I am in my 60&#x27;s now and have long hair which dries out on ends.  </li>
            <li> I do hair extensions, tinseling and other services and like to have different products for the people to eyeball while I am with a client..or for clients to purchase along with their services.  </li>

            <li> My hair is a little on the dry side, but this product has giving me long-lasting shine with a nourish scalp.  </li>

            <li> The shine wears off in a few days so there might be a build up if you keep applying it.    </li>
            <li> I have thick wavy/curly hair that is hard to tame and even harder to find products for.</li>
            <li> Usually I end up</li>
            <li> Plus now I can throw one in my bag if I&#x27;m going away and not worry about leaving it behind etc.</li>
            <li> I found two of them broken</li>
            <li> I got this stuff in a subscription box and usually HATE hair oils and treatments.</li>
            <li> Awful.  </li>

            <li> I got this stuff in a subscription box and usually HATE hair oils and treatments. I have thick wavy/curly hair that is hard to tame and even harder to find products for. Usually there is so much build up and my hair feels and looks so greasy after. Usually I end up just rewashinf my hair to get the stuff out and start over. Not with this. It leaves my hair light and soft. I bought the whole case since it only comes in these tiny vials!! I wish it came in a large bottle, but the price is great so I don&#x27;t really mind. Plus now I can throw one in my bag if I&#x27;m going away and not worry about leaving it behind etc. great product.</li>
            <li> I have been able to buy this products at CVS for over a year, but they stopped selling it.  I am glad I found it at Amazon. I am in my 60&#x27;s now and have long hair which dries out on ends.  I bought this product on a whim and put a dime size in my hair on the ends.  In 2 minutes the ends of my hair was soft and shinning.   i have use other products but this works the best.  I love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I found two of them broken</li>
            <li> This product gives the most shine, minimize the frizzes , and little of the oil Enough for all the hair</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what this stuff smells like!  What a delightful fragrance.  Bought at local beauty supply for $1.99, and you know what?  I like it better than Moroccan Oil which I was stupid enough to drop way too much money on.  This product works remarkably well.  Use sparingly (dime size amount) to avoid any heaviness or the greasies.  I have fine but thick hair and only apply to the bottom half of my mop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the packaging.  Awful.  Just pour this stuff into an old serum dispenser or small spritz bottle, and you&#x27;ll be good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For two dollars this stuff in one fab deal.</li>
            <li> The shine wears off in a few days so there might be a build up if you keep applying it.    A light oil with a pleasant, light citrus smell.</li>
            <li> It is a great product. I have had frizzy hair all mt life but Hask Argan Oil smooths away the frizz and gives it a wonderful finish.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It makes my hair really soft and shiny. I would definitely buy it again. Thanks!</li>
            <li> The product was shipped quickly and arrived well packaged. Using the product has definately improved the texture of my hair by adding softness and shine. I have begun to recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and curly and this argan oil leaves my hair smooth and shining.  will totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  It moisturizes, detangles, shines and makes your hair smell great--all in seconds.  I gave some to my mom and best friend as gifts and they constantly beg me for more (they can&#x27;t find it where they live).  Even my mom&#x27;s BOYFRIEND loves it!  I have naturally curly hair that is dry and prone to breakage, and this product is helping me to grow my hair longer.  I pray that they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> Terrific product!!Great for detangling after washing long hair. Smells great and makes hair shine and strenghtens cuticle!!</li>
            <li> Love it so much I bought the whole case :)&lt;br /&gt;All of the good reviews are true. Get the shampoo and conditioner too. You&#x27;ll never be able to stop touching your hair!</li>
            <li> i have personally used this oil, but purchased this display case for events that I am a vendor at.  I do hair extensions, tinseling and other services and like to have different products for the people to eyeball while I am with a client..or for clients to purchase along with their services.  This oil is great for adding softeness and manageability.</li>
            <li> Fabulous stuff.  It smells GREAT and really makes your hair feel great.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my hair and it&#x27;s the best thing to tame frizz without getting hair greasy!  Always great~</li>
