            <li>This lotion is well worth it!</li>
            <li>Looked original.</li>
            <li>but i would say it a lotion more for beginners who dont have much color</li>
            <li>gives you a nice brown color with natural bronzers in it.</li>
            <li>Received the item quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had pretty fair skin but can tan relatively well.</li>
            <li>today, I&#x27;m very fair skinned (blonde hair, blue eyes)</li>
            <li>This lotion smells Amazing before tanning, and smells the same after tanning.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this tanning lotion to anyone who is looking for a good quality tanning lotion that Actually works how it says it does, for any skin type.</li>
            <li>Its deffinatly nice enough to put on and tan, then go from the tanning salon to a date or the store without having to worrie about looking streeky or smelling sweaty.</li>
            <li>It is a very nice tanning lotion and it leaves your skin feeling extra soft.</li>
            <li>I have been using this lotion for a few years now and LOVE IT!!  </li>
            <li>I have very fair skin, and for those who are like me know it is very hard to tan,</li>
            <li>price is very reasonable</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time</li>
            <li>This lotion was recommended as a favorite at my local salon, but as with all of their lotions, is quite pricey.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering from them again :)</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>so there is nothing they can really say,</li>
            <li>Dark Princess is my new favorite tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t seem to be as high a bronzer level as it says (50).</li>
            <li>I purchased this product and the first time I used it I stayed in the Tanning bed for only 12 minutes, I saw a remarkabe diffrense in my tan,</li>
            <li>My lower legs thats usually take months to tan had an even tan that was lovely.</li>

            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fade fast like some other lotions I have tried.  </li>
            <li>After being about the same shade for a few weeks, it has really darkened me up!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Dark Princess is my new favorite tanning lotion. After being about the same shade for a few weeks, it has really darkened me up! The bottle squeezes great so I can use ALL the product without popping the lid off...which seems like a small thing, but really annoyed me with my last lotion. Dark Princess also keeps my skin silky soft &amp; smelling divine. I&#x27;ll definitely be re-purchasing.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion, smells great, makes my skin super soft, and gives me a great even tan</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion. First time I used it , it gave my skin a dark tan. I only tanned 10 mins in a stand up bed. So far I&#x27;ve used this lotion three times since I&#x27;ve received it and don&#x27;t need to tan for at least another four days. It&#x27;s def worth it to purchase this lotion!</li>
            <li> I thought it would give a darker result.  It is an OK lotion. I&#x27;m fair skinned, so I would say this would be a lotion to start off with.</li>
            <li> I just bought this and used it for the first time the other day.  I have already seen results and darker skin.  It smells wonderful and I dont smell like i am going tanning when I put it on or smell like i went tanning afterwards.  It was fast delivery and a lot sooner than expected.  I would recommend this product and the seller.[[ASIN:B002XVUJSM 2010 Tan Incorporated Brown Sugar Dark Princess Tanning Lotion 13.5 oz.]]</li>
            <li> The lotion smells great even after u tan but i would say it a lotion more for beginners who dont have much color this bronzors are nice not orange and doesnt stain Ur hands. but doesnt seem to do as much for me as other lotions since i am already dark</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin, and for those who are like me know it is very hard to tan, let alone find a tanning lotion that actually works. I haven&#x27;t been tanning in over a year, and figured it was time. Through days of searching for the right tanning lotion I had stumbled upon this lotion and heard/read nothing but good things about it. So I decided I would give it a try, and am so happy with the outcome. This lotion smells Amazing before tanning, and smells the same after tanning. I normally burn and turn red after tanning, and with this one, I did neither. It had gotten me a good tan color the first time of using it, and just gets better the more you use it. With most lotions I have tried, after a while of tanning, I never seemed to increase the tan after a point. This one just keeps on going to your hearts desire. I can also use this lotion and tan every day, and not have to worry about being too red or burnt and have to skip a day. I would absolutely recommend this tanning lotion to anyone who is looking for a good quality tanning lotion that Actually works how it says it does, for any skin type.</li>
            <li> I am very hard to tan individual.

I had no problems with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is very reasonable it is a big bottle and you get a lot for your buck. The tanning salon I go to sells the product but it is so popular they are always out of it when I go in there, so I ordered mine on line recieved it in one week and got it for $10.00 less than they were selling it in the Tanning Salon.&lt;br /&gt;So yes I am very pleased with the product, price and shipping of this product and would recommend it to any one who wants a great even tan fast.</li>
            <li> I just got this lotion in the mail yesterday, standard shipping took about a week, just a heads up. But it came with no problems or damage. I used it for the first time today, I&#x27;m very fair skinned (blonde hair, blue eyes) and I burn easy. I had no problems with this lotion today, I came out with no streaks, a nice golden glow, no redness, and my skin is getting darker already! I&#x27;m excited to see where this lotion takes me :) I don&#x27;t see any hint of orange and overall I feel great. This lotion is well worth it! I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Received the item quickly. Well packaged. Looked original. I&#x27;ve always had pretty fair skin but can tan relatively well. I&#x27;m used to using Swedish beauty and Australian gold products but thought I&#x27;d give this a try. I ve been using two weeks and have noticed a change in color. Not a big change but still. Trying to get past my base tan and can&#x27;t seem to do it. That is the only reason I gave it three stars. It just doesn&#x27;t seem to be as high a bronzer level as it says (50). It will not turn you orange though so that&#x27;s good!</li>
            <li> Great savings in comparison to the Tanning Salon Prices. The tanning salon tries to tell me I can&#x27;t use it but the product is for an indoor bed so there is nothing they can really say, It&#x27;s my product and my body. this is a great item and works wonderfully.  Saves lots of dollars.</li>
            <li> Love it. It is a very nice tanning lotion and it leaves your skin feeling extra soft. The smell is amazing. It smells like designer perfume. Its deffinatly nice enough to put on and tan, then go from the tanning salon to a date or the store without having to worrie about looking streeky or smelling sweaty. Great product. Even better price! a must have!</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for a few years now and LOVE IT!!  Goes on very well so a little goes a long way.  No orange hands is a plus and gives a very nice bronze tan.  Smells good even after you tan so no need to rush home to shower.  I tan easily so after about 2-3 tanning sessions I already have some good color.  For me, once I have a good tan it lasts quite awhile.  Doesn&#x27;t fade fast like some other lotions I have tried.  If you are very fair skinned or don&#x27;t tan easy may not have the same results.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I am becoming so dark in such a short amount of time. Would definately recommend this!</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion.  It has amazing bronzers that give you a fabolous color and the scent is amazing.  Smells like a really good smelling perfume.  Will definately buy this lotion again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to tan for my wedding. It smells good and works really well. Me and my Husband loved it.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!  I am getting a nice color with NO orange tint.  The scent is pleasant, not overly strong and it is hydrating.  This lotion was recommended as a favorite at my local salon, but as with all of their lotions, is quite pricey.  I checked amazon and found this for 1/2 the price!!  It shipped very fast and arrived in good condition.  I will definitely be ordering from them again :)</li>
            <li> Nice smell and silky smooth, love the way this feels on your skin and I use it with 30 and it makes me so dark..</li>
            <li> Product was average. Good to buy from but not one of my favorite tanning lotions</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an advanced tanner and I&#x27;m in love with this lotion gives you a nice brown color with natural bronzers in it. No orange color!</li>
