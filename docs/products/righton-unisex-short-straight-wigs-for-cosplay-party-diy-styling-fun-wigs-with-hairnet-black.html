            <li>Really nice quality wig, just had to cut and style the fringe</li>
            <li>It honestly looks like a girl character.</li>
            <li>The wig itself is good quality, but the wig cap I could get at the dollar store and have better quality.</li>
            <li>the color was perfect highly recommended this wig</li>
            <li>The color is exactly what it is in the picture, it&#x27;s a beautiful grayish color :)</li>
            <li>but thats what you&#x27;d expect from most wigs from the internet</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>, I think maybe a day or two before it was even supposed to come! :)</li>
            <li>I really love this wig</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li>I Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Goes</li>
            <li>Overall, its awesome!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lovely thank you</li>
            <li>bigger than i was expecting and fit me perfectly.</li>
            <li>it looks nothing like the picture in my opinion but the wig itself fit Ciels hair color better than the picture</li>
            <li>The o ly thing good about this product was that it shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Other then that its perfect.</li>
            <li>Kinda big one, but still great.</li>
            <li>It fit well</li>
            <li>Will probably require some trimming to get to the right length but other than that perfect.</li>
            <li>I really love the material it&#x27;s Made out of, it&#x27;s very soft and easy to comb.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look like the picture since it looks full gray in the pics</li>
            <li>still is cool.</li>
            <li>The hair on the wig is very soft and doesn&#x27;t feel or look cheap at all!</li>
            <li>The color is exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li>, I stuff almost 3 feet of hair in my wig and it looks natural :)</li>
            <li>the colours are nice mixture of blue and gray.</li>
            <li>Is a nice blue color with tiny bit of grey, looks nice and fits well.</li>
            <li>Well it wasn&#x27;t really the exact color as Ciel nor length</li>
            <li>The colour is a tad more grey than I&#x27;d prefer but that&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that it sheds way too easily.</li>
            <li>Great quality and thick!</li>
            <li>I would have to say it is a tight fit, but I have 3ft of hair I have to fit under it as well,</li>
            <li>It fits very well too.</li>
            <li>The color was very off and was horrendous to look at.</li>
            <li>Looks real.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really your opinion if you want to get this wig or</li>
            <li>ok I guess since that was my first time cutting a wig honestly...</li>
            <li>, now ill look great at the convention I&#x27;m going to haha!</li>
            <li>Wig is a nice material and is very durable, but the fit is all wrong for Ciel Phantomhive.</li>
            <li>Very soft feels like real hair</li>
            <li>Very soft and not too shiny!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also cut perfectly, I highly recommend this wig c:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>With the wig being parted to hang over the right eye, there&#x27;s little too much hair, and it kind of hangs over the entire front of my face, so i&#x27;ll have to see if I can clip some of it, or brush it over so that it hangs properly.</li>
            <li>While I wish I had left it a little longer when I was cutting it, I still love how it looks, and the color is beautiful.  </li>
            <li>It is very soft and has very nice lining along the part where the wig and the hair connect so you don&#x27;t itch like crazy.</li>
            <li>received it fairly early too</li>
            <li>It came in two weeks early.</li>
            <li>It looks very real, and the gray is mixed with blue strands which give it a blue-grayish look.</li>
            <li>I have actually worn it to school and other places, and everyone thought it was real!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a dark grey and almost blue in certain lights.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It is a bit long, so it will need to be trimmed, but not a big deal</li>
            <li> It was kinda long.</li>
            <li> its vary long unlike ciel hair is cut.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m just gonna die it a dark navy blue color if I can...</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the skull cap to hold your hair under the wig is a little snug - doable though.</li>
            <li> but that was expected.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s really no problem.</li>
            <li> It was a little long, so I had to cut the fringe.</li>
            <li> Very thick, and very long when I got it, but I expected that,  After cutting it, it looks fabulous, and like I said it&#x27;s very thick and very high quality.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little longer than ciel&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> The wig stinks,the color is off, and the hairline makes it hard to place.</li>
            <li> The quality of the big was not too bad but it looks nothing like in the picture.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the wrong color and style</li>
            <li> not ok!&lt;br /&gt;Overall this wig wasn&#x27;t completely horrible but yea!</li>

            <li> Its the perfect color! I have actually worn it to school and other places, and everyone thought it was real! It fits very well too. It&#x27;s a little longer than ciel&#x27;s hair but you can just cut it, I&#x27;m keeping it the same since it still looks like Ciel&#x27;s hair either way ^_^</li>
            <li> The quality of the big was not too bad but it looks nothing like in the picture. Its long in the back and short in the front and it reminds me of a mullet. The color was very off and was horrendous to look at. The o ly thing good about this product was that it shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Really nice wig, and great price. I was expecting it to be darker.  My only issue. Kinda big one, but still great.</li>

            <li> The wig is wonderful quality and the color is just right. The only problem is that it sheds way too easily.</li>
            <li> The wig is actually shoulder length. I had to cut it to make it look like Ciel&#x27;s hair. Otherwise it is s great wig. It looks very real, and the gray is mixed with blue strands which give it a blue-grayish look.</li>
            <li> Really nice quality wig, just had to cut and style the fringe but that was expected.</li>

            <li> I Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Goes perfect with my Ciel cosplay c:</li>
            <li> This Wig was perfect! It fit well, I didn&#x27;t have to adjust it. And I&#x27;m wearing it to  Ohayocon soon so that should work perfectly.</li>
            <li> The wig does not look like Ciel&#x27;s hair it&#x27;s the wrong color and style</li>
            <li> it was very good came on time and looked awsome</li>
            <li> This wig is very nice. It came in like a week so that part was good. And the color is very nice. It needs to be styled a bit but that&#x27;s really no problem.</li>
            <li> Wig is a nice material and is very durable, but the fit is all wrong for Ciel Phantomhive. It honestly looks like a girl character.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! It came in two weeks early. It doesn&#x27;t look like the picture since it looks full gray in the pics but it actually is gray with blue under highlights butir still is cool. Its super thick and is also very long. So I had to cut it alot. Overall, its awesome!!</li>
            <li> it looks nothing like the picture in my opinion but the wig itself fit Ciels hair color better than the picture</li>
            <li> very nice wig. bigger than i was expecting and fit me perfectly. the colours are nice mixture of blue and gray.</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful wig. It is very soft and has very nice lining along the part where the wig and the hair connect so you don&#x27;t itch like crazy. The colour is a tad more grey than I&#x27;d prefer but that&#x27;s alright. I&#x27;d definitely refer this to someone for it is a great price for a very great wig.</li>
            <li> Very soft feels like real hair the color was perfect highly recommended this wig</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lovely thank you</li>
            <li> The wig itself is good quality, but the wig cap I could get at the dollar store and have better quality.

            <li> Very soft and not too shiny! The hair color is just perfect for Ciel1 it matches his sort of Blue/Grey hair color ^^ I love it! It is a bit long, so it will need to be trimmed, but not a big deal</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it!</li>
