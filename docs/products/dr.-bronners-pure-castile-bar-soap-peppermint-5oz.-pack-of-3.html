            <li>My wife and I love this product.</li>
            <li>Works great, keeps my skin feeling soft &amp; hydrated.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I cannot stand body wash because it feels like it never washes off but most bar soaps have been too drying (Dial, etc) or don&#x27;t feel like they really clean (Dove, Ivory, etc).</li>
            <li>Just go easy with it on your face (burns your eyes), and also go easy with it &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This is an exceptionally fine choice for a travel soap as it can be used for body, hair and laundering your clothing.</li>
            <li>Very strong peppermint scent which is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>While I often enjoy the Tea Tree and Almond</li>
            <li>Always the same great product</li>
            <li>Fresh clean, also love the liquid form</li>
            <li>Amazing high peppermint content.</li>
            <li>My husband, who would previously only use body wash, is also in love with this bar soap and it cleans up our preschool age son nicely</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never felt so clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend bought a bar for me after he raved about it and he was so right!</li>
            <li>I love the lather and in the summer months, I love the peppermint version – because it produces a cooling sensation when you get out of the shower that is nice when the heat and humidity is high outside.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the liquid soap, no drop off and last for about 2 weeks a bar with my girlfriend and I using it.</li>
            <li>Long lasting great smell even gives a tingle if not rinsed off right away and lathers up good</li>
            <li>This soap gets you so clean and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>Gets one clean and felling fresh</li>
            <li>I’ve been using Dr. Bronner’s for many years now and it has remained consistently high quality.</li>

            <li>nice big soap bar.</li>
            <li>I like the fresh peppermint too.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite soap ever and there are no retailers that sell it near me.</li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>just the right amount of peppermint to refresh your skin and your senses-&lt;br /&gt;perfect</li>
            <li>Really gets you squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent and didn&#x27;t leave my skin dry.</li>
            <li>Very therapeutic for the skin, not acidic, not too mild.</li>
            <li>I tried this soap on my face in the shower on the first day</li>
            <li>It is super strong scented in the closed jar but one scoop in my wash and no lingering scent at all.  </li>
            <li>The clothes have come out clean but do not have little ones or super stained items to try to clean.</li>
            <li>A great smelling soap for hard water areas!</li>
            <li>A long lasting soap that leaves you feeling tingly clean with a refreshing mint scent.</li>
            <li>and she can sleep very well.</li>
            <li>The best part is that it cleared up my adult acne within only a few days of using it!!!</li>
            <li>For body wash only, it&#x27;s really very strong and dry ur face and hair.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t make your skin dry and itchy like most other soaps.</li>
            <li>This soap never gets old.  </li>
            <li>It is also completely biodegradable and vegetable-based.</li>
            <li>expensive but good for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is finally back to normal!</li>
            <li>I generally use the liquid version for both shampoo and body wash, but purchased this bar version to use while traveling.</li>

            <li> I also love it because there&#x27;s no antibacterial agent in it, as antibacterial is really bad for our immune systems.</li>

            <li> but I a relatively small individual.</li>
            <li> I prefer this soap to any other soap on the market.</li>
            <li> During cooler months, I rotate the other scents/versions… citrus orange, lavender, etc</li>
            <li> I have even known people to use it for brushing their teeth -- but that is a little extreme for me...</li>
            <li> No more dry elbows too.</li>
            <li> bar, with one use a day usually lasts me about two months or so</li>
            <li> The soap sucks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted!  </li>

            <li> Works great, keeps my skin feeling soft &amp; hydrated. No more dry elbows too. Rinses clean, smells great too. What more do you want from soap?</li>

            <li> This is the best soap on the planet. I have combination skin and this soap is perfect. It&#x27;s smell is invigotaring! It lathers beautifully and rinsed clean. I cannot stand body wash because it feels like it never washes off but most bar soaps have been too drying (Dial, etc) or don&#x27;t feel like they really clean (Dove, Ivory, etc). Even with well/softened water, this soap lathers and rinsed perfectly. My husband, who would previously only use body wash, is also in love with this bar soap and it cleans up our preschool age son nicely (I even shampoo him with the soap).</li>
            <li> Just as good as the liquid soap, no drop off and last for about 2 weeks a bar with my girlfriend and I using it.</li>
            <li> Made homemade laundry detergent with this.  It is super strong scented in the closed jar but one scoop in my wash and no lingering scent at all.  The clothes have come out clean but do not have little ones or super stained items to try to clean.</li>
            <li> For body wash only, it&#x27;s really very strong and dry ur face and hair.</li>
            <li> I use peppermint soap for everything. laundry, dishes, cleaning, washing my face and hands... the liquid kind is great too you can mix it with water to repell and kill bugs. my house never smelled so good!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted!  I LOVE this soap!</li>
            <li> This soap never gets old.  Great scent, very refreshing, and healthy!  My family is hooked.... I have used all the &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; and healthy soaps, this one is by far one of the best on the market.</li>
            <li> nice big soap bar. I like the fresh peppermint too.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this soap. I love all the Dr. Bronners products that I have tried. It has a nice scent and didn&#x27;t leave my skin dry.</li>
            <li> I love the Doc Bronners. This peppermint is my favorite. Really gets you squeaky clean. It is nice and cooling in the summer. Just go easy with it on your face (burns your eyes), and also go easy with it &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Love Love, wonderful product. Fresh clean, also love the liquid form</li>
            <li> Best soap on the planet the experiment is so invigorating</li>
            <li> best soap i have ever used by far...very refreshing and makes my skin feel amazing!</li>
            <li> A great smelling soap for hard water areas!</li>
            <li> Leaves an everlasting smell!</li>
            <li> Dr Bronners has consistently made a great product for quite some time now!  While I often enjoy the Tea Tree and Almond I do most prefer the Peppermint.  It is a great fragrance for both men and women alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that their bars of soap (along with liquid soaps) are &amp;#34;All In One&amp;#34; so they can be used on your body or hair as well as to brush teeth or wash dishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While applying this soap you will feel a tingling sensation all over and leave your shower refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely great for the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are on the fence as to whether you should purchase the bar or liquid version I would consider how it will be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bar, with one use a day usually lasts me about two months or so but I a relatively small individual.</li>
            <li> Refreshing! Great size and quality. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  Lots of lather!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best soaps ever made. I had a major hemorrhoid, and after showering in this, with warm to hot water it vanished. Very therapeutic for the skin, not acidic, not too mild. Just right. Dr. Bonner, &amp;#34;all is indeed&amp;#34; one.</li>
            <li> If you stand under water and rub yourself with this, all the dirt will come off.  I swear to God!</li>
            <li> expensive but good for sensitive skin.  Works great.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th/5th time buying. I love the bar and the liquid.</li>
            <li> Always the same great product</li>
            <li> Love it.  That&#x27;s all I have to say about it.  My skin looks better than it has since I was a kid.</li>
            <li> Love the tingley feeling when I use this soap!  Smells so good, too!  Found this product thru a recommendation of a friend.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this soap. My boyfriend bought a bar for me after he raved about it and he was so right! I&#x27;ve never felt so clean and refreshed. The smell and tingle from the peppermint is amazing too. The best part is that it cleared up my adult acne within only a few days of using it!!! I never had acne in my life. I suddenly started having break outs a few months ago. I tried many products with no luck. I tried this soap on my face in the shower on the first day I got the soap and I could see improvement in my complexion by morning. Within one week I didn&#x27;t have a single pimple! My skin is finally back to normal! Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this soap.</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronners of all varieties is excellent. A long lasting soap that leaves you feeling tingly clean with a refreshing mint scent. I generally use the liquid version for both shampoo and body wash, but purchased this bar version to use while traveling. This is an exceptionally fine choice for a travel soap as it can be used for body, hair and laundering your clothing. It is also completely biodegradable and vegetable-based. I have even known people to use it for brushing their teeth -- but that is a little extreme for me...</li>
            <li> The best soap you could use!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite soap ever and there are no retailers that sell it near me. Before I moved this was in every grocery store and health food store, now it&#x27;s like a soap unicorn. I think I remember seeing it, but was it a dream? I was beginning to think dr. Bronners Castile soap was a myth until I found it on amazon. This soap gets you so clean and fresh feeling. I prefer this soap to any other soap on the market. Also if you get some on you and don&#x27;t wash immediately it doesn&#x27;t make your skin dry and itchy like most other soaps. This is even delicate enough to use on my baby, and she has sensitive skin.  I also love it because there&#x27;s no antibacterial agent in it, as antibacterial is really bad for our immune systems.</li>
            <li> This soap is my all time favorite. I just wish it lasted longer. I got through one bar every 12 days with one shower a day.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love this product. My wife has diabetic neuropathy and we wash her feet every night with this soap and she can sleep very well.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using Dr. Bronner’s for many years now and it has remained consistently high quality. I love the lather and in the summer months, I love the peppermint version – because it produces a cooling sensation when you get out of the shower that is nice when the heat and humidity is high outside. During cooler months, I rotate the other scents/versions… citrus orange, lavender, etc… It’s simply great soap.</li>
            <li> A very nice clean.  Very strong peppermint scent which is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> just the right amount of peppermint to refresh your skin and your senses-&lt;br /&gt;perfect after a day in the summer sun</li>
            <li> The soap sucks. I tried turning the soap into liquid, but didn&#x27;t do anything! I should post pictures...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the bar soap doesn&#x27;t give me the same feeling as I get when I use the liquid version I bought locally.</li>
            <li> Gets one clean and felling fresh</li>
