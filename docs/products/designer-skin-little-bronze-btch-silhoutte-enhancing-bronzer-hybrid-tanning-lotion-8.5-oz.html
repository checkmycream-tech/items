            <li>then this will not be the best lotion for you.  </li>
            <li>For those tanning enthusiasts, this is a lighter bronzer - but works great!</li>

            <li>great</li>
            <li>It was a great price and helps give great color when tanning.</li>
            <li>but the after smell isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair skinned, so it&#x27;s nice to find something that doesn&#x27;t turn me orange.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife, she loves the scent, great price and good product.</li>
            <li>It smells really good</li>
            <li>Good thing it was just a trial size.</li>
            <li>Regardless, it is a good moisturizer with a good scent, and I will be buying it again when I run out.</li>
            <li>This bottle was 80 at my tanning salon, so I figured it would be some good stuff.</li>
            <li>It was so good that I bought two bottle to take on my honeymoon and use it at the beach.  </li>
            <li>loved the scent, the texture and color of the lotion, does not leave streaks.</li>
            <li>Gives good color.</li>
            <li>Gives you a really gorgeous glow to your tan.</li>
            <li>I was always trying to find  a good lotion, and when I got this product.</li>
            <li>Granted it doesn&#x27;t smell as great, but I thought it worked a lot better.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the price</li>
            <li>I love this lotion!</li>
            <li>But i love the smell!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, and will be buying it again!</li>
            <li>I was even a shade darker walking out smelling even better!</li>
            <li>good product but not my favorite in the designer skin line.</li>
            <li>It provides a nice brown, bronze...</li>
            <li>nice moisturizing lotion</li>
            <li>It is very hydrating and the smell is great!</li>
            <li>This lotion is really nice.</li>
            <li>It has a great coconut smell and it work fast!!</li>
            <li>This stuff smells good and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, smells good, decent price.</li>
            <li>The smell is very light, and there isn&#x27;t an after-tan odor.</li>
            <li>I know it isn&#x27;t healthy, which is why I try to minimize my visits.</li>
            <li>The problem I have with most tanning lotions, including the gifted one, is that a) they smell like all of a perfume store at once, and b) they shine, glitter, or do some sticky thing to my skin.</li>
            <li>my favorite lotion is fig me fig me</li>
            <li>These prices are better than I get even as a Salon employee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Are simply the best lotions.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin silky smooth!</li>
            <li>I go into the tanning bed, noticable, but not shocking when I come out of the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>But since I love the product and I needed a cheaper bottle I waited.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I really love the smell of this lotion, although I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my color.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I purchased thiS.</li>
            <li>I gave four stars because I wish you got more tans out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Hope it can always be available!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I have tried several lotions and this one works the best.</li>
            <li>I love that its a lotion that doesnt &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Best of all, it left my skin hydrated and glowing!!&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>use!&lt;br /&gt;i will recommend to my friends and many others!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;small bottle compared to most lotions</li>
            <li>I Love It.....  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and i love the fact that it has caffeine in it.</li>
            <li>The smell is okay too.</li>
            <li>I love this bronzer.</li>
            <li>I love it, and I tell everyone I know where to get it at..</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good</li>
            <li>It also smells great and keeps your skin soft.  </li>
            <li>It smells like coffee to me, like really strong coffee.</li>
            <li>your skin has a beautiful color!\\&quot; Further, there isn&#x27;t any funky glitter or smell with this product.</li>
            <li>I used it consistently for a month tanning and honestly couldn&#x27;t tell I was even using lotion.  </li>
            <li>I tan in the Instant Bed at Sun Tan City for anyone looking for a tanning bed, and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a great product.</li>
            <li>It smells slightly sweet and very normal, rather like a nice after-shower lotion I would apply after shaving or before bed.</li>
            <li>I tried a sample pack originally, and now I&#x27;m committed to it.</li>
            <li>The bottle came to me without original packaging and no seal on cap.</li>
            <li>It tightens and firms your body, and it has a unique smell..coffee maybe.</li>
            <li>She said the caffeine in the product would help reduce cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;Although I am not sure it made any difference on my cellulite, it was the best tanning lotion ever!  </li>
            <li>Try smile you&#x27;re darker instead!</li>
            <li>THE LOTION CAME IN THE ORIGINAL PACKAGING</li>
            <li>So far - they all love it!</li>
            <li>It not only smells good</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good about this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s was love at first sight, because after the first day of use you can tell you got some tan...</li>
            <li>Personally I still to triple or quadruple bronzer&#x27;s at the most so this lotion works great for my white girl skin!!</li>
            <li>I was noticeably darker after my first use!  </li>
            <li>I noticed a big difference and received lots of comments about how nice my tan looked.</li>
            <li>Lotion texture is easily absorbed on skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>or my skin will be so ashy it flakes right off .</li>
            <li>dark the next day, and this lotion works perfectly in doing that.</li>
            <li>When I first started out tanning, this was the first lotion that I bought!</li>
            <li>i gave the rating 5 stars because the shipping on the product was super fast</li>
            <li>It works well and smells better than the last tanning lotion I used.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I purchased a lotion online.  </li>
            <li>I noticed darker color the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>This appears to be the same product that you can buy in the salon for much more money.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so much cheaper to get it from Amazon!</li>
            <li>This was supposed to be their higher end version of that lotion.</li>
            <li>AND I COULD TELL BY THE TOP OF THE OPEN BOTTLE</li>
            <li>But even my first time using it in the tanning salon</li>
            <li>Right when I came out of the tanning bed and looked in the mirror, I was remarkably much tanner than before in just ONE</li>
            <li>like i would have liked compared to my other \\&quot;HOT MESS\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I really like this bronzer definitely one of my favorite.</li>
            <li>It was the exact product it advertized and was so much cheaper (in price).  </li>
            <li>I have tried other lotions and this is the only one that gives me awesome color, not only in tanning beds, but outdoors as well!</li>
            <li>Pretty decent tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li>I really like the smell.  </li>
            <li>Really bronzed me up.</li>
            <li>Really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much, and see a difference each time you get out of the bed.</li>
            <li>Really helps with the tan and is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>FAST DELIVERY.  </li>
            <li>The bottle name/packaging is really cute.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I have bought this at a tanning salon and it cost twice as much.</li>
            <li>It has a subtle and pleasant smell and is not greasey or sticking as others have been.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works fabulous, will make you super dark...</li>
            <li>I am super super ghostly pale and picked this one randomly based on the smell, which was delicious!</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin very smooth and is not too dark.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, it is not overwhelming at all, so if you don&#x27;t want to shower right after tanning, you really don&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li>or if you dont want to be insanely dark. :)</li>
            <li>I bought this as my second lotion at the tanning salon near where I live and I instantly fell in love with it!</li>
            <li>Perfect condition, unopened, and less than half the price than the same item at the tanning salon.  </li>
            <li>My previous lotion, Ultimate Love Junkie, by same company, was cheaper and better.  </li>
            <li>lotion in particular</li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s a fantastic lotion, and I would suggest it to any lady looking for quick, natural results, little scent, and normal skin tone/lack of sparkle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally use tingle lotion thought I&#x27;d give it a try .</li>
            <li>I will be using Little Bronze B!@tch until the bottle runs out, and will for sure be sticking with Designer Skin lotions if I want to try something new.</li>
            <li>The bronzer is subtle and good for someone new to UV tanning, like myself, but it is enough to get results quickly even after a short time in a tanning bed.</li>
            <li>IT WAS BRAND NEW.</li>
            <li>Rather than having remarks like, \\&quot;WOW!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and this lotion doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out!</li>
            <li>but you come out with a NATURAL looking tan!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not horrible, but definitely not my favorite.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Results--Wow, I was pleasantly surprised by the results I got from using this lotion!</li>
            <li>I first purchased this product at a local tanning salon upon recommendation by the sales person.  </li>
            <li>While my past tanning lotion smelled amazing and worked well, I recently switched to Bronze B!@tch today.</li>
            <li>Recently, my account was given a gift of a lotion priced at over 90 dollars full of different bronzers.</li>
            <li>TAN?!\\&quot;, I&#x27;ve heard \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li>It gets you super dark</li>
            <li>The color I&#x27;ve gotten is not extremely dark, because it looks natural.</li>
            <li>I am not half as dark as I am with smile</li>
            <li>I typically use smile</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have only used this product one time so far</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping to boost my tan, but I do not use this with a tanning bed (only natural sun for me).  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Try smile you&#x27;re darker instead!</li>
            <li> THE LOTION CAME IN THE ORIGINAL PACKAGING</li>
            <li> So far - they all love it!</li>
            <li> It not only smells good</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good about this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was love at first sight, because after the first day of use you can tell you got some tan...</li>
            <li> Personally I still to triple or quadruple bronzer&#x27;s at the most so this lotion works great for my white girl skin!!</li>
            <li> I was noticeably darker after my first use!  </li>
            <li> I noticed a big difference and received lots of comments about how nice my tan looked.</li>
            <li> Lotion texture is easily absorbed on skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> or my skin will be so ashy it flakes right off .</li>
            <li> dark the next day, and this lotion works perfectly in doing that.</li>
            <li> When I first started out tanning, this was the first lotion that I bought!</li>
            <li> i gave the rating 5 stars because the shipping on the product was super fast</li>
            <li> It works well and smells better than the last tanning lotion I used.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I purchased a lotion online.  </li>
            <li> I noticed darker color the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> This appears to be the same product that you can buy in the salon for much more money.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so much cheaper to get it from Amazon!</li>
            <li> This was supposed to be their higher end version of that lotion.</li>
            <li> AND I COULD TELL BY THE TOP OF THE OPEN BOTTLE</li>
            <li> But even my first time using it in the tanning salon</li>
            <li> Right when I came out of the tanning bed and looked in the mirror, I was remarkably much tanner than before in just ONE</li>
            <li> like i would have liked compared to my other \\&quot;HOT MESS\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I really like this bronzer definitely one of my favorite.</li>
            <li> It was the exact product it advertized and was so much cheaper (in price).  </li>
            <li> I have tried other lotions and this is the only one that gives me awesome color, not only in tanning beds, but outdoors as well!</li>
            <li> Pretty decent tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li> I really like the smell.  </li>
            <li> Really bronzed me up.</li>
            <li> Really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use much, and see a difference each time you get out of the bed.</li>
            <li> Really helps with the tan and is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> FAST DELIVERY.  </li>
            <li> The bottle name/packaging is really cute.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I have bought this at a tanning salon and it cost twice as much.</li>
            <li> It has a subtle and pleasant smell and is not greasey or sticking as others have been.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works fabulous, will make you super dark...</li>
            <li> I am super super ghostly pale and picked this one randomly based on the smell, which was delicious!</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin very smooth and is not too dark.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, it is not overwhelming at all, so if you don&#x27;t want to shower right after tanning, you really don&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li> or if you dont want to be insanely dark. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this as my second lotion at the tanning salon near where I live and I instantly fell in love with it!</li>
            <li> Perfect condition, unopened, and less than half the price than the same item at the tanning salon.  </li>
            <li> My previous lotion, Ultimate Love Junkie, by same company, was cheaper and better.  </li>
            <li> lotion in particular</li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s a fantastic lotion, and I would suggest it to any lady looking for quick, natural results, little scent, and normal skin tone/lack of sparkle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally use tingle lotion thought I&#x27;d give it a try .</li>
            <li> I will be using Little Bronze B!@tch until the bottle runs out, and will for sure be sticking with Designer Skin lotions if I want to try something new.</li>
            <li> The bronzer is subtle and good for someone new to UV tanning, like myself, but it is enough to get results quickly even after a short time in a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> IT WAS BRAND NEW.</li>
            <li> Rather than having remarks like, \\&quot;WOW!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and this lotion doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out!</li>
            <li> but you come out with a NATURAL looking tan!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not horrible, but definitely not my favorite.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Results--Wow, I was pleasantly surprised by the results I got from using this lotion!</li>
            <li> I first purchased this product at a local tanning salon upon recommendation by the sales person.  </li>
            <li> While my past tanning lotion smelled amazing and worked well, I recently switched to Bronze B!@tch today.</li>
            <li> Recently, my account was given a gift of a lotion priced at over 90 dollars full of different bronzers.</li>
            <li> TAN?!\\&quot;, I&#x27;ve heard \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li> It gets you super dark</li>
            <li> The color I&#x27;ve gotten is not extremely dark, because it looks natural.</li>
            <li> I am not half as dark as I am with smile</li>
            <li> I typically use smile</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product one time so far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to boost my tan, but I do not use this with a tanning bed (only natural sun for me).  </li>
            <li> It is tough for me to get a nice tan in the tanning booth, with a little help from this product, I was tan in a week!</li>
            <li> I didnt end up getting it until the last day of the \\&quot;expected date of arrival\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I also like [[ASIN:B006FKLRIS Juicy 16 fl oz]] for after showering, because tanning can really dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> Amazon it was about half the cost than at the local tanning salon.</li>
            <li> This Little Bronze B!@tch lotion is different.</li>
            <li> I was  skeptical about purchasing a lotion online - would it really be the same lotion inside??  </li>
            <li> and it did not wash away like the other lotions I have tried.</li>
            <li> It has that hint of coffee smell in it (since it is enriched with caffiene) and I see a noticable difference in the way my skin looks due to the caffiene.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like any other tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> And be careful, it&#x27;s a little runny if you aren&#x27;t used to it.</li>
            <li> paid half of what I would&#x27;ve if purchased at tanning salon...</li>
            <li> /&gt;In regards to the little bronze</li>
            <li> I get a little tanner everytime</li>
            <li> Ive been using this lotion for a little over a year now.</li>
            <li> Bottle opening is too small</li>
            <li> Not great value (small volume) compare to other tanning lotions.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> so you might have a hard time getting the lotion out.</li>
            <li> I began to tan 2 months ago for at least 5 times a week using Monarchy tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Or maybe I just had thick lotion</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;ve tried several very expensive lotions.</li>
            <li> Dried my skin out so bad I have to reapply skin lotion every hour</li>
            <li> I had in the past just purchased the lotion at the tanning salon, but it is very expensive there,</li>
            <li> It was really expensive</li>
            <li> It seems expensive for the amount of tans you get.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t streak bad</li>
            <li> :-(</li>
            <li> This is the worst tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used in my life.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> paid half of what I would&#x27;ve if purchased at tanning salon...good product but not my favorite in the designer skin line.</li>
            <li> Hi, girls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;ve been tanning for a couple summers now. I know it isn&#x27;t healthy, which is why I try to minimize my visits. I tan in the Instant Bed at Sun Tan City for anyone looking for a tanning bed, and it&#x27;s great. Anyway, I&#x27;ve tried several very expensive lotions. Recently, my account was given a gift of a lotion priced at over 90 dollars full of different bronzers. The problem I have with most tanning lotions, including the gifted one, is that a) they smell like all of a perfume store at once, and b) they shine, glitter, or do some sticky thing to my skin. I don&#x27;t want to leave my tanning bed needing to shower. This Little Bronze B!@tch lotion is different. I tried a sample pack originally, and now I&#x27;m committed to it. The color I&#x27;ve gotten is not extremely dark, because it looks natural. Rather than having remarks like, \\&quot;WOW! You&#x27;re so... TAN?!\\&quot;, I&#x27;ve heard \\&quot;Wow, you have a great complexion... your skin has a beautiful color!\\&quot; Further, there isn&#x27;t any funky glitter or smell with this product. It smells slightly sweet and very normal, rather like a nice after-shower lotion I would apply after shaving or before bed. It is not sticky or glossy, and I apply it liberally. All in all, it&#x27;s a fantastic lotion, and I would suggest it to any lady looking for quick, natural results, little scent, and normal skin tone/lack of sparkle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck! I also like [[ASIN:B006FKLRIS Juicy 16 fl oz]] for after showering, because tanning can really dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> I tanned for about 5 weeks before using this product. I was noticeably darker after my first use!  It provides a nice brown, bronze...no orange color at all. It also smells great and keeps your skin soft.  I get compliments on my tan all the time now, and have converted several others to use this product!  So far - they all love it!</li>
            <li> I have only used this product one time so far my favorite lotion is fig me fig me not but this was suggested so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. It smells really good and I could tell a difference as soon as I got out of the tanning bed and it did not wash away like the other lotions I have tried.</li>
            <li> Perfect condition, unopened, and less than half the price than the same item at the tanning salon.  It works well and smells better than the last tanning lotion I used.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I purchased a lotion online.  I have always paid retail at a salon (or as a salon employee at salon cost).  I was  skeptical about purchasing a lotion online - would it really be the same lotion inside??  But, I am actually really happy with my purchase.  Lotion smelled as it should and I couldnt notice a difference.  I will definatly buy my lotions online from now on.  These prices are better than I get even as a Salon employee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to the little bronze +++ lotion in particular I really like the smell.  I am picky about this.  It is the quality you would expect from a designer skin product.  HOwever, it you like a lot of bronzer then this will not be the best lotion for you.  Personally I still to triple or quadruple bronzer&#x27;s at the most so this lotion works great for my white girl skin!!</li>
            <li> I like this as a body lotion...kinda costly for just a lotion though. I did not get any darker with this. I am at the tingle factor stage of tanning, so maybe going backwards with this bronzer does not help. The bottle came to me without original packaging and no seal on cap. Will not purchase this again. By the way...black, and 14 kt. Are simply the best lotions.</li>
            <li> I bought this as my second lotion at the tanning salon near where I live and I instantly fell in love with it! It was really expensive so I decided to order my next bottle here. It has a great smell before and after being in the tanning bed. It makes your skin silky smooth! It also has a great bronzer in it. I like to have a gradual tan, not white one day and redic. dark the next day, and this lotion works perfectly in doing that. I get a little tanner everytime I go into the tanning bed, noticable, but not shocking when I come out of the tanning bed. It has that hint of coffee smell in it (since it is enriched with caffiene) and I see a noticable difference in the way my skin looks due to the caffiene. It came to my POBox completly sealed. My only criticism would have to be the seller, although it came to me sealed, it took 2 days to eveb process the order, then it had to travel from California to Maine...I didnt end up getting it until the last day of the \\&quot;expected date of arrival\\&quot;. But since I love the product and I needed a cheaper bottle I waited. :) Deff. use this if you are a beginner tanner or if you dont want to be insanely dark. :)</li>
            <li> nice moisturizing lotion but it did not produce the results like i would have liked compared to my other \\&quot;HOT MESS\\&quot;. Good thing it was just a trial size. It kinda Smells like coco butter.</li>
            <li> This is my second &#x27;designer skin&#x27; tanning lotion.  I really love the smell of this lotion, although I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my color.  I used it consistently for a month tanning and honestly couldn&#x27;t tell I was even using lotion.  My previous lotion, Ultimate Love Junkie, by same company, was cheaper and better.  Granted it doesn&#x27;t smell as great, but I thought it worked a lot better.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It tightens and firms your body, and it has a unique smell..coffee maybe. But i love the smell! I&#x27;m so glad that I purchased thiS.</li>
            <li> Really bronzed me up. I&#x27;ve been tanning for a while and have noticed myself getting darker, but once I switched to this lotion, boom! I noticed a big difference and received lots of comments about how nice my tan looked. I gave four stars because I wish you got more tans out of the bottle. It seems expensive for the amount of tans you get. And be careful, it&#x27;s a little runny if you aren&#x27;t used to it. Or maybe I just had thick lotion beforehand lol</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife, she loves the scent, great price and good product. This makes a great gift guys.</li>
            <li> It is tough for me to get a nice tan in the tanning booth, with a little help from this product, I was tan in a week!</li>
            <li> Really like this stuff.  Hope it can always be available!</li>
            <li> Pretty decent tanning lotion.  Doesn&#x27;t streak bad but it doesn&#x27;t give me as deep a color as others I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> This is the worst tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used in my life. I used it one time . Dried my skin out so bad I have to reapply skin lotion every hour or my skin will be so ashy it flakes right off . I&#x27;ve never had a problem with tanning lotion except this. I normally use tingle lotion thought I&#x27;d give it a try . Biggest mistake I have ever made . I will never order from this company again!</li>
            <li> This lotion is all it was supposed to be. I noticed darker color the first time I used it. The smell is very light, and there isn&#x27;t an after-tan odor. Overall it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I really like this bronzer definitely one of my favorite. It not only smells good but i look tanner just after one hour. It has something to do with the caffeine in it that brings your bodies capillaries closer to the surface. Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Felt like a skinny bronze bitch! Lol. Good stuff, smells good, decent price. Skin was moisturized and tightened.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion. I have used it for over a year now and it is great. It is very hydrating and the smell is great! For those tanning enthusiasts, this is a lighter bronzer - but works great!</li>
            <li> This appears to be the same product that you can buy in the salon for much more money. I love the smell, it is not overwhelming at all, so if you don&#x27;t want to shower right after tanning, you really don&#x27;t have to. It is not a bronzer, I know it says so on the bottle, but I am VERY fair and there is never any color on my hands after application. Regardless, it is a good moisturizer with a good scent, and I will be buying it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> When I first started out tanning, this was the first lotion that I bought! I have sensitive skin, and this lotion doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out! It smells good going in and coming out of the tanning bed! You don&#x27;t have to use much, and see a difference each time you get out of the bed. You don&#x27;t get \\&quot;instantly dark\\&quot; after each use but you come out with a NATURAL looking tan! I love this lotion, and will be buying it again!</li>
            <li> Scent--It smells like coffee to me, like really strong coffee. It&#x27;s not horrible, but definitely not my favorite. And fyi the smell is even stronger after you tan.&lt;br /&gt;Results--Wow, I was pleasantly surprised by the results I got from using this lotion! I was noticeably darker as soon as I got out of the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and works great. I have tried several lotions and this one works the best. I love that its a lotion that doesnt &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34;. This bottle was 80 at my tanning salon, so I figured it would be some good stuff. Because I have to buy it each month, I purchase on here as a sugestion from my boyfriend. This stuff works fabulous, will make you super dark... Defintely makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Great bronzer does a great job and smells wonderful. I don&#x27;t use anything else since I started using this one. Really helps with the tan and is not greasy at all. Can&#x27;t say enough good about this product.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this product at a local tanning salon upon recommendation by the sales person.  She said the caffeine in the product would help reduce cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;Although I am not sure it made any difference on my cellulite, it was the best tanning lotion ever!  It was so good that I bought two bottle to take on my honeymoon and use it at the beach.  It has a subtle and pleasant smell and is not greasey or sticking as others have been.  Best of all, it left my skin hydrated and glowing!!&lt;br /&gt;On Amazon it was about half the cost than at the local tanning salon.</li>
            <li> I began to tan 2 months ago for at least 5 times a week using Monarchy tanning lotion. While my past tanning lotion smelled amazing and worked well, I recently switched to Bronze B!@tch today. Right when I came out of the tanning bed and looked in the mirror, I was remarkably much tanner than before in just ONE use!&lt;br /&gt;i will recommend to my friends and many others!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;fast tanning results&lt;br /&gt;smells great&lt;br /&gt;not orange, but bronze!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;small bottle compared to most lotions</li>
            <li> I purchased this tanning lotion online to save money.  I had in the past just purchased the lotion at the tanning salon, but it is very expensive there, so I thought I would take a chance and buy it on Amazon.  I will NEVER again buy retail!  It was the exact product it advertized and was so much cheaper (in price).  I was very pleased!</li>
            <li> I Love It.....  It smells wonderful, like you in the tropics.  It was a great price and helps give great color when tanning.</li>
            <li> This lotion is really nice. The smell reminds me of coconut, but it&#x27;s not overpowering once it&#x27;s been applied. It was easy to apply, and a little goes a long way. The bronzer is subtle and good for someone new to UV tanning, like myself, but it is enough to get results quickly even after a short time in a tanning bed. I will be using Little Bronze B!@tch until the bottle runs out, and will for sure be sticking with Designer Skin lotions if I want to try something new. 10/10.</li>
            <li> loved the scent, the texture and color of the lotion, does not leave streaks.Gives good color. woul def purchase again</li>
            <li> Gives you a really gorgeous glow to your tan. I wish they didn&#x27;t discontinue this. :-( I don&#x27;t like any other tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this product. No streaks no orange. It smells pretty good but the after smell isn&#x27;t that great. I still use it daily though.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this lotion at my tanning salon, but jeez...it&#x27;s so much cheaper to get it from Amazon! I&#x27;ve been using it for over 6 months, and don&#x27;t think going to try a different one any time soon.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells good and goes on smooth. I&#x27;m hoping to boost my tan, but I do not use this with a tanning bed (only natural sun for me).  I like that you can use this with both.</li>
            <li> Item not as described. I purchased this lotion from a salon and the smell and feel were very much different. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I typically use smile you&#x27;re darker by designer skin. This was supposed to be their higher end version of that lotion. I am not half as dark as I am with smile you&#x27;re darker which is also a lot cheaper. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Try smile you&#x27;re darker instead!</li>
            <li> FAST DELIVERY.  THE LOTION CAME IN THE ORIGINAL PACKAGING AND I COULD TELL BY THE TOP OF THE OPEN BOTTLE THAT IT WAS BRAND NEW.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It gets you super dark and i love the fact that it has caffeine in it. i gave the rating 5 stars because the shipping on the product was super fast and it just works and smells really good!</li>
            <li> I like it. I&#x27;m very fair skinned, so it&#x27;s nice to find something that doesn&#x27;t turn me orange. The smell is okay too.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- The bottle name/packaging is really cute.&lt;br /&gt;- The smell is great.&lt;br /&gt;- Lotion texture is easily absorbed on skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Takes multiple times of use for skin to show bronzing.&lt;br /&gt;- Not great value (small volume) compare to other tanning lotions.&lt;br /&gt;- Bottle opening is too small so you might have a hard time getting the lotion out. Especially while you are trying to squeeze the bottle with greasy hands.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I am super super ghostly pale and picked this one randomly based on the smell, which was delicious! But even my first time using it in the tanning salon I was even a shade darker walking out smelling even better! I would always buy the product here, same things, cheaper price! Wonderful, wonderful product!!!</li>
            <li> Ive been using this lotion for a little over a year now. I have tried other lotions and this is the only one that gives me awesome color, not only in tanning beds, but outdoors as well!</li>
            <li> I have bought this at a tanning salon and it cost twice as much. Very satisfied with the price and the quality was excellent. It has a great coconut smell and it work fast!! Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this bronzer. It leaves the skin very smooth and is not too dark.</li>
            <li> I was always trying to find  a good lotion, and when I got this product. It&#x27;s was love at first sight, because after the first day of use you can tell you got some tan... I love it, and I tell everyone I know where to get it at.. Thank you</li>
            <li> Item was shipped immediately and I have been using it for about a year and it is the best tanning product I have come across.</li>
