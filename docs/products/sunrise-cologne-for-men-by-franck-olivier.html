            <li>Good ones anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>4 stars is \\&quot;extremely good and will be replaced when used up\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It had really good reviews</li>
            <li>, I have no idea what that smells like, but they loved it and so do I.  </li>
            <li>Furthermore, smelling good for 6-8 months for $20 is a no brainer IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>both of them smell really good and both of them get a lot of compliments</li>
            <li>This is an intelligently designed, high-quality, impeccably delightful fragrance whose peers cost three to five times as much.</li>
            <li>Very potent.</li>
            <li>This cologne is great; the women love it.  </li>
            <li>very nice... more for evening</li>

            <li>Its amazing</li>
            <li>Try and see amazing stuff, wonder why I havent had of it before???.</li>
            <li>When I sprayed it on, I thought, surely it can&#x27;t be THAT good?</li>
            <li>I would recommend Franck Oliver&#x27;s Sunrise as a nice, every day, day time fragrance.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>: Will not seduce women all on its own.</li>
            <li>I enjoy anything that is well put together, smells pleasant, and has acceptable longevity.</li>
            <li>Nice top notes of lavendar and begamot?</li>
            <li>If you decide to go with Sunrise, go easy on the sprays!</li>
            <li>Okay you&#x27;re probably  here because you heard this smells like fierce.</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li>After the mall kiosk tried to sell the bottle to me for $65, I went online to see if I could find a better deal.  </li>
            <li>I love when my boyfriend wears his Frank cologne.</li>
            <li>Sunrise from Frank Olivier is definitely my favorite cologne to date.</li>
            <li>Item arrived in a very timely manner and was a great price too.</li>
            <li>I love aquas, chypres, florals, fougeres, oudhs, attars, orientals.</li>
            <li>Surely.</li>
            <li>Frank Olivier is skyrocketing to the top of my list of favorite fragrance makers.</li>
            <li>Sunrise is prominently floral, where Terre d&#x27;Hermes is not at all floral.</li>
            <li>Sunrise is prominently floral, where Terre d&#x27;Hermes is not at all floral.</li>
            <li>Love this cologne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot better than others II have used</li>
            <li>My Husband loves this fragrance,  this is a repeat purchase,  will buy again for sure, can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>many many many collognes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I receive compliments on the Sunrise Cologne and have ordered it again and am pleased with the service and price.</li>
            <li>I guess It&#x27;s ok for the price.</li>
            <li>I think it has more of a grown-up smell, but that is my opinion.</li>
            <li>I Get More Comments About this Cologne than others costing 3x the price  LOVE</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truely a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Had never heard of Sunrise, but am now enjoying it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this fragrance and my woman......</li>
            <li>Love this brand of Cologne</li>
            <li>Most anyone will enjoy it - be it males or females.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fresh and a nice smell to start a day.....</li>
            <li>For one who wants to smell unique and spectacular, you can hardly do better, and you can NOT do better for the price.</li>
            <li>This wonderful fragrance comes INCREDIBLY highly recommended from an experienced amateur fragrance enthusiast.</li>
            <li>Amazing and smells exactly like the Ambercrombie and Fitch Stores.</li>
            <li>It is a lovely chypre-and-citrus, with florals in the background, a bold one, wood forward...</li>
            <li>for everyday use, its perfect.  </li>
            <li>light-</li>
            <li>Really enjoy the cologne.</li>
            <li>Fantastic cologne.</li>
            <li>I received this in the original packaging and can confirm it&#x27;s genuine after it lasted all day.</li>
            <li>I thought, surely I&#x27;ve accidentally hit the apex of a line of average designer fragrances, an accidentally great one.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a Montale aoud accord which is unique in the industry</li>
            <li>Despite the incorrect comparison I made originally, because of the quality, longevity, uniqueness of this scent, and factoring in the value at its price point, the 5-star rating stands.</li>
            <li>If you are thinking of buying this purely on reviews I will note first that this is a very safe scent.</li>
            <li>It smells good but haven&#x27;t really gotten much compliments from the ladies.</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;m a middle-aged professional man, father, who enjoys a nice wardrobe, including fragrances.</li>
            <li>, it has a nice scent and comes in a beautiful bottle, the problem is that the scent lasts for only a few minutes at most</li>
            <li>Good back up alternative in case</li>
            <li>Sunrise is not bad for a cologne.</li>
            <li>It is a pleasant sent though and a little more on the safer side then Sun Java.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottle looks super cool.</li>
            <li>I have given this 5 stars... against Amouage, Montale, Serge Lutens, L&#x27;Artisan Parfumeur, Le Labo, and my absolute favorite oriental design house fragrances, Fujiyama (by Succes de Paris) and Issey Miyake, both spectacular synthetic orientals for which I have found no peer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunrise, and Frank Olivier in general, is a rising star.</li>
            <li>This is a fresh and clean smelling scent.</li>
            <li>with a fresh, clean scent.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m In love with this scent from the first time I smelt it on my man on our first date.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended and Woman love the smell.</li>
            <li>It smells good but not for long.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite new scents.  </li>
            <li>Purchased for my 28 yo son who absolutely loves this fragrance!!  </li>
            <li>I love all of Franck Olivier&#x27;s colognes because they are very high quality, yet very affordable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The benchmark for Sunrise is Terre d&#x27;Hermes, and I have just spent a good amount of time searching for my bottle of Terre d&#x27;Hermes in my collection</li>
            <li>is, this fragrance is a spectacular accomplishment, and for the price, doubly so.</li>
            <li>Terre d&#x27;Hermes has a pronounced cedar, moss in addition to the &#x27;warm citrus&#x27; basenote that is not present in Sunrise.</li>
            <li>I would put it in the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; category, but you won&#x27;t smell like fresh laundry.</li>
            <li>Great scent strong and long lasting.</li>
            <li>All very positive.</li>
            <li>If you want something that last much much longer and is more bold and unique I&#x27;d recommend going for Sun Java.</li>
            <li>: I still would recommend this to those on a budget, but if you&#x27;re able to pay a little more you should go with Mont Blanc Legend instead.</li>
            <li>I previously purchased the Sun Java EDT from Franck Olivier and absolutely loved it, so I thought I would give this a try.</li>
            <li>very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>and you will thank me later do your love life</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had numerous compliments on many occasions by both women and men.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost 100% sure this is the same fragrance as the &amp;#34;Legend Eau De Toilette Spray Men by Mont Blanc&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not overpowering like some of those muskier, more traditional colognes.</li>
            <li>I found that this product doesn&#x27;t last more then three hours on my skin but fairs well on my clothes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottle will last 8 months+ for most.</li>
            <li>but it certainly doesn&#x27;t smell better than Blue Touch.</li>
            <li>Sunrise is a little lighter, brighter, more accessible, and although it does contain a very subtle, pleasant but synthetic wood note, it is not the same warm, earthy, wood-forward note as Terre d&#x27;Hermes.</li>
            <li>Sunrise is a little lighter, brighter, more accessible, and although it does contain a very subtle, pleasant but synthetic wood note, it is not the same warm, earthy, wood-forward note as Terre d&#x27;Hermes.</li>
            <li>fragrance is not good, but great.</li>
            <li>As others have stated, this pretty much is Fierce.</li>
            <li>If another of these (i.e., Sun Java) ends up being as stellar as this, I&#x27;d say, Frank Olivier will be a bar-none exotic, quality fragrance that knocks every other parfumeur out of the ballpark in value-for-money.</li>
            <li>It comes very highly recommended by me.</li>
            <li>I own both, the Sunrise is little cheaper</li>
            <li>This cologne smells very \\&quot;sharp\\&quot; in comparison to Legend (if that makes any sense), so it can get a bit cloying.</li>
            <li>This seems to capture both fragrances at a very competitive price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much sharper, but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very masucline and smell like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>this is an absolute steal.</li>
            <li>It really does smell like Fierce by Abocrombie &amp; Fitch.</li>
            <li>really loves it,</li>
            <li>blank legend smells kind of similar</li>
            <li>This is my secret weapon such a good smell women love it and always ask what I ware I do not tell though.</li>
            <li>Despite the incorrect comparison I made originally, because of the quality, longevity, uniqueness of this scent, and factoring in the value at its price point, the 5-star rating stands.t is not present in Sunrise.</li>
            <li>I would go for this one again if I dont get my any other favorite brands</li>
            <li>It has nice smell but not that long lasting one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not horrible, just very average (in my opinion), so I will use it from time to time, but certainly won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li>Main difference is that this is at the fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>you run out of your favorite more expensive cologne.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly how to describe it other than to say it&#x27;s very crisp and</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a new cologne, this is it.</li>
            <li>Though people who use cologne tend to spray too much, one is enough, two at most if you&#x27;re spraying directly on a  cotton swab to spread to other parts of the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cologne smells absolutely amazing, and the price is ridiculous.</li>
            <li>I like it, not sure yet if I love it.</li>
            <li>I first smelled this cologne on a friends boyfriend, and I could not get enough!!</li>
            <li>They are pretty different.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Umm im pretty sure ive found the secret weapon in attracting girls and its with this cologne.</li>
            <li>Completely unsatisfied.</li>
            <li>I despise cloying fragrances, especially artificial ones, cheap, synthetic \\&quot;woods and spices\\&quot; types (astringent old-man smells), and many \\&quot;red\\&quot; fragrances for lack of a better term, based on cinnamon, cardamom, amber.</li>
            <li>Totally unexpected and absolutely surprised.</li>
            <li>Wow Frank Olivier knows what he&#x27;s doing.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is cool and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Not easy to find and no one will have the same light but masculine scent</li>
            <li>After an hour, it&#x27;s still present in open air and a gentle breeze.</li>
            <li>My collection is considerable, numbering in &#x27;several hundreds&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Opinions on products like this are extremely subjective, as we all have different tastes, but for me, this is just OK, and not a patch on Sun Java, or some of my other favourite EDT&#x27;s such as Bulgari or Issey</li>
            <li>My initial response wasn&#x27;t the wow factor like I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;everyone&#x27;s tastes are different though, so if you want a really masculine cologne then get something</li>
            <li>I read somewhere that this was comparable to Abercrombie Fierce and decided to give it a shot - its pretty much dead on.</li>
            <li>Black Touch was an absolute home-run for me, a top-25 fragrance.</li>

            <li> Love this brand of Cologne</li>
            <li> Most anyone will enjoy it - be it males or females.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fresh and a nice smell to start a day.....</li>
            <li> For one who wants to smell unique and spectacular, you can hardly do better, and you can NOT do better for the price.</li>
            <li> This wonderful fragrance comes INCREDIBLY highly recommended from an experienced amateur fragrance enthusiast.</li>
            <li> Amazing and smells exactly like the Ambercrombie and Fitch Stores.</li>
            <li> It is a lovely chypre-and-citrus, with florals in the background, a bold one, wood forward...</li>
            <li> for everyday use, its perfect.  </li>
            <li> light-</li>
            <li> Really enjoy the cologne.</li>
            <li> Fantastic cologne.</li>
            <li> I received this in the original packaging and can confirm it&#x27;s genuine after it lasted all day.</li>
            <li> I thought, surely I&#x27;ve accidentally hit the apex of a line of average designer fragrances, an accidentally great one.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a Montale aoud accord which is unique in the industry</li>
            <li> Despite the incorrect comparison I made originally, because of the quality, longevity, uniqueness of this scent, and factoring in the value at its price point, the 5-star rating stands.</li>
            <li> If you are thinking of buying this purely on reviews I will note first that this is a very safe scent.</li>
            <li> It smells good but haven&#x27;t really gotten much compliments from the ladies.</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;m a middle-aged professional man, father, who enjoys a nice wardrobe, including fragrances.</li>
            <li> , it has a nice scent and comes in a beautiful bottle, the problem is that the scent lasts for only a few minutes at most</li>
            <li> Good back up alternative in case</li>
            <li> Sunrise is not bad for a cologne.</li>
            <li> It is a pleasant sent though and a little more on the safer side then Sun Java.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottle looks super cool.</li>
            <li> I have given this 5 stars... against Amouage, Montale, Serge Lutens, L&#x27;Artisan Parfumeur, Le Labo, and my absolute favorite oriental design house fragrances, Fujiyama (by Succes de Paris) and Issey Miyake, both spectacular synthetic orientals for which I have found no peer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunrise, and Frank Olivier in general, is a rising star.</li>
            <li> This is a fresh and clean smelling scent.</li>
            <li> with a fresh, clean scent.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m In love with this scent from the first time I smelt it on my man on our first date.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended and Woman love the smell.</li>
            <li> It smells good but not for long.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite new scents.  </li>
            <li> Purchased for my 28 yo son who absolutely loves this fragrance!!  </li>
            <li> I love all of Franck Olivier&#x27;s colognes because they are very high quality, yet very affordable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The benchmark for Sunrise is Terre d&#x27;Hermes, and I have just spent a good amount of time searching for my bottle of Terre d&#x27;Hermes in my collection</li>
            <li> is, this fragrance is a spectacular accomplishment, and for the price, doubly so.</li>
            <li> Terre d&#x27;Hermes has a pronounced cedar, moss in addition to the &#x27;warm citrus&#x27; basenote that is not present in Sunrise.</li>
            <li> I would put it in the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; category, but you won&#x27;t smell like fresh laundry.</li>
            <li> Great scent strong and long lasting.</li>
            <li> All very positive.</li>
            <li> If you want something that last much much longer and is more bold and unique I&#x27;d recommend going for Sun Java.</li>
            <li> : I still would recommend this to those on a budget, but if you&#x27;re able to pay a little more you should go with Mont Blanc Legend instead.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased the Sun Java EDT from Franck Olivier and absolutely loved it, so I thought I would give this a try.</li>
            <li> very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> and you will thank me later do your love life</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had numerous compliments on many occasions by both women and men.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 100% sure this is the same fragrance as the &amp;#34;Legend Eau De Toilette Spray Men by Mont Blanc&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not overpowering like some of those muskier, more traditional colognes.</li>
            <li> I found that this product doesn&#x27;t last more then three hours on my skin but fairs well on my clothes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottle will last 8 months+ for most.</li>
            <li> but it certainly doesn&#x27;t smell better than Blue Touch.</li>
            <li> Sunrise is a little lighter, brighter, more accessible, and although it does contain a very subtle, pleasant but synthetic wood note, it is not the same warm, earthy, wood-forward note as Terre d&#x27;Hermes.</li>
            <li> Sunrise is a little lighter, brighter, more accessible, and although it does contain a very subtle, pleasant but synthetic wood note, it is not the same warm, earthy, wood-forward note as Terre d&#x27;Hermes.</li>
            <li> fragrance is not good, but great.</li>
            <li> As others have stated, this pretty much is Fierce.</li>
            <li> If another of these (i.e., Sun Java) ends up being as stellar as this, I&#x27;d say, Frank Olivier will be a bar-none exotic, quality fragrance that knocks every other parfumeur out of the ballpark in value-for-money.</li>
            <li> It comes very highly recommended by me.</li>
            <li> I own both, the Sunrise is little cheaper</li>
            <li> This cologne smells very \\&quot;sharp\\&quot; in comparison to Legend (if that makes any sense), so it can get a bit cloying.</li>
            <li> This seems to capture both fragrances at a very competitive price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much sharper, but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very masucline and smell like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> this is an absolute steal.</li>
            <li> It really does smell like Fierce by Abocrombie &amp; Fitch.</li>
            <li> really loves it,</li>
            <li> blank legend smells kind of similar</li>
            <li> This is my secret weapon such a good smell women love it and always ask what I ware I do not tell though.</li>
            <li> Despite the incorrect comparison I made originally, because of the quality, longevity, uniqueness of this scent, and factoring in the value at its price point, the 5-star rating stands.t is not present in Sunrise.</li>
            <li> I would go for this one again if I dont get my any other favorite brands</li>
            <li> It has nice smell but not that long lasting one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not horrible, just very average (in my opinion), so I will use it from time to time, but certainly won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Main difference is that this is at the fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> you run out of your favorite more expensive cologne.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly how to describe it other than to say it&#x27;s very crisp and</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a new cologne, this is it.</li>
            <li> Though people who use cologne tend to spray too much, one is enough, two at most if you&#x27;re spraying directly on a  cotton swab to spread to other parts of the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cologne smells absolutely amazing, and the price is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I like it, not sure yet if I love it.</li>
            <li> I first smelled this cologne on a friends boyfriend, and I could not get enough!!</li>
            <li> They are pretty different.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Umm im pretty sure ive found the secret weapon in attracting girls and its with this cologne.</li>
            <li> Completely unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> I despise cloying fragrances, especially artificial ones, cheap, synthetic \\&quot;woods and spices\\&quot; types (astringent old-man smells), and many \\&quot;red\\&quot; fragrances for lack of a better term, based on cinnamon, cardamom, amber.</li>
            <li> Totally unexpected and absolutely surprised.</li>
            <li> Wow Frank Olivier knows what he&#x27;s doing.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is cool and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Not easy to find and no one will have the same light but masculine scent</li>
            <li> After an hour, it&#x27;s still present in open air and a gentle breeze.</li>
            <li> My collection is considerable, numbering in &#x27;several hundreds&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Opinions on products like this are extremely subjective, as we all have different tastes, but for me, this is just OK, and not a patch on Sun Java, or some of my other favourite EDT&#x27;s such as Bulgari or Issey</li>
            <li> My initial response wasn&#x27;t the wow factor like I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;everyone&#x27;s tastes are different though, so if you want a really masculine cologne then get something</li>
            <li> I read somewhere that this was comparable to Abercrombie Fierce and decided to give it a shot - its pretty much dead on.</li>
            <li> Black Touch was an absolute home-run for me, a top-25 fragrance.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is simple, yet long lasting&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.....</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re paying for quality here as this aroma will be on you all day long.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time on my skin.</li>
            <li> Lasts long, get lots of complements.</li>
            <li> This is the only cologne I have worn for roughly a year</li>
            <li> A single parfumeur or designer does not get 5 stars twice in a row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunrise</li>
            <li> is an unbelievable, unexpected, knocking-the-ball-out-of-the-ballpark home run fragrance.</li>
            <li> I might buy a few additional bottles and stock up in case the price goes up in the future!</li>
            <li> one wrist vs. the other, and revise my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like like needles in your nose sharp.</li>
            <li> holy COW!</li>
            <li> This cologne lasts about 6 hours in a typical work environment just by spraying it on your body.</li>
            <li> At less than half the price of Fierce per oz</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I sprayed it on, waited a few moments, and thought...</li>
            <li> And when I say heavy</li>
            <li> If you are like me, and do not like Fierce from Abercrombie and find Legend not interesting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about this fragrance .</li>
            <li> I mean really heavy.</li>
            <li> I will say that compared to the Gucci guilty and Giorgio Armani that I wear, I would choose sunrise over and over again, it last longer and people keep asking which cologne is that, you can&#x27;t do wrong with it</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> and I have absolutely failed to find it.</li>
            <li> I was always thinking about getting Fierce from A&amp;F and this was recommended by someone on random fragrance website.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>

            <li> Great scent strong and long lasting. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Completely unsatisfied. Was guaranteed this order 2 days ago, and now it is going to be 4-6 days out after Christmas, which it was a gift for. Now I&#x27;m not going to have a gift for my own father! Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Great product, great price</li>
            <li> Okay you&#x27;re probably  here because you heard this smells like fierce. Well it does,it is identical. There is 0 difference. Same silage,projection.mont blank legend smells kind of similar but this is fierce. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> It smells good but not for long. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Umm im pretty sure ive found the secret weapon in attracting girls and its with this cologne. Its amazing i wore it to work and never got this many compliments ever!!! Im still in shock. Order this and you will thank me later do your love life a favor lol</li>
            <li> I like it, not sure yet if I love it. I have to wait until my husband actually wears it.</li>
            <li> I got this cologne by chance and boy what a buy!!!. The fragrance is cool and long lasting.Try and see amazing stuff, wonder why I havent had of it before???.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and smells awesome!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite new scents.  After the mall kiosk tried to sell the bottle to me for $65, I went online to see if I could find a better deal.  The Amazon vendor was not only over 60% cheaper, but the unit arrived within two days.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and it Smells great! I love when my boyfriend wears his Frank cologne.</li>
            <li> I first smelled this cologne on a friends boyfriend, and I could not get enough!! This cologne smells absolutely amazing, and the price is ridiculous. I bought this for my husband and can&#x27;t wait to give it to him. If you are looking for a new cologne, this is it.</li>
            <li> Sunrise from Frank Olivier is definitely my favorite cologne to date. I&#x27;ve had numerous compliments on many occasions by both women and men. You&#x27;re paying for quality here as this aroma will be on you all day long. This one is definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li> Item arrived in a very timely manner and was a great price too.</li>
            <li> A brief blurb to place my fragrance sensibilities: I&#x27;m a middle-aged professional man, father, who enjoys a nice wardrobe, including fragrances. My collection is considerable, numbering in &#x27;several hundreds&#x27;. I enjoy anything that is well put together, smells pleasant, and has acceptable longevity. I despise cloying fragrances, especially artificial ones, cheap, synthetic \\&quot;woods and spices\\&quot; types (astringent old-man smells), and many \\&quot;red\\&quot; fragrances for lack of a better term, based on cinnamon, cardamom, amber. Things often called \\&quot;Desire\\&quot; or \\&quot;Night\\&quot;. I love aquas, chypres, florals, fougeres, oudhs, attars, orientals. Good ones anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance is not good, but great. I sprayed it on, waited a few moments, and thought... holy COW! This is SPECTACULAR! And this is 2 for 2 for Frank Olivier. Black Touch was an absolute home-run for me, a top-25 fragrance. I thought, surely I&#x27;ve accidentally hit the apex of a line of average designer fragrances, an accidentally great one. I had bought 2 or 3 (including Sunrise and Sun Java, which I haven&#x27;t tried yet) and thought - downhill from here. Surely. A single parfumeur or designer does not get 5 stars twice in a row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunrise is an unbelievable, unexpected, knocking-the-ball-out-of-the-ballpark home run fragrance. Totally unexpected and absolutely surprised. Every time I get a drift of the fragrance I think - you&#x27;re kidding - I had no idea, no expectation, and at THIS PRICE? Frank Olivier is skyrocketing to the top of my list of favorite fragrance makers. If another of these (i.e., Sun Java) ends up being as stellar as this, I&#x27;d say, Frank Olivier will be a bar-none exotic, quality fragrance that knocks every other parfumeur out of the ballpark in value-for-money. It doesn&#x27;t have a Montale aoud accord which is unique in the industry but it smells, simply put, spectacular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benchmark for Sunrise is Terre d&#x27;Hermes, and I have just spent a good amount of time searching for my bottle of Terre d&#x27;Hermes in my collection and I have absolutely failed to find it. If I do, I will do a side-by-side comparison, one wrist vs. the other, and revise my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As is, this fragrance is a spectacular accomplishment, and for the price, doubly so. It is a lovely chypre-and-citrus, with florals in the background, a bold one, wood forward... it is truly delightful. After an hour, it&#x27;s still present in open air and a gentle breeze. If this bottle cost $50 I might be lukewarm but at its price point I cannot possibly compliment it enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My rating system is that 3 stars is \\&quot;good, but will not be replaced when used up\\&quot;. 4 stars is \\&quot;extremely good and will be replaced when used up\\&quot;. 5 stars is \\&quot;top-25 ever\\&quot; out of a wardrobe numbering somewhere above 400, maybe 500 fragrances, in addition to all others tested. I have given this 5 stars... against Amouage, Montale, Serge Lutens, L&#x27;Artisan Parfumeur, Le Labo, and my absolute favorite oriental design house fragrances, Fujiyama (by Succes de Paris) and Issey Miyake, both spectacular synthetic orientals for which I have found no peer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunrise, and Frank Olivier in general, is a rising star. For one who wants to smell unique and spectacular, you can hardly do better, and you can NOT do better for the price. This is an intelligently designed, high-quality, impeccably delightful fragrance whose peers cost three to five times as much. I am totally tickled about this. When I sprayed it on, I thought, surely it can&#x27;t be THAT good? Then after 5, 10 minutes - after an hour - after two - it is. It IS! This wonderful fragrance comes INCREDIBLY highly recommended from an experienced amateur fragrance enthusiast. You must have this in your collection!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---- updated:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find my bottle of Terre d&#x27;Hermes today and did a side-by-side comparison. I withdraw the comparison. They are pretty different. Terre d&#x27;Hermes has a pronounced cedar, moss in addition to the &#x27;warm citrus&#x27; basenote that is not present in Sunrise. Sunrise is a little lighter, brighter, more accessible, and although it does contain a very subtle, pleasant but synthetic wood note, it is not the same warm, earthy, wood-forward note as Terre d&#x27;Hermes. They are both still excellent fragrances. Sunrise is prominently floral, where Terre d&#x27;Hermes is not at all floral. Despite the incorrect comparison I made originally, because of the quality, longevity, uniqueness of this scent, and factoring in the value at its price point, the 5-star rating stands.t is not present in Sunrise. Sunrise is a little lighter, brighter, more accessible, and although it does contain a very subtle, pleasant but synthetic wood note, it is not the same warm, earthy, wood-forward note as Terre d&#x27;Hermes.

Despite the incorrect comparison I made originally, because of the quality, longevity, uniqueness of this scent, and factoring in the value at its price point, the 5-star rating stands.</li>
            <li> This is a fresh and clean smelling scent. It lasts a long time on my skin. I love all of Franck Olivier&#x27;s colognes because they are very high quality, yet very affordable. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 100% sure this is the same fragrance as the &amp;#34;Legend Eau De Toilette Spray Men by Mont Blanc&amp;#34;. I own both, the Sunrise is little cheaper (75ml vs. 50ml). Very nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> As others have stated, this pretty much is Fierce. So if you like that, you&#x27;ll like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I still would recommend this to those on a budget, but if you&#x27;re able to pay a little more you should go with Mont Blanc Legend instead. It smells almost identical to Sunrise and Fierce. This cologne smells very \\&quot;sharp\\&quot; in comparison to Legend (if that makes any sense), so it can get a bit cloying. If you decide to go with Sunrise, go easy on the sprays!</li>
            <li> It had really good reviews so I decided to order it for my husband, it has a nice scent and comes in a beautiful bottle, the problem is that the scent lasts for only a few minutes at most</li>
            <li> The fragrance is simple, yet long lasting&lt;br /&gt;Not over powering and cost a fraction of the price it would have if I got it at a local store.&lt;br /&gt;I get a lot of compliments</li>
            <li> What can I say, it is execellent. Best value for the money. Lasts long, get lots of complements. you gotta try it.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Quick shipping. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne. Nice top notes of lavendar and begamot? with a fresh, clean scent. I have purchased this product elsewhere and paid triple the price. I would recommend Franck Oliver&#x27;s Sunrise as a nice, every day, day time fragrance.</li>
            <li> Sunrise is not bad for a cologne. It&#x27;s a lot better than others II have used but it certainly doesn&#x27;t smell better than Blue Touch.</li>
            <li> my husband like this product.  very reasonable price.  for everyday use, its perfect.  hope the price stays the same for the future purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Wow! I just have to keep spraying myself with this all the time because it is soo good! This cologne lasts about 6 hours in a typical work environment just by spraying it on your body. If you spray it on your clothes it will last for days. Wow Frank Olivier knows what he&#x27;s doing. Guys, this is a must have in your cologne collection. It works great and EXPECT to get compliments if you go out - It WILL happen! Keep smelling great!</li>
            <li> My Husband loves this fragrance,  this is a repeat purchase,  will buy again for sure, can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> If you are like me, and do not like Fierce from Abercrombie and find Legend not interesting. This seems to capture both fragrances at a very competitive price.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased the Sun Java EDT from Franck Olivier and absolutely loved it, so I thought I would give this a try. Opinions on products like this are extremely subjective, as we all have different tastes, but for me, this is just OK, and not a patch on Sun Java, or some of my other favourite EDT&#x27;s such as Bulgari or Issey Miyake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not horrible, just very average (in my opinion), so I will use it from time to time, but certainly won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Last longer and smells the same as the abercrombie cologne</li>
            <li> It has nice smell but not that long lasting one. I would go for this one again if I dont get my any other favorite brands</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 28 yo son who absolutely loves this fragrance!!  Must buy!</li>
            <li> People compliment how I smell all the time when I&#x27;m wearing sunrise. I don&#x27;t know exactly how to describe it other than to say it&#x27;s very crisp and light- it&#x27;s not overpowering like some of those muskier, more traditional colognes. Definitely recommend. This is also about 60 bucks cheaper than what it retails for in brick &amp; mortar, so jump on it!</li>
            <li> I was always thinking about getting Fierce from A&amp;F and this was recommended by someone on random fragrance website. This is for fraction of price of Fierce and I LOVE it. I do think its same. Cheers</li>
            <li> Really enjoy the cologne. My brother and his girlfriend kept saying I am using Abercrombie cologne, I have no idea what that smells like, but they loved it and so do I.  So I guess that is the best comparison.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews on this and on Sun Java and figured I&#x27;d give them a shot. I found that this product doesn&#x27;t last more then three hours on my skin but fairs well on my clothes. My initial response wasn&#x27;t the wow factor like I was hoping for. It is a pleasant sent though and a little more on the safer side then Sun Java. If you want something that last much much longer and is more bold and unique I&#x27;d recommend going for Sun Java.</li>
            <li> Have received numerous comments on this scent. All very positive. If you are thinking of buying this purely on reviews I will note first that this is a very safe scent. Most anyone will enjoy it - be it males or females. Definetely not a sweet/warm or musky smell. I would put it in the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; category, but you won&#x27;t smell like fresh laundry. It&#x27;s much sharper, but like like needles in your nose sharp. This is the only cologne I have worn for roughly a year and I have smelled many many many collognes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottle will last 8 months+ for most. Very potent. Two/three sprays will keep you smelling like a million bucks all day. Furthermore, smelling good for 6-8 months for $20 is a no brainer IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottle looks super cool. I don&#x27;t mind leaving it out in my room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Will not seduce women all on its own.</li>
            <li> I receive compliments on the Sunrise Cologne and have ordered it again and am pleased with the service and price. Great Cologne!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about this fragrance . It smells good but haven&#x27;t really gotten much compliments from the ladies. I guess It&#x27;s ok for the price.</li>
            <li> the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.....but I like the smell...it&#x27;s fresh and a nice smell to start a day..... i would recommend to others..</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves it. I get a lot of compliments!</li>
            <li> I bought this several years ago at one of those kiosks in the mall in Pittsburgh. I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in my city so I looked online and found it here. It&#x27;s very masucline and smell like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever tried. Everyone loves the way it smells. I always get &amp;#34;what is that&amp;#34; from everyone that smells it on me.</li>
            <li> Found it at an outlet it&#x27;s everything I thought it would be</li>
            <li> This cologne is great; the women love it.  I always get compliments or inquiries. Great brand and price, as well as quality.</li>
            <li> Fantastic cologne. I read somewhere that this was comparable to Abercrombie Fierce and decided to give it a shot - its pretty much dead on. At less than half the price of Fierce per oz this is an absolute steal. I might buy a few additional bottles and stock up in case the price goes up in the future!</li>
            <li> This product is regularly mistaken for Abercrombie &amp; Fitch&#x27;s &amp;#34;Fierce&amp;#34; cologne. I think it has more of a grown-up smell, but that is my opinion.</li>
            <li> I Get More Comments About this Cologne than others costing 3x the price  LOVE It</li>
            <li> Amazing and smells exactly like the Ambercrombie and Fitch Stores. Highly Recommended and Woman love the smell. Best value for my favorite cologne of alltime</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m In love with this scent from the first time I smelt it on my man on our first date. I bought it for him on Christmas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truely a favorite of mine. It really does smell like Fierce by Abocrombie &amp; Fitch. It comes very highly recommended by me.</li>
            <li> I will say that compared to the Gucci guilty and Giorgio Armani that I wear, I would choose sunrise over and over again, it last longer and people keep asking which cologne is that, you can&#x27;t do wrong with it</li>
            <li> This smells just like the Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Stores. Main difference is that this is at the fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> LOVE this smell for my Hubby.. and everyone compliments him on it!</li>
            <li> Good back up alternative in case you run out of your favorite more expensive cologne.</li>
            <li> All great, but the price needs to stop rising! Delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> This smells similar to fierce but with a heavier spice note. And when I say heavy I mean really heavy. The scent does not change at all. I got no compliments. For Longevity I got 5 hours and projection was 1 hour.  I gave this away.</li>
            <li> very nice... more for evening</li>
            <li> Girlfriend likes it but says it does not smell like aeropostale fierce but she says it still smells very good to her.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. Smelled this fragrance in  group setting, and sniffed my way to the source!  Had never heard of Sunrise, but am now enjoying it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this fragrance and my woman......really loves it,</li>
            <li> Smell like another that i got,really no surprise to me this cologne!!</li>
            <li> Love this brand of Cologne</li>
            <li> Not easy to find and no one will have the same light but masculine scent</li>
            <li> I received this in the original packaging and can confirm it&#x27;s genuine after it lasted all day. Scents great and not overpowering. Though people who use cologne tend to spray too much, one is enough, two at most if you&#x27;re spraying directly on a  cotton swab to spread to other parts of the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;everyone&#x27;s tastes are different though, so if you want a really masculine cologne then get something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great price for a great cologne.</li>
            <li> This is my secret weapon such a good smell women love it and always ask what I ware I do not tell though. I switch between this and Swiss Army Cologne. both of them smell really good and both of them get a lot of compliments</li>
