            <li>I use with my Clarisonic and my skin looks amazing ....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s designed for use in the morning and at night, and is very gentle, yet does a great job exfoliating.</li>
            <li>STILL LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>Guess I have to give it more time.</li>
            <li>Used another brand of exfoliating cleanser (prescription brand product) for many years.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>We were so pleased to find that Amazon carries this product line.</li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d check around for a better price and found it here.  </li>
            <li>Just like the identical product I purchased from my dermotologist &amp; this product from Amazon was much more afforrable.</li>
            <li>outstanding customer service</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of the scent, but it works great, I will use for ever, and I wish everyone could try it!</li>
            <li>but it seems to be pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Great wash, leaves face soft.</li>
            <li>Great on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have rosacea and this is the best (by far) cleanser that I have found that is gentle on my rosacea but yet truly cleanses my face and helps keep breakouts to a minimum and fights the aging process.</li>
            <li>Seems to be far superior to most products of this type.</li>
            <li>This product is STRONG - used it 2 nights in a row and my skin was cracked and flaking.  </li>
            <li>Super!</li>
            <li>Great product that I have used since last year.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and silky afterward.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very mild for the skin and leaves a clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>Gentle and effective.</li>

            <li>I first bought it from a Spa where I had some facial treatments and loved it.  </li>
            <li>It is very gentle on the skin and does an excellent job of gentle exfoliation without being harsh or abrasive.  </li>
            <li>This a clear jell that is gentle and nice, but not quite what I thought I was buying.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>I am truly enjoying this skin cleanser, it is working wonders and helping to clear my skin.</li>
            <li>Anyways, it greatly reduces my facial blemishes but it hasn&#x27;t totally eliminated them.</li>
            <li>This cleanser exfoliates and leaves my face clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle &amp; will be buying more.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who has mild acne and who has sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>It cleans, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s doing any more.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin soft and tightens it up!  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin so soft!</li>
            <li>A medium consistency clear gel.</li>
            <li>This cleanser leaves my face feeling soft and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>I am in my early 40&#x27;s and still struggle with oily skin, clogged pores and breakouts.  </li>

            <li> I Kept it anyway since it was the plain cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this, but for the price I&#x27;m not sure I will buy again.</li>
            <li> You put a small amount in your hand, moisten it and rub it in circles into the skin.</li>
            <li> Cleared up my small bouts of acne.  </li>
            <li> Much better than using stuff with  microbeads which are terrible for the environment !!!  </li>
            <li> Too late to return it, so I&#x27;ll give it a try as a once-weekly product.  </li>
            <li> no more!  </li>
            <li> so it was just selecting the wrong product to ship.</li>
            <li> You simply can&#x27;t go wrong with this brand.</li>
            <li> Expensive.</li>

My skin feels smooth and silky afterward.  I have acne rosacea and would highly recommend this product to anyone with hypersensitive, red toned skin.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this by my anesthetist.  It was sold in the spa for twice the amount here on amazon so I am great to have looked around before purchasing it first.&lt;br /&gt;It is very mild for the skin and leaves a clean feeling.  My face is much clearer and feels a lot cleaner when using this product.  I recommend this to anyone who has mild acne and who has sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I STILL LOVE THIS PRODUCT BUT IT HAS GONE UP SEVEN DOLLARS SINCE I LAST PURCHASED IT A FEW MONTHS AGO</li>
            <li> Can dry out skin, becareful if your sensitive.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it that often but it seems to be pretty good.  Guess I have to give it more time.</li>

            <li> thecleanser I ordered was incorrect .  I Kept it anyway since it was the plain cleanser.  If this happens again I will return it for the exfoliating cleanser.  so it was just selecting the wrong product to ship.</li>
            <li> Our dermatologist recommended this product and it works perfectly in removing blackheads. We were so pleased to find that Amazon carries this product line. It has also made my skin softer and has shrunk my pores. It is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I expected this product to have scrubbing granules. it does not. You put a small amount in your hand, moisten it and rub it in circles into the skin. Seems to do the job of exfoliating.</li>

            <li> I used this product for a while now. Seems to be far superior to most products of this type.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Makes your skin soft and tightens it up!  I first bought it from a Spa where I had some facial treatments and loved it.  Thought I&#x27;d check around for a better price and found it here.  It can burn a little if your skin is not use to it but that subsides after a few treatments.

            <li> I have been using this product for years now . My doctor of 13 years whom I highly trust recommended. Great product</li>
            <li> My wife uses this cleanser on a daily basis. The Dermatologist sells it for $36 so Amazon&#x27;s $20-$21 is a relative bargain, especially with Prime shipping. Anyways, it greatly reduces my facial blemishes but it hasn&#x27;t totally eliminated them. I&#x27;ve had no problem with burning or skin dryness.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser.  It cleans my face very well and I do not have trouble with the pores filling up</li>

            <li> Great product.  I use it every evening and will continue ordering it.</li>
            <li> Purchased was shipped quickly and its a great product, and half the price you pay in a med-spa or doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of the Neocutis products and this one is at the same level of effectiveness as all of their products. A bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I just started to used this product and when I use it -it make my skin feel so clean-it is not harsh on your face-and it help hears acne scars as well..</li>

            <li> I use with my Clarisonic and my skin looks amazing ....I&#x27;m 62 and sometimes got tiny cysts......no more!  Much better than using stuff with  microbeads which are terrible for the environment !!!  An aesthetician recommended this along with the Claisonic.  She was right!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to my by my dermatologist and I now use it all the time.  Great on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product and especially love that I can get it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like it.  I have never tried it before, but&lt;br /&gt;have tried other Neocutis products.&lt;br /&gt;No problems with my order.</li>
