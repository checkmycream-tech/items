            <li> I wanted one that got really hot because my hair is hard to shape with heat and one with curved edges</li>
            <li> &amp; I can flat iron my hair in an hour.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this flat iron to anyone.</li>
            <li> I think that someone with thicker hair might find that it takes a long time to straighten.</li>
            <li> long hair time consumption is everything</li>
            <li> -- it has actually melted other items it comes into contact with.</li>
            <li> it cut down on how long it took big time!</li>
            <li> This iron does not feel smooth to the cold touch.  </li>
            <li> u have to b careful</li>
            <li> when using it; i had 2 heat resistant mats underneath it &amp; careful not to touch except the tip to guide while styling.</li>
            <li> Performance is as expected.</li>
            <li> The curved edge does allow me to flip my hair in a little easier than my other flat irons.</li>
            <li> Other reviews note there is a gap between the plates.  </li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t have to change the voltage on the iron like some other dual voltage appliances require.  </li>
            <li> just had to be careful handling &amp; setting it down on silicone mat.</li>
            <li> seemed weird to not have a grounded plug, and I wasn&#x27;t entirely certain</li>
            <li> it cuts off after an hour and has a swivel cord and has an adjustable heat setting...features which are difficult to find all in one iron of this size for a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Luckily, I have extremely thick hair and can afford to lose 20-30 extra hairs every couple of weeks, which is as often as I straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> Just hope it holds up in the years down the road.</li>
            <li> It burned my hair pretty badly with this flat iron...</li>
            <li> The plates have a slight gap.</li>
            <li> The only con is that if you put a really thin strand of hair through the plates it might not do anything.</li>
            <li> the iron is on, it tugs on your hair as it&#x27;s not a smooth process swiping it through your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have found a flat iron that can straighten my thick &amp; curly hair!</li>
            <li> also has a pretty bad smell to it from the hair that gets caught in it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clamp very tightly.</li>
            <li> When I turn it on it usually hears up within 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li> and I like that it has slightly curved edges (very hard to find these days for some reason).</li>
            <li> the numbers are hard  for me to read.</li>
            <li> would not recommend this for anyone who has medium to thick hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and and would never have noticed the gap if I hadn&#x27;t looked for it.</li>
            <li> The one thing I hate is buying an expensive flat iron that does not live up to its guaranteed performance...</li>
            <li> I have thin hair but a lot of it</li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the high because I have very coarse hair and it works for me</li>
            <li> It burned my hair pretty badly with this flat iron...it left marks on the ceramic blades! And it took forever to reach the temperature I set on it. The light kept blinking and blinking. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be putting my hair through torture this product offers again.</li>
            <li> I got this because I had one similar to it before and I loved it. I wanted one that got really hot because my hair is hard to shape with heat and one with curved edges so I could flip it under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets plenty hot but it doesn&#x27;t clamp down tight enough on my hair to have much effect at all. My hair is not thin at all. I have lots of hair but it is baby fine. Now it&#x27;s sitting in the bathroom closet collecting dust. Maybe I&#x27;ll give it to my niece.</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron!  I have stubborn fine hair and this flat iron is amazing.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clamp very tightly. Disappointed</li>
            <li> I bought this while away in vacation and I forgot mine at home. I absolutely love it. Gives me the body and the bend that I seem to alway struggle with at home with my old flat iron. I aways had the lines in my bend. This has the prefect cure, heat, and doesn&#x27;t snag or pull out my hair! Great product!</li>
            <li> The curved edge gives you smooth hair with no ridges whether you are going straight or making curls with this flat iron. The width is great and also means no hard edges. Heats up quickly and is a joy to use.</li>
            <li> The iron works okay and I like that it has slightly curved edges (very hard to find these days for some reason). But my biggest issue with it is that it does not stand up well on a counter -- it&#x27;s always falling over. This is a problem since it&#x27;s so hot -- it has actually melted other items it comes into contact with. If it stood up straight, this wouldn&#x27;t be an issue.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair silky and smooth. Bought it initially because it is dual voltage and I needed it for Europe. But this has now replaced my higher end flat iron. The rounded edges also facilitate in curling my hair with it. I love that I can flat iron my hair and curl it as well. It can get very hot so being able to lower the temp is a big plus so I don&#x27;t put such high heat on my hair. The only con is that if you put a really thin strand of hair through the plates it might not do anything.The plates have a slight gap. I have thin hair but a lot of it so it&#x27;s not a big problem for me. Great quality for the price!</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm. Just hope it holds up in the years down the road. I really like how I can curly and do flips with it.</li>
            <li> This heats very quickly. I have long hair and use the lowest heat setting, which is just right for not drying my hair too much. I get a smooth finish that has nice curve at the ends.</li>
            <li> I have fine long wavy hair and this flat iron works very well when I need to straighten it. I don&#x27;t like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have heat settings, however for my purposes it works fine. I think that someone with thicker hair might find that it takes a long time to straighten. The curved edge does allow me to flip my hair in a little easier than my other flat irons.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is easy to use, especially when trying to create spirals/ringlets on longer  hair. It gets hot quickly and maintains its temperature. I have kinky hair and it still gets it straight with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> seemed weird to not have a grounded plug, and I wasn&#x27;t entirely certain it truly was dual voltage except that the packaging said so.  I couldn&#x27;t find anything on the iron itself that said so.  But I took it to Europe and used it in the UK, Austria, Germany and The Netherlands and it worked every time.  Heated up quickly.</li>
            <li> This Andis 1 1/2&amp;#34; Flat Iron heats up quickly, but is a little too heavy for me.  It&#x27;s going back.</li>
            <li> Bought this last Christmas but just started using it 3 months ago, so of course there is no warranty or opportunity for return.&lt;br /&gt;The protective coating is already wearing off leaving my hair exposed to straight metal (and I don&#x27;t use chemicals in my hair)....there is a gap that makes it ineffective (as others have stated earlier)...and it often catches/pulls hair (ouch!). I DO NOT recommend this product and am searching for a replacement.</li>
            <li> the setting had it on low heat and it still got incredibly hot. also love the thickness of this iron, i have incredibly long hair and compared to my 1in it cut down on how long it took big time!</li>
            <li> This iron does not feel smooth to the cold touch.  Leading me to feel that the plates are not truly ceramic.&lt;br /&gt;Once the iron is on, it tugs on your hair as it&#x27;s not a smooth process swiping it through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;It also has a pretty bad smell to it from the hair that gets caught in it.&lt;br /&gt;I have very wavy hair and it does not work well on my hair.  I&#x27;ve had other flat irons that are true ceramic that glide easily across your hair that do a better job than this one.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this for anyone who has medium to thick hair.</li>
            <li> Worked for trip to greece, which is why i ordered it (Still have to have 2 prong adapter). Gets really hot u have to b careful when using it; i had 2 heat resistant mats underneath it &amp; careful not to touch except the tip to guide while styling. Very satisfied with performance for the price, didnt want to take an expensive tool overseas, this worked just fine just had to be careful handling &amp; setting it down on silicone mat.</li>
            <li> My daughter took them over seas and they are still her favorites.</li>
            <li> The one thing I hate is buying an expensive flat iron that does not live up to its guaranteed performance...FINALLY! I have found a flat iron that can straighten my thick &amp; curly hair! When I turn it on it usually hears up within 1-2 minutes. The best part I don&#x27;t even have to set the temp to the max, I usually put the dial in the middle &amp; I get my hair bone straight w/out having to flat iron it twice, with long hair time consumption is everything &amp; I can flat iron my hair in an hour. I also like how the plates are curved because I can put curls in my hair smoothly without any dents. I would recommend this flat iron to anyone.</li>
            <li> nice tool but a little on the heavy side and the numbers are hard  for me to read.</li>
            <li> I like the curved plates, but it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.  Purchased this to replace a hot tools iron with curved plates that has been discontinued.  It goes to 430 degrees and is much hotter than this one which states it gets to 450.  No way it gets that hot.  If you don&#x27;t need it to get that hot, this is great but if you have course hair like mine that requires high heat this will work but will take a lot longer.  Other reviews note there is a gap between the plates.  I can see it but it is not an issue.  My hair is thick and and would never have noticed the gap if I hadn&#x27;t looked for it.</li>
            <li> it heats up pretty quickly and one you get the hang of it it works magnificiently I purchased the 1.5 inch for my my hair it was just the right one.</li>
            <li> excellent product quality</li>
            <li> I purchased this before going on a trip to Croatia.  It worked flawlessly without a power converter there and it&#x27;s ready to go out of the box, I didn&#x27;t have to change the voltage on the iron like some other dual voltage appliances require.  I&#x27;m still using it at home in the U.S. and have no complaints at all.  Heats up quickly, and the curved edges are good for getting some volume near your roots.</li>
            <li> I was shopping for a curved iron, not just the curved edge, but this works for me.  It gets REALLY HOT, so beware!</li>
            <li> Performance is as expected. Would buy again. Good product</li>
            <li> Yeah.  I wanted to LOVE this flat iron, but don&#x27;t.  It pulls out my hair, and never heats up to the point where the flashing light becomes solid...until the 1-hour &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; period is over.  I do like that it cuts off after an hour and has a swivel cord and has an adjustable heat setting...features which are difficult to find all in one iron of this size for a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, I have extremely thick hair and can afford to lose 20-30 extra hairs every couple of weeks, which is as often as I straighten my hair.</li>
