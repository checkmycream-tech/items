            <li> She said that it will last her for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The colors in this make up kit are ugly colors that I am sure no one would wear.  </li>
            <li> they go on with a subtle, classy look.</li>
            <li> But this \\&quot;extreme black\\&quot; mascara made my deepset eyes \\&quot;pop\\&quot; and come to life.</li>
            <li> I ordered Estee Lauder 2013 Blockbuster Ultimate Color Makeup Gift Set and the product quality is really poor.</li>
            <li> both Lipsticks got broken within few days..</li>
            <li> They eyeliner gives a very thin sharp line that smudges if you wish.</li>
            <li> I could never wear black mascara in the past as it aged me terribly.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.</li>

            <li> Really love this set!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best collections in years! This is the 2013 collection not 2012 as it is listed here. Last years was pretty good but the Advanced Time Zone Night instead of brushes this year really added value. For those that do not know the value of the Time Zone, see your local Est√©e Lauder Consultant! Add Advanced Night Repair and say goodbye to your old skin!</li>
            <li> it was very nice , great value . just like the picture. brand new . i will do more business with you in future. thanks so much</li>
            <li> excellent 100% recommended</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Purchased for my daughter for Christmas. Nice selection of brushes as well as makeup colors.Handy bag for travel as well.  Estee Lauder as always, a great product!</li>
            <li> My mother was overwhelmed when this arrived and is still sifting through it to dress herself up.  Thank God she still cares.</li>
            <li> I got this collection quickly and wrapped nicely. Brand new condition. I would recommend this. I totally love mine, it has Estee Lauder quality and beautiful colors!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear much makeup, especially eye makeup. I could never wear black mascara in the past as it aged me terribly. But this \\&quot;extreme black\\&quot; mascara made my deepset eyes \\&quot;pop\\&quot; and come to life. Also, although the eye shadows look like strong color they go on with a subtle, classy look. Same with the lipsticks and lipgloss. They eyeliner gives a very thin sharp line that smudges if you wish. Overall I am extremely pleased with all the products, their beauty and classy look. Also love the cases that came with it! My husband got this as a Christmas gift and even my mother was amazed at what a good job he did with this.</li>
