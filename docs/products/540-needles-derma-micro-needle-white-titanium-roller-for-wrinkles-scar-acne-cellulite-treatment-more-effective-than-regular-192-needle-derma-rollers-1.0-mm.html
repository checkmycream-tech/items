            <li>a quality product with good construction and needle design.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s of good quality</li>
            <li>It has its own storage case which I like.  </li>
            <li>case it comes in is a nice molded plastic which fits the roller unit nicely.</li>
            <li>Hurts a bit but worth it!!!</li>
            <li>The product itself is in good condition and works fine.</li>
            <li>and it still looks good, and my face is not sagging any longer and that didn&#x27;t even take a full month.</li>
            <li>and then Roc wrinkle cream on top.</li>
            <li>I have ordered the 0.25 Derma Micro Needle now to see if it works any better than the 1.0.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t think this would hurt most people...</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m sure it would.</li>
            <li>I can tell that my skin products go deeper &amp; work better.  :)</li>
            <li>and then I began to feel it more.  </li>
            <li>Thus, I had this at the top of my Amazon wishlist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The case allows the roller to rest safely without putting pressure on any of the needles.</li>
            <li>I must say, I quite enjoyed the sensation.</li>
            <li>If this tool can help tighten my skin and even the tone, then I will be extremely satisfied for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It will take many months to see the results.  </li>
            <li>my right hand, it felt good as well.</li>
            <li>I found this on Amazon and the reviews were pretty good</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve got the chance to use it two times and I&#x27;ve seen some great results.</li>
            <li>I am not going to write a huge thing, get it if you want but after a week you will forget you have it and realize hurting your body doesn&#x27;t work unless you get it done by a pro.</li>
            <li>If however, you have sensitive skin, using this product with a numbing cream might be a good idea.</li>
            <li>but nothing significant</li>
            <li>It was nice and new</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I was satisfied with my rolling of both areas, I applied some pure coconut oil.</li>

            <li>I can honestly say that I was pleasantly surprised that I would even notice a change considering the price.</li>
            <li>As i said before it doesn&#x27;t hurt much to use it, mostly just afterward</li>
            <li>and it quickly fades.</li>
            <li>and I will say it burns a lot more on the back and hurts significantly more during use.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and was as ordered.  </li>
            <li>The only thing i don&#x27;t like about the product itself is that it squeaks when you roll it, otherwise it is fantastic!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t push super hard because I don&#x27;t want to injure myself, but I did apply a fair amount of pressure as I rolled, being sure to focus on problem spots.</li>
            <li>Specially when it&#x27;s going to be your first time</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>totally worth it</li>
            <li>I am excited about seeing better results in the future.  </li>
            <li>In the product&#x27;s defense, You need to use it consistently</li>
            <li>have just now used the product for the first time.</li>
            <li>I first cleansed both areas with a numbing antiseptic, cleaned the needles with isoproyl alcohol, and went to work.</li>
            <li>I bought this product a few days ago and got to use it twice, and so far I&#x27;ve seen some great results.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to someone who wants to try skin needling and will use it consistently.</li>
            <li>and it arrived after closing time the previous day meaning it had to wait overnight at the post office, so overall it was great timing.</li>
            <li>I really like this needler.  </li>
            <li>Really, almost painless.</li>
            <li>and I recommend for everyone to use it responsibly.</li>
            <li>Just make sure before using this product to read everything carefully and have any type of medication you want to apply to your face after use.</li>
            <li>So yeah I would really recommend this product - 5 stars.</li>
            <li>You really can hear your face popping when the needles go through the skin</li>
            <li>I hope this really works.  </li>
            <li>mind you but less prominent.  </li>
            <li>I dare not use it in my face, mainly to attempt get rid of cellulite on my thighs.</li>
            <li>I have watched many tutorials, reviews, and read countless websites varying from cosmetic hubs to fitness forums where various derma rollers have been praised by users.</li>
            <li>I have a high tolerance for pain</li>
            <li>I would no suggest using this every day, but I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The 540 needle derma roller I have used is better than any other by far.  </li>
            <li>I put too much pressure on it on my thighs and they were marked with lines for over a week.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s normal</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s normal</li>
            <li>Well I would really recommend this product to anyone, specially if you&#x27;re trying to get rid of acne scars or any other type of scars you might prob.</li>
            <li>Thus, I decided to give this a shot to see if it can help diminish the spots and that lumpy thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it only on my right hand and my forehead today.</li>
            <li>At first your face would get really red depending on the amount of pressure you put, but after you get use to it your face wont be as red as the first time.</li>
            <li>I also have a small mass of cells that have built up on themselves on the top of my forehead.</li>
            <li>It came in a box, inside a sturdy, clear plastic storage case.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this feels but don&#x27;t use it often enough to see how well it works.  </li>
            <li>was a natural way to help with wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It works for 35 year old smokers wrinkles.</li>
            <li>and I check the needles after every use, so far used it 15 times</li>
            <li>It seemed to dull pretty quickly</li>
            <li>On one hand it seems crazy but on the other hand it makes perfect sense.</li>
            <li>When I first used it, I expected pain like some had posted.</li>
            <li>believe this is something that I will continue to use weekly, if for no other reason than I like the feeling.</li>

            <li> /&gt;15-20 minutes later, my hand is still pink overall, but only red in a few areas.</li>
            <li> As others have stated after treatment it looks like a pretty bad sunburn but on the plus side both my DMAE serum and night cream soaked right in like they never have before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I use it there is only minor discomfort as stated in other reviews but after weeks of use I have not seen any improvement at all in my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> the item arrived on the 23rd (a day after the estimated date) solely because i live in a complex</li>
            <li> I previously used a 0.5mm roller, a different brand, for about a month and thought I should try the 1mm.  </li>
            <li> I recently had that little waxy lump checked and it is NOT cancerous, so</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s still really ugly and the dermatologist said I&#x27;d probably just continue growing more as I age.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s key because pressure on the needles can dull them, and I&#x27;ve read that can make things</li>
            <li> After use, I washed with cold water and it helped the stinging to calm down.</li>
            <li> I was very doubtful that this would really make a difference, but the price was right</li>
            <li> Wahhhh I&#x27;m only 31, so that&#x27;s not good news.</li>
            <li> so I can see  little drops of blood at times.</li>
            <li> , It hurts just a little bit but</li>
            <li> and it did draw a little bit of blood in some spots.</li>
            <li> So...I will place another order for the 1.5 soon if this little device starts to work.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re desperate on  searching for products that would really work.</li>
            <li> I have had hyper-pigmentation on my forehead for a few years now.</li>
            <li> The skin there is dry and quite thin, so while I was shocked at first, it made sense after pondering a moment.</li>
            <li> The skin there is dry and quite thin, so while I was shocked at first, it made sense after pondering a moment.</li>
            <li> After what I&#x27;ve gone through in the last 8 weeks nothing else can be even half as painful?</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s hard to trust products that you don&#x27;t know anything about.</li>
            <li> or they pressed so hard that you question their</li>
            <li> To do that, I think a person would either have very thin, dry skin</li>
            <li> I waited to rate it because I wanted to use it at least twice to see the results on my face.  </li>
            <li> At least I know my serum and creams are getting the job done with the penetration.</li>
            <li> It is less painful than I expected.</li>
            <li> but i do have tough skin.</li>
            <li> This is not as bad as I expected pain-wise.</li>
            <li> (OTC, because I&#x27;m poor.)</li>

            <li> I was very doubtful that this would really make a difference, but the price was right and I figured I would give it a try. Now it&#x27;s not a miracle face lift or anything that extreme, and I can&#x27;t really compare it to &amp;#34;professional treatments&amp;#34; that others here have talked about (I&#x27;ve never had one) but I have noticed an improvement in the wrinkles around the mouth (which is where I have been focusing since I received it).  They are still there mind you but less prominent.  This is after about a month of using it 3-4 times a week at first, a little less often the last week or so.  It does leave  a red area for a while but nothing significant and it quickly fades. I have been using the hyaluronic acid that came with it and then Roc wrinkle cream on top. I can honestly say that I was pleasantly surprised that I would even notice a change considering the price. I have ordered the 0.25 Derma Micro Needle now to see if it works any better than the 1.0.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this feels but don&#x27;t use it often enough to see how well it works.  But, I do feel like my face is refreshed after I use it.</li>
            <li> the item arrived on the 23rd (a day after the estimated date) solely because i live in a complex so it needed to be left in the office and it arrived after closing time the previous day meaning it had to wait overnight at the post office, so overall it was great timing. The seller is great. The only thing i don&#x27;t like about the product itself is that it squeaks when you roll it, otherwise it is fantastic!! I have a high tolerance for pain but I wouldn&#x27;t think this would hurt most people...there is a lot of burning afterward as your face will turn red. The after effect feels similar to a sunburn, indian burn, or chemical peel (depending on what you can relate to). As i said before it doesn&#x27;t hurt much to use it, mostly just afterward but i do have tough skin. I used it on my face, but I also used it on my back and I will say it burns a lot more on the back and hurts significantly more during use. After use, I washed with cold water and it helped the stinging to calm down. I would no suggest using this every day, but I would highly recommend it. If however, you have sensitive skin, using this product with a numbing cream might be a good idea. I bought one but i dont need it so i don&#x27;t know if it helps but i&#x27;m sure it would.I hope this helps...happy shopping!</li>
            <li> I have only used this one time so far but I have already noticed a difference.  You may want to add a numbing cream as it does sting a bit.  I am excited about seeing better results in the future.  People say I look much younger than I am at age 63.&lt;br /&gt;It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does hurt a bit, but it&#x27;s worth the small amount of pain.  I can tell that my skin products go deeper &amp; work better.  :)</li>
            <li> I saw that using a product such as this on the show the Drs. was a natural way to help with wrinkles. I found this on Amazon and the reviews were pretty good so I ordered it. Came quickly and was as ordered.  That is why I gave it an extra star. When I use it there is only minor discomfort as stated in other reviews but after weeks of use I have not seen any improvement at all in my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I really like this needler.  I waited to rate it because I wanted to use it at least twice to see the results on my face.  The construction is tight and the needles are firm, the roller is just right not too loose.  It has its own storage case which I like.  As advertised, it works well on reducing the appearance of wrinkles.  I think that the collagen in my skin has begun to regenerate--which was my goal.</li>
            <li> I have seen some results with this product. When I first used it, I expected pain like some had posted. But it wasn&#x27;t bad. I bought the 1.0 thinking I ordered the 2.0 but it does get deep enough if I apply pressure as I do so I can see  little drops of blood at times. I figure no pain, no gain. But it doesn&#x27;t leave marks for the following day, so no problem there. At least I know my serum and creams are getting the job done with the penetration. I use it about every 2-3 days and use retinA opposite days as I am approaching 59 soon, and I can&#x27;t erase the years, but I hope to retain some of the years now.</li>
            <li> The product is sturdy. It is less painful than I expected. Really, almost painless. I purchased my son one too.</li>
            <li> Buy it. It works for 35 year old smokers wrinkles. Wonderful. Hurts a bit but worth it!!! The numbing cream does not come with the roller.</li>
            <li> I have used this roller for a month now and I recommend for everyone to use it responsibly. I put too much pressure on it on my thighs and they were marked with lines for over a week. I dare not use it in my face, mainly to attempt get rid of cellulite on my thighs.</li>
            <li> I got this about 5 months ago. It was nice and new, It hurts just a little bit but totally worth it you can see your skin smoother for a couples of wks after you use it. Still appreciate your wonderful delivery.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few days ago and got to use it twice, and so far I&#x27;ve seen some great results. I know it&#x27;s hard to trust products that you don&#x27;t know anything about. Specially when it&#x27;s going to be your first time and you&#x27;re desperate on  searching for products that would really work. Well I would really recommend this product to anyone, specially if you&#x27;re trying to get rid of acne scars or any other type of scars you might prob. have. So far I&#x27;ve got the chance to use it two times and I&#x27;ve seen some great results. Just make sure before using this product to read everything carefully and have any type of medication you want to apply to your face after use. At first your face would get really red depending on the amount of pressure you put, but after you get use to it your face wont be as red as the first time. So yeah I would really recommend this product - 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I used this derma roller a few times and was surprised that it didn&#x27;t hurt.  I&#x27;m not sure if it made much of a difference after using it.  It seemed to dull pretty quickly and then I began to feel it more.  In the product&#x27;s defense, You need to use it consistently and I don&#x27;t.  It it a quality product with good construction and needle design.  I would recommend it to someone who wants to try skin needling and will use it consistently.</li>
            <li> i HAVEN&#x27;T USED IT IN A LONG TIME. APPEARED TO WORK.</li>
            <li> I received this item for Christmas this year. I have watched many tutorials, reviews, and read countless websites varying from cosmetic hubs to fitness forums where various derma rollers have been praised by users. Thus, I had this at the top of my Amazon wishlist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have just now used the product for the first time. I received the 1mm size. It came in a box, inside a sturdy, clear plastic storage case. The case allows the roller to rest safely without putting pressure on any of the needles. That&#x27;s key because pressure on the needles can dull them, and I&#x27;ve read that can make things painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, back to me. I have had hyper-pigmentation on my forehead for a few years now. It seems like it popped up out of the blue and it has never gone away, despite religious use of retinol lotions, sunscreens, etc. (OTC, because I&#x27;m poor.) I also have a small mass of cells that have built up on themselves on the top of my forehead. I recently had that little waxy lump checked and it is NOT cancerous, so thank goodness. However, it&#x27;s still really ugly and the dermatologist said I&#x27;d probably just continue growing more as I age. Wahhhh I&#x27;m only 31, so that&#x27;s not good news. Thus, I decided to give this a shot to see if it can help diminish the spots and that lumpy thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it only on my right hand and my forehead today. I first cleansed both areas with a numbing antiseptic, cleaned the needles with isoproyl alcohol, and went to work. I must say, I quite enjoyed the sensation. It didn&#x27;t hurt me at all. It didn&#x27;t even sting, imo. It felt invigorating. I didn&#x27;t push super hard because I don&#x27;t want to injure myself, but I did apply a fair amount of pressure as I rolled, being sure to focus on problem spots. Even when I pushed &#x27;pretty&#x27; hard, I never drew any blood on my forehead. To do that, I think a person would either have very thin, dry skin or they pressed so hard that you question their intentions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my right hand, it felt good as well. I have to admit I did get some blood when I rolled across one knuckle. The skin there is dry and quite thin, so while I was shocked at first, it made sense after pondering a moment. Despite the 4 dots of blood that appeared, it did not hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I was satisfied with my rolling of both areas, I applied some pure coconut oil. I will see how long the plump redness lasts. 7 minutes later, my hand is already beginning to go back to it&#x27;s normal shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this is something that I will continue to use weekly, if for no other reason than I like the feeling. Is that weird? :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping to see a reduction in the wrinkles I get when I furrow my brow, and I&#x27;m hoping my spots will lighten up. If this tool can help tighten my skin and even the tone, then I will be extremely satisfied for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;15-20 minutes later, my hand is still pink overall, but only red in a few areas.ll.

            <li> I am not going to write a huge thing, get it if you want but after a week you will forget you have it and realize hurting your body doesn&#x27;t work unless you get it done by a pro.</li>
            <li> This is not as bad as I expected pain-wise. Perhaps its because I just had a root canal and am still battling a jaw/face infection. After what I&#x27;ve gone through in the last 8 weeks nothing else can be even half as painful? I don&#x27;t know...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case it comes in is a nice molded plastic which fits the roller unit nicely. The box is also sealed in plastic for sterility obviously. That was great. Yes, it does hurt a bit when rolling and perhaps buying the numbing cream might help a lot of people. You really can hear your face popping when the needles go through the skin and it did draw a little bit of blood in some spots. As others have stated after treatment it looks like a pretty bad sunburn but on the plus side both my DMAE serum and night cream soaked right in like they never have before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do hope this works on my forehead wrinkles. My only regret is that I chickened out and got the 1.00mm instead of the 1.5mm that is recommended for wrinkles. So...I will place another order for the 1.5 soon if this little device starts to work. On one hand it seems crazy but on the other hand it makes perfect sense. We shall see....I will update if I see any progress.</li>
            <li> I used this and it&#x27;s of good quality and I check the needles after every use, so far used it 15 times and it still looks good, and my face is not sagging any longer and that didn&#x27;t even take a full month.</li>
            <li> It will take many months to see the results.  I hope this really works.  The product itself is in good condition and works fine.</li>
            <li> The 540 needle derma roller I have used is better than any other by far.  I previously used a 0.5mm roller, a different brand, for about a month and thought I should try the 1mm.  The 1mm is the perfect size for practically every derma procedure you would need.</li>
