    <ol>
            <li>Great, great product.  </li>
            <li>This would be a great product if it didn&#x27;t have formaldehyde in it.  </li>
            <li>great product and price.  </li>
            <li>and it works great</li>
            <li>This is the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>Good quality and good brand.</li>
            <li>What a great top coat.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>For me that&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Deborah Lippman nail polish is all great...such nice quality.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Top coat.  </li>
            <li>And my nails don&#x27;t peel any more.</li>
            <li>The top coat will not harden after 6-8 hours, leaving sheet marks on my manicure overnight.</li>
            <li>I use it as a top coat (one coat over my nail color)</li>
            <li>I also noticed that my nails aren&#x27;t brittle any more.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love this after you try it once.</li>
            <li>Amazing product and worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I just love it and nail polish takes it off easily.  </li>
            <li>I was even able to clean while forgetting to put on my gloves to protect my hands - and my polish did not chip.  </li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t taken it easy on my nails.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s durable, shiny and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Ladies you will be happy and your manicure will last.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not what you&#x27;d call cheap</li>
            <li>So this may seem to be overpriced, but I haven&#x27;t been able to keep a regular nail polish on my nails for more than 48 hours without chipping and peeling, until now.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This product keeps my nails strong and seems to stop the breakage, so far.</li>
            <li>Worth the money and highly recommended!</li>
            <li>really is rock hard and can use as a polish too  soo great</li>
            <li>I have no idea why I thought paying more money would mean a better product.</li>
            <li>, when most polishes are roughly .33 oz., so you definitely get even more for your money.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work for my nails.  </li>
            <li>I already knew I wanted this product, but I have to drive pretty far to buy it at a store, so finding it online is very convenient.  </li>
            <li>Sure this is pricey but it will keep your nails from chipping and peeling better than any other product that you would pay much less for.</li>
            <li>Using this as a base and top coat, along with Deborah Lippmann nail polish, which is a great consistency, my manicure lasts a whole week.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, if your nails are weak, brittle, or tend to peel and break, give this a try -- it really works!</li>
            <li>I would happily repurchase as it works great with one coat, but the price is a bit exaggerated, the small bottle does not last long</li>
            <li>I like Deborah Lippmann nail polishes and this combination base and top coat is a particularly good buy.</li>
            <li>I always had trouble getting my polish to last more than one day.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting something fabulous but it was no better than</li>
            <li>This one is incredibly hard and strong.  </li>
            <li>As a nurse, I wash my hands frequently and use an alcohol foam multiple times a day between washes.</li>
            <li>It dries fast and keeps the nail polish on with minimal chipping.  </li>
            <li>Using Hard Rocks as both a base coat and a topcoat, I can enjoy my lovely manicures for several extra days, which is all sorts of fabulous.</li>
            <li>I have been using Sally Hanson Hard as Nails with some success.</li>

            <li> They tend to split at the sides of the finger tips when they get long.  </li>
            <li> My nails become dry, form ridges, peel, chip, and break.</li>

            <li> It can be used as a base coat and a top coat, and it truly makes my manicure last.</li>
            <li> I have been applying this product every other day since I received it 8 days ago.</li>
            <li> Two base coats and a top coat later, my nails are equally as hard.  </li>
            <li> My manicure lasts about 9 days when I use Hard Rock as a base and top coat.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do fake nails as I don&#x27;t want to weaken my natural nails; so I purchased this product to keep my nails hard as they grow.  </li>
            <li> , I see very little chipping when applied.  </li>
            <li> The size of the product is rather small compared to the price.  </li>
            <li> The Hard Rocks nail hardener is no exception.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Deborah Lippmann nail lacquer, Hard Rock!!  </li>
            <li> Yes, Lippman products are expensive, but you are paying for quality.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, brittle nails that crack and peel if you just look at them the wrong way.</li>
            <li> A very expensive purchase that I warn others to avoid.</li>
            <li> disappointed</li>
            <li> Base coat.  </li>
            <li> I am a Lippmann fan, but this product is terrible.</li>

            <li> A bit price but I purchased as a corrector for my peeling and cracking nails.  I see no difference and will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have been applying this product every other day since I received it 8 days ago. As a nurse, I wash my hands frequently and use an alcohol foam multiple times a day between washes. My nails become dry, form ridges, peel, chip, and break. I have been using Sally Hanson Hard as Nails with some success. Since using the Lipmann my nails are cracking, peeling, and braking at such a rate that I am discontinuing use of the Lipmann immediately and returning to Sally Hanson. I have no idea why I thought paying more money would mean a better product.</li>

            <li> Hi! Good quality and good brand.</li>
            <li> This would be a great product if it didn&#x27;t have formaldehyde in it.  Ingredients: Ethyl Acetate, SD Alcohol 40B, Butyl Acetate, Isopropyl Alcohol, Nitrocellulose, Propyl Acetate, Tosylamide/Formaldehyde Resin, Polyvinyl Butyral, Dibutyl Phthalate, Camphor, Triphenyl Phosphate, Benzophenone 1, D&amp;C Violet 2, Calcium Pantothenate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Biotin, Camellia Oleifera Extract.</li>
            <li> What a great top coat.  My manicure lasted for two weeks.  I was even able to clean while forgetting to put on my gloves to protect my hands - and my polish did not chip.  The is a wonderful-wonderful product.  Ladies you will be happy and your manicure will last.</li>
            <li> So this may seem to be overpriced, but I haven&#x27;t been able to keep a regular nail polish on my nails for more than 48 hours without chipping and peeling, until now.  I love this stuff.  Pricy?  Yes? So were my regular manicures, I can now wear polish.  I am going on day 5 with regular polish, no chips.  I have cooked, washed dishes, and I spend all day at a keyboard so I haven&#x27;t taken it easy on my nails.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for my nails.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference after using it for a month.  It may work for others.</li>
            <li> great product and price.  would buy again!  really is rock hard and can use as a polish too  soo great</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Even if I go to a nail salon I bring it with me. It can be used as a base coat and a top coat, and it truly makes my manicure last. I&#x27;ve spent a whole week in the past without my nails chipping, which is a miracle considering how frequently I wash my hands during the day. Just finished my bottle and buying another. Worth the money and highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is the only product you even need.  Top coat.  Base coat.  Nail hardener.  Amazing product and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Deborah Lippman nail polish is all great...such nice quality. The Hard Rocks nail hardener is no exception. I have very thin, brittle nails that crack and peel if you just look at them the wrong way. Using Hard Rocks as both a base coat and a topcoat, I can enjoy my lovely manicures for several extra days, which is all sorts of fabulous. I definitely recommend this stuff. Yes, Lippman products are expensive, but you are paying for quality. Also, each bottle is about .50 oz., when most polishes are roughly .33 oz., so you definitely get even more for your money.</li>
            <li> Stays on and on and on.  And my nails don&#x27;t peel any more.I always had trouble getting my polish to last more than one day.  Using this as a base and top coat, along with Deborah Lippmann nail polish, which is a great consistency, my manicure lasts a whole week.  For me that&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I am a Lippmann fan, but this product is terrible. The top coat will not harden after 6-8 hours, leaving sheet marks on my manicure overnight. A very expensive purchase that I warn others to avoid. I will stick with the Ultra Quick-Dry topcoat next time.</li>
            <li> Delivery was prompt.  I already knew I wanted this product, but I have to drive pretty far to buy it at a store, so finding it online is very convenient.  Honestly, if your nails are weak, brittle, or tend to peel and break, give this a try -- it really works!</li>
            <li> After one month my nails keep on breaking and peeling off.  disappointed</li>
            <li> I was expecting something fabulous but it was no better than OPI and OPI is 1/3 the price.  I don&#x27;t see what the hype is about this brand, could someone explain?</li>
            <li> This products works as promised, my nails became dramatically stronger while using this product.  I use it as a top coat (one coat over my nail color) and it works great, I see very little chipping when applied.  The size of the product is rather small compared to the price.  While it works, I&#x27;ve managed to make it to Sally&#x27;s Beauty supply and buy a nail hardener at a fraction of the cost. Two base coats and a top coat later, my nails are equally as hard.  The price is why I&#x27;m giving this product this rating.  I would happily repurchase as it works great with one coat, but the price is a bit exaggerated, the small bottle does not last long and I paint my nails regularly.</li>
            <li> I like Deborah Lippmann nail polishes and this combination base and top coat is a particularly good buy. It&#x27;s durable, shiny and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Sure this is pricey but it will keep your nails from chipping and peeling better than any other product that you would pay much less for. My manicure lasts about 9 days when I use Hard Rock as a base and top coat. I also noticed that my nails aren&#x27;t brittle any more. Not only did other polish chip with other products, but my nails chipped, too. You&#x27;ll love this after you try it once.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve used a ton of different ones.  This one is incredibly hard and strong.  It&#x27;s not what you&#x27;d call cheap but it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The nail hardener ROCKS!  It dries fast and keeps the nail polish on with minimal chipping.  I use it often</li>
