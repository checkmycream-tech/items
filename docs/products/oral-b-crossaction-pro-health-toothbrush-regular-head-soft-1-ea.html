            <li>These work great!</li>
            <li>One of the best non-mechanical toothbrushes in my opinion.</li>
            <li>and I like it a lot, perfect firmness</li>
            <li>Oral B took the superb design of the CrossAction toothbrush, removed the outer bristles and replaced them with rubber fence posts.</li>
            <li>Feels so good to brush my teeth!  </li>
            <li>Very pleased!</li>
            <li>Using the brush the sideways, it is great for plaque removal and getting in those spaces between the gum and tooth with the teeth.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I decided to try these toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>The price is great for a multi pack as well.</li>
            <li>Otherwise the toothbrushes are great.</li>
            <li>toothbrush is great.</li>
            <li>handle is great in your hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finding a great toothbrush can be a chore with the seemingly infinite options.</li>
            <li>The brush material feels like some kind of plastic!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom Line: Easily the best manual toothbrush ever created.</li>
            <li>The Assured brand toothbrushes from the dollar store are surprisingly good given their retail price of 2 for a dollar, so I buy tons of them every time I&#x27;m at the dollar store.</li>
            <li>Good quality and value.</li>
            <li>I was determined to give the choices a good once-over at the supermarket and came across the Oral-B Pro-Health CrossAction (some packaging refers to it as the All-In-One).  </li>
            <li>Just about as good as a tooth brush can be</li>
            <li>The CrossAction has helped me get good checkups for years and years.  </li>
            <li>The rubber bristles around the perimeter of the brush massage your gums for a wonderful clean feeling.</li>
            <li>They clean my teeth excellently.</li>
            <li>These are my husband&#x27;s favorite toothbrushes!  </li>
            <li>Love these brushes!  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is amazing.  </li>
            <li>nice cheek and tongue cleaner too.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great toothbrushes, the bristles are good, and the back tongue cleaner works great.  </li>
            <li>The angle of the bristles makes it very effective, it has the rubber bristles on the outside, and the bristles on the top are perfect for getting the front teeth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also eating more fruits/veggies and getting more sleep, so that helps as well!</li>
            <li>These by far are the best.</li>
            <li>They are by far the best toothbrushes I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I went to the dentist and they also said soft is best</li>
            <li>They are not, however, as good as the original ones since they added the &amp;#34;gum massaging tentacles&amp;#34; and somewhat modified the bristles.  </li>
            <li>Love these toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My mouth gets a refreshing exercise using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This is the only toothbrush i use and it fits me perfectly, does not hurt, does not irritate the gums...</li>
            <li>The crossaction bristles get more of the &#x27;crevice&#x27; plaque located within teeth as well as a power toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the order.</li>
            <li>Love em&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I like to think they help keep my gums healthy, but I already floss twice a day and use a water pick on occasion, so</li>
            <li>I would probably get a better price from Costco, but I don&#x27;t have a ton of time to go shopping.</li>
            <li>I wish the color assortment were more varied.  </li>
            <li>My favorite toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>love these toothbrushes</li>
            <li>I personally think they are one of the best toothbrushes I ever have used.  </li>
            <li>They are much better than the off brands.</li>
            <li>I love the</li>
            <li>This is a great deal, and since I have a tiny mouth, it&#x27;s nice to be able to just type &amp;#34;soft compact toothbrush&amp;#34; into Amazon&#x27;s search bar instead of hunting the rack in the drug store for a compact brush that is NOT a rigid one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am very satisfied, and certainly would recommend!</li>
            <li>They hold up well, scrub really well, and the grip is good.</li>
            <li>I have tried other brushes and have settled on this one as the best of the breed.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold while brushing.</li>
            <li>Received the Oral B toothbrushes I ordered very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It actually easy on the gums by the massaging bristles.</li>
            <li>very nice tooth brush for a better cleaning of your teeth , the only CON is it hurts your cheek, when you brush your teeth, the  backside rubs and hurts your cheek</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I used to get these at the local buyers club, now I&#x27;m hooked on a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>so glad I could find them and economically priced online.</li>
            <li>I received this product for free for the purpose of my review</li>
            <li>I received this product for free for the purpose of my review.  </li>
            <li>A pack for four of these costs the same or more in stores and with prime its a good buy..</li>
            <li>If you want to clean your teeth, try to find the original CrossAction brush.</li>
            <li>The comparison between this and others is the clean feeling of your teeth.</li>
            <li>I like the ergonomics of the brush, the tounge scraper, and it does seem to clean well.</li>
            <li>My mouth always feels clean after using this brush.</li>
            <li>The rubber bristles do an exceptional job at the gum line, and my teeth feel equally clean and smooth on both the outside and inside</li>
            <li>pleased with the performance of this Oral-B, and when the time comes, I&#x27;ll be certain to purchase this model again.  </li>
            <li>My family love it so much</li>
            <li>Thanks Oral B :)</li>
            <li>Durable tooth brush that makes your teeth feel super clean</li>
            <li>I can feel that this toothbrush brushes my teeth and leaving my mouth feeling so fresh and clean clean.</li>
            <li>It can reach pretty far back and has a great tongue/cheek scrubber!</li>
            <li>This brush is way overpriced and wears out quickly.</li>
            <li>Cheap simple and effective, and an item that makes sense to buy in bulk.</li>
            <li>Combined with Crest Pro-Health toothpaste and Advanced Listerine, my mouth felt much cleaner than with the Reach brush.  </li>
            <li>to get a years worth at at time and be done with it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much they actually add if you already have good oral hygeine.</li>
            <li>Worth for money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic</li>
            <li>(I feel like I&#x27;m brushing my teeth with a child&#x27;s size toothbrush), it does do an effective enough job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a REACH toothbrush user and devotee for many years, going back to the original.  </li>
            <li>just right... need a toothbrush?</li>
            <li>clean very well, do</li>
            <li>favorite toothbrushes are: Colgate 360 Extra Soft, a particular kind of Assured brand toothbrush that are 2 for $1 at Dollar Tree, and these Oral-B Pro-Health toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>These oral-b crossaction pro-health toothbrushes are the best i&#x27;ve used in a wide variety of other toothbrushes brands.</li>
            <li>I wish the bristles were a bit on the softer side (it might earn them an extra star in this rating), but otherwise they feel really phenomenal on your teeth.</li>
            <li>That is what I thought when I first used this</li>
            <li>and I love the tongue cleaner on the back of the head.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care for the feel of this toothbrush at first.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was fairly easy to open.</li>
            <li>The bristles are spaced out, which gives a large are to get between the teeth.</li>
            <li>This is a great toothbrush, if I may use this adjective in connection with such a mundane item.</li>
            <li>I just got this toothbrush for free from my dentist last week.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li>The crossaction really cleans my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The handle is more rounded than it&#x27;s predecessor thus more difficult to hold; more so for larger hands.</li>
            <li>The ridges really bugged me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a toothbrush, not too much to say about it.</li>
            <li>They massage the outside of teeth while preventing the bristles from actually getting between teeth and effectively cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And the tongue scrubber on the back gets my mouth first-date fresh!</li>
            <li>Went to the dentist for the first time in a decade, who gave me a big healthy thumbs up as I only need a cleaning...and I never floss.</li>
            <li>It feels like it&#x27;s cleaning much more than any other toothbrush I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>For the backs of the front teeth, the back of the head of the toothbrush has these special bristles for this area and it works very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too hard or too soft, and it really feels good to brush your teeth with it.  </li>
            <li>, I continued with it and have become comfortable with its strange design in my mouth.</li>
            <li>These are hands down my favorite toothbrushes, and you can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The head is large enough, the bristles are soft, yet enable you to clean well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used medium to harder bristles before, but I had heard soft bristles are better for you.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>accidentally knocked my last Reach brush into a sink full of cleanser, so I needed to get a new one sooner than normal.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the package when I got home and was very pleasantly surprised to discover the outer rubber bristles were just as soft as the regular bristles and flexed easily to the touch.  </li>
            <li>That said, I will say that if you prefer a soft bristle with a large area of coverage then this toothbrush is for you.</li>
            <li>I have a retainer and the soft bristles work through and around it to provide the clean feeling to the entire mouth.</li>
            <li>The bristles are pleasantly gentle and brushing becomes effortless and therapeutic in one seamless package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are great toothbrushes and you don&#x27;t have to worry about losing something expensive if you&#x27;re on the road.</li>
            <li>I have used this style of toothbrush for a few years and love them.  </li>
            <li>I live in Japan.</li>
            <li>The side bristles rae gentle on my gums, and the brush, overall, cleans very well.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the bigger handle and the larger bristle coverage.  </li>
            <li>They are gentle but clean in all the hidden spaces.  </li>
            <li>The last one I purchased (Reach Total Care Floss Clean) was marked as Soft, but certainly felt like a Medium to me...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to people with sensitive teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>product, you can see the results very early.</li>
            <li>and soft to brush everyday and unlike many other brushes which at first couple of usages tend to be sharp and might produce blood, I had no issues with this and tooth feel very clean after every brush.</li>
            <li>It DOES make a funny noise on your teeth from time to time, and I once had a crown pop off once and rattle around in my mouth, and it&#x27;s the same noise and sensation.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I went to the dentist this week after using this toothbrush for a couple months and the hygienist said I had more plaque than usual in the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Also, the bristles are lined with a sort of row of soft rubber pegs that clean down to the gum line.</li>
            <li>But wow, has this product exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>far stiffer than I would expect from a soft-bristle</li>
            <li>I bought the twin-pack, so I&#x27;d have the next brush ready when this one wore</li>
            <li>The plastic bristles on the edge worried me as I have really sensitive gums (hence the need for a soft brush)</li>
            <li>,  This brush works on your whole mouth with the different bristles.  </li>
            <li>My dentist reccomended soft bristles for me and this is the one I purchase over and over through subscribe &amp; save.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this particular model for a long time</li>
            <li>I like the 360 Extra Soft because it&#x27;s extra soft (heh)</li>
            <li>Having never used it before, I was intrigued by the outer edge rubber \\&quot;bristles\\&quot; and how they&#x27;d actually feel, considering the brush itself is labeled as Soft.  </li>
            <li>When I found this one, I was intrigued by the soft bristles in combination with the multiple bristle directions and cleaning actions.</li>
            <li>It is really a scraper, so it&#x27;s a bit odd, but it works well and doesn&#x27;t leave your tongue feeling like you ran a sheet of sandpaper over it.</li>

            <li> pleased with the performance of this Oral-B, and when the time comes, I&#x27;ll be certain to purchase this model again.  </li>
            <li> My family love it so much</li>
            <li> Thanks Oral B :)</li>
            <li> Durable tooth brush that makes your teeth feel super clean</li>
            <li> I can feel that this toothbrush brushes my teeth and leaving my mouth feeling so fresh and clean clean.</li>
            <li> It can reach pretty far back and has a great tongue/cheek scrubber!</li>
            <li> This brush is way overpriced and wears out quickly.</li>
            <li> Cheap simple and effective, and an item that makes sense to buy in bulk.</li>
            <li> Combined with Crest Pro-Health toothpaste and Advanced Listerine, my mouth felt much cleaner than with the Reach brush.  </li>
            <li> to get a years worth at at time and be done with it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much they actually add if you already have good oral hygeine.</li>
            <li> Worth for money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic</li>
            <li> (I feel like I&#x27;m brushing my teeth with a child&#x27;s size toothbrush), it does do an effective enough job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a REACH toothbrush user and devotee for many years, going back to the original.  </li>
            <li> just right... need a toothbrush?</li>
            <li> clean very well, do</li>
            <li> favorite toothbrushes are: Colgate 360 Extra Soft, a particular kind of Assured brand toothbrush that are 2 for $1 at Dollar Tree, and these Oral-B Pro-Health toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> These oral-b crossaction pro-health toothbrushes are the best i&#x27;ve used in a wide variety of other toothbrushes brands.</li>
            <li> I wish the bristles were a bit on the softer side (it might earn them an extra star in this rating), but otherwise they feel really phenomenal on your teeth.</li>
            <li> That is what I thought when I first used this</li>
            <li> and I love the tongue cleaner on the back of the head.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the feel of this toothbrush at first.  </li>
            <li> The packaging was fairly easy to open.</li>
            <li> The bristles are spaced out, which gives a large are to get between the teeth.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush, if I may use this adjective in connection with such a mundane item.</li>
            <li> I just got this toothbrush for free from my dentist last week.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> The crossaction really cleans my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The handle is more rounded than it&#x27;s predecessor thus more difficult to hold; more so for larger hands.</li>
            <li> The ridges really bugged me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a toothbrush, not too much to say about it.</li>
            <li> They massage the outside of teeth while preventing the bristles from actually getting between teeth and effectively cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the tongue scrubber on the back gets my mouth first-date fresh!</li>
            <li> Went to the dentist for the first time in a decade, who gave me a big healthy thumbs up as I only need a cleaning...and I never floss.</li>
            <li> It feels like it&#x27;s cleaning much more than any other toothbrush I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> For the backs of the front teeth, the back of the head of the toothbrush has these special bristles for this area and it works very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too hard or too soft, and it really feels good to brush your teeth with it.  </li>
            <li> , I continued with it and have become comfortable with its strange design in my mouth.</li>
            <li> These are hands down my favorite toothbrushes, and you can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The head is large enough, the bristles are soft, yet enable you to clean well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used medium to harder bristles before, but I had heard soft bristles are better for you.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> accidentally knocked my last Reach brush into a sink full of cleanser, so I needed to get a new one sooner than normal.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the package when I got home and was very pleasantly surprised to discover the outer rubber bristles were just as soft as the regular bristles and flexed easily to the touch.  </li>
            <li> That said, I will say that if you prefer a soft bristle with a large area of coverage then this toothbrush is for you.</li>
            <li> I have a retainer and the soft bristles work through and around it to provide the clean feeling to the entire mouth.</li>
            <li> The bristles are pleasantly gentle and brushing becomes effortless and therapeutic in one seamless package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are great toothbrushes and you don&#x27;t have to worry about losing something expensive if you&#x27;re on the road.</li>
            <li> I have used this style of toothbrush for a few years and love them.  </li>
            <li> I live in Japan.</li>
            <li> The side bristles rae gentle on my gums, and the brush, overall, cleans very well.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the bigger handle and the larger bristle coverage.  </li>
            <li> They are gentle but clean in all the hidden spaces.  </li>
            <li> The last one I purchased (Reach Total Care Floss Clean) was marked as Soft, but certainly felt like a Medium to me...</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to people with sensitive teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> product, you can see the results very early.</li>
            <li> and soft to brush everyday and unlike many other brushes which at first couple of usages tend to be sharp and might produce blood, I had no issues with this and tooth feel very clean after every brush.</li>
            <li> It DOES make a funny noise on your teeth from time to time, and I once had a crown pop off once and rattle around in my mouth, and it&#x27;s the same noise and sensation.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I went to the dentist this week after using this toothbrush for a couple months and the hygienist said I had more plaque than usual in the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Also, the bristles are lined with a sort of row of soft rubber pegs that clean down to the gum line.</li>
            <li> But wow, has this product exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> far stiffer than I would expect from a soft-bristle</li>
            <li> I bought the twin-pack, so I&#x27;d have the next brush ready when this one wore</li>
            <li> The plastic bristles on the edge worried me as I have really sensitive gums (hence the need for a soft brush)</li>
            <li> ,  This brush works on your whole mouth with the different bristles.  </li>
            <li> My dentist reccomended soft bristles for me and this is the one I purchase over and over through subscribe &amp; save.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this particular model for a long time</li>
            <li> I like the 360 Extra Soft because it&#x27;s extra soft (heh)</li>
            <li> Having never used it before, I was intrigued by the outer edge rubber \\&quot;bristles\\&quot; and how they&#x27;d actually feel, considering the brush itself is labeled as Soft.  </li>
            <li> When I found this one, I was intrigued by the soft bristles in combination with the multiple bristle directions and cleaning actions.</li>
            <li> It is really a scraper, so it&#x27;s a bit odd, but it works well and doesn&#x27;t leave your tongue feeling like you ran a sheet of sandpaper over it.</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm and \\&quot;aggressive\\&quot;, albeit a gentle aggressive if that makes sense, while soft making it less likely to brush away enamel and/or gums.</li>
            <li> I tried some of the highly touted new styles but was not impressed with the cleaning action.</li>
            <li> Even though I replace my toothbrush every few months these toothbrushes still appear in like new condition.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months with a natural tea tree oil toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Maybe because my mouth is so wide open trying to accommodate this thing??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is really big, much bigger than any other toothbrush I&#x27;ve every used and it makes it hard to reach back to all the nooks in the back of the mouth.  </li>
            <li> Brush your teeth all day long with these brushes... not too hard and not too soft...</li>
            <li> Usually I take the red or yellow and my husband the blue or green.  </li>
            <li> Having only blue and green makes identifying which one belongs to whom more difficult as the colors are not bright.  </li>
            <li> these brushes have little nubs at the outside of the brush part which massage your gums.  </li>
            <li> The tradeoff here is that it doesn&#x27;t appear to last as long as brushes usually do.    </li>
            <li> Even though I ordered 16, almost all are blue or green.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m careful when it comes to my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I refuse to use any other toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used these for about the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> My only problem is the handle is too thick for my toothbrush holder.  </li>
            <li> , I have a problem with saliva &amp; toothpaste dripping down the handle causing the toothbrush to slip out of my grip.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this problem with other toothbrushes in the past.  </li>
            <li> After just a few uses, the bristles soften, the fence posts don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I am crazy particular about my toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Here everyone likes toothbrushes with small heads</li>
            <li> But a small price to pay.</li>
            <li> the bristles get into hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> removes the icky plaque that your teeth get.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel the leftover plaque that other toothbrushes leave behind!</li>
            <li> so that in case there&#x27;s something about a certain brush that is horrible, it is not able to cause long-term damage.</li>
            <li> They are very hard to find in stores,</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy the thin, flimsy \\&quot;Advantage\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li> However, it was very odd that this one package of toothbrushes came in about a 1&#x27; x 2&#x27; x 4&amp;#34; box !!!</li>
            <li> Just a bit weird when I compared the color shading to the one I bought from rite aid.</li>
            <li> But lately, I&#x27;ve been disappointed with both the design and effectiveness of their brushes.  </li>
            <li> Afraid it may be discontinued.</li>
            <li> and I get BLOODY mouth.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great-feeling manual brush. I like to switch my toothbrushes up and brush with different ones throughout the year so that in case there&#x27;s something about a certain brush that is horrible, it is not able to cause long-term damage. Hopefully that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite toothbrushes are: Colgate 360 Extra Soft, a particular kind of Assured brand toothbrush that are 2 for $1 at Dollar Tree, and these Oral-B Pro-Health toothbrushes. I like the 360 Extra Soft because it&#x27;s extra soft (heh) so it gives my gums a break, and also it has these rubbery rings inside that are reminiscent of the dentist&#x27;s toothbrush. The Assured brand toothbrushes from the dollar store are surprisingly good given their retail price of 2 for a dollar, so I buy tons of them every time I&#x27;m at the dollar store. The ones I don&#x27;t use at home I use as throw-away travel brushes (50 cents a piece, yo!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B Pro-Health ones you see here are one of my faves because it feels like your mouth is getting a massage. I wish the bristles were a bit on the softer side (it might earn them an extra star in this rating), but otherwise they feel really phenomenal on your teeth.</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They clean very well, do what a toothbrush should do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to hold in hand, the grip is just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very satisfied, and certainly would recommend!</li>
            <li> Good quality and value. Easy to hold while brushing. My mouth gets a refreshing exercise using this toothbrush. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I used to get these at the local buyers club, now I&#x27;m hooked on a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Nice to get a years worth at at time and be done with it.</li>
            <li> I live in Japan. Here everyone likes toothbrushes with small heads so I had to order this from the US. This toothbrush is bigger but that is because it has been designed not only for dental hygiene but also for plaque removal, which is what my dentist always admonishes me to do. Using the brush the sideways, it is great for plaque removal and getting in those spaces between the gum and tooth with the teeth. For the backs of the front teeth, the back of the head of the toothbrush has these special bristles for this area and it works very well. It is the best toothbrush I have ever used!</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush, if I may use this adjective in connection with such a mundane item. The side bristles rae gentle on my gums, and the brush, overall, cleans very well. The tradeoff here is that it doesn&#x27;t appear to last as long as brushes usually do.    But a small price to pay. I will buy these again.</li>
            <li> This is the only toothbrush i use and it fits me perfectly, does not hurt, does not irritate the gums... just massages them and removes alot of plaque!..    Highly recommended to people with sensitive teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I have been using a standard Colgate manual toothbrush for awhile now since my move back to manual toothbrushes from a Soniccare. But wow, has this product exceeded my expectations. The rubber bristles around the perimeter of the brush massage your gums for a wonderful clean feeling. The crossaction bristles get more of the &#x27;crevice&#x27; plaque located within teeth as well as a power toothbrush. And the tongue scrubber on the back gets my mouth first-date fresh! The bristles are pleasantly gentle and brushing becomes effortless and therapeutic in one seamless package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: Easily the best manual toothbrush ever created.</li>
            <li> These are my husband&#x27;s favorite toothbrushes!  Accept no imitations!</li>
            <li> The packaging was fairly easy to open. The brushes do the job. I&#x27;m satisfied with the order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a REACH toothbrush user and devotee for many years, going back to the original.  But lately, I&#x27;ve been disappointed with both the design and effectiveness of their brushes.  The last one I purchased (Reach Total Care Floss Clean) was marked as Soft, but certainly felt like a Medium to me... far stiffer than I would expect from a soft-bristle toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I accidentally knocked my last Reach brush into a sink full of cleanser, so I needed to get a new one sooner than normal.  I was determined to give the choices a good once-over at the supermarket and came across the Oral-B Pro-Health CrossAction (some packaging refers to it as the All-In-One).  Having never used it before, I was intrigued by the outer edge rubber \\&quot;bristles\\&quot; and how they&#x27;d actually feel, considering the brush itself is labeled as Soft.  I bought the twin-pack, so I&#x27;d have the next brush ready when this one wore out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the package when I got home and was very pleasantly surprised to discover the outer rubber bristles were just as soft as the regular bristles and flexed easily to the touch.  On the reverse side of the head is a texturized rubber surface that cleans and massages the tongue, cheeks, and gums while you brush (thus my review headline).  Combined with Crest Pro-Health toothpaste and Advanced Listerine, my mouth felt much cleaner than with the Reach brush.  The rubber bristles do an exceptional job at the gum line, and my teeth feel equally clean and smooth on both the outside and inside surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with the performance of this Oral-B, and when the time comes, I&#x27;ll be certain to purchase this model again.  Goodbye, Reach!</li>
            <li> Received the Oral B toothbrushes I ordered very quickly.  I have used this style of toothbrush for a few years and love them.  They are very hard to find in stores, so glad I could find them and economically priced online.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years. Love em&#x27;. The Cadillac of toothbrushes. Please buy them so they keep making them. Don&#x27;t buy the thin, flimsy \\&quot;Advantage\\&quot; product. I got tricked into saving some money once. Once.</li>
            <li> They clean my teeth excellently.</li>
            <li> best toothbrush you can buy&lt;br /&gt;!</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush.  To me - it is to the teeth what a crosstrainer is to the foot.  It does an excellent job!</li>
            <li> I refuse to use any other toothbrush. The comparison between this and others is the clean feeling of your teeth. I have a retainer and the soft bristles work through and around it to provide the clean feeling to the entire mouth.</li>
            <li> These oral-b crossaction pro-health toothbrushes are the best i&#x27;ve used in a wide variety of other toothbrushes brands. These by far are the best. It actually easy on the gums by the massaging bristles. I can feel that this toothbrush brushes my teeth and leaving my mouth feeling so fresh and clean clean. My family love it so much, I stocked up on these. Afraid it may be discontinued. Give it a try. Your gum and teeth will thank you.</li>
            <li> I just got this toothbrush for free from my dentist last week.  I really enjoy the bigger handle and the larger bristle coverage.  Feels so good to brush my teeth!  Thanks Oral B :)</li>
            <li> I am so happy I decided to try these toothbrushes.  They are by far the best toothbrushes I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothbrush for years.  Went to the dentist for the first time in a decade, who gave me a big healthy thumbs up as I only need a cleaning...and I never floss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used medium to harder bristles before, but I had heard soft bristles are better for you. I went to the dentist and they also said soft is best (doesn&#x27;t wipe away enamel which protects and coats your teeth). So I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months with a natural tea tree oil toothpaste. I&#x27;m impressed, my teeth are whiter than they&#x27;ve been in years in my opinion. I&#x27;m also eating more fruits/veggies and getting more sleep, so that helps as well!</li>
            <li> Would rather have the traditional Oral B. This brush is way overpriced and wears out quickly. The brush material feels like some kind of plastic!</li>
            <li> This is a great deal, and since I have a tiny mouth, it&#x27;s nice to be able to just type &amp;#34;soft compact toothbrush&amp;#34; into Amazon&#x27;s search bar instead of hunting the rack in the drug store for a compact brush that is NOT a rigid one. I like the ergonomics of the brush, the tounge scraper, and it does seem to clean well. The plastic bristles on the edge worried me as I have really sensitive gums (hence the need for a soft brush) but it&#x27;s fine. It DOES make a funny noise on your teeth from time to time, and I once had a crown pop off once and rattle around in my mouth, and it&#x27;s the same noise and sensation. But nope, no falling out teeth, just the bristles. I like to think they help keep my gums healthy, but I already floss twice a day and use a water pick on occasion, so I don&#x27;t know how much they actually add if you already have good oral hygeine. The price is great for a multi pack as well.</li>
            <li> My mouth always feels clean after using this brush. I run my tongue across my teeth and I don&#x27;t feel the leftover plaque that other toothbrushes leave behind!</li>
            <li> Wow!  That is what I thought when I first used this,  This brush works on your whole mouth with the different bristles.  My only problem is the handle is too thick for my toothbrush holder.  I received this product for free for the purpose of my review</li>
            <li> I would probably get a better price from Costco, but I don&#x27;t have a ton of time to go shopping. These are great toothbrushes and you don&#x27;t have to worry about losing something expensive if you&#x27;re on the road.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!  They are gentle but clean in all the hidden spaces.  I wish the color assortment were more varied.  Even though I ordered 16, almost all are blue or green.  Usually I take the red or yellow and my husband the blue or green.  Having only blue and green makes identifying which one belongs to whom more difficult as the colors are not bright.  Otherwise the toothbrushes are great.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free for the purpose of my review.  opinions are 100 % of my own.&lt;br /&gt;this toothbrush is great. the bristles get into hard to reach areas. removes the icky plaque that your teeth get. you mouth feels cleaner and of course healthier.  nice cheek and tongue cleaner too. the bristles don&#x27;t hurt your side of your mouth either.&lt;br /&gt;the handle is great in your hands.&lt;br /&gt;this is the best toothbrush i have found</li>
            <li> Worth for money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic product, you can see the results very early.</li>
            <li> This is my toothbrush of choice. Holds up well after months or using and throw away after recommended 3 months of use. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> these brushes have little nubs at the outside of the brush part which massage your gums.  My fav brushes.</li>
            <li> Just about as good as a tooth brush can be I&#x27;d think.  The angle of the bristles makes it very effective, it has the rubber bristles on the outside, and the bristles on the top are perfect for getting the front teeth.  Cheap simple and effective, and an item that makes sense to buy in bulk.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothbrush.  Durable tooth brush that makes your teeth feel super clean</li>
            <li> Excellent value and excellent product - this toothbrush has the varied height bristles that make a difference in brushing. I&#x27;ve used this type for years and hope the company continues making it. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> These are hands down my favorite toothbrushes, and you can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> love these toothbrushes</li>
            <li> I am crazy particular about my toothbrushes.  This is one of the best.  The head is large enough, the bristles are soft, yet enable you to clean well and I love the tongue cleaner on the back of the head.</li>
            <li> Although this toothbrush style is not the size I&#x27;d like (I feel like I&#x27;m brushing my teeth with a child&#x27;s size toothbrush), it does do an effective enough job.</li>
            <li> The CrossAction has helped me get good checkups for years and years.  They are not, however, as good as the original ones since they added the &amp;#34;gum massaging tentacles&amp;#34; and somewhat modified the bristles.  That&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars.  &#x27;Cause they just don&#x27;t make &#x27;em like they used to.</li>
            <li> We all have different opinions of what a toothbrush should be and how it should feel. So I am not going to tell you what you should like. That said, I will say that if you prefer a soft bristle with a large area of coverage then this toothbrush is for you. The bristles are spaced out, which gives a large are to get between the teeth. Even though I replace my toothbrush every few months these toothbrushes still appear in like new condition. They really do last and perform well.</li>
            <li> Brush your teeth all day long with these brushes... not too hard and not too soft... just right... need a toothbrush? Brush with this...</li>
            <li> very nice tooth brush for a better cleaning of your teeth , the only CON is it hurts your cheek, when you brush your teeth, the  backside rubs and hurts your cheek and I get BLOODY mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m careful when it comes to my teeth and gums. Finding a great toothbrush can be a chore with the seemingly infinite options. When I found this one, I was intrigued by the soft bristles in combination with the multiple bristle directions and cleaning actions. Let me say I will be sticking with this one. The bristles are firm and \\&quot;aggressive\\&quot;, albeit a gentle aggressive if that makes sense, while soft making it less likely to brush away enamel and/or gums. This was key for me. Also, the bristles are lined with a sort of row of soft rubber pegs that clean down to the gum line. The back of the head of the brush serves as a tongue cleaner. It is really a scraper, so it&#x27;s a bit odd, but it works well and doesn&#x27;t leave your tongue feeling like you ran a sheet of sandpaper over it. I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is amazing.  It feels like it&#x27;s cleaning much more than any other toothbrush I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s not too hard or too soft, and it really feels good to brush your teeth with it.  I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone.</li>
            <li> I personally think they are one of the best toothbrushes I ever have used.  The crossaction really cleans my teeth.  In fact, I didn&#x27;t buy just one, I bought 6.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes work the best for tartar control for me. They are much better than the off brands. I tried some of the highly touted new styles but was not impressed with the cleaning action. These work great!</li>
            <li> Some reason it&#x27;s different color shades than the one you buy from Rite Aid but it is same thing. Just a bit weird when I compared the color shading to the one I bought from rite aid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used these for about the past 10 years. They hold up well, scrub really well, and the grip is good.</li>
            <li> What is there to rate ... a toothbrush is a toothbrush. They serve the purpose for which intended.  However, it was very odd that this one package of toothbrushes came in about a 1&#x27; x 2&#x27; x 4&amp;#34; box !!!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this toothbrush for adults. I love the it is longer with crisscrossing bristles. It can reach pretty far back and has a great tongue/cheek scrubber!</li>
            <li> I use this as my manual ToothBrush in the mornings along with my Electric ToothBrush (also an Oral-B) that I use at night.  I have tried other brushes and have settled on this one as the best of the breed.</li>
            <li> Excelente cepillo dental, robusto y no tengo queja en cuanto al cepillado lo recomiendo como un producto de calidad bien elaborado</li>
            <li> My dentist reccomended soft bristles for me and this is the one I purchase over and over through subscribe &amp; save.</li>
            <li> The handle is more rounded than it&#x27;s predecessor thus more difficult to hold; more so for larger hands.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the feel of this toothbrush at first.  The ridges really bugged me.  But it cleans my teeth so well, I continued with it and have become comfortable with its strange design in my mouth.</li>
            <li> It is really big, much bigger than any other toothbrush I&#x27;ve every used and it makes it hard to reach back to all the nooks in the back of the mouth.  I went to the dentist this week after using this toothbrush for a couple months and the hygienist said I had more plaque than usual in the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have a problem with saliva &amp; toothpaste dripping down the handle causing the toothbrush to slip out of my grip.  I&#x27;ve never had this problem with other toothbrushes in the past.  Maybe because my mouth is so wide open trying to accommodate this thing??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll switch back to a regular sized toothbrush when this one wears out.</li>
            <li> A pack for four of these costs the same or more in stores and with prime its a good buy..&lt;br /&gt;Nice and soft to brush everyday and unlike many other brushes which at first couple of usages tend to be sharp and might produce blood, I had no issues with this and tooth feel very clean after every brush.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great toothbrushes, the bristles are good, and the back tongue cleaner works great.  One of the best non-mechanical toothbrushes in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a toothbrush, not too much to say about it. I&#x27;ve used this particular model for a long time and I like it a lot, perfect firmness and I like the way it looks.</li>
            <li> Oral B took the superb design of the CrossAction toothbrush, removed the outer bristles and replaced them with rubber fence posts. After just a few uses, the bristles soften, the fence posts don&#x27;t. They massage the outside of teeth while preventing the bristles from actually getting between teeth and effectively cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to massage gums, get a device designed to do that.  If you want to clean your teeth, try to find the original CrossAction brush.</li>
