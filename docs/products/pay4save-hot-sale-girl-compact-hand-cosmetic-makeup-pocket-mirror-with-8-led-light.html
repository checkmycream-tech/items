    <ol>
            <li>Excellent product....fit every need of mine and came when scheduled.  </li>
            <li>This is great for the concept.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and I love the lighting on the side of the mirror</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s so cute.</li>
            <li>The lights are just too bright to be useful.  </li>
            <li>It works much better than this, but is nowhere near as bright and the mirror surface is smaller.&lt;br /&gt;Nitpicking</li>
            <li>It is compact and would easily fit in your bag.</li>
            <li>I would have liked for it to be smaller and an easy way to replace batteries.  </li>
            <li>I mean, it&#x27;s nice and bright, but the lights shine directly in your eyes unless you flip it over and use the magnifying side.</li>
            <li>Good little mirror</li>
            <li>Though the devices were relatively inexpensive, I suggest paying a slightly higher price for a more dependable product.</li>
            <li>I love the lights &amp; how big the mirror is!</li>
            <li>Mirrors are okay, but sort of like the ones you often find in public restrooms in parks.</li>
            <li>so when we lose power, which often happens with National Grid, I can still get ready for work and see to put my makeup</li>
            <li>aside, this is a very well made compact.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a piece of junk that just falls apart after a couple of uses, but this is really nicely made and should last a long time.</li>
            <li>Took a long time to arrive from China and was cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been to one restaurant with good lighting for makeup, so his handy-dandy little gadget is a lifesaver.</li>
            <li>in all though, it&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s a bigger size compact so can see yourself better...and the extra lighting helps in dark conditions.</li>
            <li>I want to replace the batteries and not by a new one.</li>
            <li>I bought this after I was mortified how freakish my makeup looked, even though it looked fine at the dark bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li>Light doesn&#x27;t last long!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bigger than I expected, but I wanted a compact mirror with a light.  </li>
            <li>The first one was shipped with a battery that measured half the voltage of a new, 12 volt battery.  </li>
            <li>On the second device, the left bank of LED lights illuminated properly but the ones on the right side did not.  </li>
            <li>It is difficult to position so the light hits you just right, and, you have to move back to get your entire face.</li>
            <li>but the lights died almost instantly like with in the first few minutes.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s bigger than I expected, but I wanted a compact mirror with a light.  This didn&#x27;t come with directions on how to replace the batteries though and it looks like it came from Japan or China because the description is in Chinese as well as English. I would have liked for it to be smaller and an easy way to replace batteries.  I paid 9 bucks for this mirror.  I want to replace the batteries and not by a new one.</li>
            <li> Broken upon arrival. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> yeah the size was listed as like 4inches by 3 or something like that but it was significantly bigger and heavier than i expected. I like it, but it is also chunky and the leds are beginning to lose power after a month of non continual use. i leave at at home and use it to remove makeup. it&#x27;s simply too big and too heavy to bring with me in a purse. it doesn&#x27;t flip open, you have to open it manually. the button is on the middle part that holds the two mirrors together. i like it for a different use, not as what i wanted or intended it to be used for ;( i wanted something thinner and lighter.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to arrive from China and was cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been to one restaurant with good lighting for makeup, so his handy-dandy little gadget is a lifesaver. I bought this after I was mortified how freakish my makeup looked, even though it looked fine at the dark bathroom mirror. I love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product....fit every need of mine and came when scheduled.  :)</li>
            <li> My wife purchased two of these recently and asked me to look at them when they didn&#x27;t work properly.  The first one was shipped with a battery that measured half the voltage of a new, 12 volt battery.  On the second device, the left bank of LED lights illuminated properly but the ones on the right side did not.  I suspect a wire was not connected properly during construction and the product was not tested thoroughly prior to shipping.  Less likely is the chance that the damage was caused during the shipping process.  The mirror in front of the electrical circuit is glued in so there is no failsafe way to remove the mirror in order to inspect the wires and LED lamps.  Though the devices were relatively inexpensive, I suggest paying a slightly higher price for a more dependable product.</li>
            <li> I love it! But don&#x27;t know how to change the battery???</li>
            <li> At the time of this review I do not have my compact mirror,  but what attracted me to this item; Was for one they have different colors and I love the lighting on the side of the mirror I think it&#x27;s so cute. It is like a mini vanity mirror.</li>
            <li> I bought two lighted compact mirrors for my wife and daughter and received both with dead batteries!  To make matters worse the mirrors use an odd 23Abattery and not a common AAA and not cheap to replace.</li>
            <li> This is great for the concept.  The lights are just too bright to be useful.  Too blinding when trying to look at something in detail.</li>
            <li> I love the lights &amp; how big the mirror is! But it&#x27;s not too big where it&#x27;s a drag to carry around.</li>
            <li> Mirrors are okay, but sort of like the ones you often find in public restrooms in parks.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected.  It is difficult to position so the light hits you just right, and, you have to move back to get your entire face. I see it as an emergency solution.  It is compact and would easily fit in your bag.</li>
            <li> Good little mirror but the lights died almost instantly like with in the first few minutes. I tried to replace the batteries but it still wont work I think it shorted out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the fence about liking this mirror or not.... It has the extra lighting that I need. I wanted a compact like this so when we lose power, which often happens with National Grid, I can still get ready for work and see to put my makeup on.&lt;br /&gt;My only quibble is that the way the lights are arranged makes it hard to see what you&#x27;re doing. I mean, it&#x27;s nice and bright, but the lights shine directly in your eyes unless you flip it over and use the magnifying side. So for being extra-bright, it&#x27;s kinda not useful.&lt;br /&gt;All in all though, it&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s a bigger size compact so can see yourself better...and the extra lighting helps in dark conditions. I just wish they&#x27;d have arranged the lights differently...I have another compact that has 2 lights on the center, clamshell part--It works much better than this, but is nowhere near as bright and the mirror surface is smaller.&lt;br /&gt;Nitpicking aside, this is a very well made compact. I was expecting a piece of junk that just falls apart after a couple of uses, but this is really nicely made and should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Light doesn&#x27;t last long!</li>
