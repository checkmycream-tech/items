            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and it feels so smooth after I use it!</li>
            <li>It has a heat sensor so it doesn&#x27;t put out more heat than your hair needs.</li>
            <li>Much better than my last one and the price is amazing!!</li>
            <li>straightens your hair very easy and smooth and Heats up very very quickly.</li>
            <li>Heats up very quickly, does not catch on my hair, and straightens with ease.</li>
            <li>It also heats up very quickly and you can adjust the temperature as it has a temperature control setting.</li>
            <li>So glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price.</li>
            <li>However when I found out I was fine with it.</li>
            <li>I received this very Unique Iron in Two Days, the description exceeded what this hair tool really does.</li>
            <li>and although this had been the very first time it had presented an issue I had to chuck it.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my sister and she absolutely loves it!!</li>

            <li>I was very nervous at first because it was refurbished, but it ended being way better than  I expected</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a straightener.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t risk having only half my hair straight because it crapped out for good in the middle of me getting ready.</li>
            <li>Great flat iron, bought the new and the refurbished, refurbished is half the price and works the same.</li>
            <li>Have it at Wal-Mart for like $30 brand new.</li>
            <li>and I did repurchase, but I opted for the brand new model this time around.</li>
            <li>I am torn because I loved my Croc straightener (rip) but they are so expensive</li>
            <li>This happened 3 or more times during my session ( I have thick naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>I had gotten one for a relative for their birthday, but it was new one.</li>

            <li> Great product !!&lt;br /&gt;Just like new.&lt;br /&gt;I Could not tell it was &amp;#34;refurbished&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My girlfriend get crazy with this. She really love it.  I will buy one for my mom too. RECOMENDED!</li>
            <li> Great flat iron, bought the new and the refurbished, refurbished is half the price and works the same.</li>
            <li> Love this! So glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price. Operates perfectly, I have had no problems with it. Heats up very quickly, does not catch on my hair, and straightens with ease. Lock feature allows for compact storage.</li>
            <li> I had gotten one for a relative for their birthday, but it was new one. I used once and was in love. So I decided to buy myself one as well. I saw that there was a pre-certified option for half the price and I decided &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34;. Well The first time I used it was great. But then the second time I used it, I turned it on then did my makeup which only take 10 minutes and when I picked up my straightener to use it, I noticed that it was off. So I turned it on again, did my hair and turned it off. But after that I noticed that it starts to turn off all of the sudden. Sometimes I turns off when I&#x27;m in the process of doing my hair. This has become very annoying on the mornings I&#x27;m in a rush. I guess this is one straightener that got buy the inspection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know there is an auto-shut off, but not after only 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any problem because of it being a refurbished product. Nice long plates that make straightening quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is easily the best iron I&#x27;ve used till date. It doesn&#x27;t give the bad burning smell while ironing, doesn&#x27;t damage the hair and the hair protection feature actually works. Till now I&#x27;m pretty happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Great and easy to use</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and stays hot... I am torn because I loved my Croc straightener (rip) but they are so expensive but this is a close second and the price doesn&#x27;t hurt a bit &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> this product is quite good and leaves hair smooth</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my sister and she absolutely loves it!! It is a great price for a great product and am very happy with my purchase!!</li>
            <li> Great product, straightens hair perfectly, I would never have guessed this was refurbished. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a straightener.</li>
            <li> Good product bought it for my daughter was delivered on time and she&#x27;s happy with it.</li>
            <li> Love it. Just as good as my Chi. Have it at Wal-Mart for like $30 brand new. Wish I would&#x27;ve known that!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with these Remingon flat irons.  Straightens but doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out.</li>
            <li> It works great, I have really thick hair and it feels so smooth after I use it! Much better than my last one and the price is amazing!!</li>
            <li> I received this very Unique Iron in Two Days, the description exceeded what this hair tool really does. Very Impressed!</li>
            <li> I was very nervous at first because it was refurbished, but it ended being way better than  I expected</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron because it was cheaper due the fact that I am an amazon prime member. It was one of those splurge &#x27;one click buy&#x27; moments. I did not read the title fully and did not know until I had already purchased it that this straightener was &#x27;certified refurbished&#x27;. However when I found out I was fine with it. When it arrived I was very happy with the product, it is the best Remmington model I have yet to use (I tend to buy middle-end flat irons because I use them so frequently that I tend to replace them every 6-8 months due to typical wear and tear). It glides across the hair like it&#x27;s a $100 straighter, very impressive. Plus the over all appearance is very attractive, which is an added bonus. I am giving this 2 stars because the last time I used it I noticed that the unit kept turning off, although it was still plugged in and supposed to be working. This happened 3 or more times during my session ( I have thick naturally curly hair so it takes me over an hour to fully straighten). Although it has an automatic one hour shut off, that could not have been the culprit because it was shutting off every 5 minutes towards the end. I had been using this flat iron for about 4 months and although this had been the very first time it had presented an issue I had to chuck it. I can&#x27;t risk having only half my hair straight because it crapped out for good in the middle of me getting ready. I do like this straightener and I did repurchase, but I opted for the brand new model this time around. Although I have no idea if the &#x27;refurbished-ness&#x27; is the reason why this flat iron met it&#x27;s demise, I wasn&#x27;t willing to risk it again.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair straightener on the market. It has a heat sensor so it doesn&#x27;t put out more heat than your hair needs. It also heats up very quickly and you can adjust the temperature as it has a temperature control setting.</li>
            <li> Excellent buy!  Great quality!</li>
            <li> Love it!! the iron works perfect, although I bought befurbished from BeautyHairOnlines, feels and works like new.  straightens your hair very easy and smooth and Heats up very very quickly.</li>
