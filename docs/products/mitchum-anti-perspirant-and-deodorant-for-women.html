    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>but this stuff is still the best.  </li>
            <li>This is the BEST antiperspirant that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Now I have the best of both worlds.</li>
            <li>Works Great!</li>
            <li>and now I&#x27;m a happy girl!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy i can find it on here and in bulk.</li>
            <li>Works great!  </li>
            <li>Awesome scent!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is absolutely great!  </li>
            <li>Best product everrrrr!</li>
            <li>Great price for an excellent product.</li>
            <li>and it was incredible.</li>
            <li>This deodorant is 100% effective and smells like DKNY Be Delicious perfume.</li>
            <li>Works great smells good</li>
            <li>That said, this brand (but not this scent) has provided good protection.  </li>
            <li>Why would they change a good product?  </li>
            <li>but I always wanted to switch to something else because they have a lot of good smelling deodorant</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good price per stick as well.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this product, it works great</li>
            <li>I loved that they don&#x27;t test on animals and that it was effective for sweat and odor.</li>
            <li>if you have a sweating problem, try this for sure!</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this!  </li>
            <li>The product does a good job of preventing perspiration and has a lovely scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still &amp;#34;so effective</li>
            <li>Because its flaking off, it stops being effective and I&#x27;ve noticed wetness and odor.</li>
            <li>I was lucky if it worked for 48 mins!!  </li>
            <li>I have used Mitchum deodorant for women for many years.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many antiperspirants out there.</li>
            <li>works ok but unscented works better.</li>
            <li>I would have to apply more.  </li>
            <li>I love this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>It is also EWG researched and safe.</li>
            <li>you could even skip a day&amp;#34; :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE MITCHUM, and have been using this product for over 20+ years.  </li>
            <li>how many times I launder (looking at you, Dove).</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find this scent in the stores.</li>
            <li>I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>My favorite of the Mitchum line.</li>
            <li>and I love the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Has a very clean smell.</li>
            <li>I purchased this on 22 June, happy to find a source for the OLD formulation of Lady Mitchum.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice but isn&#x27;t too much.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, Amazon is overriding the inability to return this, and sending me a label.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still available online.</li>
            <li>thanks amazon!!!  </li>
            <li>$2.80 each is significantly cheaper than even Walmart.  </li>
            <li>I usually hold the antiperspirant over the sink, because when I pull the lid off a great glob of the gel flies out: better it land in the sink than on the floor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cannot use many deodorants because the aluminum burns under my arms and the healthier products wear off fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After reading these reviews I was concerned that they had changed my tried and true while I was away (and hoping I could come back for good to this Mitchum stuff).</li>
            <li>An overall good brand of deoderant but the flower fresh is overpowering.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know why so many stores are not carrying it where I live.  </li>
            <li>This is the first one that can keep me from smelling without burning!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands and forms of anti-perspirant deodorant and this definitely stays on the longest, keeps my pits cool, and prevents the b/o!</li>
            <li>Love soft smell and assurance of never being offensive because of body odor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not afraid to raise my hand.</li>
            <li>Flower fresh.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t understand how they managed to destroy a perfect product so completely.</li>
            <li>I overheat easily and this keeps me dry and smelling fine!</li>
            <li>Not offensive, not powdery or overly tween girl, right up</li>
            <li>Recently I have found that my favorite scent (Flower Fresh) has been difficult to locate in my local stores, so I was delighted to find it available on Amazon.com for a good price.</li>
            <li>Why did they mess with a good thing???</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find this exact scent in any of my local stores any more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid sweater</li>
            <li>problem is that after opening, when you pull the top off, the vacuum generated pulls product out of the three delivery openings.</li>
            <li>It is said to last 24 hours which is good because sometime I work a double shift.</li>
            <li>Smaller then the regular size so is good for travelling, but also a lot for the price.  </li>
            <li>First, I am not a person who has much perspiration, at all.</li>
            <li>I thought yeah, right, but they live up to their promise.  </li>
            <li>Works very well in the AZ heat.</li>
            <li>or you&#x27;ll push up too much),</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>Okay, I purchased six of these mitchem alleged power gels.</li>
            <li>I do like clear gels better than the white waxy solids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The gel formula is wonderful, as it doesn&#x27;t cake up under your arms, and it&#x27;s clear, so it&#x27;s less likely to get white residue on your clothes.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s impossible to find in stores, and it really is the best!</li>
            <li>Luckily I still had an old bottle to compare...and now I&#x27;m so relieved to report that I see NO DIFFERENCE between the old formula and the new!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a long-term user of Mitchum, so I was tickled to see this in a large size and a new formula.  </li>
            <li>Light, doesn&#x27;t enterfer with other fragrances.</li>
            <li>I also haven&#x27;t had a problem with the new oxygen Mitchum.</li>
            <li>Anyway I have to start searching for a new brand now.</li>
            <li>Got it today, and it&#x27;s the non-functional NEW formulation.  </li>
            <li>This is far superior to Dove or Secret.</li>
            <li>I ordered this hoping that it would be old stock, but this is the new &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; one (not as pictured,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Keeps me dry and fresh</li>
            <li>Mitchum Smart Solid always and forever!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care what they say, they do not go on and stay clear.</li>
            <li>Clear Get that dries fast...never turns white...stays clear....</li>
            <li>the one in the photo is the old version).</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive to everything.  </li>
            <li>Surprised to find it on Amazon...who would think to buy deodorant online?</li>
            <li>I have to wait till it completely dries and then put my shirt on to avoid this.</li>
            <li>The solid version seems to still work, so I&#x27;m using that for now, although I really prefer a gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glad I can buy it on line because it&#x27;s hard to find locally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not afraid to wear black.  </li>
            <li>It not only STAYS CLEAR!</li>
            <li>I am a 30 year old female.  </li>
            <li>I have been a long time, off and on user of this deodorant, and I keep coming back to it because it consistently is the only one that doesn&#x27;t smell funky after I&#x27;ve sweat a bit, and doesn&#x27;t leave a smell on my clothing that won&#x27;t come out no matter</li>

            <li> The new gel leaves dark marks all over my clothing.</li>
            <li> This is my preferred brand of deodorant, the gel can be a bit messy but its clear and doesn&#x27;t show up on clothes.</li>
            <li> No extra drying time (although the new dispenser means you have to go realllyyyy slow</li>
            <li> Once dry it starts flaking off</li>
            <li> Love this product, disappointed can&#x27;t find it in local stores.</li>
            <li> Partly my bad for thinking I was buying &#x27;shower fresh&#x27; but just a warning for people who are sensitive to smells.  </li>
            <li> suppose I could gently work the lid off very slowly and carefully to avoid the problem, but I don&#x27;t have to do this with other antiperspirants</li>
            <li> I try other brands from time to time.  </li>
            <li> The smell lasts all day if you like it but also melts away into your other perfume and isn&#x27;t over powering.</li>
            <li> and they would wear down before the end of the work day</li>
            <li> It also work extremely well without irritating my armpits, which is the only deodorant I&#x27;ve found that does both.</li>
            <li> I mean, what did I have to loose?</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m usually in a hurry in the morning.</li>
            <li> I forced myself to use all six, so I am informed about this product--although I will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I usually purchase my mitchum on the military base, but lately there shelves have been empty, so I decided to try amazon and found it.</li>
            <li> The new &amp;#34;oxygen&amp;#34; formula is horrible, sticky and wet and doesn&#x27;t do anything for wetness OR odor.</li>
            <li> Second, the nasty white residue goes everywhere.</li>
            <li> I hate waste due to poor product design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a previous review has said, Mitchum has recently changed to an &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; version of this product, which works terrible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m secretly stocking up on it</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find the &amp;#34;Flower Fresh&amp;#34; scent in stores</li>
            <li> Fail.  </li>
            <li> About a month ago, however, they inexplicably changed the formula for the worse.</li>
            <li> As a woman who sweats and isn&#x27;t afraid to admit it...</li>
            <li> My wife hate it,produce sticky sued.</li>
            <li> I have to add to the chorus of complaints that this product has been reformulated and is now just awful.</li>

            <li> I try other brands from time to time.  I&#x27;ve tried two of the &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; ones out there but this stuff is still the best.  I overheat easily and this keeps me dry and smelling fine!</li>
            <li> An overall good brand of deoderant but the flower fresh is overpowering.  Just out of the package it set my asthma off.  Partly my bad for thinking I was buying &#x27;shower fresh&#x27; but just a warning for people who are sensitive to smells.  That said, this brand (but not this scent) has provided good protection.  It is said to last 24 hours which is good because sometime I work a double shift.</li>
            <li> I have used Mitchum deodorant for women for many years.  The gel formula is wonderful, as it doesn&#x27;t cake up under your arms, and it&#x27;s clear, so it&#x27;s less likely to get white residue on your clothes.    Recently I have found that my favorite scent (Flower Fresh) has been difficult to locate in my local stores, so I was delighted to find it available on Amazon.com for a good price.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many antiperspirants out there. Certain-Dri, Dove, Degree and a couple others as well. When I saw Mitchum, I thought that I would give it a try. I mean, what did I have to loose? This is the BEST antiperspirant that I have ever used. I don&#x27;t know how it works so well, but it does so if you have a sweating problem, try this for sure! It might just change your life.</li>
            <li> The product does a good job of preventing perspiration and has a lovely scent. I do like clear gels better than the white waxy solids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that after opening, when you pull the top off, the vacuum generated pulls product out of the three delivery openings. I usually hold the antiperspirant over the sink, because when I pull the lid off a great glob of the gel flies out: better it land in the sink than on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose I could gently work the lid off very slowly and carefully to avoid the problem, but I don&#x27;t have to do this with other antiperspirants and I&#x27;m usually in a hurry in the morning. I hate waste due to poor product design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars for the antiperspirant deodorant effectiveness, zero stars for the delivery device effectiveness.</li>
            <li> works ok but unscented works better. This is far superior to Dove or Secret. last way longer than those products too.</li>
            <li> Love soft smell and assurance of never being offensive because of body odor. Never sticky under arms. Never calking. Light, doesn&#x27;t enterfer with other fragrances.</li>
            <li> Now, this is ONLY my opinion. I am a 30 year old female.  I am polish and italian and with degree, suave, dove whatever ones are out there I&#x27;ve tried them all and they would wear down before the end of the work day I would have to apply more.  I don&#x27;t care what they say, they do not go on and stay clear. (For me) I saw the mitchum and decided to give it a try.  It not only STAYS CLEAR! But it lasts ALL day!  I&#x27;m not afraid to raise my hand. I work out in the yard and it works until the days end.  I play sports and it lasts all through the sport!  I&#x27;m not afraid to wear black.  I can once again wear tank tops without the fear of white residue. I love this deodorant!  I am never going back to the others.  Again this is my opinion and it works for me.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant.  It is difficult to find the &amp;#34;Flower Fresh&amp;#34; scent in stores so I only purchase it online. It&#x27;s a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Works very well in the AZ heat.</li>
            <li> My title says it all.  $2.80 each is significantly cheaper than even Walmart.  I intend to continue ordering this through Amazon Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li> Smaller then the regular size so is good for travelling, but also a lot for the price.  Repeat buy item.</li>
            <li> It met my expectations, Thank you</li>
            <li> As a previous review has said, Mitchum has recently changed to an &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; version of this product, which works terrible. It doesn&#x27;t last to the end of one day, never mind the 48 hour labeling on the front.  Why would they change a good product?  I ordered this hoping that it would be old stock, but this is the new &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; one (not as pictured, the one in the photo is the old version).</li>
            <li> I love this!  My skin is sensitive to everything.  I cannot use many deodorants because the aluminum burns under my arms and the healthier products wear off fast. This is the first one that can keep me from smelling without burning! It is also EWG researched and safe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Mitchum for years but I always wanted to switch to something else because they have a lot of good smelling deodorant and I personally wanted a scented deodorant but I didn&#x27;t want to risk it not working as well as Mitchum. Now I have the best of both worlds. It smells nice but isn&#x27;t too much. I also haven&#x27;t had a problem with the new oxygen Mitchum. It&#x27;s still &amp;#34;so effective you could even skip a day&amp;#34; :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to last 48 hrs...I was lucky if it worked for 48 mins!!  Fail.  Mitchum Smart Solid always and forever!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years! Works Great!</li>
            <li> I LOVE MITCHUM, and have been using this product for over 20+ years.  I usually purchase my mitchum on the military base, but lately there shelves have been empty, so I decided to try amazon and found it. Mitchum is the only deodorant I use.</li>
            <li> Great price for an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Clear Get that dries fast...never turns white...stays clear....never sticky...wonderful smell..Flower fresh. Like the fact that I can subscribe to the product so I never run out.</li>
            <li> I did not get what was pictured.  The deodorant pictured is not what I received.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time, off and on user of this deodorant, and I keep coming back to it because it consistently is the only one that doesn&#x27;t smell funky after I&#x27;ve sweat a bit, and doesn&#x27;t leave a smell on my clothing that won&#x27;t come out no matter how many times I launder (looking at you, Dove). Not offensive, not powdery or overly tween girl, right up my alley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading these reviews I was concerned that they had changed my tried and true while I was away (and hoping I could come back for good to this Mitchum stuff). Luckily I still had an old bottle to compare...and now I&#x27;m so relieved to report that I see NO DIFFERENCE between the old formula and the new! No extra drying time (although the new dispenser means you have to go realllyyyy slow or you&#x27;ll push up too much), no change in smell or performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep making this scent, Mitchum!! It&#x27;s impossible to find in stores, and it really is the best!</li>
            <li> I have to add to the chorus of complaints that this product has been reformulated and is now just awful. I used the power gel (pictured) religiously for years and it was incredible. The new &amp;#34;oxygen&amp;#34; formula is horrible, sticky and wet and doesn&#x27;t do anything for wetness OR odor. Total strikeout, I don&#x27;t understand how they managed to destroy a perfect product so completely. Anyway I have to start searching for a new brand now.</li>
            <li> Love this product, disappointed can&#x27;t find it in local stores. thanks amazon!!!  It&#x27;s the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this this &amp; using it daily the 6 last about 6 months....</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this exact scent in any of my local stores any more. I have looked everywhere. Surprised to find it on Amazon...who would think to buy deodorant online? I love the scent of this product, it works great and now I&#x27;m a happy girl!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long-term user of Mitchum, so I was tickled to see this in a large size and a new formula.  I just have to remember to use it sparingly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid sweater and I&#x27;m not ashamed to admit it. I&#x27;ve tried many brands and forms of anti-perspirant deodorant and this definitely stays on the longest, keeps my pits cool, and prevents the b/o!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find this scent in the stores. I&#x27;m very happy i can find it on here and in bulk. I love the scent.  Works great!  It lasted all day.</li>
            <li> Awesome scent!  My favorite of the Mitchum line. Glad I can buy it on line because it&#x27;s hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> I thought yeah, right, but they live up to their promise.  The price is unbeatable for the amount you get.  This will last for about a year.</li>
            <li> Works great smells good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using mitchum deoderant for around 10 years. I loved that they don&#x27;t test on animals and that it was effective for sweat and odor. About a month ago, however, they inexplicably changed the formula for the worse. It now says \\&quot;oxygenated\\&quot; on the label. The new gel leaves dark marks all over my clothing. I have to wait till it completely dries and then put my shirt on to avoid this. Once dry it starts flaking off and I get white flakes on my pants throughout the day. Because its flaking off, it stops being effective and I&#x27;ve noticed wetness and odor. I can&#x27;t reapply mid day, because then I&#x27;d get the marks on my clothing! The solid version seems to still work, so I&#x27;m using that for now, although I really prefer a gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they change the formula back, because I won&#x27;t buy it like this. Why did they mess with a good thing???</li>
            <li> I purchased this on 22 June, happy to find a source for the OLD formulation of Lady Mitchum.  Got it today, and it&#x27;s the non-functional NEW formulation.  Fortunately, Amazon is overriding the inability to return this, and sending me a label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have been warned.</li>
            <li> I must have had a chemical change in my body.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t control the under arm odor with the&lt;br /&gt;roll on I was using.  A friend suggested that Mitchum&lt;br /&gt;was what I needed.  Not on every drug store or grocery&lt;br /&gt;store shelf.  This stuff is absolutely great!  I Strongly&lt;br /&gt;recommend it.</li>
            <li> This really works. Has a very clean smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m secretly stocking up on it so I never have to use anything else EVER again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeps me dry and fresh and I love the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why so many stores are not carrying it where I live.  I&#x27;m just grateful it&#x27;s still available online.</li>
            <li> This is my preferred brand of deodorant, the gel can be a bit messy but its clear and doesn&#x27;t show up on clothes. It also work extremely well without irritating my armpits, which is the only deodorant I&#x27;ve found that does both. It&#x27;s a good price per stick as well.</li>
            <li> My wife hate it,produce sticky sued.</li>
            <li> Okay, I purchased six of these mitchem alleged power gels. I forced myself to use all six, so I am informed about this product--although I will not purchase it again. First, I am not a person who has much perspiration, at all. Yet, I noticed zero reduction in perspiration with this product. Second, the nasty white residue goes everywhere.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is 100% effective and smells like DKNY Be Delicious perfume. The smell lasts all day if you like it but also melts away into your other perfume and isn&#x27;t over powering. This deodorant smell is NOT sold in stores and that is why I buy it in bulk on amazon. I would recommend this deodorant to everyone nd anyone. As a woman who sweats and isn&#x27;t afraid to admit it...this deodorant gets people complimenting me when I sweat, and that&#x27;s saying something. Best product everrrrr!</li>
