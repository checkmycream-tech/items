            <li>All good when the wife was here to help with the socks.</li>
            <li>she tried it and loved it</li>
            <li>Seems to work good.  </li>

            <li>Regaining her independence by putting on her own socks</li>
            <li>when I found it on Amazon now I can put my own scoks on.</li>
            <li>I liked the product it made putting on my socks on a lot easier.</li>
            <li>this sock puller is so handy my mom broke her hip 2 years ago</li>
            <li>Good price, good workmanship, quick service.</li>
            <li>Works great and quickly.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Makes putting socks on very easy.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>

            <li>Now able to put own socks on without assistance</li>
            <li>It works great, price was right</li>
            <li>but now it is easy!  </li>
            <li>It works great and is a great help for someone with lower back problems.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly!!</li>
            <li>Yeah winter in Wisconsin, socks very important.</li>
            <li>You are a genius...and THank You Very Much!!!</li>
            <li>This is a very good aid &amp; so far it has held together.</li>
            <li>This one works much better.</li>
            <li>It is OK</li>
            <li>My husband was able to use it immediately once I showed him how to use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quite satisfied with the product and shipping time.</li>
            <li>The sock has to stretch more than I would have thought, but this allows your foot and ankle to get the sock on without it hanging up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for those who lack the flexibility to be able to put their socks on without a struggle.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better.  </li>
            <li>Of everything I have bought from Amazon this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Much better than ones</li>
            <li>He was amazed to be able to get his sock on all the way in one swoop..</li>
            <li>After a couple of days I was able to get hose on without the device.  </li>
            <li>Plan to buy more for Christmas gifts this year.</li>
            <li>You can shorten the handles, but I have been able to adapt without doing that.</li>
            <li>This worked perfectly for my husband following his hip replacement surgery.</li>
            <li>The price was better here than at the hospital.</li>
            <li>how wonderful it is to gain back some of my independence.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>Many of you can relate I am sure...</li>
            <li>IF I COULD GIVE MORE THEN</li>
            <li>It worked like magic, and she self-taught how to use it.  </li>
            <li>Need to be more flexible.</li>
            <li>I was so glad</li>
            <li>I love him</li>
            <li>It gave me the ability to dress myself; thereby giving me a greater sense of freedom.</li>
            <li>He is able to put his socks on by himself now.</li>
            <li>I love.</li>
            <li>Be sure to get all the sock pulled up on the tube before you start; otherwise, the sock may not be fully pulled into position.</li>
            <li>I just tried it again and no way was I able to put a sock on using this device in spite of the foam handles.</li>
            <li>This device has saved by back so many times!!!  </li>
            <li>Great, since I had 7 rods placed in my back I cannot bend over completely, this is excellent!</li>
            <li>Great idea, simple yet effective.</li>
            <li>Perfect if you have limited mobility.</li>
            <li>I cut some microfiber cloth to fit the inside and glued it with spray glue and it works much better.  </li>
            <li>I like this sock aid better than the smooth one I used in rehab .  </li>
            <li>There were already many choices available.  </li>
            <li>So far it has worked great.</li>
            <li>this gave me a sense of independence, and it was even kind of fun to use it.</li>
            <li>Best money I have ever spent!</li>
            <li>easy way to put on socks</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>and she could not do any bending for 6 weeks, this product made it so easy to put on her socks</li>
            <li>He found it easy to use and loves it.</li>
            <li>it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>The rope comes out of the slots easily when pulling the socks up.</li>
            <li>USE POWDER TO HELP SLIDE EASY .</li>
            <li>IT IS AS EASY</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Easy to use and helps with support stockings as well as socks.</li>
            <li>you have leg issues and your hands are still strong, this might be useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Strong sturdy plastic.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product strongly over others on the market.</li>
            <li>If you are clever you could make your own with plastic milk carton though this plastic is thicker and more rigid that a milk carton.</li>
            <li>and it has been fine for another month now.</li>
            <li>Works just fine.  </li>
            <li>Has worked fine when attempted to use it.</li>
            <li>The sock slides easily onto the smooth surface, and the foam pad keeps the sock on the aid as you pull it onto your foot.</li>
            <li>and I think it will be fine.</li>
            <li>The product is fine.</li>
            <li>It works, but the plastic is too smooth and and too ridged.  </li>
            <li>Simple to use and works great.</li>
            <li>Calf wouldn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>It is available at Walmart in the arts and crafts section.</li>
            <li>Also available at Hobby Lobby.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic for getting the socks on.  </li>
            <li>It takes a while to get the hang of a smooth glide and even then I push the plastic on the rug to force it off my foot.  </li>
            <li>Overall though it&#x27;s so great not to have someone help me or go without socks.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve liked this product so much that I&#x27;ve ordered one for my brother, who is a severe diabetic.</li>
            <li>It has a fabric surface that holds the sock in place even if it is a snug fit.</li>
            <li>VERY SIMPLE &amp; WORKS GREAT.</li>
            <li>The edges are too smooth to hold my sock in place.  </li>
            <li>it dosen&#x27;t slide smooth over my heel</li>
            <li>Great help putting on socks after back surgery.</li>
            <li>It takes practice, but after a few days of using it he thinks it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>Happy to say it is made of the same sturdy quality plastic and foam as that one,</li>
            <li>So far the product works pertty good.  </li>
            <li>Really like this product, easy to train patients to use, easy on the hands and prevent patient from bending over!  </li>
            <li>true replacement for the one given me in hospital that I broke... make getting socks on easy.</li>
            <li>Very simple and very effective.</li>
            <li>socks went onto the gadget easily, didn&#x27;t deform the sock, then onto the foot and over the ankle quick as you please.  </li>
            <li>sock is on foot, amazing product, highly recommend</li>
            <li>This device works perfectly and has proven to be durable.&lt;br /&gt;I am sure it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li>This is another cool gadget that worked out well for mom.</li>
            <li>good product - use it daily</li>
            <li>This gadget is a true gem..</li>
            <li>Overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li>It really helps you be able to put your socks on when you can&#x27;t reach your feet.</li>
            <li>is more of a strength, agility, and coordination issue for a really elderly person.  </li>
            <li>Needed to still be able to put on socks, and this really does the job</li>
            <li>The ropes have not broken &amp; I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>quick fix.  </li>
            <li>Needed a replacement quickly.  </li>
            <li>I had knee replacement surgery and could not bend my knee adequately to put on socks.  </li>
            <li>QUICK, SPEEDY DELIVERY SERVICE</li>
            <li>First for a relative with Parkinson&#x27;s who could no longer put on his own socks - now he can!</li>
            <li>Also I was squeezing it when it first came in to see if my socks would fit and it cracked.  </li>
            <li>very well constructed and easy to use.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see how it holds up over the months, but so far this is a wonderful aid for those that cannot bend down to feet.</li>
            <li>My uncle raves about how much this helps!!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it needs to!</li>
            <li>Works great even for a little sport sock.  </li>
            <li>I must use compression stockings, and the sock aid  really helps to get them on smoothly.</li>
            <li>He has lost most of the feeling in his hands so the soft and over sized &amp;#34;handles&amp;#34; will be helpful to him.  </li>
            <li>Works much better than the soft sided ones they.sell at drug stores.</li>
            <li>I can finally put my own socks on.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>My handicap son can finally put on his own socks.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny to assist in putting on stockings when you can&#x27;t bend to do it.</li>
            <li>Only problem is, my young grandsons think it should be a great jump rope.</li>
            <li>I broke the one the hospital gave me pretty quickly, but this one has lasted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give this to Good Will or other charity.</li>
            <li>UPS delivered the product right on time.  </li>
            <li>One thing that could be improved for me is that if&lt;br /&gt;i use right after taking a shower</li>
            <li>and you know your sock is about to be right in place.</li>
            <li>Now it goes right on.  </li>
            <li>VERY LARGE BOTTOM PLASTIC PART.  </li>
            <li>Sock pulls on more easily than other models I&#x27;ve used.easily</li>
            <li>A simple design and very cost effective.  </li>
            <li>back saver , good quality, helps so much for us old folks !</li>
            <li>Before using this tool, which works exactly as advertised, I had to stretch for about 20 minutes before I tried to put my socks on.</li>
            <li>Exactly what was needed for my elderly neighbor.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s struggled for years and makes her feel so much more independent.</li>
            <li>If you have had orthopedic surgery or otherwise have lower extremity weakness, this simple but ingenious device will step up to the plate for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a review on Amazon where the guy used a strip of felt with hot glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed after my hip surgery.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The directions for this sock aid could have been more specific.</li>
            <li>As an aside, I purchased the product through Amazon from  Surgical Medical Source and received outstanding customer service.</li>
            <li>and she probably would have been willing to keep putting my socks on while my leg was in an immobilizing brace, but</li>
            <li>I tried tying more and larger knots but it still slipped through.  </li>
            <li>For elderly people who have a difficult time bending over to put on socks, this is awesome.</li>
            <li>only make sure your feet are not damp or it will not slide.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly like the one I received from the hospital when I broke my hip.  </li>
            <li>This device works just great; place sock on device, insert foot, pull cords/handles up slowly</li>
            <li>I had back surgery, and the scarring has kept me from being very flexible, especially first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>But the simple and elegant design of this device makes this task effortless and fast.</li>
            <li>I simply glued it back on with silicone adhesive and all is good again.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for a&lt;br /&gt;Quirky solution!</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s able to use this while stretched out on the bed before she transfers to her chair.</li>
            <li>but I can buy 10 of these for less and keep them handy wherever needed.</li>
            <li>Easy pull on and built to last.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a no brainer simple easy to use item.</li>
            <li>I cut a piece of an old bathroom rug and super glued it to the pad spot.  </li>
            <li>Like the other reviewers, she found it easy to use and it works!</li>
            <li>Very high recommendation.</li>
            <li>Only works with huge socks.</li>
            <li>Compression stockings were to much for it.</li>
            <li>Works very well with all socks.</li>
            <li>Expected better product.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>AND HE SAID IT REALLY WORKED.</li>
            <li>It works well with regular socks and light support stocking.  </li>
            <li>This item works very well for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid 4 times as much for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a God send and makes life so much easier</li>
            <li>This really helped putting socks on after injury</li>
            <li>This works very well for my husband.  </li>
            <li>so I have to really stretch my socks to get them onto this device.</li>
            <li>this thing really does work.</li>
            <li>This sock aid works very well.</li>
            <li>It definatley does the job very well.  </li>
            <li>the rope attaches via a knot through a whole in the plastic.  </li>
            <li>I used it primarily for white athletic socks</li>
            <li>I was given this Built Up Handle Sock Aid and found it was very user friendlly.</li>
            <li>Just gently slide. .</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>Really like having the two separate handles (instead of one handle looped), which allows me to miss the incision site.  </li>
            <li>This one is very sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my mother who has a real issue getting her socks on in the morning.  </li>
            <li>She said it&#x27;s SO much easier to get those socks on with this thing, so</li>
            <li>Too much going on with surgeries to take the time to return it.</li>
            <li>It is challenging for me to pull the knee high socks up the rest of the way since I have limited strength in my hands, as well.</li>
            <li>This handy tool even works with those darn tight surgical hose with a little bit of work, but huge success.  </li>
            <li>As long as you have the strength to load a sock onto the sock aid, it should work fine.  </li>
            <li>I could not live as easily without it.  </li>
            <li>Easy and very simple, ropes are stronger which makes this particular aid better than others I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>Once I get it partially on, it slides easily.  </li>
            <li>I would have gladly given this a 5 star rating except for the black pad falling off after one week.</li>
            <li>Way too wide for ladies&#x27; socks and not all that easy for men&#x27;s sox either.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the problem is this particular sock aid, I think pulling anything over her heel would cause her discomfort.  </li>
            <li>last time that I was in the hospital they had me try one similar to this, it was made of a thinner more flexible plastic and worked quite well.</li>
            <li>and the most recent one for a friend who had some of the vertebrae in his back fused.  </li>
            <li>The price is right, too - much cheaper than a medical supply store.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommended to others needing assistance with putting on their socks.</li>
            <li>Recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone who experiences difficulty with their socks.  </li>
            <li>One is a little more flexible, which works well for socks.  </li>
            <li>Extremely useful for putting socks on for anyone who has had recent surgery or just needs help to put their socks on.  </li>
            <li>This little device is easy to use, very compact, and puts my socks on perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better to put on completely dry and not recently washed feet.  </li>
            <li>Simple enough to use, and easy to hide away.  </li>
            <li>makes a big difference getting my right sock or stocking</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live with out it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>After reading the new info.on this item I read that now it won&#x27;t come off,  Guess what, still doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>I gave mine to him and ordered a new one.</li>
            <li>If you have hip or knee issues and can&#x27;t get your socks on, you can&#x27;t live without this gadget.</li>
            <li>I even told a physical therapist about it since they just had three relatives injured who may be interested in.</li>
            <li>This is by far the neatest product EVER!  </li>
            <li>Be aware that due to the width of the tube, this device might stretch the top of some socks, especially if you use the same pair with the sock aid over and over.</li>
            <li>Easily puts socks on with little effort.</li>
            <li>To improve performance, you need to put some cheap hand lotion down the front of the tube, each time you use it.  </li>
            <li>Works well so far but the plastic size is pretty darn big for women&#x27;s socks.. may stretch them all out after a while.</li>
            <li>After A YEAR AND MANY USES IT STARTED TO CRACK DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE PLASTIC, BUT HE WANTED TO FIND ANOTHER ONE JUST LIKE IT.</li>
            <li>It is  made of very sturdy hard plastic material with a smooth finish that will not damage your clothes.</li>
            <li>She was sceptical but after a few tries is able to use it and gained a little more independence.</li>
            <li>The plastic is heavy and is smooth around the edges...</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 85 year old father who had hip replacement surgery.  </li>
            <li>Would be really helpful following hip replacement.  </li>
            <li>As an old man, I needed help with my socks.</li>
            <li>66 years old.</li>
            <li>purchased for 90 year young Mother.  </li>
            <li>My mother wore out her old one I and found this identical one on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Simple to use and very well designed.</li>
            <li>MY EIGHTY YEAR OLD DAD CAN FINISH DRESSING</li>
            <li>I know there are various aids available on the market, and it&#x27;s hard to know what might be the right thing.  </li>
            <li>So for me no more waiting for someone to put my sock on for me because now I can easily do it all by my self!😀</li>
            <li>finds it so easy to put on her socks with and stresses her back less.</li>
            <li>After using the original one for a year it broke, using compression stockings everyday.  </li>
            <li>Small black pad on back does help hold sock up while pulling the your sock on, but it could be a little more effective because the sock does not always stay on the device allowing it to be pulled all the way up.</li>
            <li>Works great till the black pad comes off than its not great but still works.</li>
            <li>Normal socks will not stretch enough.</li>
            <li>Strong, hard, and will not bend.</li>
            <li>I ordered the new one because it was starting to split.</li>
            <li>I got this for my husband who was injured in an accident, leg &amp; ankle full of plates &amp; screws, ankle is stiff &amp; he cannot straighten it out.  </li>
            <li>This simple device really gave me back my independence after my hip replacement surgery.  </li>
            <li>Finally had hip surgery and was lent one of these sock aids - WOW!  </li>
            <li>I AM HANDICAP &amp; PUTTING ON SOCKS IS VERY HARD FOR ME ( NOT ANY MORE ).</li>
            <li>It is a bit more difficult for the thigh high stockings, but the knee highs and any socks work well with the aid.</li>
            <li>This is a must have and works great for those who have bad backs or hip and leg issues.</li>
            <li>Apparently these sock aids come in sizes.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised how simple it was to use.</li>
            <li>Really nice product, but not perfect yet.</li>
            <li>to pull the sock all the way onto the device and leave just a tiny bit of toe not tight on top.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a simple device, I&#x27;m surprised it costs as much as it does especially with the minimal instructions.</li>
            <li>I tried out a couple of other types that cost twice as much and didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>I ordered the one that said &amp;#34;super&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s for people who have really fat feet and very wide socks.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the sock has a lot left above the toes and I use another tool to pull the sock on completely.</li>
            <li>Substantially less expensive than what the hospital was trying to sell me, but just as successful.  </li>
            <li>Small price to pay, for something so useful</li>
            <li>This takes some practice getting the sock onto the implement the first few tmes.  </li>
            <li>Recently had major back surgery and cannot bend to put socks/shoes on.</li>
            <li>The width of the &amp;#34;half-tube&amp;#34; is a little wider than necessary for me (but I realize it has to be &amp;#34;one-size fits all.&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>and I have to use a slight wiggling motion instead of pulling straight to get the sock on.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t go anywhere and didn&#x27;t need socks for the first few weeks following knee replacement surgery.  </li>
            <li>If I need to put on a pair of socks early, I was unable to do it easily, if at all.</li>
            <li>If you have trouble putting on your socks or stockings, you certainly should get this sock aid.</li>
            <li>I use a little bit of powder and the socks slide on real easly.</li>
            <li>Although the foam handles and thick strings are nice features, the sock aide is hard for me to use.</li>

            <li> Arrived quickly!!</li>
            <li> Yeah winter in Wisconsin, socks very important.</li>
            <li> You are a genius...and THank You Very Much!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very good aid &amp; so far it has held together.</li>
            <li> This one works much better.</li>
            <li> It is OK</li>
            <li> My husband was able to use it immediately once I showed him how to use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quite satisfied with the product and shipping time.</li>
            <li> The sock has to stretch more than I would have thought, but this allows your foot and ankle to get the sock on without it hanging up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for those who lack the flexibility to be able to put their socks on without a struggle.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s better.  </li>
            <li> Of everything I have bought from Amazon this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Much better than ones</li>
            <li> He was amazed to be able to get his sock on all the way in one swoop..</li>
            <li> After a couple of days I was able to get hose on without the device.  </li>
            <li> Plan to buy more for Christmas gifts this year.</li>
            <li> You can shorten the handles, but I have been able to adapt without doing that.</li>
            <li> This worked perfectly for my husband following his hip replacement surgery.</li>
            <li> The price was better here than at the hospital.</li>
            <li> how wonderful it is to gain back some of my independence.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> Many of you can relate I am sure...</li>
            <li> IF I COULD GIVE MORE THEN</li>
            <li> It worked like magic, and she self-taught how to use it.  </li>
            <li> Need to be more flexible.</li>
            <li> I was so glad</li>
            <li> I love him</li>
            <li> It gave me the ability to dress myself; thereby giving me a greater sense of freedom.</li>
            <li> He is able to put his socks on by himself now.</li>
            <li> I love.</li>
            <li> Be sure to get all the sock pulled up on the tube before you start; otherwise, the sock may not be fully pulled into position.</li>
            <li> I just tried it again and no way was I able to put a sock on using this device in spite of the foam handles.</li>
            <li> This device has saved by back so many times!!!  </li>
            <li> Great, since I had 7 rods placed in my back I cannot bend over completely, this is excellent!</li>
            <li> Great idea, simple yet effective.</li>
            <li> Perfect if you have limited mobility.</li>
            <li> I cut some microfiber cloth to fit the inside and glued it with spray glue and it works much better.  </li>
            <li> I like this sock aid better than the smooth one I used in rehab .  </li>
            <li> There were already many choices available.  </li>
            <li> So far it has worked great.</li>
            <li> this gave me a sense of independence, and it was even kind of fun to use it.</li>
            <li> Best money I have ever spent!</li>
            <li> easy way to put on socks</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> and she could not do any bending for 6 weeks, this product made it so easy to put on her socks</li>
            <li> He found it easy to use and loves it.</li>
            <li> it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> The rope comes out of the slots easily when pulling the socks up.</li>
            <li> USE POWDER TO HELP SLIDE EASY .</li>
            <li> IT IS AS EASY</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Easy to use and helps with support stockings as well as socks.</li>
            <li> you have leg issues and your hands are still strong, this might be useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Strong sturdy plastic.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product strongly over others on the market.</li>
            <li> If you are clever you could make your own with plastic milk carton though this plastic is thicker and more rigid that a milk carton.</li>
            <li> and it has been fine for another month now.</li>
            <li> Works just fine.  </li>
            <li> Has worked fine when attempted to use it.</li>
            <li> The sock slides easily onto the smooth surface, and the foam pad keeps the sock on the aid as you pull it onto your foot.</li>
            <li> and I think it will be fine.</li>
            <li> The product is fine.</li>
            <li> It works, but the plastic is too smooth and and too ridged.  </li>
            <li> Simple to use and works great.</li>
            <li> Calf wouldn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> It is available at Walmart in the arts and crafts section.</li>
            <li> Also available at Hobby Lobby.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic for getting the socks on.  </li>
            <li> It takes a while to get the hang of a smooth glide and even then I push the plastic on the rug to force it off my foot.  </li>
            <li> Overall though it&#x27;s so great not to have someone help me or go without socks.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve liked this product so much that I&#x27;ve ordered one for my brother, who is a severe diabetic.</li>
            <li> It has a fabric surface that holds the sock in place even if it is a snug fit.</li>
            <li> VERY SIMPLE &amp; WORKS GREAT.</li>
            <li> The edges are too smooth to hold my sock in place.  </li>
            <li> it dosen&#x27;t slide smooth over my heel</li>
            <li> Great help putting on socks after back surgery.</li>
            <li> It takes practice, but after a few days of using it he thinks it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Happy to say it is made of the same sturdy quality plastic and foam as that one,</li>
            <li> So far the product works pertty good.  </li>
            <li> Really like this product, easy to train patients to use, easy on the hands and prevent patient from bending over!  </li>
            <li> true replacement for the one given me in hospital that I broke... make getting socks on easy.</li>
            <li> Very simple and very effective.</li>
            <li> socks went onto the gadget easily, didn&#x27;t deform the sock, then onto the foot and over the ankle quick as you please.  </li>
            <li> sock is on foot, amazing product, highly recommend</li>
            <li> This device works perfectly and has proven to be durable.&lt;br /&gt;I am sure it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is another cool gadget that worked out well for mom.</li>
            <li> good product - use it daily</li>
            <li> This gadget is a true gem..</li>
            <li> Overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li> It really helps you be able to put your socks on when you can&#x27;t reach your feet.</li>
            <li> is more of a strength, agility, and coordination issue for a really elderly person.  </li>
            <li> Needed to still be able to put on socks, and this really does the job</li>
            <li> The ropes have not broken &amp; I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> quick fix.  </li>
            <li> Needed a replacement quickly.  </li>
            <li> I had knee replacement surgery and could not bend my knee adequately to put on socks.  </li>
            <li> QUICK, SPEEDY DELIVERY SERVICE</li>
            <li> First for a relative with Parkinson&#x27;s who could no longer put on his own socks - now he can!</li>
            <li> Also I was squeezing it when it first came in to see if my socks would fit and it cracked.  </li>
            <li> very well constructed and easy to use.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how it holds up over the months, but so far this is a wonderful aid for those that cannot bend down to feet.</li>
            <li> My uncle raves about how much this helps!!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it needs to!</li>
            <li> Works great even for a little sport sock.  </li>
            <li> I must use compression stockings, and the sock aid  really helps to get them on smoothly.</li>
            <li> He has lost most of the feeling in his hands so the soft and over sized &amp;#34;handles&amp;#34; will be helpful to him.  </li>
            <li> Works much better than the soft sided ones they.sell at drug stores.</li>
            <li> I can finally put my own socks on.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> My handicap son can finally put on his own socks.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny to assist in putting on stockings when you can&#x27;t bend to do it.</li>
            <li> Only problem is, my young grandsons think it should be a great jump rope.</li>
            <li> I broke the one the hospital gave me pretty quickly, but this one has lasted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give this to Good Will or other charity.</li>
            <li> UPS delivered the product right on time.  </li>
            <li> One thing that could be improved for me is that if&lt;br /&gt;i use right after taking a shower</li>
            <li> and you know your sock is about to be right in place.</li>
            <li> Now it goes right on.  </li>
            <li> VERY LARGE BOTTOM PLASTIC PART.  </li>
            <li> Sock pulls on more easily than other models I&#x27;ve used.easily</li>
            <li> A simple design and very cost effective.  </li>
            <li> back saver , good quality, helps so much for us old folks !</li>
            <li> Before using this tool, which works exactly as advertised, I had to stretch for about 20 minutes before I tried to put my socks on.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was needed for my elderly neighbor.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s struggled for years and makes her feel so much more independent.</li>
            <li> If you have had orthopedic surgery or otherwise have lower extremity weakness, this simple but ingenious device will step up to the plate for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a review on Amazon where the guy used a strip of felt with hot glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed after my hip surgery.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The directions for this sock aid could have been more specific.</li>
            <li> As an aside, I purchased the product through Amazon from  Surgical Medical Source and received outstanding customer service.</li>
            <li> and she probably would have been willing to keep putting my socks on while my leg was in an immobilizing brace, but</li>
            <li> I tried tying more and larger knots but it still slipped through.  </li>
            <li> For elderly people who have a difficult time bending over to put on socks, this is awesome.</li>
            <li> only make sure your feet are not damp or it will not slide.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly like the one I received from the hospital when I broke my hip.  </li>
            <li> This device works just great; place sock on device, insert foot, pull cords/handles up slowly</li>
            <li> I had back surgery, and the scarring has kept me from being very flexible, especially first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> But the simple and elegant design of this device makes this task effortless and fast.</li>
            <li> I simply glued it back on with silicone adhesive and all is good again.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for a&lt;br /&gt;Quirky solution!</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s able to use this while stretched out on the bed before she transfers to her chair.</li>
            <li> but I can buy 10 of these for less and keep them handy wherever needed.</li>
            <li> Easy pull on and built to last.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a no brainer simple easy to use item.</li>
            <li> I cut a piece of an old bathroom rug and super glued it to the pad spot.  </li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers, she found it easy to use and it works!</li>
            <li> Very high recommendation.</li>
            <li> Only works with huge socks.</li>
            <li> Compression stockings were to much for it.</li>
            <li> Works very well with all socks.</li>
            <li> Expected better product.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> AND HE SAID IT REALLY WORKED.</li>
            <li> It works well with regular socks and light support stocking.  </li>
            <li> This item works very well for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid 4 times as much for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a God send and makes life so much easier</li>
            <li> This really helped putting socks on after injury</li>
            <li> This works very well for my husband.  </li>
            <li> so I have to really stretch my socks to get them onto this device.</li>
            <li> this thing really does work.</li>
            <li> This sock aid works very well.</li>
            <li> It definatley does the job very well.  </li>
            <li> the rope attaches via a knot through a whole in the plastic.  </li>
            <li> I used it primarily for white athletic socks</li>
            <li> I was given this Built Up Handle Sock Aid and found it was very user friendlly.</li>
            <li> Just gently slide. .</li>
            <li> SO MUCH</li>
            <li> Really like having the two separate handles (instead of one handle looped), which allows me to miss the incision site.  </li>
            <li> This one is very sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my mother who has a real issue getting her socks on in the morning.  </li>
            <li> She said it&#x27;s SO much easier to get those socks on with this thing, so</li>
            <li> Too much going on with surgeries to take the time to return it.</li>
            <li> It is challenging for me to pull the knee high socks up the rest of the way since I have limited strength in my hands, as well.</li>
            <li> This handy tool even works with those darn tight surgical hose with a little bit of work, but huge success.  </li>
            <li> As long as you have the strength to load a sock onto the sock aid, it should work fine.  </li>
            <li> I could not live as easily without it.  </li>
            <li> Easy and very simple, ropes are stronger which makes this particular aid better than others I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Once I get it partially on, it slides easily.  </li>
            <li> I would have gladly given this a 5 star rating except for the black pad falling off after one week.</li>
            <li> Way too wide for ladies&#x27; socks and not all that easy for men&#x27;s sox either.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the problem is this particular sock aid, I think pulling anything over her heel would cause her discomfort.  </li>
            <li> last time that I was in the hospital they had me try one similar to this, it was made of a thinner more flexible plastic and worked quite well.</li>
            <li> and the most recent one for a friend who had some of the vertebrae in his back fused.  </li>
            <li> The price is right, too - much cheaper than a medical supply store.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommended to others needing assistance with putting on their socks.</li>
            <li> Recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone who experiences difficulty with their socks.  </li>
            <li> One is a little more flexible, which works well for socks.  </li>
            <li> Extremely useful for putting socks on for anyone who has had recent surgery or just needs help to put their socks on.  </li>
            <li> This little device is easy to use, very compact, and puts my socks on perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better to put on completely dry and not recently washed feet.  </li>
            <li> Simple enough to use, and easy to hide away.  </li>
            <li> makes a big difference getting my right sock or stocking</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live with out it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading the new info.on this item I read that now it won&#x27;t come off,  Guess what, still doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I gave mine to him and ordered a new one.</li>
            <li> If you have hip or knee issues and can&#x27;t get your socks on, you can&#x27;t live without this gadget.</li>
            <li> I even told a physical therapist about it since they just had three relatives injured who may be interested in.</li>
            <li> This is by far the neatest product EVER!  </li>
            <li> Be aware that due to the width of the tube, this device might stretch the top of some socks, especially if you use the same pair with the sock aid over and over.</li>
            <li> Easily puts socks on with little effort.</li>
            <li> To improve performance, you need to put some cheap hand lotion down the front of the tube, each time you use it.  </li>
            <li> Works well so far but the plastic size is pretty darn big for women&#x27;s socks.. may stretch them all out after a while.</li>
            <li> After A YEAR AND MANY USES IT STARTED TO CRACK DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE PLASTIC, BUT HE WANTED TO FIND ANOTHER ONE JUST LIKE IT.</li>
            <li> It is  made of very sturdy hard plastic material with a smooth finish that will not damage your clothes.</li>
            <li> She was sceptical but after a few tries is able to use it and gained a little more independence.</li>
            <li> The plastic is heavy and is smooth around the edges...</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 85 year old father who had hip replacement surgery.  </li>
            <li> Would be really helpful following hip replacement.  </li>
            <li> As an old man, I needed help with my socks.</li>
            <li> 66 years old.</li>
            <li> purchased for 90 year young Mother.  </li>
            <li> My mother wore out her old one I and found this identical one on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Simple to use and very well designed.</li>
            <li> MY EIGHTY YEAR OLD DAD CAN FINISH DRESSING</li>
            <li> I know there are various aids available on the market, and it&#x27;s hard to know what might be the right thing.  </li>
            <li> So for me no more waiting for someone to put my sock on for me because now I can easily do it all by my self!😀</li>
            <li> finds it so easy to put on her socks with and stresses her back less.</li>
            <li> After using the original one for a year it broke, using compression stockings everyday.  </li>
            <li> Small black pad on back does help hold sock up while pulling the your sock on, but it could be a little more effective because the sock does not always stay on the device allowing it to be pulled all the way up.</li>
            <li> Works great till the black pad comes off than its not great but still works.</li>
            <li> Normal socks will not stretch enough.</li>
            <li> Strong, hard, and will not bend.</li>
            <li> I ordered the new one because it was starting to split.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband who was injured in an accident, leg &amp; ankle full of plates &amp; screws, ankle is stiff &amp; he cannot straighten it out.  </li>
            <li> This simple device really gave me back my independence after my hip replacement surgery.  </li>
            <li> Finally had hip surgery and was lent one of these sock aids - WOW!  </li>
            <li> I AM HANDICAP &amp; PUTTING ON SOCKS IS VERY HARD FOR ME ( NOT ANY MORE ).</li>
            <li> It is a bit more difficult for the thigh high stockings, but the knee highs and any socks work well with the aid.</li>
            <li> This is a must have and works great for those who have bad backs or hip and leg issues.</li>
            <li> Apparently these sock aids come in sizes.</li>
            <li> and I was surprised how simple it was to use.</li>
            <li> Really nice product, but not perfect yet.</li>
            <li> to pull the sock all the way onto the device and leave just a tiny bit of toe not tight on top.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a simple device, I&#x27;m surprised it costs as much as it does especially with the minimal instructions.</li>
            <li> I tried out a couple of other types that cost twice as much and didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I ordered the one that said &amp;#34;super&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s for people who have really fat feet and very wide socks.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the sock has a lot left above the toes and I use another tool to pull the sock on completely.</li>
            <li> Substantially less expensive than what the hospital was trying to sell me, but just as successful.  </li>
            <li> Small price to pay, for something so useful</li>
            <li> This takes some practice getting the sock onto the implement the first few tmes.  </li>
            <li> Recently had major back surgery and cannot bend to put socks/shoes on.</li>
            <li> The width of the &amp;#34;half-tube&amp;#34; is a little wider than necessary for me (but I realize it has to be &amp;#34;one-size fits all.&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> and I have to use a slight wiggling motion instead of pulling straight to get the sock on.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t go anywhere and didn&#x27;t need socks for the first few weeks following knee replacement surgery.  </li>
            <li> If I need to put on a pair of socks early, I was unable to do it easily, if at all.</li>
            <li> If you have trouble putting on your socks or stockings, you certainly should get this sock aid.</li>
            <li> I use a little bit of powder and the socks slide on real easly.</li>
            <li> Although the foam handles and thick strings are nice features, the sock aide is hard for me to use.</li>
            <li> More difficult to use (but less than pulling with your hands) with high compression socks and stocking.  </li>
            <li> This little gadget does a fairly decent job.</li>
            <li> THE PAD DOES NOT LAST LONG AND CAN NOT BE REPLACED</li>
            <li> It is too wide for my socks that it barely fits.  </li>
            <li> I have a larger sock aid with scallops along the two long edges of the tube.</li>
            <li> It used to take him a long time to get his left sock on.  </li>
            <li> Got it for my elderly mother, you slip the sock onto the end of the plastic, hold the handles, place the product down near your foot and slip your foot into your sock.</li>
            <li> Makes a difficult procedure easy.</li>
            <li> Had to loop the rope completely around the hole which changed the design slightly.  </li>
            <li> After five back surgeries , it is difficult to bend over so this sock on aid really helps an old person get his socks on..</li>
            <li> We bought this device for my 92 year old father who has trouble bending and wasn&#x27;t putting on socks.</li>
            <li> would make any excuse not to wear this...</li>
            <li> different than i expected.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s well built to last a long time.</li>
            <li> Due to recent surgery on both of my shoulders, I have difficulty putting on my socks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this would be an issue for using a single hand other than getting both handles together at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Harder to put on long elastic pressure stockings and did not work with booties.</li>
            <li> They tend to stretch but remain stretched so using this might make for some very loose socks.</li>
            <li> Had back surgery and had to wear a brace so could not reach down to get my socks on.  </li>
            <li> My husband has had the kids put his socks on for the last year and half</li>
            <li> It comes with a foam piece that you need to stick to outside of half cylinder.</li>
            <li> If my feet are wet or even dry but have had all the oils washed off them when I go to pull the sock onto my foot the plastic sticks to the bottom of my foot</li>
            <li> When I received the product I thought it was way too big, but after use I think it could be a little wider.  </li>
            <li> YOURS IS MADE THE SAME AND APPEARS TO BE A LITTLE STRONGER PLASTIC.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> but socks don&#x27;t slide as expected.  </li>
            <li> Slipping your socks on is a cinch.</li>
            <li> a simple solution to an everyday problem.</li>
            <li> Not as wide as what I got in pt</li>
            <li> A total waste of money</li>
            <li> The knot kept slipping through the hole.  </li>
            <li> I had to retie it to keep it from slipping off.</li>
            <li> The end you attach the sock to is too wide.  </li>
            <li> I have wide, duck-like feet</li>
            <li> The sock slid onto my foot each time and up around my ankle with minimal effort although I was using a handle in each of my hands.  </li>
            <li> Though this is a simple device, it works well and is quite helpful to me since I have trouble bending my knee and hip because of arthritis.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> So now I have to be careful not to snag the part of the rope inside the plastic</li>
            <li> It works as well as expected.</li>
            <li> This item is wide - it needs to be to place your foot inside.</li>
            <li> No more cold feet and feeling dependent for one more thing.</li>
            <li> This is a tool that is a boon for those who have difficulty bending over to put on socks, due to a hip replacement or other cause.</li>
            <li> I fought with my socks for months and months due to a developing hip problem</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned after I read the review about having problems using it by someone with wide feet.</li>
            <li> the therapeutic socks I use could not stretch enough to go over the device, so it was too hard to get the socks on.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m preparing for a total hip replacement in a few days, I was told I would need a sock aid for the 8 to 12 weeks of hip precautions, when I can&#x27;t bend over past 90 degrees.</li>
            <li> Only complaint:  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this until it was too late to send back.  </li>
            <li> Took a few tries to get the hang of.</li>
            <li> Elderly who cannot bend much at the hip also face the problem of placing it on the floor or blindly throwing it down on the floor and lining it up to get foot in it.  </li>
            <li> Due to a medical condition it is very difficult for me to put my sox on but thanks to this little device</li>
            <li> I recommend it for those of us who can&#x27;t reach down to put on socks anymore.</li>
            <li> My father in law couldn&#x27;t bend down to put socks</li>
            <li> , i had it down pat.</li>
            <li> The sock aid helps me a lot,because I cannot bend down do to hip surgery.</li>
            <li> Due to an accident I am temporarily disabled.</li>
            <li> Also a little narrow for my wide foot.</li>
            <li> Works well when the black paste on stays put.  </li>
            <li> Cracked in half when put compression sock on it.  </li>
            <li> At first it IS \\&quot;too wide\\&quot; (per bad review), but modifying the end by cutting it down as same shape &amp; sanding the edges with 80-120grit+/- helps keep sock on item to get sock on foot very well.</li>
            <li> Still need to pull the sock up all the way tight but does do what it is intended to do.</li>
            <li> It was a little snug around my foot, but in no way did it feel overly binding or too tight.  </li>
            <li> Every little bit helps.</li>
            <li> Maybe a little heaver plastic on the front would help.</li>
            <li> Hurt my ankle a little</li>
            <li> It does take a little bit to figure it out , but it does work.</li>
            <li> the unit could be a little longer the adhesive that holds the fabric that catches your sock pulls off after 3 uses</li>
            <li> I had surgery on one of my knees and fell and sprain the knee on the other leg, and I have lupus, so my knees are stiff all the time because of the lupus and arthritis, so I have a hard time putting on my shoes because I have gained a lot of weight due to being on the steroids for the Lupus.</li>
            <li> so I was a little concerned if the aid would be too narrow.  </li>
            <li> Recent thumb surgery made slipping on socks difficult for my spouse.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> The sponge goes approximately 1 inch above the bottom edge of the sock aid.</li>
            <li> item works just like in the utube video, after watching the video a few times</li>
            <li> The product would probably work for a person with narrow feet.</li>
            <li> Got this for my father who has trouble bending.</li>
            <li> This model is firm plastic</li>
            <li> included.&lt;br /&gt;The aid is constructed of heavy, durable plastic and</li>
            <li> TO GET HIS SOCKS ON WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE.  </li>
            <li> and she has trouble getting her socks</li>
            <li> Because I have a replacement hip I am not able to reach down to get my socks on.</li>
            <li> The edges are hard and sharp leading me to believe that some of my support stockings could tear otherwise</li>
            <li> I am unable to bent over due to a back operation.</li>
            <li> My bad back and arthritic fingers made putting on socks a daily ordeal.</li>
            <li> With my muscle condition, which makes putting on my own socks impossible, it is also impossible for me to do Step1, pull the socks over this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plastic is too slick.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with my back and bending is difficult.  </li>
            <li> Too small for me and</li>
            <li> Too small for my husbands calfs.  </li>
            <li> My Mom was not able to bend her knee (before the surgery), and was waiting for her neighbor to come and help her with the sock.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well for small footed persons with small socks.  </li>
            <li> Unable to remove paper on the back of the rubber pad to affix it to the sock aide.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why people complain that it does not take off your sock because the description never said that it would.</li>
            <li> I found no need at this time for using the small foam pad</li>
            <li> Also not sure why people say the rope breaks because there is no need to pull hard.</li>
            <li> I have a very wide foot, and find it a little difficult to get my foot into the the device without pushing the sock off.  </li>
            <li> He finds this hard to place the sock on it.&lt;br /&gt;Mickey</li>
            <li> After bi-lateral knee replacement it is hard to put on a pair of socks.</li>
            <li> He is elderly and has a hard time with putting on his socks.  </li>
            <li> It might be we&#x27;re using it wrong, the instructions that came with it are minimal</li>
            <li> After that it loses it&#x27;s ability to stick.  </li>
            <li> It sucks to have to have help putting socks on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other types of sock helpers that were difficult to put on and fell apart in a month.</li>
            <li> Not to be mean</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is useless to me, and the return will cost over half of the purchase price.  </li>
            <li> Maybe not good for people with arthritic hands.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product to help me put my socks on, as I have a bad hip and it took so long to put on my socks and by the time I was done, I was exhausted.  </li>
            <li> Very stiff and difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> Very clumsy.</li>
            <li> My poor husband had to assist me whenever he was home.</li>
            <li> Designed by Chinese idiots who never bothered to try it out before going into production.</li>
            <li> You can never appreciate a device like this until you&#x27;ve broken a hip or leg with this</li>
            <li> It was frustrating to the point of tears.  </li>
            <li> Need to wear tight compression socks and have a bad hip.  </li>
            <li> Just got this item- was skeptical but</li>
            <li> Product is made of a ridged plastic that makes it difficult to slide the stocking onto it, when sliding the device onto the foot and over the heal the stocking slides off before it passes over</li>
            <li> bought this item for my Mom who is unable to bend forward to put on socks.</li>
            <li> and I am unable to get the sock on correctly.  </li>
            <li> He was quite cynical about it working.  </li>
            <li> disappointing.</li>
            <li> After having 7 joint replacements and revisions, I&#x27;m unable to bend, being afraid to either subluxate or dislocate!  </li>
            <li> I had another type that frustrated me by making me work like crazy to get my socks on.</li>
            <li> After having hip replacement surgery, it was very difficult to put the Ted Stockings on.</li>
            <li> I got this contraption for a friend of mine who is a paraplegic and is having to wear support socks, VERY difficult and time consuming to get on under the circumstances.  </li>
            <li> Very difficult to put sock on &amp;#34;aid&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> They are painful, not helpful.</li>
            <li> my painful morning ritual is over.  </li>
            <li> When I wanted to wear socks, I found it very painful and difficult to bend my leg to get on socks.  </li>
            <li> I have another one with the base is flexible plastic with 3 sections (like a fork) and is covered with a terry cloth material.  </li>
            <li> I have CMT and my feet can be very painful to the touch.</li>
            <li> This is worthless!!!!!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very handy and does the job.</li>
            <li> It works, but the plastic is too smooth and and too ridged.  I have another one with the base is flexible plastic with 3 sections (like a fork) and is covered with a terry cloth material.  This one works much better.</li>
            <li> This product made my husband very satisfied.  He didn&#x27;t like the fact I had to help him put on ;his socks and shoes.  This product gave him the ability to do his own socks.  He used shoes that fastened by Velcro, so this product made him feel independent again.</li>
            <li> This one is my third and is a gift for my father in law who is 89.  My others have a slightly smaller &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34; and work well.  He has lost most of the feeling in his hands so the soft and over sized &amp;#34;handles&amp;#34; will be helpful to him.  A good product which lasts. I recommend it for those of us who can&#x27;t reach down to put on socks anymore.</li>
            <li> Helped with regular sox. Compression stockings were to much for it. Every little bit helps. Maybe a little heaver plastic on the front would help.</li>
            <li> My father in law couldn&#x27;t bend down to put socks and so he didn&#x27;t wear socks.  I bought him this and he is so happy to wear socks again!  It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  Good value</li>
            <li> had to make modifications</li>
            <li> Great, since I had 7 rods placed in my back I cannot bend over completely, this is excellent!</li>
            <li> easy way to put on socks if you have a a handicap</li>
            <li> very well constructed and easy to use. Since I have hip problems .. bending and putting on socks was a nightmare. My poor husband had to assist me whenever he was home. If he wasn&#x27;t then I had to wait until I could manage to get them on by myself. This tool is a God send.!</li>
            <li> This is worthless!!!!!  The cords stretch and the knots come through the plastic.  Takes forever to get the sock on the damn thing.  Designed by Chinese idiots who never bothered to try it out before going into production.</li>
            <li> Tom rota-tor cuffs made putting on socks agony, this thing is the bee&#x27;s knee&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This is a tool that is a boon for those who have difficulty bending over to put on socks, due to a hip replacement or other cause.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Easy to use. A necessity for anyone undergoing hip surgery.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I now no longer have to wait for someone to help me put on my socks. No more cold feet and feeling dependent for one more thing. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works very well with all socks. Easy and very simple, ropes are stronger which makes this particular aid better than others I have used in the past. Would highly recommended to others needing assistance with putting on their socks.</li>
            <li> Of all the sock aid devices out there,this is the simplest and best one.  To improve performance, you need to put some cheap hand lotion down the front of the tube, each time you use it.  Small price to pay, for something so useful</li>
            <li> It works as advertised. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> A must for anyone who has a problem putting on their socks.  Simple to use and works great.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  Helps putting ON socks on affected leg with joint problem.  Does NOTHING to help get them off.  How many socks can you put on?!!!</li>
            <li> This takes some practice getting the sock onto the implement the first few tmes.  Gets the job done easily enough, though.</li>
            <li> WHEN YOU CAN&#x27;T REACH YOUR FEET, THIS IS A BIG HELP. THE PAD DOES NOT LAST LONG AND CAN NOT BE REPLACED</li>
            <li> My uncle raves about how much this helps!!</li>
            <li> A great time and pain saver for me. Before using this tool, which works exactly as advertised, I had to stretch for about 20 minutes before I tried to put my socks on. After finally getting them on, I would have to stretch and rest to recover from the effort. With this tool, socks are on in a jiffy and no pain or strain.</li>
            <li> Works just as advertised. I was a little concerned after I read the review about having problems using it by someone with wide feet.I&#x27;ma big guy and the&#x27;re wasn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li> Apparently these sock aids come in sizes. The one the OT who was working with was smaller then this one. He finds this hard to place the sock on it.&lt;br /&gt;Mickey</li>
            <li> Expected better product.</li>
            <li> My spouse thinks the sock aid I bought for her is the greatest thing since sliced bread.  She has not let a sockless-feet-day by since she received them at the therapy home.  Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was needed for my elderly neighbor. She is required to wear compression stockings and is unabler to put them on. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This item works as described - a lifesaver if you wear socks and have arthritis.</li>
            <li> Works much better than the soft sided ones they.sell at drug stores. Slides out.easterly.</li>
            <li> Very clumsy. Calf wouldn&#x27;t fit. Compression socks collapse the walls and the foot can&#x27;t gain entry into the sock.</li>
            <li> this was an answer to my sock problem</li>
            <li> Bought this when I had a hip replacement. It works really well. I used it for 3 months for one foot.The circular pad on the housing that grips the sock as you pull it on pulled away from the plastic housing. I re-glued it with ES 6000 glue and it has been fine for another month now.Let it set for 24 hours. Love that glue! It is available at Walmart in the arts and crafts section. Also available at Hobby Lobby. I noted another reviewer mentioning the same problem.</li>
            <li> bought this for my mother who recently had hip surgery. she loves that she can put on her own socks and pantyhose! She&#x27;s struggled for years and makes her feel so much more independent. I recommend a reacher to take off socks.</li>
            <li> So far the product works pertty good.  When I received the product I thought it was way too big, but after use I think it could be a little wider.  I have a very wide foot, and find it a little difficult to get my foot into the the device without pushing the sock off.  Small black pad on back does help hold sock up while pulling the your sock on, but it could be a little more effective because the sock does not always stay on the device allowing it to be pulled all the way up.</li>
            <li> It is OK but socks don&#x27;t slide as expected.  The aid comes off before sock is on.  Plastic is too slick.</li>
            <li> the therapeutic socks I use could not stretch enough to go over the device, so it was too hard to get the socks on.</li>
            <li> DAD, HAD GOTTEN ONE OF THESE FROM HIS DOCTOR AFTER HIS HIP REPLACEMENT AND HE SAID IT REALLY WORKED. After A YEAR AND MANY USES IT STARTED TO CRACK DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE PLASTIC, BUT HE WANTED TO FIND ANOTHER ONE JUST LIKE IT. YOURS IS MADE THE SAME AND APPEARS TO BE A LITTLE STRONGER PLASTIC. Thank you for your speedy shipping.</li>
            <li> If you have had orthopedic surgery or otherwise have lower extremity weakness, this simple but ingenious device will step up to the plate for you. Slipping your socks on is a cinch. I might add that if you&#x27;re wearing compression sock/stockings, it is more difficult.</li>
            <li> Works great - wasn&#x27;t supposed to bend over after eye surgery - didn&#x27;t have to with the sock aid.</li>
            <li> My husband has had the kids put his socks on for the last year and half and I kept saying to my husband why don&#x27;t we get a sock aid so you can do this by yourself and he finally agreed. The only thing you have to put together is the sponge on the bottom of the sock aid. If you don&#x27;t then often times the sock slips off before it should. The sponge goes approximately 1 inch above the bottom edge of the sock aid. My husband was able to use it immediately once I showed him how to use it. I often use these devices in my work as an Occupational therapist.</li>
            <li> Need this for my arthritis , can&#x27;t reach my feet anymore , this device let me put on my socks&lt;br /&gt;without a problem .&lt;br /&gt;Good invention and unbreakable .</li>
            <li> Hi does help me put my socks on. HOWEVER, it stretches my socks to the point where, sometimes, the elastic is ruined. It&#x27;s okay. Don&#x27;t recommend anything like this. Need a smaller end to keep the sock&#x27;s form.</li>
            <li> works great.  easy to use.  quick fix.  recommend this for any one who is impaired and has difficulty with socks.  allows independence&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews about several similar products, I chose this one for my Mom.  Like the other reviewers, she found it easy to use and it works!</li>
            <li> Provides just the help I need to put on my socks after hip replacement surgery.</li>
            <li> What a great invention!</li>
            <li> It works well with regular socks and light support stocking.  More difficult to use (but less than pulling with your hands) with high compression socks and stocking.  The plastic is heavy and is smooth around the edges...I didn&#x27;t go anywhere and didn&#x27;t need socks for the first few weeks following knee replacement surgery.  When I wanted to wear socks, I found it very painful and difficult to bend my leg to get on socks.  This produce rescued me.</li>
            <li> Due to recent surgery on both of my shoulders, I have difficulty putting on my socks. This product helps me with that issue. I just wish there was something on the back of the plastic that would hold the sock in place until it was further up my leg. Presently, it will only get the sock just over my heel. It is challenging for me to pull the knee high socks up the rest of the way since I have limited strength in my hands, as well.</li>
            <li> This thing is HUGE…much larger than the photo suggests.  With my muscle condition, which makes putting on my own socks impossible, it is also impossible for me to do Step1, pull the socks over this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have leg issues and your hands are still strong, this might be useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is useless to me, and the return will cost over half of the purchase price.  Definitely not an accommodating return policy.  I&#x27;ll give this to Good Will or other charity.</li>
            <li> Really like this product, easy to train patients to use, easy on the hands and prevent patient from bending over!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Works with socks after I found a way to prevent sock from falling off while manoeuvring over heel. Pulled the sock over the knobs on the side, then pulled over heel and before pulling on slipped off knobs. Harder to put on long elastic pressure stockings and did not work with booties.</li>
            <li> Having had hip replacements  I need this tool to enable me to put on my socks.  Several Medical Supply Outlets did not have this type in stock, so when we discovered the vender had two in stock, we ordered them both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite satisfied with the product and shipping time.</li>
            <li> I had back surgery, and the scarring has kept me from being very flexible, especially first thing in the morning. If I need to put on a pair of socks early, I was unable to do it easily, if at all. This little device is easy to use, very compact, and puts my socks on perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may take using it once or twice to get the hang of pulling the sock over the plastic. The sock has to stretch more than I would have thought, but this allows your foot and ankle to get the sock on without it hanging up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for those who lack the flexibility to be able to put their socks on without a struggle.</li>
            <li> my dad loves this tool</li>
            <li> Very high recommendation. They allow a person to put on socks when it is not possible to bend knees. Works great, best 8 bucks you can spend!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  I can use it for both sheer knee highs and cotton socks.  I have a problem with my back and bending is difficult.  This product makes the daily routine of dressing a pleasure.  I would recommend it to anyone that shares the problem of simply putting on a pair of socks. The price is right, too - much cheaper than a medical supply store.</li>
            <li> Need to wear tight compression socks and have a bad hip.  My wife got herself a similar product with terry knit cloth wrapped around it so your feet slide on.  Too small for me and the cloth is now shredding apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this, my feet wouldn&#x27;t slide in to my socks, they stick to the PVC.  I cut some microfiber cloth to fit the inside and glued it with spray glue and it works much better.  I&#x27;ve seen a review on Amazon where the guy used a strip of felt with hot glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still just gets the sock to my ankles and I have to do the rest but it&#x27;s better.  Also I was squeezing it when it first came in to see if my socks would fit and it cracked.  Low grade PVC, still works but... gee.  Maybe if it cost under $2 it be good but I won&#x27;t be buying this brand again.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Sock pulls on more easily than other models I&#x27;ve used.easily</li>
            <li> VERY LARGE BOTTOM PLASTIC PART.  COULD BE SMALLER.  ALSO HAS 2 SEPERATE HANDLES.  I TIED THEM INTO ONE TO MAKE IT EASIER TO HANDLE.</li>
            <li> Really great when you can&#x27;t quite reach your feet!</li>
            <li> my wife had hip surgery and she could not do any bending for 6 weeks, this product made it so easy to put on her socks and she still uses them today.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 85 year old father who had hip replacement surgery.  He found it easy to use and loves it.</li>
            <li> Of everything I have bought from Amazon this is my favorite.  I am 75 and have difficulty reaching.  The person who thought of this is an angel and a genius all in one.  The price is great and this item has allowed me to once again wear socks with my shoes.  Hats of to whomever made this.</li>
            <li> At first it IS \\&quot;too wide\\&quot; (per bad review), but modifying the end by cutting it down as same shape &amp; sanding the edges with 80-120grit+/- helps keep sock on item to get sock on foot very well. {can \\&quot;contact\\&quot; via} reallayman.webs.com</li>
            <li> Worked great for hip replacements</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other types of sock helpers that were difficult to put on and fell apart in a month. This product is easily the best.</li>
            <li> a simple solution to an everyday problem. This product makes the chore of putting on regular socks and the,hard to put on support hose. Makes a difficult procedure easy. A big help to a job that must be done.</li>
            <li> Not as wide as what I got in pt but I can buy 10 of these for less and keep them handy wherever needed.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband who was injured in an accident, leg &amp; ankle full of plates &amp; screws, ankle is stiff &amp; he cannot straighten it out.  The product works beautifully.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic for getting the socks on.  I would recommend for anyone that needs help with putting on socks.  Exactly what I needed after my hip surgery.</li>
            <li> Just got this item- was skeptical but lo and behold it does work well- makes a big difference getting my right sock or stocking on-</li>
            <li> So necessary to put on compression hose.  After having 7 joint replacements and revisions, I&#x27;m unable to bend, being afraid to either subluxate or dislocate!  This item works very well for me.</li>
            <li> Double tie the knots as mine have pulled out.  It takes a while to get the hang of a smooth glide and even then I push the plastic on the rug to force it off my foot.  Overall though it&#x27;s so great not to have someone help me or go without socks.  Sometimes the sock has a lot left above the toes and I use another tool to pull the sock on completely.</li>
            <li> It works if you have use of both hands.</li>
            <li> I purchased this device to help me don my compression stockings. They tend to twist when I insert my foot. They are painful, not helpful.</li>
            <li> Strong sturdy plastic. Easy pull on and built to last. Much better than ones I&#x27;ve paid 4 times as much for.</li>
            <li> it is exctly what i need  im in need of hip replacement surgery and cant bend enough to put my socks on so this  item permits me do what i cant do.</li>
            <li> Personally, I like this sock aid, but my wife doesn&#x27;t like to use it because it causes discomfort at her heel when she pulls the aid from around her foot, over her heel, and up her calf.  I don&#x27;t think the problem is this particular sock aid, I think pulling anything over her heel would cause her discomfort.  It might be we&#x27;re using it wrong, the instructions that came with it are minimal so we&#x27;ve kind of figured out how to use it on the fly.  It&#x27;s really a simple device, I&#x27;m surprised it costs as much as it does especially with the minimal instructions.</li>
            <li> item works just like in the utube video, after watching the video a few times, i had it down pat.</li>
            <li> The plastic is not flexable enough. Very stiff and difficult to use.  I wish I had bought the cheaper one.</li>
            <li> I gave this to a friend who needed it for one foot. He was amazed to be able to get his sock on all the way in one swoop..</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live with out it!&lt;br /&gt;It is a God send and makes life so much easier--Thank you!!!!!!!Thank you  Than you!!!!!  AMEN!</li>
            <li> Works just fine.  Used to put on elastic hose.  After a couple of days I was able to get hose on without the device.  Would be really helpful following hip replacement.  I had knee surgery and soon after could reach my feet.  If your elastic hose cause a problem, this device will help.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it a lot yet.  Has worked fine when attempted to use it.</li>
            <li> This is a must have and works great for those who have bad backs or hip and leg issues. As for seniors, it&#x27;s a must have!  Easily puts socks on with little effort. Good quality also. I recommend this product strongly over others on the market. Plan to buy more for Christmas gifts this year.</li>
            <li> This device has saved by back so many times!!!  It works perfectly and is very easy to use.  I could not live as easily without it.  AAA+++</li>
            <li> The edges are hard and sharp leading me to believe that some of my support stockings could tear otherwise it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Too small for my husbands calfs.  Made for smaller sized legs, I will have to look for a larger size.</li>
            <li> If you need help putting on your socks, use this.  It is easy to use and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This really helped putting socks on after injury and I was surprised how simple it was to use. I even told a physical therapist about it since they just had three relatives injured who may be interested in.</li>
            <li> After bi-lateral knee replacement it is hard to put on a pair of socks. After using this sock aid it is almost effortless.</li>
            <li> Works well when the black paste on stays put.  After a couple of uses the paste on begins to roll up.  After that it loses it&#x27;s ability to stick.  Without that it doesn&#x27;t work.  After reading the new info.on this item I read that now it won&#x27;t come off,  Guess what, still doesn&#x27;t work for me.I purchased it again and it didn&#x27;t last a week. Won&#x27;t fall for that again.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get along without it.</li>
            <li> After recent back surgery the doctor said &amp;#34;No bending.&amp;#34;  The sock aid is terrific at helping you get dressed. The occupational therapist in the hospital recommended it, too.</li>
            <li> Works great every time and speeds up  an otherwise daunting task. I recommend it for anyone with mobilty issues its great</li>
            <li> This is another cool gadget that worked out well for mom. Regaining her independence by putting on her own socks</li>
            <li> The product would probably work for a person with narrow feet. The rope comes out of the slots easily when pulling the socks up.</li>
            <li> I can finally put my own socks on. I should have purchased this sooner. It even fits my ankle socks. Works well. Took a few tries to get the hang of. You can shorten the handles, but I have been able to adapt without doing that.</li>
            <li> This worked perfectly for my husband following his hip replacement surgery. Now thankfully after physical therapy he no longer requires it but it was a aid that WORKED!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. Got this for my father who has trouble bending. Still need to pull the sock up all the way tight but does do what it is intended to do.</li>
            <li> You can never appreciate a device like this until you&#x27;ve broken a hip or leg with this you don&#x27;t have to struggle to get the sock on again.  The padded handles are a plus</li>
            <li> After five back surgeries , it is difficult to bend over so this sock on aid really helps an old person get his socks on..</li>
            <li> My Mom used one of these in rehab after a heart attack and she loves it.  The price was better here than at the hospital.</li>
            <li> true replacement for the one given me in hospital that I broke... make getting socks on easy.</li>
            <li> have tried so many and this is the best I don!t have to have my wife take off my socks anymore.</li>
            <li> This device works perfectly and has proven to be durable.&lt;br /&gt;I am sure it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Terrific tool for spouse with hip issues.  Makes putting socks on very easy.  I just wish I would have found this sooner.</li>
            <li> Product is made of a ridged plastic that makes it difficult to slide the stocking onto it, when sliding the device onto the foot and over the heal the stocking slides off before it passes over the heal.&lt;br /&gt;The last time that I was in the hospital they had me try one similar to this, it was made of a thinner more flexible plastic and worked quite well.</li>
            <li> Perfect if you have limited mobility. I had fusion surgery and it&#x27;s been very handy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be lost with out this device.  I have two of them.  One is a little more flexible, which works well for socks.  This model is firm plastic and it works well for putting on support hose.</li>
            <li> Cracked in half when put compression sock on it.  Could not believe it.  Have to contact maker to return.  As soon as possible</li>
            <li> Fantastic. My bad back and arthritic fingers made putting on socks a daily ordeal. But the simple and elegant design of this device makes this task effortless and fast. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Needed a replacement quickly.  This did the job.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000HF4PE0 Built Up Handle Sock Aid]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item for my Mom who is unable to bend forward to put on socks. She was sceptical but after a few tries is able to use it and gained a little more independence.</li>
            <li> The sock aid helps me a lot,because I cannot bend down do to hip surgery.It helps me with the crew and tube socks.I use a little bit of powder and the socks slide on real easly.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a friend after his surgery.  He loved them.</li>
            <li> As an old man, I needed help with my socks. This widget does it!</li>
            <li> Recent thumb surgery made slipping on socks difficult for my spouse. This is an excellent product. Slip on sock to appliance, and slip on appliance to foot. No fuss.</li>
            <li> This works very well for my husband.  He has had a stroke and isn&#x27;t quite as flexible as he once was.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to help me put my socks on, as I have a bad hip and it took so long to put on my socks and by the time I was done, I was exhausted.  Such a simple product but how wonderful it is to gain back some of my independence.  I&#x27;ve liked this product so much that I&#x27;ve ordered one for my brother, who is a severe diabetic.</li>
            <li> You had 2 pictures of this device that looked identical. I ordered the one that said &amp;#34;super&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s for people who have really fat feet and very wide socks. I don&#x27;t fall in that category so I have to really stretch my socks to get them onto this device. Other than that, it&#x27;s well built to last a long time.</li>
            <li> this thing really does work. follow the directions and before you know it you&#x27;ve got your socks on. very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> My son has Myotonic dystrophy and this is idea for helping him get his socks on.  The second one was for a friend who wears support hose and she loves it.</li>
            <li> It should come in sizes.  It is too wide for my socks that it barely fits.  Once I get it partially on, it slides easily.  Good for people who cannot bend.  Maybe not good for people with arthritic hands.  But it does make it easier to put on socks.</li>
            <li> I like this sock aid better than the smooth one I used in rehab .  It has a fabric surface that holds the sock in place even if it is a snug fit.</li>
            <li> Only works with huge socks. Normal socks will not stretch enough. A total waste of money</li>
            <li> This will allow me to put on my hand knit socks post knee surgery. You can use for any socks!! Works exactly as described. If you are clever you could make your own with plastic milk carton though this plastic is thicker and more rigid that a milk carton.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Elderly Mother, she had the same one for years, and it was wearing out. Low and behold I found the same one on Amazon. She likes this style the best, works for all her stockings, easy for her to use, and it hangs nicely by her bed ready to help put her socks on.</li>
            <li> It works great, price was right and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> a big help for putting on socks.</li>
            <li> Hurt my ankle a little but it works.</li>
            <li> good product - use it daily</li>
            <li> UPS delivered the product right on time.  Good price, good workmanship, quick service.</li>
            <li> Works great putting on my own socks when you aren&#x27;t  suppose to more than 90 degree.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m preparing for a total hip replacement in a few days, I was told I would need a sock aid for the 8 to 12 weeks of hip precautions, when I can&#x27;t bend over past 90 degrees. This sock aid works very well. The sock slides easily onto the smooth surface, and the foam pad keeps the sock on the aid as you pull it onto your foot. Very simple and very effective. I tried out a couple of other types that cost twice as much and didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I must use compression stockings, and the sock aid  really helps to get them on smoothly.Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> We bought this device for my 92 year old father who has trouble bending and wasn&#x27;t putting on socks. Winter inNew England requires socks!  He was a liitle leary of the device, but once he used it, and found it simple to use, he&#x27;s sold and uses it all the time.  I definitely recommend this for anyone needing assistance with socks.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to use.  It was delivered as promised with no issues.</li>
            <li> This is by far the neatest product EVER!  I fought with my socks for months and months due to a developing hip problem - couldn&#x27;t bend my leg to put on my left sock to save my life. Finally had hip surgery and was lent one of these sock aids - WOW!  Of course I had to order one for my very own. This handy tool even works with those darn tight surgical hose with a little bit of work, but huge success.  I bought one for my cousin in Texas too.  What a great invention!</li>
            <li> 66 years old. two bionic knee.  A protruding belly about 57 inches.  For the last couple of years I have had to spend 5 to 10 minutes trying to lassoo the hole end of my socks around my big toe, as my feet are just out of my reach.  Many of you can relate I am sure...It was frustrating to the point of tears.  I had an ephifany and was going to try to invent something to solve my problem.  i looked on line instead and...Bingo...There were already many choices available.  I tried this guy and all I can say is&gt;&gt;&gt;THANK YOU GOD!  It works perfectly as advertised and my painful morning ritual is over.  Whoever designed this...You are a genius...and THank You Very Much!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Would recommend to anyone that needs lines. It sucks to have to have help putting socks on but it is necessary for my condition and you will need this if you have any difficulty putting on socks</li>
            <li> IF I COULD GIVE MORE THEN 5-STARS I WOULD. THIS IS THE THE GREATEST PRODUCT. I AM HANDICAP &amp; PUTTING ON SOCKS IS VERY HARD FOR ME ( NOT ANY MORE ). USE POWDER TO HELP SLIDE EASY . I WISH I HAD THIS PRODUCT YEARS AGO. VERY SIMPLE &amp; WORKS GREAT. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA+++++++++++++++++++++++++++</li>
            <li> I had hip replacement surgery and for several weeks could not put my sock on.  I did some research on Amazon and found this product and ordered it.  It definatley does the job very well.  I am now able to put my sock on without aid however during the difficult period, this sock aid permitted me to put my sock on without difficulty.  Recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest!  Wish I had invented it.  I had knee replacement surgery and could not bend my knee adequately to put on socks.  This gadget is a true gem.. It even works great for compression stockings.  Only complaint:  the rope attaches via a knot through a whole in the plastic.  The knot kept slipping through the hole.  I had to retie it to keep it from slipping off.</li>
            <li> I needed this after hip replacement. It comes with a foam piece that you need to stick to outside of half cylinder. That foam helps keep the sock on the aid while you are pulling it over your heel. So far it has worked great. Today one of the ropes pulled out of its hole but I just made a bigger knot and I think it will be fine.</li>
            <li> back saver , good quality, helps so much for us old folks !</li>
            <li> Although the foam handles and thick strings are nice features, the sock aide is hard for me to use. The edges are too smooth to hold my sock in place.  I have a larger sock aid with scallops along the two long edges of the tube. The scallops hold the sock in place as I pull the sock up my leg. The directions for this sock aid could have been more specific.</li>
            <li> Works well so far but the plastic size is pretty darn big for women&#x27;s socks.. may stretch them all out after a while.</li>
            <li> Had Knee replacement surgery and cannot fully bend my leg. This productreally helps me get my socks on. Especially helpful getting my compression sock on.</li>
            <li> If I could I would give this item 10 stars. My Mom was not able to bend her knee (before the surgery), and was waiting for her neighbor to come and help her with the sock. But not after I sent her this! It worked like magic, and she self-taught how to use it.  I am so happy that it was invented! Knowing that I cannot help my Mom was killing me.</li>
            <li> Have used this product since my knee replacement 3 weeks ago. Works great and quickly. Don&#x27;t know what I would have done without it. I highly recommend it. I used it primarily for white athletic socks but it also worked great for my dress socks. As an aside, I purchased the product through Amazon from  Surgical Medical Source and received outstanding customer service.</li>
            <li> Due to an accident I am temporarily disabled. I currently have use of only one arm. This item has two handles. I tied the two handles together to make it useable by us one-armed bandits.</li>
            <li> I am unable to bent over due to a back operation. This is the answer for anyone with this problem. I recomment this product. I had one and when my oldest son began to have the problem with his socks I gave mine to him and ordered a new one.</li>
            <li> purchased for 90 year young Mother.  Doesn&#x27;t work well for small footed persons with small socks.  Overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Need to be more flexible.</li>
            <li> I have had to use this when I had both my hips replacements, then when my knees were done. I broke my back in 2011 and when we got home from the Rehap home it was not to be found. So my husband was having to help me with my socks. Way back when I had my hip replacements I used one they had it was not as good as this one. Upon release to go home I was given this Built Up Handle Sock Aid and found it was very user friendlly. I was so glad when I found it on Amazon now I can put my own scoks on. Not to be mean but my husband was not that good at putting on my socks I love him but he is not a person to give you aid in dressing LOL.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t put on one of my socks after knee Surgery.  It gave me the ability to dress myself; thereby giving me a greater sense of freedom.</li>
            <li> Unable to remove paper on the back of the rubber pad to affix it to the sock aide.  I didn&#x27;t realize this until it was too late to send back.  Also a little narrow for my wide foot. Looks like it might work if everything worked.</li>
            <li> Sock aid&lt;br /&gt;The sock aid is a must for everyone after hip surgery and the elderly.  My husband had hip surgery five months ago and still need to use it.  We have also given it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very effective.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at  all.  Kept pulling out from sock.</li>
            <li> the sock aid works great. My handicap son can finally put on his own socks. Wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> Works well to don on socks</li>
            <li> The product is fine. But you sent me three. I sent two back when you sent me three and I only need one. Credit my card ASAP since you charged me for three instead of one</li>
            <li> After having hip replacement surgery, it was very difficult to put the Ted Stockings on. This little gadget does a fairly decent job. It is a bit more difficult for the thigh high stockings, but the knee highs and any socks work well with the aid. It does take a little bit to figure it out , but it does work.</li>
            <li> Due to a medical condition it is very difficult for me to put my sox on but thanks to this little device it is now a snap.  T H A N K S</li>
            <li> Every senior should have one</li>
            <li> This thing works great. I had a back surgery on my lower back, the Dr. said no bending, twisting or lifting for six weeks. All good when the wife was here to help with the socks. She had to go back up north for work. We found this thing and I didn&#x27;t have to wear the same socks all week. Yeah winter in Wisconsin, socks very important. This thing is awesome!!!</li>
            <li> I would have gladly given this a 5 star rating except for the black pad falling off after one week. I simply glued it back on with silicone adhesive and all is good again. It works great and is a great help for someone with lower back problems. Would recommend, but order a tube of silicone glue with it.</li>
            <li> Best money I have ever spent!😊 It&#x27;s a no brainer simple easy to use item. Not sure why people complain that it does not take off your sock because the description never said that it would. Also not sure why people say the rope breaks because there is no need to pull hard. Just gently slide. . So for me no more waiting for someone to put my sock on for me because now I can easily do it all by my self!😀</li>
            <li> My mother broke her hip and received one of these in rehab. She showed it to everyone. One of her friends needed one so we ordered one for them. It really helps you be able to put your socks on when you can&#x27;t reach your feet.</li>
            <li> The end you attach the sock to is too wide.  It is extremely difficult to attach most socks except diabetic socks.  I have another sock aid that is narrorer.  I ordered the new one because it was starting to split.</li>
            <li> Works great even for a little sport sock.  I have wide, duck-like feet so I was a little concerned if the aid would be too narrow.  It was a little snug around my foot, but in no way did it feel overly binding or too tight.  The sock slid onto my foot each time and up around my ankle with minimal effort although I was using a handle in each of my hands.  I don&#x27;t think this would be an issue for using a single hand other than getting both handles together at the same time.  I would have to place both handles under my leg before tossing the sock aid to the floor and then retrieve the handles for pulling from there.  I found no need at this time for using the small foam pad included.&lt;br /&gt;The aid is constructed of heavy, durable plastic and the handles and ropes were of equal strength.  I think this would last for quite some time.</li>
            <li> I liked the product it made putting on my socks on a lot easier. One thing that could be improved for me is that if&lt;br /&gt;i use right after taking a shower it dosen&#x27;t slide smooth over my heel and I have to add lotion to the bottom of aid.</li>
            <li> My mother wore out her old one I and found this identical one on Amazon.  Works great and can&#x27;t beat the price!  She uses it every day.</li>
            <li> As long as you have the strength to load a sock onto the sock aid, it should work fine.  But even putting on a standard sock (not compression style) is more of a strength, agility, and coordination issue for a really elderly person.  Elderly who cannot bend much at the hip also face the problem of placing it on the floor or blindly throwing it down on the floor and lining it up to get foot in it.  Bought two of them, and load them each, so that elderly person can do that portion of dressing by themselves, but don&#x27;t think she&#x27;s sold on the bother.  She should be wearing a tighter compression, but doesn&#x27;t because of the sock wrestling involved.</li>
            <li> My wife is a saint and she probably would have been willing to keep putting my socks on while my leg was in an immobilizing brace, but this gave me a sense of independence, and it was even kind of fun to use it. Took a while to master, but then you learn that feeling that comes when the plastic is clearing the heel and you know your sock is about to be right in place.</li>
            <li> Had back surgery and had to wear a brace so could not reach down to get my socks on.  This allowed me to be independent getting dressed.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Though this is a simple device, it works well and is quite helpful to me since I have trouble bending my knee and hip because of arthritis.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this product to clients as an Occupational Therapist.</li>
            <li> THANK YOU FOR SENDING THIS TO US.  IT HELPS MY HUSBAND SO MUCH TO GET HIS SOCKS ON WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE.  IT IS AS EASY AS DESCRIBED.  QUICK, SPEEDY DELIVERY SERVICE</li>
            <li> Mom shared this device with friends and family members and they were intrigued and found it useful.&lt;br /&gt;Mom finds it so easy to put on her socks with and stresses her back less. Thanks so much for a&lt;br /&gt;Quirky solution!</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  A must have for spine surgery patients.</li>
            <li> If you have trouble putting on your socks or stockings, you certainly should get this sock aid. It is  made of very sturdy hard plastic material with a smooth finish that will not damage your clothes. Who ever thought this up is a genius in my book!</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  Very handy after my hip surgery</li>
            <li> Recovering from surgery, knee flexibility was non-existent.  Needed to still be able to put on socks, and this really does the job well.  Substantially less expensive than what the hospital was trying to sell me, but just as successful.  Really like having the two separate handles (instead of one handle looped), which allows me to miss the incision site.  socks went onto the gadget easily, didn&#x27;t deform the sock, then onto the foot and over the ankle quick as you please.  Very happy with this.</li>
            <li> My wife helps me with my socks at home, but sometimes I travel and needed a solution for those times.  This product does the trick.  Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this about a month and have found out what I can and can&#x27;t do with it.  Better to put on completely dry and not recently washed feet.  If my feet are wet or even dry but have had all the oils washed off them when I go to pull the sock onto my foot the plastic sticks to the bottom of my foot and I am unable to get the sock on correctly.  Haven&#x27;t tried baby powder but might the next time I run into this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also after 3 weeks one of the knots pulled through the hole in the plastic.  I tried tying more and larger knots but it still slipped through.  Had to loop the rope completely around the hole which changed the design slightly.  So now I have to be careful not to snag the part of the rope inside the plastic and I have to use a slight wiggling motion instead of pulling straight to get the sock on.  But still works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 11/24/2015 - The foam pad that helps pull the sock on wore away.  I&#x27;ve added a picture of a homemade solution I came up with.  I cut a piece of an old bathroom rug and super glued it to the pad spot.  Works like a charm.  Didn&#x27;t want to spend 10 bucks with shipping on one pad or buy 12 pads, when I only need one every year or so.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, good value. Worth every penny to assist in putting on stockings when you can&#x27;t bend to do it.</li>
            <li> to pull the sock all the way onto the device and leave just a tiny bit of toe not tight on top.&lt;br /&gt;this works PERFECT this way.  i have back problems and dreaded putting socks on every day.&lt;br /&gt;i would make any excuse not to wear this...but now it is easy!  BUY THIS!!!</li>
            <li> the unit could be a little longer the adhesive that holds the fabric that catches your sock pulls off after 3 uses</li>
            <li> Great help putting on socks after back surgery.</li>
            <li> Learned about this from a nurse, bought it for my husband. He is able to put his socks on by himself now.</li>
            <li> Awesome!!! Makes husbands dressing time easier . Only problem is, my young grandsons think it should be a great jump rope. Well boys will be boys.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT!!!  Strong, hard, and will not bend. VERY HAPPY!!  Arrived quickly!!</li>
            <li> My spouse, after spine surgery, couldn&#x27;t put his socks on.  So for weeks I had been doing it.  I bought one of these because sometimes I&#x27;m not around to do that for him.  He was quite cynical about it working.  It takes practice, but after a few days of using it he thinks it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> For elderly people who have a difficult time bending over to put on socks, this is awesome. I highly recommend this. Got it for my elderly mother, you slip the sock onto the end of the plastic, hold the handles, place the product down near your foot and slip your foot into your sock. Pull the handles and TA-DA! sock is on foot, amazing product, highly recommend</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do without it...only make sure your feet are not damp or it will not slide.  Seems sturdy...a great aide.</li>
            <li> Because I have a replacement hip I am not able to reach down to get my socks on. This is a very good aid &amp; so far it has held together. The ropes have not broken &amp; I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my Dad.  He is elderly and has a hard time with putting on his socks.  He says it works great.</li>
            <li> This simple device really gave me back my independence after my hip replacement surgery.  Easy to use and helps with support stockings as well as socks.</li>
            <li> It was exactly like the one I received from the hospital when I broke my hip.  After using the original one for a year it broke, using compression stockings everyday.  Now once again I can get my socks on!</li>
            <li> husband recently had knee surgery and it worked great to help him get his socks on when no one was around</li>
            <li> This is the second one I purchased.  First for a relative with Parkinson&#x27;s who could no longer put on his own socks - now he can! and the most recent one for a friend who had some of the vertebrae in his back fused.  It used to take him a long time to get his left sock on.  Now it goes right on.  Really nice product, but not perfect yet.</li>
            <li> Way too wide for ladies&#x27; socks and not all that easy for men&#x27;s sox either.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it needs to!</li>
            <li> This is the only way to get my support hose on</li>
            <li> Great item if you have had knee or hip surgery</li>
            <li> Great idea, simple yet effective. Works every time. Pleasure to recommend.</li>
            <li> works great for people with knee problems...great invention</li>
            <li> This sock Puller actually WORKS ! I bought for my husband who has rheumatoid arthritis and spinal stenosis and he actually uses it every day. Very pleased with this purchase and it is affordable.</li>
            <li> It works! I had another type that frustrated me by making me work like crazy to get my socks on. This one is very sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my mother who has a real issue getting her socks on in the morning.  A simple design and very cost effective.  Whoever thought this up should receive an award!  I highly recommend this for anyone who experiences difficulty with their socks.  Simple enough to use, and easy to hide away.  Great product!</li>
            <li> If you have hip or knee issues and can&#x27;t get your socks on, you can&#x27;t live without this gadget. I&#x27;ve had both hips replaced in the last 12 months and no way could I have managed without my sock-put-er-on-er. I broke the one the hospital gave me pretty quickly, but this one has lasted. It&#x27;s simple but functional. A life saver.</li>
            <li> Recently had major back surgery and cannot bend to put socks/shoes on. This device works just great; place sock on device, insert foot, pull cords/handles up slowly and voila...socks are on! We&#x27;ll see how it holds up over the months, but so far this is a wonderful aid for those that cannot bend down to feet.</li>
            <li> Extremely useful for putting socks on for anyone who has had recent surgery or just needs help to put their socks on.  Simple to use and very well designed.</li>
            <li> I got this contraption for a friend of mine who is a paraplegic and is having to wear support socks, VERY difficult and time consuming to get on under the circumstances.  She said it&#x27;s SO much easier to get those socks on with this thing, so I thought I&#x27;d just mention that in a review, in case it&#x27;s helpful for others in the same situation.  I know there are various aids available on the market, and it&#x27;s hard to know what might be the right thing.  She&#x27;s able to use this while stretched out on the bed before she transfers to her chair.</li>
            <li> this sock puller is so handy my mom broke her hip 2 years ago and she has trouble getting her socks on.the hospital gave her one when she went home but it finally wore out so i bought her this one.i gave it to her today she tried it and loved it</li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s the best thing since sliced bread. It really is a big help when I am trying to put on my socks. I had surgery on one of my knees and fell and sprain the knee on the other leg, and I have lupus, so my knees are stiff all the time because of the lupus and arthritis, so I have a hard time putting on my shoes because I have gained a lot of weight due to being on the steroids for the Lupus. This is really great, I have told everyone about this product. It&#x27;s great. I love.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Too much going on with surgeries to take the time to return it. disappointing.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad to replace the one he&#x27;s had for the last 4 years.  Happy to say it is made of the same sturdy quality plastic and foam as that one,</li>
            <li> MY EIGHTY YEAR OLD DAD CAN FINISH DRESSING</li>
            <li> Works great till the black pad comes off than its not great but still works.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to put sock on &amp;#34;aid&amp;#34;.  Rope came of &amp;#34;aid&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It works as well as expected. Had opportunity to use same product during visit to a Friend. Decided I must have one of my own.&lt;br /&gt;gene</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. Now able to put own socks on without assistance</li>
            <li> I bought this to use following back surgery, and it has been a big help. The width of the &amp;#34;half-tube&amp;#34; is a little wider than necessary for me (but I realize it has to be &amp;#34;one-size fits all.&amp;#34;) Be aware that due to the width of the tube, this device might stretch the top of some socks, especially if you use the same pair with the sock aid over and over. Be sure to get all the sock pulled up on the tube before you start; otherwise, the sock may not be fully pulled into position.</li>
            <li> Great help for getting socks on</li>
            <li> different than i expected.  I returned it</li>
            <li> I tried for fifteen minutes without making it work.  I just tried it again and no way was I able to put a sock on using this device in spite of the foam handles.</li>
            <li> Just starting using it.  Seems to work good.  I wish I invented it</li>
            <li> It definitely helps to put socks on.  I have CMT and my feet can be very painful to the touch.</li>
            <li> This item is wide - it needs to be to place your foot inside. However, I haven&#x27;t tried it with cotton or wool socks. They tend to stretch but remain stretched so using this might make for some very loose socks.</li>
