            <li>My hair has never looked so good.</li>
            <li>The shampoo itself is good.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>All of the Alterna products that I&#x27;ve tried have been great, but the caviar line is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Hair feels nice too.</li>
            <li>great shampoo that leaves hair full and silky.  </li>
            <li>Heard my hairstylist (*Billy Fong*) ordering this from a rep that was visiting his salon, so I tried it and it smells really good!</li>
            <li>Pretty good stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I love Alterna.  </li>
            <li>I found myself doubling up the amount of conditioner to try to be able to  put a comb through it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping great item</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 months now and my hair feels better and stopped falling out.</li>
            <li>I love alterna.</li>
            <li>Love the volume though</li>
            <li>Love the way this product smells.</li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo &amp; conditioner duo ever.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner not only smell good but seem good for your hair.</li>
            <li>I have a fine hair on an oily side with highlights.</li>
            <li>This product gives your hair Super volume and bounce!</li>
            <li>My hair feels luxurious and full after just one wash.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair more manageable and product ships in a reasonable time.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;m a real product junkie).</li>
            <li>Shampoo and conditioner is okay leaves hair soft but didn&#x27;t really create that much volume, I tried the Alterna recover shampoo which was really good.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair super shiny and manageable.  </li>
            <li>After looking for good products for a long time I settled on these.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly!!!</li>
            <li>The volume is just right and the hair is so shiny.</li>
            <li>She has very fine, blonde hair.</li>
            <li>I was concerned that maybe the products are not through the maker, as sometimes you see reviews saying it isn&#x27;t the real deal, but the packaging is the same, the product itself looks, smells, feels just like the real deal, and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and it is so soft now</li>
            <li>As far as the condition of her hair afterwards, HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>Thanks Billy!</li>
            <li>Bought my first Alterna Caviar products from my stylist.  </li>
            <li>but it definitely makes her hair appear more full than it does normally.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair super silky soft.  </li>
            <li>This pair gave me volume but my hair is dry and needed more hydration.</li>
            <li>I‘ve used Pureology for the last several years but this is by far my new favorite!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is well worth the price and considerably lower than retail stores.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The shampoo seems to really clean your hair and lifts the roots, while the conditioner nourishes and provides deep moisture.</li>
            <li>Just because this product is more expensive, does not mean its better.</li>
            <li>I have found it much cheaper to buy through Amazon, and it is delivered directly to my house!  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this..</li>
            <li>These products do not dry out my hair and protect highlights very well.</li>
            <li>Made my hair feel soft and silky like young hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are on a pricy side, but on Amazon the cost is much lower then the regular price in the store.</li>
            <li>I ordered this item that I regularly purchase in the salon and when I went to use it for the first time, I discovered that the contents in the bottle were VERY different from the contents of the bottles that I had purchased at the salon.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product if you want your thin hair to get on the thick side.</li>

            <li> After using this product, my hair has become extremely dry and frizzy.</li>

            <li> You can get the same results from a less expensive shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I may return them because $40 is very expensive for that much shampoo and coniditoner.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this doesn&#x27;t feel like the same product.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t realized that 8.5 ounces quite small.</li>
            <li> With my fine, shoulder length hair, the conditioner was absolutely awful!!</li>
            <li> I found out the hard way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted</li>
            <li> expensive though.</li>
            <li> I buy this product at my hair salon for at least $25-$30 - $16 a piece on Amazon, what a deal!!!</li>

            <li> My hairdresser uses this product when I visit to salon...I wanted the same results.&lt;br /&gt;It is well worth the price and considerably lower than retail stores.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this..</li>
            <li> I buy this product at my hair salon for at least $25-$30 - $16 a piece on Amazon, what a deal!!! I was concerned that maybe the products are not through the maker, as sometimes you see reviews saying it isn&#x27;t the real deal, but the packaging is the same, the product itself looks, smells, feels just like the real deal, and I am very pleased. I hope they keep offering it.</li>
            <li> great shampoo that leaves hair full and silky.  expensive though.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.  I‘ve used Pureology for the last several years but this is by far my new favorite!!</li>
            <li> You can get the same results from a less expensive shampoo and conditioner. Have used Alterna products for some time and was not pleased with this particular product. Makes you hair stringy. Didn&#x27;t know it was for colored hair when purchased as it was not described as such in the product description, and was told it didn&#x27;t matter by &#x27;One Stop Beauty Source&#x27;. It does matter. Stick with other Alterna products - this one is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> The wife was told to try this by the hair dresser and she has been stuck on it ever since.  I hope it never gets discontinued.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  I love Alterna.  I get Brazilian Blowouts and this is one of the few brands I can use.  I recommend it highly!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this shampoo and turned to Amazon after my hair salon stopped carrying it.  Unfortunately, this doesn&#x27;t feel like the same product.  After using this product, my hair has become extremely dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> The product smells great, that is the only reason why I gave it any stars. With my fine, shoulder length hair, the conditioner was absolutely awful!! The conditioner completely dried my hair out and it does not untangle your hair. I found myself doubling up the amount of conditioner to try to be able to  put a comb through it. Thank goodness for It&#x27;s a Ten leave in conditioner! Without it my hair would have been in dire straights!!! I stopped utilizing this product and instead purchased my reliable hair cleaner and conditioner, Alterna Bamboo. Just because this product is more expensive, does not mean its better. I found out the hard way.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great item</li>
            <li> This product gives your hair Super volume and bounce! My hair feels luxurious and full after just one wash. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Love the product.  My hair has never looked so good.</li>
            <li> Best volume shampoo and conditioner out on the market. I&#x27;m addicted</li>
            <li> My hair stylist used this one me. Saved quite a bit at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 months now and my hair feels better and stopped falling out. I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t realized that 8.5 ounces quite small. I may return them because $40 is very expensive for that much shampoo and coniditoner. The shampoo itself is good.</li>
            <li> All of the Alterna products that I&#x27;ve tried have been great, but the caviar line is my favorite.  It makes your hair super silky soft.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Shampoo and conditioner is okay leaves hair soft but didn&#x27;t really create that much volume, I tried the Alterna recover shampoo which was really good.  Made my hair feel soft and silky like young hair.</li>
            <li> I love alterna. This pair gave me volume but my hair is dry and needed more hydration.Love the volume though</li>
            <li> I ordered this item that I regularly purchase in the salon and when I went to use it for the first time, I discovered that the contents in the bottle were VERY different from the contents of the bottles that I had purchased at the salon.  They had an off chemical smell and were clearly not the same.</li>
            <li> Heard my hairstylist (*Billy Fong*) ordering this from a rep that was visiting his salon, so I tried it and it smells really good! Actually feels like it plumps my hair up with moisture. Would prob use it on the daily except I get flakey in the winter months and use Ahava for that. Pretty good stuff! Thanks Billy!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner not only smell good but seem good for your hair. I alternate shampoos but I use this one and the Alterna Moisturizing shampoo and conditioner on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Bought my first Alterna Caviar products from my stylist.  I use the shampoo, conditioner and the hair spray.  I have found it much cheaper to buy through Amazon, and it is delivered directly to my house!  Don&#x27;t have to worry if my stylist has any in stock!  Great product.</li>
            <li> this is the best ever! suggest by my hair stylist. My hair is fine and it is so soft now</li>
            <li> Love the way this product smells. Hair feels nice too. I alternate between using this and Bosley products from day to day because of my thinning hair.</li>
            <li> girlfriend loves this stuff. She has very fine, blonde hair. This stuff does not add a ton of volume like other brands can but it definitely makes her hair appear more full than it does normally. As far as the condition of her hair afterwards, HUGE difference. She gives constant compliments over and over about this brand, will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> The volume and texture of your hair after the wash is unbeatable. Hands down the best I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;m a real product junkie). The shampoo seems to really clean your hair and lifts the roots, while the conditioner nourishes and provides deep moisture. With such a steep price, I keep looking for alternatives- but nothing has come close- so I&#x27;m sticking to this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you want your thin hair to get on the thick side. It makes your hair more manageable and product ships in a reasonable time.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo &amp; conditioner duo ever. I have a fine hair on an oily side with highlights. After looking for good products for a long time I settled on these. I have been using them for over a year and cannot be happier. The volume is just right and the hair is so shiny. These products do not dry out my hair and protect highlights very well. Smell is great too.&lt;br /&gt;They are on a pricy side, but on Amazon the cost is much lower then the regular price in the store.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair super shiny and manageable.  Super expensive for the amount you get in my opinion.  I like it but will stick with my Pureology.</li>
