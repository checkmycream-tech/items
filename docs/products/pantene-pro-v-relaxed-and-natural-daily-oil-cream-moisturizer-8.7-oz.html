            <li> My hair is really kinky but super thin</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair, but this product keeps my hair well nourished and moisturized</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful about over working.  </li>
            <li> If you like pink oil, you should like this oily cream.</li>
            <li> my hair is extremely dry,especially in the winter, and this product softens my hair and conditions my scalp.</li>
            <li> Feels slightly oily on application but did not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> Very hard to find on page under &amp;#34;Women of Color&amp;#34; especially when front page indicated 8 numbered products by Pantene.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they changed the formula and have provided a smaller amount of the oils.  </li>
            <li> I started with a very small amount</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even at least soften my hair, and I had to pull it up in a pony tail because I was afraid I would get grease stains on my blouse.  </li>
            <li> To bad I can&#x27;t find it anymore as they stopped making it.</li>
            <li> Awful smell and greasy!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Softens and moisturizers very well</li>
            <li> This product works great for my hair. I&#x27;m multiracial, &amp; my hair is curly. I don&#x27;t just recommend this for women or colour, I recommend it to anyone with curly hair. Not only does it keep my hair moisturized all day, it keeps the frizz away, and it smells great! This product will definitely stay in my \\&quot;Favorite Products\\&quot; list. ;)</li>
            <li> My husband did not order this product. I did and yes I was happy to have found it because I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Like many of the other reviewers I also have curly dry hair.  I used this product and it did absolutely nothing for my hair.  It became greasy and oily. It didn&#x27;t even at least soften my hair, and I had to pull it up in a pony tail because I was afraid I would get grease stains on my blouse.  I started with a very small amount and it still felt as if I had dunked my hair into mineral oil. I get better results putting cream rinse on my hair and not rinsing it out.  It comes out smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> This product works great, but had leaked all over the interior of the box upon delivery.</li>
            <li> The intial scent is strong but dissipates quickly. It moisturies and shines my 3c hair well, lasting for two days. Feels slightly oily on application but did not weigh my hair down. Does not define but, then, it doesn&#x27;t claim to.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and I use this all the time.  My hair is really kinky but super thin so I have to be careful about over working.  This product makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have used this for many years but started to have trouble finding it in the stores.  It works wonders on my hair.</li>
            <li> Not bad but I  do not think I will buy this product again was not impress maybe someone one else had a different experience.</li>
            <li> I am an African American and I have been using this product for years.  I apply it after I shampoo before blow-drying (weekly care instructions according to the older bottles).  It leaves my hair soft and silky, especially after I flat-iron.  Looks like I could be in a commercial lol. Unfortunately they changed the formula and have provided a smaller amount of the oils.  They&#x27;ve also changed the size even though the price continues to rise (now 8.7 compared to 10.2).  I will continue using it, but its not as great as the previous formula.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it&#x27;s not heavy but gives a great boost to hair moisture.  I bought ten of them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since it first came on the market about 10 to 12 years ago.  I love the way it leaves my hair soft, shiney and looking healthy.</li>
            <li> Great to use everyday, I can&#x27;t find this in my local stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Great for my daughter&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product.  I would order it again.</li>
            <li> I like the product and would purchase again.  Delivery could have been shorter. Very hard to find on page under &amp;#34;Women of Color&amp;#34; especially when front page indicated 8 numbered products by Pantene. Found a thumbnail when leaving the pages in frustration via Amazon. My friend was happy with her gift!</li>
            <li> Enjoyed the product.  However, the tube started peeling and flaking off on my hands and hair.  Wasn&#x27;t expecting a product design flaw.</li>
            <li> The product I received was Pantene Pro-V for Relaxed Hair only. Not what I needed.</li>
            <li> This works so well for my daughters hair.  To bad I can&#x27;t find it anymore as they stopped making it.</li>
            <li> Love it, can&#x27;t understand why its not available in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Needed in a hurry and Amazon came through. Great product!</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair, but this product keeps my hair well nourished and moisturized&lt;br /&gt; its an excellent product that I would recommend to ppl with dry hair.</li>
            <li> This&#x27;s conditioner is very light and allows my hair to move freely.  Love that it has reduced breakage.</li>

            <li> I did not think I would love this product :):):)</li>
            <li> Did not like at all. Awful smell and greasy! Contains mineral oil. If you like pink oil, you should like this oily cream.</li>
