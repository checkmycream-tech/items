            <li>Love this product, wish I found it years ago &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>mmmmm topic still better</li>
            <li>Good product, but don&#x27;t like the large particles</li>
            <li>I guess it does sort of &amp;#34;fill in the light areas where my hair has thinned.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it does cover up the light areas.</li>
            <li>I ordered the light brown</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many similar products and this is by far the best one.</li>
            <li>I really love this product,  it really helps when I need a touch-up on my roots.</li>
            <li>I use this product everyday and it is great.</li>
            <li>Works great on the vertical streak of bare scalp on the back of my head...will continue to order this...lasts until each shampoo...</li>
            <li>Easy to use and blends in with hair and looks natural.  </li>
            <li>Test it first before applying it all over the area needed is my advise.</li>
            <li>Somewhat expensive; but Amazon had the best price.</li>
            <li>I was looking for product that would feel comfortable, look natural and not expensive.</li>
            <li>I have used several other types of hair thickening fibers and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>You will find a large smattering go these fibers all over your sink, so beware of that.</li>
            <li>This worked very well and was offered at a reasonable price compared to hair dressers&#x27; prices.  </li>
            <li>, it blends in very well and covers well.  </li>
            <li>The only mess is in the sink which is very easily wiped clean.</li>
            <li>Twas a great color match and just a little went a long ways.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product for us thin hair people!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to the aging boomers.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I use a little hairspray to make the fibers stick better.</li>
            <li>Eyeshadow for a buck from cvs works wayyyyyy better than this, don&#x27;t waste money, doesn&#x27;t cling, does not make your hair fuller, does not cover grays or bald spots,</li>
            <li>I cannot live without this product.</li>
            <li>It has a very natural look and blends in well with my daughters color hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use; a tad bit messy since it&#x27;s powder.  </li>
            <li>Blends into hair naturally without clumping.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to all, I even bought this for my 66 year old mother for her to try.</li>
            <li>The price is almost unbelievable as I paid more in a beauty supply store open only to professionals.</li>

            <li> I used the dark brown and it fills in my part very naturally.</li>
            <li> and it also covers the grey at the same time</li>
            <li> I needed dark brown but it literally looked like a deep burgundy when applied on my head.</li>
            <li> I dye my blonde hair dark brown</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look fuller and makes me less embarrassed to go out in public.</li>

            <li> You have to be careful with dark brown because others I have tried have a grayish cast.</li>
            <li> either it was mislabeled or just their interpretation of dark brown looks burgundy.</li>
            <li> Color was too dark.  </li>
            <li> but I need to get a color somewhere in between Dark Brown and Medium Brown and trying to mix them</li>
            <li> This color was way too dark</li>
            <li> even little one I have  thought I could get away with this in between hair dyes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of the product, so be careful/</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t damage my hair, was way excited&lt;br /&gt;Big waste</li>
            <li> I wanted to comment on the customers who claim it is  messy.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone that needs coverage in areas of missing hair.</li>
            <li> is not easy.</li>
            <li> But you have to shake it on, and impossible to tell how much you need or have used.</li>
            <li> Either way I was not satisfied with it .</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but I ordered it and to my surprise it works.  </li>

            <li> I guess it does sort of &amp;#34;fill in the light areas where my hair has thinned. But you have to shake it on, and impossible to tell how much you need or have used. You will find a large smattering go these fibers all over your sink, so beware of that. It&#x27;s a waste of the product, so be careful/</li>
            <li> This product was ordered because I thought Id try something different . I needed dark brown but it literally looked like a deep burgundy when applied on my head. either it was mislabeled or just their interpretation of dark brown looks burgundy. Either way I was not satisfied with it . Test it first before applying it all over the area needed is my advise.</li>
            <li> Blends into hair naturally without clumping.  A little goes a long way.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> Color was too dark.  I do like the product but I need to get a color somewhere in between Dark Brown and Medium Brown and trying to mix them is not easy.</li>
            <li> Its ok...I don&#x27;t like how it makes my scalp appear when i sweat.  My nephews actually thought I had a scalp disease when I came back from playing a long game of tag.  I didn&#x27;t realize the product &amp;#34;melted&amp;#34; on my scalp and made it look &amp;#34;patchy&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;distorted&amp;#34;.  I would recommend this product if you do not plan to do anything that involves swimming or sweating. Otherwise it does cover up the light areas.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this product. It hides the bald spots.</li>
            <li> It does what is says. I have ordered more.</li>
            <li> I have tried many things for my thinning hair and when I saw this on tv I was skeptical, but I ordered it and to my surprise it works.  I ordered the light brown and I love this.

            <li> I like the product.  It&#x27;s easy to use; a tad bit messy since it&#x27;s powder.  Somewhat expensive; but Amazon had the best price.</li>
            <li> Not even 1 star!! Does not work!!  Eyeshadow for a buck from cvs works wayyyyyy better than this, don&#x27;t waste money, doesn&#x27;t cling, does not make your hair fuller, does not cover grays or bald spots, even little one I have  thought I could get away with this in between hair dyes so don&#x27;t damage my hair, was way excited&lt;br /&gt;Big waste</li>
            <li> This worked very well and was offered at a reasonable price compared to hair dressers&#x27; prices.  Would highly recommend to the aging boomers.</li>
            <li> Builds up with the fibers....priced correctly...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many similar products and this is by far the best one. The color matches my hair perfectly. I used the dark brown and it fills in my part very naturally. You have to be careful with dark brown because others I have tried have a grayish cast. Also, it is not sticky as others have been. The price is almost unbelievable as I paid more in a beauty supply store open only to professionals. I highly recommend.  I wanted to comment on the customers who claim it is  messy. I shake it on standing at my bathroom sink before I get dressed. The only mess is in the sink which is very easily wiped clean. Nothing ever on my clothing or bedding.</li>
            <li> I dye my blonde hair dark brown so the root regrowth makes everything look baaad and bald!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this and it hides the regrowth well. Sometimes I use a little hairspray to make the fibers stick better.</li>
            <li> Everything was great!</li>
            <li> My child has hair loss. A medical condition. I was looking for product that would feel comfortable, look natural and not expensive. I feel this product is the best for everything I needed. I would recommend this product to anyone that needs coverage in areas of missing hair. It has a very natural look and blends in well with my daughters color hair.</li>
            <li> Cover the spot and work good</li>
            <li> this is a great product for both men and women it hides any spots where hair is thinning and it also covers the grey at the same time great product</li>
            <li> Great product and service was excellent.</li>
            <li> Simple...it met my expectations! It blended well. &#x27;Twas a great color match and just a little went a long ways.</li>
            <li> THE FIBERS DOESN&#x27;T STAY OR COVER UP ANYTHING. YOU WILL FIND IT MORE ON YOUR CLOTHES THAN HAIR.</li>
            <li> Love this product, wish I found it years ago &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Easy to use and blends in with hair and looks natural.  I just apply to balding spots on my head and spray.</li>
            <li> It works well. The problem I have is that it lands over the bathroom as well as in my hair and on my pillow.  A better way to apply would be nice.</li>
            <li> Works great on the vertical streak of bare scalp on the back of my head...will continue to order this...lasts until each shampoo...</li>
            <li> I have used several other types of hair thickening fibers and this one is by far the best.  I like the color, it blends in very well and covers well.  I also like the fact that on a windy day, the fibers don&#x27;t fly off or out of my hair.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.  Thanks for a great product for us thin hair people!</li>
            <li> I really love this product,  it really helps when I need a touch-up on my roots. It does add some thickness also.</li>
            <li> Good product, but don&#x27;t like the large particles</li>
            <li> This color was way too dark</li>
